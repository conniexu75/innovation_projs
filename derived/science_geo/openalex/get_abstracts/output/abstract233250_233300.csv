https://openalex.org/W2008845432,"BCL-2 family proteins constitute a critical control point for the regulation of apoptosis. Protein interaction between BCL-2 members is a prominent mechanism of control and is mediated through the amphipathic alpha-helical BH3 segment, an essential death domain. We used a chemical strategy, termed hydrocarbon stapling, to generate BH3 peptides with improved pharmacologic properties. The stapled peptides, called ""stabilized alpha-helix of BCL-2 domains"" (SAHBs), proved to be helical, protease-resistant, and cell-permeable molecules that bound with increased affinity to multidomain BCL-2 member pockets. A SAHB of the BH3 domain from the BID protein specifically activated the apoptotic pathway to kill leukemia cells. In addition, SAHB effectively inhibited the growth of human leukemia xenografts in vivo. Hydrocarbon stapling of native peptides may provide a useful strategy for experimental and therapeutic modulation of protein-protein interactions in many signaling pathways."

Fuming sulfuric acid charges SWNTs and promotes their ordering into an aligned phase of individual mobile SWNTs surrounded by acid anions. This ordered dispersion was extruded via solution spinning into continuous lengths of macroscopic neat SWNT fibers. Such fibers possess interesting structural composition and physical properties.

The electrical current pulse is injected through a sub-micrometer-sized semiconductor wire at the center of the mode with minimal degradation of the quality factor. The actual mode of interest operates in a nondegenerate monopole mode, as evidenced through the comparison of the measurement with the computation based on the actual fabricated structural parameters. As a small step toward a thresholdless laser or a single photon source, this wavelength-size photonic crystal laser may be of interest to photonic crystals, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and quantum information communities."

Their impressive variation in beak morphology is associated with the exploitation of a variety of ecological niches, but its developmental basis is unknown. We performed a comparative analysis of expression patterns of various growth factors in species comprising the genus Geospiza. We found that expression of Bmp4 in the mesenchyme of the upper beaks strongly correlated with deep and broad beak morphology. When misexpressed in chicken embryos, Bmp4 caused morphological transformations paralleling the beak morphology of the large ground finch G. magnirostris ."
https://openalex.org/W2084251919,"Microbial methane consumption in anoxic sediments significantly impacts the global environment by reducing the flux of greenhouse gases from ocean to atmosphere. Despite its significance, the biological mechanisms controlling anaerobic methane oxidation are not well characterized. One current model suggests that relatives of methane-producing Archaea developed the capacity to reverse methanogenesis and thereby to consume methane to produce cellular carbon and energy. We report here a test of the ""reverse-methanogenesis"" hypothesis by genomic analyses of methane-oxidizing Archaea from deep-sea sediments. Our results show that nearly all genes typically associated with methane production are present in one specific group of archaeal methanotrophs. These genome-based observations support previous hypotheses and provide an informed foundation for metabolic modeling of anaerobic methane oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1992680479,"The deposition of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in neuritic plaques plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is generated through the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential actions of β- and γ-secretases. Although recent evidence has unveiled much about the biochemical identity and characteristics of γ-secretase, the mechanism regulating endogenous γ-secretase activity remains elusive. To identify possible extracellular signals and associated signaling cascades that could regulate APP proteolysis by γ-secretase activity, we have developed a cell-based reporter gene assay by stably cotransfecting HEK293 cells with the Gal4-driven luciferase reporter gene and the Gal4/VP16-tagged C-terminal fragment of APP (C99-GV), the immediate substrate of γ-secretase. The cleavage of C99-GV by γ-secretase releases the transcription factor that activates luciferase expression, providing a quantitative measurement of γ-secretase activity. Using this reporter assay, we have demonstrated that interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α can specifically stimulate γ-secretase activity, concomitant with increased production of Aβ and the intracellular domain of APP (AICD). The γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of Notch is also enhanced upon the stimulation of these cytokines. The cytokine-enhanced γ-secretase activity can be suppressed by a potent inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Furthermore, cells transfected with dominant-positive MEKK1, one of the most potent activators of the JNK cascade, exhibit increased γ-secretase activity, suggesting that the JNK-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway could mediate the cytokine-elicited regulation of γ-secretase. Our studies provide direct evidence that cytokine-elicited signaling cascades control Aβ production by modulating γ-secretase activity.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated through the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential actions of β- and γ-secretases (2Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). APP can be first cleaved by β-secretase that cuts at the 28-residue N-terminal to the transmembrane domain of APP (3Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), releasing a large soluble fragment (β-APPs) into the lumen/extracellular space and retaining a 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99-CTF) in the membrane. This membrane-tethered C99 can then be further processed by γ-secretase through an unusual cleavage that apparently occurs within the transmembrane domain of C99, thus generating the Aβ peptides and a cytoplasmic tail dubbed APP-intracellular domain (AICD). Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that causative mutations linked to APP and the presenilins (PS1 and PS2) found in familial early-onset AD patients all result in increased production of the more amyloidogenic 42-residue Aβ isoform (Aβ42) versus the soluble 40-residue isoform (Aβ40). Both β- and γ-secretases have thus become important therapeutic targets. Tremendous progress has been made toward the identification of these secretases. Whereas β-secretase appears to be a novel membrane-associated aspartyl protease (4Tang J. Ghosh A.K. Hong L. Koelsch G. Turner 3rd, R.T. Chang W. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), accumulated evidence has supported the notion that PSs are obligatory components of γ-secretase (5Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The discovery that presenilins are probably the proteases catalyzing the last step in Aβ generation is consistent with the idea that all FAD-causing mutations are localized either to positions in APP near the cleavage sites for Aβ production or to genes encoding the protease that generates Aβ (presenilin/γ-secretase). Its pivotal role in Aβ generation and AD pathogenesis is further demonstrated by the analysis of FAD-associated PS missense mutations that have been shown to intimately correlate with the selective elevation of Aβ42 versus Aβ40 in human, cultured cells, and transgenic mice (6Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic analyses further reveal that PSs are part of a multimeric γ-secretase complex. PS heterodimers co-migrate with a high molecular mass of ∼250 kDa through density gradients (7Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M.

Blue-native PAGE analysis of the γ-secretase complex has given molecular masses ranging from 250 to 500 kDa (9Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

By using an inhibitor-immobilized matrix, γ-secretase activity can be isolated and co-purified with PS heterodimers in addition to another PS-associated membrane protein called nicastrin (13Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 14Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S.

Most recently, two independent studies using genetic screening in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified two other membrane proteins, Aph-1 and Pen-2, as novel obligate members of γ-secretase (15Goutte C.

Cell. 2002; 3: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Furthermore, compelling evidence has shown that the full spectrum of γ-secretase activity can be reconstituted by the co-expression of human presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (9Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), providing definitive proof for the minimal required constituents of the physiologically active γ-secretase. These presenilin cofactors have been shown to play distinct functions in the formation of the high molecular weight enzyme complex, as Aph-1 stabilizes the presenilin holoprotein in the complex and Pen-2 sustains γ-secretase activity by enforcing the endoproteolysis of presenilin (18Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The identification of these presenilin cofactors presents additional objects for the intervention of γ-secretase activity and Aβ production. The endogenous mechanism regulating γ-secretase activity remains elusive, despite the enormous progress in biochemical characterization of this protease in recent years. Previous studies have gathered substantial evidence demonstrating the close correlation between inflammation and Aβ-centered pathogenesis of AD. A variety of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor-β, are up-regulated in AD patients versus nondemented individuals and have been suggested to promote the synthesis and processing of APP. In addition, marked increase of Aβ40 and Aβ42 is observed in primary astrocytes or astrocytoma cells following stimulation with a combination of interferon-γ (Ifn-γ) and TNF-α or Ifn-γ and IL-1β (19Blasko I. Marx F. Steiner E. Hartmann T. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 20Blasko I. Veerhuis R. Stampfer-Kountchev M. Saurwein-Teissl M. Eikelenboom P. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), suggesting that inflammatory cytokines could regulate the processing of APP through cytokine-elicited signaling pathways. Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor can enhance the β-γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP through a Src-Rac-dependent pathway (21Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that endogenous brain Aβ levels could be under stringent regulation mediated by a variety of inflammatory molecules. Here, we developed an efficient and quantitative assay and use it to obtain evidence for the first time that proinflammatory cytokines, including Ifn-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α, are potent stimulators of γ-secretase, resulting in the increased production of Aβ through a pathway involving the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent MAPK pathway. Reagents—BCA protein assay reagent kit and SuperSignal West Femto reagents were purchased from Pierce. Rabbit anti-Notch(Val1744) antibody, anti-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK MAP kinase antibody, and mouse anti-phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, Expand long template PCR system, and the PCR nucleotide mixture were from Roche Applied Science. Dual luciferase assay reagents, Steady-Glo luciferase assay reagents, and pRL-TK vector were from Promega. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. The human Aβ40 colorimetric ELISA kit was from BioSource International Inc. Interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α were from PeproTech Asia (Rehovot, Israel). All other reagents were at least reagent grade and obtained from standard suppliers. Generation of DNA Constructs—APP695-Gal4VP16 (APP-GV), pFR-Luc, C57-Gal4VP16 (C57-GV), and CMV-Gal4VP16 (CMV-GV) were gifts from Dr. Mark Bothwell (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The cDNA sequence encoding the last 99 residues to the C terminus of APP695 was amplified along with the Gal4VP16 tag by PCR using the APP-GV construct as template and subcloned into the pcDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen) to generate the tetracycline-inducible C99-Gal4VP16/TO chimeric construct (C99-GV). An initiation codon (ATG) was included to ensure proper expression of C99-GV. The sequences of forward (APP-S1-BamHI) and reverse primers (GV-A1-XbaI) were 5′-CCGGATCCATGGATGCAGAATTCCGACATGACTCA-3′ and 5′-CCTCTAGACTACCCACCGTACTCGTCAATTCCAAGGGC-3′, respectively. Restriction sites are underlined. PCR amplimers were purified, cleaved by BamHI and XbaI, and ligated with BamHI/XbaI-cleaved pcDNA5/TO vector. To generate a Gal4-driven luciferase reporter gene construct that is suitable for stable transfection, pFR-Luc vector was first cleaved with StyI, and the protrusive ends were converted to blunt ends by Taq DNA polymerase. An additional cleavage of the linearized vector by NdeI released the complete open reading frame of firefly luciferase along with the upstream promoter plus five tandem repeats of Gal4 binding motif that was then purified and ligated with pBudCE4.1 vector (Invitrogen) previously cleaved by NdeI and ScaI. The residual cytomegalovirus promoter sequence carried over from the original pBudCE4.1 vector was removed by the cleavage of NdeI and SpeI, followed by the conversion of protrusive ends to blunt ends by Taq DNA polymerase and subsequent self-ligation to generate a novel Gal4 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct (Gal4-Luc) containing a zeocin-resistant selection marker. In transient transfection, a vector constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase, pRL-TK, was included as an internal control to normalize the transfection variation. A Notch expression construct encoding the mouse Notch1 (residues 1704-2184) was derived from a vector expressing constitutively activated membrane-bound Notch (NΔE) in which a methionine (Met1727) residue within its transmembrane domain was replaced with valine (a gift of Dr. Raphael Kopan, Washington University, St. Louis, MO (22Schroeter E.H.

A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar)) by PCR. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers used in PCR were 5′-CCCTCTAGACAGGCATGCCACGGCTCCTGACGCCCCTTC-3′ (Notch-S10-XbaI) and 5′-CCCGGATCCCGACGAGCTGTCCAACAGCCAGCCCTTGCC-3′ (Notch-A3-BamHI), respectively. Underlined bases denoted the appended restriction sites. PCR amplimers were purified, cleaved with BamHI and XbaI, and subcloned into pBudCE4.1 vector to generate the NΔE-pBud vector. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and COS7 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1 mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. T-REx293 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient Transfection of Mammalian Cells—Transfection of HEK293, COS, and T-REx293 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Cells were plated onto 6-well microplates and grown to about 60-80% confluency prior to transfection. On the day of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with fresh 2 ml/well of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. C99-GV (0.5 μg), pFR-Luc (0.5 μg), and pRL-TK (0.1 μg) were diluted in 100 μl of serum-free DMEM and mixed with 3.3 μl of FuGENE 6, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Transfection mixtures were added dropwise into cell culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Transfected cells were harvested by PBS containing 20 mm EDTA and lysed with 100 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and subjected to luciferase assay using the Dual luciferase assay reagent kit. Protein content of lysates was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit. Generation of Stably Transfected Cell Lines—T-REx293 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes until 50% confluency as described above. On the day of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 8 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. T-REx293 cells were transfected with equal amounts of C99-GV (5 μg) and Gal4-Luc (5 μg) by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 200 μg/ml hygromycin, 250 μg/ml zeocin, and 5 μg/ml blasticidin (DMEM-HZB), and single colonies resistant to antibiotic selection were isolated individually using cloning cylinders. Each of independent cell lines was screened for the tetracycline-induced expression of C99-GV and corresponding luciferase signals that can be attenuated by γ-secretase inhibitors. Individually isolated cell lines were plated into 96-well microplates in DMEM-HZB containing 5 μg/ml tetracycline in the presence or absence of 10 μm compound E, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, for 24 h. Cell lysis and the addition of reagents for luciferase assay were completed simultaneously using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase signals were determined by a MLX microplate luminometer (DYNEX Technologies, Inc.). The optimal cell line was the one exhibiting the highest tetracycline-induced luciferase signal that can be significantly suppressed by compound E down to the basal level comparable with the luciferase signal obtained in the absence of tetracycline induction. Based on this criterion, clone T20 was selected and optimized for the cell-based γ-secretase assay (Fig. 1). To generate cells constitutively expressing NΔE, HEK293 cells were transfected with NΔE-pBud (10 μg) by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described above. Transfected cells were selected by DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 250 μg/ml zeocin (DMEM-Zeo), and single colonies were isolated individually using the cloning cylinder method. Lysates of selected cell lines were generated and analyzed for the overexpression of NΔE by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-Notch(Val1744) polyclonal antibody. Clone N7 was shown to express significant amounts of NΔE that can be cleaved by γ-secretase, and the treatments of γ-secretase inhibitors, both compound E and DAPT, dramatically suppressed this cleavage, demonstrating the efficiency of this Notch-based assay for γ-secretase (Fig. 4). Cell-based γ-Secretase Assays—To examine cytokine-elicited effects on γ-secretase specifically, T20 cells stably transfected with C99-GV and Gal4-Luc were trypsinized and washed with serum-free DMEM prior to plating onto 12-well microplates in 1 ml/well serum-free DMEM at 5 × 105 cells/well. Following the incubation at 37 °C overnight, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml Ifn-γ, IL-1β, or TNF-α in DMEM containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline, the inducer of C99-GV expression, and incubated at 37 °C for various intervals as specified. For dose-response studies, various concentrations of cytokines were included in the medium as specified. Cells incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline alone were used to define the basal level of γ-secretase activity at each time point, whereas cells treated with DMEM without tetracycline were used to estimate the nonspecific background emission of the luciferase signal. To terminate reactions, cells were harvested with PBS containing 20 mm EDTA and lyzed in 100 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,200 × g for 5 min, and luciferase activity in clarified lysates was determined by mixing 20 μl of lysates and 20 μl of Steady-Glo luciferase assay reagent in a 96-well LumiNunc microplate (Nunc). Following incubation at room temperature for 5 min, emitted luminescence in individual microwells was determined by a MLX Microplate luminometer and subsequently normalized by the protein content of lysates. The protein content of clarified lysates was determined by the BCA protein assay kit as described in manufacturer's instructions. The normalized luciferase signal emitted by T20 cells in serum-free DMEM without tetracycline was referred to as 1-fold of activation. For the time course studies, T20 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of the respective cytokines in serum-free DMEM containing 1 μg/ml of tetracycline, incubated at 37 °C for various intervals, and harvested for luciferase assay. For treatments of chemical compounds, such as compound E, DAPT, MAP kinase inhibitors, compounds were added into medium to the final concentration of 10 μm or as specified. To examine cytokine-elicited stimulation on γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of Notch, N7 cells constitutively expressing NΔE were plated onto 12-well microplates in 1 ml/well of serum-free DMEM at 5 × 105 cells/well. Following incubation at 37 °C overnight, cells were treated with 5 or 50 ng/ml Ifn-γ, IL-1β, or TNF-α in DMEM and incubated at 37 °C for 9 h. Treated cells were harvested by PBS containing 20 mm EDTA and dissolved in 50 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation at 13,200 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. The protein concentrations of clarified supernatants were determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit, and cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Notch(Val1744) polyclonal antibody as described below. Aβ ELISA—To determine cytokine-stimulated Aβ production, T20 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates and treated with various amounts of cytokines in serum-free DMEM containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 9 h. Conditioned media were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, supplemented with the Complete® protease inhibitor mixture, and stored at -80 °C until ready for assay. Levels of secreted Aβ40 in conditioned media were determined using a quantitative human Aβ40 sandwich ELISA kit as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Aβ40 measurements were conducted in triplicate, and the medium of T20 cells treated with serum-free DMEM alone was included as the blank. Site-directed Mutagenesis of MEKK1—The MEKK1 expressing vector (pCMV-MEKK1) encoding the catalytic kinase domain of wild-type mouse MEKK1 was purchased from Clontech. To generate the dominant-negative forms of MEKK1 (MEKK1-T560A or MEKK1-T572A (24Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

Two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations, flanked by unmodified nucleotide sequences, were synthesized. The paired primers for the generation of mutant MEKK1-T560A were T560A-forward (5′-TTGGCATCAAAAGGAGCCGGTGCAGGAGAGT-3′) and T560A-reverse (5′-ACTCTCCTGCACCGGCTCCTTTTGATGCCAA-3′), whereas the ones for MEKK1-T572A were T572A-forward (5′-GGACAGTTACTGGGGGCAATTGCATTCATGG-3′) and T572A-reverse (5′-CCATGAATGCAATTGCCCCCAGTAACTGTCC-3′). Underlined nucleotides denote the single based changes to incorporate the desired missense mutations. The dominate-negative kinase activity of mutants T560A and T572A was verified by using the In Vivo kinase assay (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Clarified cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of proteins were mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% dithiothreitol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Denatured proteins were resolved in Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels (10 or 12%). Separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were then treated with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST)) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by a brief rinse with PBST. Blocked membranes were probed with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody in PBST at room temperature for 1 h. The unbound primary antibody was removed by extensive washes with PBST. Subsequently, washed membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST at room temperature for 1 h. Following extensive washes with PBST, antibody-reacted proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blot detection reagents or SuperSignal West Femto reagents. The autoradiography of x-ray film and the band intensity were processed using Quantity One software version 4.5 (Bio-Rad). The antibodies used and their dilutions were as follows: anti-Gal4 (Santa Cruz), 1:1000; anti-Notch(Val1744), 1:1000; anti-phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK and anti-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) 1:10,000; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz), 1:1000. The Generation and Characterization of a Cell-based Reporter Gene Assay Specific for γ-Secretase—To specifically address the regulation of γ-secretase activity, we first generated a cell line (T20) stably transfected with the Gal4-luciferase reporter gene and C99-GV, the immediate substrate of γ-secretase C-terminal tagged with Gal4/VP16 that was derived from a yeast transcription factor and a viral transcription activator. The rationale of this cell-based luciferase reporter assay for γ-secretase activity is depicted in Fig. 1A. To optimize the responsiveness of this reporter assay to γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis, a tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression was employed so that the expression of C99-GV would only be induced when the detection of γ-secretase activity was needed, reducing the background emission of luminescence because of constitutive expression of C99-GV. In the isolated stable line T20, the γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of C99-GV expressed upon tetracycline induction releases the Gal4/VP16-tagged APP intracellular domain (AICD-GV) from the membrane, and the transcription factor then activates the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of five tandem repeats of Gal4 cis-elements in the Gal4-Luc vector, resulting in a ∼30-fold increase of luminescence emission in comparison to the background emission exhibited in the absence of tetracycline induction(1-foldofactivation)(Fig. 1B). Suchγ-secretase-dependent emission of luminescence can markedly be attenuated by a known γ-secretase inhibitor, compound E (25Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F.

https://openalex.org/W2131913960,"Progress in gerontological research has been promoted through the use of numerous animal models, which have helped identify possible mechanisms of aging and age-related chronic diseases and evaluate possible interventions with potential relevance to human aging and disease. Further development of nonhuman primate models, particularly rhesus monkeys, could accelerate this progress, because their closer genetic relationship to humans produces a highly similar aging phenotype. Because the relatively long lives of primates increase the administrative and economic demands on research involving them, new emphasis has emerged on increasing the efficient use of these valuable resources through cooperative, interdisciplinary research."

Ischemia decreases the content of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin accompanied by a decrease in cytochrome c content and a diminished rate of oxidation through cytochrome oxidase. We propose that during ischemia mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species at sites in the electron transport chain proximal to cytochrome oxidase that contribute to the ischemic damage. Isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were treated with rotenone, an irreversible inhibitor of complex I in the proximal electron transport chain, immediately before ischemia. Rotenone pretreatment preserved the contents of cardiolipin and cytochrome c measured after 45 min of ischemia. The rate of oxidation through cytochrome oxidase also was improved in rotenone-treated hearts. Inhibition of the electron transport chain during ischemia lessens damage to mitochondria. Rotenone treatment of isolated subsarcolemmal mitochondria decreased the production of reactive oxygen species during the oxidation of complex I substrates. Thus, the limitation of electron flow during ischemia preserves cardiolipin content, cytochrome c content, and the rate of oxidation through cytochrome oxidase.

Specifically, in the isolated rabbit heart, 30 and 45 min of ischemia decreases oxidation through cytochrome oxidase in SSM, whereas IFM remain unaffected (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3865-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This complex requires the integrity of catalytic subunits (21Babcock G.T. Varotsis C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and of regulatory and structural subunits (22Anthony G. Reimann A. Kadenbach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5755-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ischemia does not lead to functional inactivation of a subunit peptide of cytochrome oxidase (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in oxidation through cytochrome oxidase occurs concomitant with a selective decrease in the content of cardiolipin (18Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A decrease in the cytochrome c content of SSM occurs as the cardiolipin content decreases in these organelles (18Lesnefsky E.J.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Vik S.B. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5755-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), is enriched in oxidatively sensitive linoleic acyl groups (26Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We propose that during ischemia, oxidant production from sites upstream of cytochrome oxidase (possibly from complex III (27Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36027-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar)) leads to depletion of cardiolipin, in turn leading to loss of cytochrome c and decreased rates of oxidation through cytochrome oxidase. In this event, the blockade of electron flow during ischemia should interrupt this sequence. To address this proposal during in situ ischemia in the intact heart, the electron transport chain was inhibited during ischemia and the content of cardiolipin, cytochrome c, and the rate of oxidation through cytochrome oxidase were measured following 45 min of global ischemia in the isolated rabbit heart. Treatment immediately before ischemia with rotenone, which is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of complex I, preserved cardiolipin content, cytochrome c content, and oxidation through cytochrome oxidase in SSM. Blockade of electron transport during ischemia protects against damage to more distal sites in the electron transport chain. In isolated mitochondria, rotenone blockade of electron transport decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (27Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36027-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Thus, the proximal electron transport chain mediates damage to the distal electron transport chain during the progression of ischemia. Ischemic damage to mitochondria in turn leads to myocyte damage during reperfusion (2Becker L.B. vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2240-H2246PubMed Google Scholar). All chemicals were of highest commercial purity and were obtained from Sigma. HPLC grade solvents were obtained from Fischer Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Phospholipid standards were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The isolated, buffer-perfused rabbit heart model was used as described previously (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Louis Stokes Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center approved the study. Groups of hearts underwent either 15 min of perfusion as non-ischemic controls (n = 8) or 15 min of perfusion with rotenone (n = 8) or antimycin A (n = 3) or underwent no treatment (n = 10) followed by 45 min of global ischemia. Rotenone was used to inhibit complex I because of its high affinity for this complex and its irreversible inhibitory effect. Antimycin A is a high affinity inhibitor of complex III. Irreversible inhibition of complexes I and III was an advantage in the present study because reperfusion, and thus the need for recovery of oxidative metabolism, was not planned. Rotenone was administered as a bolus of 60 μm over 1 min immediately before ischemia. Antimycin A was infused at a final concentration of 400 μm over 1 min. The concentrations of inhibitors were calculated based upon the amount needed to yield a concentration of inhibitor in the estimated total tissue volume of the heart similar to the inhibitory concentrations used in the oxygen electrode chamber (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ventricular pacing was discontinued during inhibitor administration. We previously found that cardiac function and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were preserved during 60 min of perfusion as time controls (18Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two populations of cardiac mitochondria were isolated as described previously (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J.

Cytochromes were quantified using the difference of dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized absorption spectra (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J.

Polarographic cytochrome oxidase activity was measured in deoxycholate-solubilized SSM in the presence of 32 μm cytochrome c and exogenous phospholipid supplied by liposomes of soybean asolectin as described previously (12Lesnefsky E.J.

Complex III activity was measured as antimycin A sensitive decylubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase as described previously (28Lesnefsky E.J. Gudz T.I. Moghaddas S. Migita C.T. Ikeda-Saito M.

Protein concentrations were measured using the biuret method with bovine serum albumin as standard (29Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol.

Individual phospholipid and lysophospholipid peaks were identified by comparison of retention time to standards (18Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lesnefsky E.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Organic phosphate was measured by the method of Bartlett adapted for use in a multiwell plate reader (18Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lesnefsky E.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Organic phosphate analysis was not performed in two rotenone-treated hearts. In one heart, the standard curve in the organic phosphate assay did not meet quality control criteria. In the second heart, there was a technical failure of the total phospholipid phosphate measurement. Samples for lipid analysis were not available in two perfusion controls. The rate of H2O2 production from SSM was measured by the oxidation of the fluorogenic indicator, Amplex Red, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase as described previously (32Moghaddas S. Hoppel C. Lesnefsky E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Amplex Red reacts with H2O2 in the presence of horseradish peroxidase to generate a stable fluorescent product, resorufin (excitation 530 nm, emission 585 nm). Fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (1420 Victor2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SSM from non-ischemic hearts were incubated (0.1 mg protein/ml) at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing chelex-treated 160 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm/0.1units/ml of Amplex Red/horseradish peroxidase containing glutamate 10 mm, pyruvate (2.5 mm)/malate (2.5 mm), or succinate (10 mm) as substrates with or without either rotenone (2.4 μm), antimycin A (10 μm), or stigmatellin (6.6 μm) as inhibitors. H2O2 production was calculated as fluorescence minus background rates measured in the absence of SSM (pmol/mg protein). As expected, the addition of catalase (643 units/ml) decreased fluorescence by 85–90%, confirming that the increase in fluorescence occurred because of H2O2 production. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of the mean. Differences among groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons performed using the Student-Newman-Keuls test of multiple comparisons (33Steel R. Torrie J. Principles and Procedures of Statistics. McGraw-Hill, New York1960Google Scholar). A difference of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Rabbit Heart Model of Ischemia—The isolated, buffer-perfused rabbit heart was studied before ischemia (n = 8), following 45 min of ischemia (n = 10) or 45 min of ischemia with rotenone (n = 8) or antimycin A (n = 3) treatment immediately before ischemia. Before inhibitor treatment, all groups had similar developed pressure, positive and negative dP/dt, and coronary flow (data not shown). The bolus infusion of either inhibitor decreased developed pressure to less than 60% of the pressure before inhibitor administration without an increase in diastolic pressure or decrease in coronary flow (data not shown). Diastolic pressure following 45 min of ischemia was similar in the presence or absence of inhibitors (ischemia alone: 45 ± 4 mm Hg, n = 10; rotenone + ischemia: 41 ± 5 mm Hg, n = 8; antimycin A + ischemia: 38 ± 9 mm Hg, n = 3). Ischemia, with or without rotenone pretreatment, did not alter the protein yield of SSM or IFM compared with non-ischemic controls (Table I). Rotenone markedly inhibited glutamate oxidation, although inhibition was somewhat greater in SSM compared with IFM as expected (Table I). Antimycin A also did not alter mitochondrial protein yield (SSM 12.4 ± 0.6, IFM 10.7 ± 1.0 mg protein/gm heart, n = 3). Respiration with glutamate, succinate, and duroquinol was markedly inhibited in both SSM and IFM (ADP-stimulated respiration with glutamate: SSM 10 ± 1 nAO/min/mg; IFM 16 ± 5; ± S.E., n = 3, succinate and duroquinol not shown). As expected, complex III activity was inhibited by 97 ± 1% (n = 3) in both SSM and IFM.Table IProtein yield and respiration rate in myocardial mitochondria isolated from rabbit hearts with and without rotenone treatmentNon-ischemia (n = 8)45 minutes ischemia (n = 10)45 minutes ischemia-rotenone treated (n = 8)Mitochondrial protein yieldmg of protein/g wet weightSSM15.4 ± 0.513.9 ± 0.813.3 ± 1.4IFM11.4 ± 0.69.8 ± 0.311.1 ± 0.7Uncoupled respiration: glutamate as complex I substratenAO/min/mg of proteinSSM201 ± 10102 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.25 ± 4ap < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.bp < 0.05 versus 45 min ischemia alone.IFM288 ± 16172 ± 11ap < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.62 ± 8ap < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.bp < 0.05 versus 45 min ischemia alone.Respiration through cytochrome oxidase in SSM: TMPD-ascorbate as substratenAO/min/mg of proteinMax ADPcMaximal rate of ADP-stimulated respiration using 2 mm ADP.477 ± 25324 ± 20ap < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.436 ± 37bp < 0.05 versus 45 min ischemia alone.UncoupleddDinitrophenol uncoupled respiration.586 ± 32338 ± 12ap < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.455 ± 41ap < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.bp < 0.05 versus 45 min ischemia alone.Respiration through cytochrome oxidase in IFM: TMPD-ascorbate as substratenAO/min/mg of proteinMax ADPcMaximal rate of ADP-stimulated respiration using 2 mm ADP.800 ± 54658 ± 35813 ± 52UncoupleddDinitrophenol uncoupled respiration.822 ± 59651 ± 46846 ± 85a p < 0.05 versus non-ischemia hearts.b p < 0.05 versus 45 min ischemia alone.c Maximal rate of ADP-stimulated respiration using 2 mm ADP.d Dinitrophenol uncoupled respiration. Open table in a new tab Morphology of Myocardium and Isolated Mitochondria following Rotenone Treatment—As in our previous study (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both SSM and IFM in untreated ischemic hearts were pallid but showed almost no other differences from mitochondria in normal hearts except for a lack of matrix granules. Mitochondria in cardiomyocytes from rabbit hearts treated immediately before ischemia with rotenone exhibited several morphological differences from mitochondria in untreated ischemic hearts (Fig. 1). The major alteration involved increased pallor of the inner compartment. A few of the mitochondria were swollen, signaled by an increase in size and a disrupted outer membrane. All of the mitochondria lacked matrix granules. In all other respects, the mitochondria, both subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar, were normal in appearance; most were of typical size, and cristae were unchanged in number or configuration. Again as in our previous study, the mitochondrial pellets from untreated ischemic hearts consisted of a mixture of organelles, most of which were normal in appearance except for a pallid matrix (Fig. 2). Mitochondria isolated from rotenone-treated, ischemic hearts did not differ to any meaningful degree from their counterparts derived from untreated ischemic hearts. Although the majority of isolated SSM from such hearts had a typical morphology, a few showed disruption of the outer membrane, leading to the formation of “blowout” blebs of inner membrane. Some organelles contained a large vacuole that undoubtedly resulted from swelling and expansion of a single crista. In pellets of IFM, there was a small number of organelles that matched certain in situ mitochondria in that they were bounded for a portion of their circumference by a single membrane with their cristae compacted against the diametrically opposite intact portion of the bounding membranes. Isolated interfibrillar mitochondria in general displayed slightly more structural changes than did their subsarcolemmal counterparts. Although not swollen, some otherwise undamaged mitochondria had a central portion that looked “moth-eaten.” In sum, during ischemia, although in situ and isolated populations of cardiac mitochondria from rotenone-treated hearts exhibited a modicum of morphologic alterations compared with organelles from untreated hearts, mitochondria for the most part remained intact following rotenone-treatment. Pretreatment with Rotenone but Not with Antimycin A Preserves Oxidative Function through Cytochrome Oxidase—As described previously, the oxidation of TMPD-ascorbate, an electron donor to cytochrome oxidase via cytochrome c, decreased following 45 min of ischemia in SSM (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following 45 min of ischemia in the presence of rotenone the rates of both ADP-stimulated and uncoupled respiration through cytochrome oxidase in SSM were higher than with ischemia alone (Table I). Rotenone treatment did not alter oxidative phosphorylation through cytochrome oxidase in IFM, although a non-significant trend toward a decrease in oxidation was evident at the end of ischemia, also ameliorated by rotenone treatment (Table I). Next we asked if blockade of electron transport distal to the quinol oxidation (Qo) site of complex III with antimycin A also preserved oxidation through cytochrome oxidase. In contrast to rotenone, treatment immediately before ischemia with antimycin A failed to preserve the rate of TMPD-ascorbate oxidation in SSM following 45 min of ischemia (ADP-stimulated respiration 306 ± 30, ± S.E., n = 3; uncoupled respiration 366 ± 6, both p = not significant versus 45 min of ischemia alone). Cytochrome oxidase activity was then measured in frozenthawed, deoxycholate solubilized mitochondria by polarographic assay technique in the presence of exogenous phospholipids, conditions that yield maximal enzyme activity (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the decrease in respiration through cytochrome oxidase in intact SSM, ischemia did not decrease cytochrome oxidase activity in solubilized SSM (Table II) consistent with previous results (12Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antimycin A treatment before ischemia decreased cytochrome oxidase activity in SSM compared with non-ischemic controls, SSM from untreated ischemic hearts, and SSM from rotenone-treated ischemic hearts (Table II). In contrast, the preserved cytochrome oxidase activity in SSM from ischemic hearts treated with rotenone is consistent with an absence of any additional damage to cytochrome oxidase caused by this inhibitor. The decrease in cytochrome oxidase activity in SSM from ischemic hearts treated with antimycin A suggests that this inhibitor causes additional damage to cytochrome oxidase by a mechanism distinct from ischemia.Table IIPolarographic cytochrome oxidase activity in solubilized SSMNon-ischemia (n = 3)45 min ischemia (n = 3)45 min ischemia-rotenone treated (n = 3)45 min ischemia-antimycin A treated (n = 2)SSM5335 ± 665364 ± 2135833 ± 2733834 ± 42ap < 0.05 versus all other groups by one-way analysis of variance.

Open table in a new tab Content of Phospholipids in SSM and IFM from Rotenone-treated and Untreated Ischemic Hearts—Ischemia decreased the content of cardiolipin in SSM, whereas the cardiolipin content in IFM remained unaltered (18Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in cardiolipin content is selective given that the contents of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol are preserved during ischemia in SSM (18Lesnefsky E.J. Slabe T.J. Stoll M.S. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2770-H2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rotenone treatment preserved the content of cardiolipin in SSM following 45 min of ischemia (Fig. 3). Treatment with antimycin A before ischemia also preserved the content of cardiolipin in SSM (43 ± 7 nmol/mg, n = 3). Cardiolipin content (nmol/mg of protein) was unaltered by ischemia in IFM (non-ischemic 40 ± 5 (n = 6); ischemia alone 38 ± 2 (n = 10); rotenone-treated ischemia 49 ± 4 (n = 6); all p = not significant). Total lipid phosphate was measured in parallel samples. The recovery of phospholipids was excellent, as shown by the sum of the four individual phospholipids representing ∼90% of total lipid phosphate (SSM, 88 ± 5%, n = 22; IFM, 88 ± 5%, n = 22), as described previously (18Lesnefsky E.J.

SK channels are likely encoded by three genes, Kcnn1–3, whereas IK and most BK channels are most likely products of the Kcnn4 and Slo (Kcnma1) genes, respectively. IK channels are prominently expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system and in organs involved in salt and fluid transport, including the colon, lung, and salivary glands. IK channels likely underlie the K+ permeability in red blood cells that is associated with water loss, which is a contributing factor in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. IK channels are also involved in the activation of T lymphocytes. The fluid-secreting acinar cells of the parotid gland express both IK and BK channels, raising questions about their particular respective roles. To test the physiological roles of channels encoded by the Kcnn4 gene, we constructed a mouse deficient in its expression. Kcnn4 null mice were of normal appearance and fertility, their parotid acinar cells expressed no IK channels, and their red blood cells lost K+ permeability. The volume regulation of T lymphocytes and erythrocytes was severely impaired in Kcnn4 null mice but was normal in parotid acinar cells. Despite the loss of IK channels, activated fluid secretion from parotid glands was normal. These results confirm that IK channels in red blood cells, T lymphocytes, and parotid acinar cells are indeed encoded by the Kcnn4 gene. The role of these channels in water movement and the subsequent volume changes in red blood cells and T lymphocytes is also confirmed. Surprisingly, Kcnn4 channels appear to play no required role in fluid secretion and regulatory volume decrease in the parotid gland.

Surprisingly, Kcnn4 channels appear to play no required role in fluid secretion and regulatory volume decrease in the parotid gland. It has become clear that multiple types of Ca2+-activated potassium channels underlie a wide range of distinct physiological processes. Physiological and pharmacological analyses have subdivided Ca2+-activated potassium channels into three groups, i.e. the small, intermediate, and large conductance channels, often termed SK, 1The abbreviations used are: SK, small potassium conductance; IK, intermediate potassium conductance; BK, large potassium conductance; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NS, normal saline; RVD, regulatory volume decrease. IK, and BK channels, respectively. IK channels, as their designation implies, have a single channel conductance intermediate between the SK and BK channels. These three functional groups have rather distinct pharmacological profiles, and SK, IK, and BK channels can be specifically blocked by apamin, clotrimazole, and paxilline, respectively. SK and IK channels are encoded by four genes of the KCNN gene family. The three SK channels, KCNN1–3, share ∼70–75% amino acid identity. The IK channel KCNN4 is encoded by a protein sharing only ∼40% amino acid identity with each of the three SK channels, KCNN1–3. KCNN4 channels are prominently expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system and in organs involved in salt and fluid transport, including the colon, lung, and salivary glands (1Joiner W.J. Wang L.

The expressed channels are sensitive to clotrimazole, but the reported affinity appears to depend on the expression system used (compare, for example, Refs. 2Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B.

These channels are also sensitive to inhibition by charybdotoxin, stichodactyla toxin, and maurotoxin but are insensitive to the SK blocker apamin and the BK blocker iberiotoxin. Red blood cells have a high but latent passive permeability to K+ ions that is mediated by what is often called the Gardos channel (7Gardos G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 653-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This channel has all the properties of, and is likely encoded by, the KCNN4 gene (4Vandorpe D.H. Shmukler B.E. Jiang L. Lim B.

Increased water loss from red blood cells secondary to increased K+ permeability is a contributing factor in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. The resulting increase in the intracellular concentration of hemoglobin S leads to a shortened delay time for the polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin S. Thus, blocking erythrocyte K+ permeability and the consequent dehydration is under evaluation as a potential therapy for sickle cell disease. Indeed, blocking the red blood cell IK channel with clotrimazole prevents erythrocyte dehydration in patients with sickle cell disease (9Brugnara C. Gee B. Armsby C.C. Kurth S. Sakamoto M. Rifai N.

Blood. 2003; 101: 2412-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The KCNN4 gene also likely encodes the Ca2+-activated, intermediate conductance K+ channel expressed in T lymphocytes (3Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32723-32726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This channel is expressed at low levels in human resting T cells and is strongly up-regulated during activation by mitogens (13Ghanshani S. Wulff H. Miller M.J. Rohm H. Neben A. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37137-37149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The role of the IK channel in lymphocytes appears to be the maintenance of a hyperpolarized membrane potential, thus facilitating and maintaining the intracellular Ca2+ levels required for mitogen activation (14Fanger C.M. Rauer H. Neben A.L. Miller M.J. Wulff H. Rosa J.C. Ganellin C.R. Chandy K.G. Cahalan M.D. J. Biol.

Drug Discovery Devel. 2003; 6: 640-647PubMed Google Scholar). The cell shrinkage that correlates with the initiation of apoptosis in T lymphocytes is specifically blocked by clotrimazole, suggesting that IK1 may also be involved in early events associated with apoptosis in this cell type (16Elliott J.I. Higgins C.F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In most fluid-secreting exocrine epithelia, the acinar cell cytoplasmic Cl– concentration is maintained above electrochemical equilibrium by the Na-K-2Cl transporter. The exit of Cl– into the lumen is balanced by the movement of Na+ ions through the interstitial tight junctions into the lumen. This elevated salt concentration draws water into the lumen and, after modification by the duct cells, leads to a secreted fluid rich in NaCl. To maintain fluid secretion, the Cl– efflux into the lumen must be sustained. In the absence of any other active channels, the acinar cell membrane potential would approach the Cl– equilibrium potential and net Cl– movement would cease. Both exocrine and other fluid-secreting epithelia often express K+ channels whose activity can facilitate Cl– efflux by maintaining a hyperpolarized membrane voltage. Rodent (and other) salivary glands express two types of Ca2+-activated potassium channels, a BK channel and an IK channel (17Hayashi T. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Maruyama Y. Nishiyama A. Teshima T. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1986; 36: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Wegman E.A.

Hayashi M. Ishikawa T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C127-C144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These BK and IK channels have biophysical and pharmacological properties consistent with those expected of channels encoded by the Slo (Kcnma1) and Kcnn4 genes, respectively (6Nehrke K. Quinn C.C. Begenisich T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C535-C546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Takahata T. Hayashi M. Ishikawa T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C127-C144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both channels are activated by the increase in intracellular Ca2+ produced by muscarinic agonists, but the evidence suggests that fluid secretion may be independent of BK channel activity (17Hayashi T. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Ishikawa T. Murakami M. Seo Y. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Hayashi T. Poronnik P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), leaving IK channels to play this role. Kcnn4 is believed to play important roles in the volume regulation of circulating blood cells such as lymphocytes (15Wulff H. Beeton C. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Devel. 2003; 6: 640-647PubMed Google Scholar) and erythrocytes (10Brugnara C. De Franceschi L. Bennekou P. Alper S.L. Christophersen P. Drug News Perspect. 2001; 14: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which traverse the hyperosmotic environment of the renal medulla. In lymphocytes, Kcnn4-mediated hyperpolarization promotes sustained elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, which permits the modulation of gene expression via the regulated nuclear translocation of transcription factors. In sickle disease erythrocytes the hyperactivation of Kcnn4 contributes, via cell shrinkage and the increased concentration of hemoglobin S, to the pathological acceleration of deoxyhemoglobin S polymerization. This, in turn, accelerates cell sickling and increases the likelihood of vaso-occlusion. To test for the physiological roles of IK channels, we have inactivated the Kcnn4 gene in mouse by homologous recombination. Homozygous mice carrying this knock-out appeared grossly normal and were fertile. We found the expected loss of functional IK1 channels in T lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and parotid acinar cells, confirming the genetic basis for this channel type. Disrupting the expression of the Kcnn4 gene impaired the volume regulation of T lymphocytes and erythrocytes but not that of parotid acinar cells. Despite the loss of IK channels, activated fluid secretion from the parotid glands was normal. Gene Targeting—The targeting vector for homologous recombination was constructed using the pKO Scrambler V1901 vector (Lexicon Genetics), which contains the Neo gene driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. A mouse IK1 genomic clone was isolated from an SVJ129 lambda library using a probe specific to exons 1 and 2 and standard screening techniques. The 5′-arm was created as a BglII-tagged fragment by low round PCR amplification from the excised IK1 genomic insert. The 3′-arm was isolated directly from the genomic clone as a BglII (genomic)/NotI(vector) fragment. All clones were sequenced for verification. The 5′-arm was inserted into the pKO Scrambler V1901 vector's BglII site, and the 3′-arm was inserted into the vector's BamHI and NotI sites. The phosphoglycerate kinase-Neo cassette lies between the arms in the opposite orientation (Fig. 1). The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into CJ7 embryonic stem cells. Southern blot analysis identified several positive clones, one of which was expanded and injected into blastocysts. Chimeric male mice were bred to C57Bl/6J female mice. Breeder pairs from the resulting heterozygous offspring were used to generate wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous null littermates for all of the subsequent experiments. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Resources Committee of the University of Rochester. Genotyping and Southern Analysis—DNA was isolated from tail clips using standard procedures. Initial characterization of the targeting event was performed on Southern blots with hybridization to the 250-bp 5′-outside probe (Fig. 1). In addition, PCR products were obtained using the Triple Master PCR System (Eppendorf), which span both ends of the recombination (indicated in Fig. 1). Sequencing of these products across the recombination sites confirmed that the targeting vector has integrated at the expected site in the mouse IK1 locus (data not shown). Routine genotyping of mice for functional assays was done using standard PCR protocols. Northern Blots—Parotid salivary glands were dissected from adult wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous knockout mice. CD4+ T cells were isolated using the protocol described below under the section entitled “CD4+ T Lymphocyte Methods.” Either the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) or Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA from all tissues. mRNA was prepared using oligo(dT) mini columns (Qiagen). 15 μg of total RNA or 5 μg of mRNA were separated on a 1% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel and blotted. The blots were hybridized with a full-length probe for the Kcnn4 coding sequence, the total RNA blot in Church buffer (0.5 m NaPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) at 65 °C, and the mRNA blot in ExpressHyb reagent (Clontech) per the manufacturer's instruction. Marker sizes are based on 18 and 28 S bands or an RNA ladder (Invitrogen).

Chem. 2001; 276: 23413-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In brief, mice were anesthetized by exposure to CO2 gas and killed by exsanguination via cardiac puncture. The parotid glands were dispersed in a digestion solution composed of Eagle's minimum essential medium (Biofluid), 0.17 mg/ml Liberase RI enzyme (Roche Applied Science), 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 35–37 °C. Parotid tissue was minced with fine scissors in digestion buffer and incubated for 20 min. Cells were dispersed by pipetting every 10 min followed by rinsing with basal medium (Eagle) with 1% bovine serum albumin. To obtain single cells, the minced tissue was initially incubated in digestion solution containing 0.1% trypsin and 5 mm EDTA for 5 min and then further digested as described above in the presence of a 0.2% trypsin inhibitor. Cell Volume Measurement—Isolated acinar cells were incubated with 2 μm calcein-acetoxymethyl ester in basal medium (Eagle) with 1% BSA for 20 min and then washed twice. Cells were attached to a coverslip on the base of a 500-μl chamber and perfused with bicarbonate-free physiologic salt solution containing 105 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium gluconate, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, with NaOH) at room temperature (20–22 °C). The hypotonic shock solution was made by adding a 30% volume of distilled water. The perfusion chamber was mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 200) interfaced with a fluorescence imaging system (TILL) and perfused at 3 ml/min. Fluorescence images were collected at 10-s intervals using 20-msec exposures at 490-nm excitation and 530-nm emission wavelengths. Cell volume changes were expressed as 1 per normalized fluorescence as reported previously (24Krane C.M. Melvin J.E. Nguyen H.V. Richardson L. Towne J.E. Doetschman T. Menon A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23413-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Quantitative estimates of the rates of cell volume change were made using the early linear phase of volume recovery. Channel inhibitors were introduced 2 min prior to the hypotonic shock. In Vivo Saliva Collection—Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg) prior to isolating the ducts from the left and right parotid glands with the aid of a dissecting microscope. The trachea was exposed and incised to ensure a patent airway during the experiment. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a regulated blanket (Harvard Apparatus). The cut ends of the ducts were inserted into individual calibrated glass capillary tubes (VWR Scientific). Secretion was stimulated by intraperitoneal injection of secretagogues. Saliva was collected for 30 min and stored at –86 °C. At the end of the saliva collection period, blood was collected by cardiac puncture into heparinized syringes, and mice were euthanized by exposure to CO2 gas. Parotid glands were removed and carefully trimmed of connective tissue under a dissecting microscope. Salivary flow rate was expressed as 1 μl per 100 mg of gland weight. Sodium and potassium concentrations were measured by atomic absorption (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 3030 spectrophotometer). Chloride activity was measured using an Orion Research expandable ion analyzer 940. Sample osmolality was obtained with a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer. Protein concentration was estimated by a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made at room temperature (20–22 °C) with an Axopatch 1-D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data acquisition was performed using a 12-bit analog/digital converter controlled by a personal computer. We used an internal solution that consisted of 135 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mm EGTA, and 3 mm CaCl2, which established a free Ca2+ concentration of 250 nm (25Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) (see also www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html). The external solution consisted of 135 mm sodium glutamate, 5 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated using a CD4+ Cell Isolation kit (Mitenyi Biotec; Auburn, CA). Briefly, mice were killed by exposure to CO2. Lymph nodes (including inguinal, brachial, axillary, superficial cervical, and mesenteric nodes) were removed, placed in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% l-glutamine, and 0.0002% 2-mercaptoethanol) and then gently forced through a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (Falcon 352350; BD Biosciences). The resulting cell suspension was transferred through a 40-μm nylon cell strainer (Falcon 352340; BD Biosciences) and then centrifuged at 4 °C and 1200 rpm (∼250 g) for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in degassed PBS buffer (with 1% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm EDTA) containing a biotin-antibody mixture and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Anti-biotin microbeads were added for an additional 15 min at 4 °C, the suspension was rinsed, and then CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated on MACS separation columns (Mitenyi Biotec; Auburn, CA). Cells were kept on ice in the RPMI solution until use. Cell volume was determined using a Coulter counter and Channelyzer (Beckman Coulter Electronics Inc.). Cell volume determinations were performed using software from Coulter Electronics Inc. (AccuComp version 4.1A) and expressed in femtoliters per cell. 86Rb+Influx—86Rb+ influx into mouse erythrocytes was measured using a variation of previously described methods (11De Franceschi L. Saadane N. Trudel M. Alper S.L. Brugnara C. Beuzard Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1670-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Rivera A. Rotter M.A. Brugnara C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C746-C754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparinized blood was washed five times in 10 volumes of choline wash solution (172 mm choline chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-MOPS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) and then washed once in normal saline (NS) (165 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-MOPS, pH 7.4) and resuspended at room temperature with a hematocrit of 3% in flux medium (NS supplemented with 50 μm CaCl2, 1 mm ouabain, 100 μm bumetanide, and 10 μCi/ml 86Rb+) in the absence or presence of 10 μm clotrimazole. The influx assay was initiated by the addition of 5 μm A23187 (from 1 mm ethanol stock) or vehicle alone to the erythrocyte suspension. Triplicate 100-μl aliquots of vortexed cell suspension were withdrawn at influx times of 2 and 5 min. These aliquots were immediately added to precooled 1.5-ml tubes containing 0.8 ml of NS plus 5 mm EGTA layered over 0.3 ml of phthalate. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 s. After removal of the aqueous upper layers and part of the oil layer, the tube tips were cut off and counted in a γ-counter. Influx was calculated from the linear slope derived from the mean values at 2 and 5 min and expressed in units of mmol K(Rb)/1013 cells × h–1. KCNN4-mediated flux was expressed as the clotrimazole-sensitive component of 86Rb+ influx in the presence of A23187. Osmotic Fragility—Mouse erythrocytes washed three times in NS were resuspended to 5% hematocrit in isotonic lysis solution (NS buffered by 10 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.5 at 20 °C) in the absence or presence of 5 μm A23187 and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Triplicate 10-μl aliquots of cell suspension were transferred to microfuge tubes containing 290-μl lysis solutions of the indicated relative tonicity prepared by proportional mixing of NS buffered by 2 mm Tris-HEPES (relative tonicity of 1) with 2 mm Tris HEPES-buffered water (relative tonicity of 0). After thorough mixing, tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpm × 5 min, and 250-μl aliquots of each supernatant were removed for measurement of A540. A540 values at zero relative tonicity were defined as 100% lysis for normalization. The mouse Kcnn4 gene was inactivated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. A targeting vector was constructed with 3.5- and 2.3-kb homologous arms of Kcnn4 genomic sequence, completely deleting exon 1. Homologous recombinants were identified by Southern blot analysis, and a positively identified recombinant clone was injected into blastocysts. Germline transmission was confirmed through Southern hybridization and PCR analyses of tail samples from the progeny of the chimeric founders (Fig. 1). Mating mice heterozygous for the inactivated allele of Kcnn4 produced 425 offspring; of these, 103 were homozygous wild-type (+/+), 228 were heterozygous (±), and 94 were homozygous Kcnn4 null (–/–) animals representing 24, 54, and 22% of the number of births, respectively. This distribution is nearly identical to the normal Mendelian frequency of 25, 50, and 25%. The Kcnn4(–/–) mice appeared to develop normally. Homozygous (–/–) mice of both sexes were fertile. Body weights of homozygous males and females do not differ from their wild-type littermates (mean ± S.E. values are as follows: male +/+, 27.0 ± 1.1 g with n = 36; male –/–, 27.3 ± 1.0 g with n = 42; female +/+, 21.5 ± 0.5 g with n = 40; female –/–, 22.9 ± 0.6 g with n = 36). In contrast, the weight of the parotid glands from homozygote null male mice was significantly higher than that from wild-type male animals (+/+, 29.2 ± 1.2 mg with n = 36; and –/–, 32.8 ± 1.2 mg with n = 42; p = 0.04). A similar trend was observed in females but did not achieve statistical significance (+/+, 26.4 ± 0.9 mg with n = 40; –/–, 28.0 ± 0.9 mg with n = 36; p = 0.25). Histological examination of major organ systems did not reveal any gross differences between wild-type and knock-out tissues. IK1 Channels and T lymphocyte Physiology—Ca2+-mobilizing agents induce shrinkage of CD4+ T lymphocytes, which can be specifically blocked by clotrimazole (16Elliott J.I. Higgins C.F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Northern blot in Fig. 2A shows the expression of IK1 mRNA in CD4+ lymphocytes from wild-type mice (+/+). This band is absent in Kcnn4 null animals (–/–). Panel B of Fig. 2 shows that the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (5 μm), induced T lymphocytes isolated from wild-type mice (Fig. 2B, ▪) to shrink nearly 20% (n = 6). In contrast, the ionomycin-induced shrinkage of lymphocytes from Kcnn4 null (Fig. 2B, ○) animals was dramatically reduced (n = 6). Similarly, the IK1-specific channel blocker clotrimazole (10 μm) essentially eliminated the cell shrinkage in wild-type CD4+ lymphocytes (data not shown). IK1 Channels and Red Blood Cell Physiology—As described above, red blood cells have a Ca2+-activated conductive K+ permeability believed to be mediated by the Gardos channel (7Gardos G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 653-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3A show that this permeability is indeed encoded by the Kcnn4 gene. The large A23187-stimulated, clotrimazole-sensitive 86Rb influx into red blood cells from wild-type animals was nearly eliminated in the Kcnn4 (–/–) erythrocytes. We also examined the ability of the IK1/Kcnn4 Gardos channel to control red blood cell volume by measuring the effect of A23187 on osmotic fragility for red cells. Fig. 3B shows the percentage of red cell lysis from wild-type animals at the indicated relative solution tonicity in the absen"
https://openalex.org/W2148590099,"The pregnane X receptor (PXR) plays an important role in the response to xenobiotics and endogenous toxins. We have used a specific anti-PXR antibody in the Western blotting of mouse liver nuclear extracts to show that PXR is accumulated in the nucleus after treatment with 5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one-16α-carbonitrile (PCN), followed by an increase in Cyp3a11 mRNA. Expression of wild type PXR and various mutants as green fluorescent fusion proteins in mouse livers showed that PXR was retained in the cytoplasm from where PCN treatment translocated PXR into the nucleus. Furthermore, the xenochemical response signal, the nuclear translocation signal, and the activation function 2 domain were all required for the nuclear translocation to occur. Immunoprecipitation experiments using the hsp90 antibody demonstrated the presence of PXR in a complex with the endogenous cytoplasmic constitutive active/androstane receptor retention protein (CCRP) in HepG2 cells. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of mouse liver sections after co-expression of cyan fluorescent protein-CCRP and yellow fluorescent protein-PXR also indicated that CCRP and PXR were closely associated in vivo. Overexpression of exogenous CCRP increased the cytoplasmic level of the PXR·CCRP·hsp90 complex, whereas a decrease in endogenous CCRP by treatment with small interfering RNA for CCRP repressed the PXR-mediated reporter activity in HepG2 cells. We conclude that the CCRP mediates the retention of PXR in the cytosol and modulates the activation of PXR in response to PCN treatment.

NR1I2) and constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) are involved in the primary response to xenobiotics and endogenous toxins (1Goodwin B. Redinbo M.R. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These receptors respond to ligands by activating the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in phase I (oxidation) and phase II (conjugation) metabolism as well as proteins involved in the efflux of toxins from the cell (3Honkakoski P. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Sonoda J. Rosenfeld J.M. Xu L. Evans R.M. Xie W. Curr. Drug Metab. 2003; 4: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Swales K. Negishi M. Mol. Endcrinol. 2004; 18: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CAR is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of untreated liver cells and translocates to the nucleus after exposure to PB and PB-like chemicals (6Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic CAR retention protein (CCRP and designated Dnajc7 in the official gene symbol in the NCBI data base) has been shown to maintain the cytoplasmic localization of CAR by forming a complex with CAR and hsp90 (7Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Yoshinari K. Kobayashi K. Moore R. Kawamoto T. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Other nuclear receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor also exist as complexes with receptor-specific co-chaperones and hsp90 that play an important role in locating these receptors in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells (9Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). These co-chaperones, including immunophilin-FK506-binding proteins and hepatitis B virus protein X-associated protein 2, contain multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are 34 amino acid sequences that form a pair of anti-parallel α helices that mediate protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes (10D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The movement of proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is an energy-dependent process determined by both nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and nuclear export sequence on the protein (11Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The typical NLS consists of a single or repeat cluster of basic amino acids that associate with factors such as importins, which carry the proteins into the nucleus through a nuclear pore complex. The typical nuclear export sequence is a leucine-rich region and has been identified on a number of proteins, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (12Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13Berg P. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43231-43238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After binding to ligand, the nuclear receptor GR moves along cytoskeletal tracks toward the nucleus by connecting with dynein motors (reviewed in Ref. 13Berg P. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43231-43238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The C-terminal AF2 domain is required for ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by steroid hormone and many other nuclear receptors (14Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and it is displaced upon the binding of ligand, allowing it to interact with co-activators. The removal of the AF2 domain prevents the nuclear translocation of the VDR and GR (15Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 16Racz A. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the AF2 domain is not required for the nuclear translocation of CAR following PB exposure (17Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The nuclear translocation of CAR following drug exposure is dependent on the xenochemical response sequence (XRS), a leucine-rich sequence near the C terminus conserved as (L/M)XXLXXL (17Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in mouse and human CAR and PXR. However, mutations in the key leucine residues in the XRS did not affect the formation of heterodimers between CAR and RXR or the co-activation of CAR by SRC-1. This suggests that the XRS regulates the translocation but not the activation of CAR. In contrast to CAR, PXR is generally thought to be primarily retained in the nucleus where it activates the expression of genes such as Cyp3a11 after binding ligands such as PCN. Thus, the possibility that co-chaperones could regulate the cellular localization of PXR has not been investigated. However, recent results of the immunostaining of mouse liver sections using a commercially available antibody suggest that mPXR may be located in the cytosol of untreated liver cells (18Kawana K. Ikuta T. Kobayashi Y. Gotoh O. Takeda K. Kawajiri K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); however, additional supporting experiments, such as Western blot analysis, were not presented. Moreover, in transformed cells, human hPXR (SXR) is located primarily in the nucleus, and mutation of specific amino acids in the so-called NLS region of the DNA binding domain of hPXR resulted in cytoplasmic localization of the receptor in transformed cells (18Kawana K. Ikuta T. Kobayashi Y. Gotoh O. Takeda K. Kawajiri K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the role of the NLS as well as other specific motifs (AF2 and XRS) in the nuclear translocation of mPXR in the liver following drug treatment remains unexplored. Our goal was to use more definitive methods to determine whether mPXR was located in the cytoplasm of untreated liver and translocated to the nucleus only after exposure to xenochemicals. To achieve this, we produced specific antibodies against the hinge region of mPXR and used these antibodies in the Western blotting of liver nuclear extracts prepared from control mice and those treated with PCN. We also investigated the interaction of mPXR with CCRP in the cytosol to determine whether CCRP played a role in maintaining mPXR in the cytosol. We then looked at the NLS, XRS, and the AF2 domain, which may be involved in the nuclear translocation of mPXR in response to drug treatment, to determine whether these components also affected the association of mPXR with CCRP. Finally, we investigated the role of endogenous CCRP in the activation of mPXR in response to drug treatment. Antibodies—Anti-mPXR antibody was raised in rabbits using the hinge region peptide NH2-CSNAAVEQRRALIKRKKRE-COOH conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as the antigen. The antibody was purified from serum by affinity chromatography using the peptide coupled to SulfoLink gel (Pierce). Rabbit anti-CAR antibody and rabbit anti-CCRP antibody were produced as described previously (7Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Honkakoshi P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Anti-hsp90 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (catalog number MA3–011, Golden, CO), control IgM from BD Biosciences, and anti-V5-horseradish peroxidase antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-lamin B was from Santa Cruz Biotechonology (sc-20682, Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmids—cDNAs encoding full-length mPXR, mPXRΔAF2 (residues 1–416), hPXR, mCAR, and CCRP were PCR-amplified using the appropriate primers and cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA3.1/mPXR-V5-His, pcDNA3.1/mPXRΔAF2-V5-His, pcDNA3.1/hPXR-V5-His, pcDNA3.1/mCAR-V5-His, and pcDNA3.1/CCRP-V5-His. mPXR and CCRP were also amplified using 5′ primers containing an in-frame XhoI site and 3′ primers containing an EcoRI site and cloned into pEYFP-C1 or pECFP-C1 expression vectors (BD Biosciences) to produce an N-terminal fusion with green fluorescent protein. The XREM-3A4-Luc (p3A4–362(7836/7208ins)) reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Bryan Goodwin (GlaxoSmithKlein) (20Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The following mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) and the appropriate primers: pcDNA3.1/mPXR-V5-His or pEYFP-mPXR containing either the mutations M391A, L394A, or L397A in the XRS region and R63/R64A/R85/K86A or R63/R64A/R88A/R89A in the NLS region. All plasmids were verified by nucleotide sequencing and prepared using a Qiagen plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Expression of Fluorescent Protein-tagged PXR and CCRP in Mouse Liver in Vivo—Expression of pEYFP-mPXR, its various mutants, and pECFP-CCRP in mouse liver in vivo and their detection by microscopy was performed as described previously (7Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Sueyoshi T. Moore R. Pascussi J-M. Negishi M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Plasmids were injected via the tail veins of male CD-1 mice using the TransIT in vivo gene delivery system (Mirus, Maddison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two h later, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 15 mg/kg PCN, 100 mg/kg PB, or Me2SO vehicle and killed 6 h later. Liver sections were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Zeiss LSM510 META microscopy system. For FRET analysis, 458-nm excited signals were captured twice before and twice after YFP photobleaching using twenty-five pulses of a 514-nm laser. Wavelength scanning images between 450 and 540 nm were collected to extract simultaneously each of the YFP and CFP emissions using software provided by Zeiss. Dequenching of CFP was quantified for multiple liver cells, and FRET efficiency E was calculated with the equation, E = 1 - (Ii/Ii0), where Ii is fluorescence intensity before the bleaching and Ii0 is that of after the bleaching. The distance between the CFP donor and YFP acceptor was calculated using an R0 value (the distance at which energy transfer efficiency is 50% in ideal conditions) of 4.9 nm (22Harpur A.G.

Cells and Transfection Assay—HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). At ∼50% confluence, the cells were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h later, the cells were given fresh medium, and a further 24 h later, the cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in buffer A (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 0.3% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) as described in Refs. 7Kobayashi K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a nuclear pellet, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 17,800 × g for 10 min to obtain a clear cytosolic fraction for use in immunoprecipitation. The pellet was washed once in buffer A, once in buffer A without Nonidet P-40, and then suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor). The resulting suspension was mixed at 4 °C for 12 h in the presence of 0.4 m NaCl and centrifuged for 10 min at 17,800 × g to obtain a clear nuclear extract. Preparation of Mouse Liver Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared based on published methods (24Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 25Sueyoshi T. Kobayashi R. Nishio K. Aida K. Moore R. Wada T. Handa H. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Liver was homogenized in 20 volumes of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm spermine, and 1 mm EDTA using a motor-driven glass Teflon homogenizer kept on ice. The homogenate was then layered over a cushion of the same buffer and centrifuged at 85,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (as described above), mixed at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.4 m NaCl, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation—Anti-hsp90 (5 μl) or IgM (1 μg), as a control, was added to 2 mg of cytosolic protein from HepG2 cells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Twenty μl of a 50% slurry of protein L-Sepharose (ImmunoPure immobilized protein L, Pierce) previously washed in buffer A was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was recovered by centrifugation and washed five times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Na2MoO4, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted from the resin with NuPAGE LDS buffer (Invitrogen) and subjected to Western blotting. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated either on a NuPAGE 4–10% BisTris gel in NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) or a 10% SDS gel in Tris-glycine buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using the SemiPhor semi-dry transfer unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in a mixture of TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% Blotto milk powder followed by1hof incubation with primary antibody (rabbit anti-mPXR, rabbit anti-mCAR) in the same medium and 1 h with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For the detection of V5-tagged proteins, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with anti-V5-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in a mixture of TBS and Tween 20 with 5% Blotto. The protein bands were visualized on the membranes using Lumigen PS-3 ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, the immunoblots were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and restained with antibodies. GST Pull-down Assay—The GST-CCRP fusion protein was expressed and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) (7Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 35S-labeled mPXR and mCAR were produced from pcDNA3.1/mPXR-V5-His and pcDNA3.1/mCAR-V5-His using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) along with 35S-labeled methionine. GST-CCRP or GST coupled to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B was incubated with the 35S-labeled mPXR or mCAR in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. The resin was then recovered by centrifugation and washed three times in the same buffer. Proteins were extracted from the resin by heating for 10 min at 70 °C in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and separated on a NuPAGE 4–10% BisTris gel in NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer for1hat150 volts. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue, destained and dried under vacuum, and the proteins detected by autoradiography. siRNA Treatment and Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) to about 50% confluence. The cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/mPXR-V5-His or pcDNA3.1/hPXR-V5-His, the XREM-3A4-Luc reporter, and phRL-tk as a transfection control (Promega) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA interfering experiments, HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNA against CCRP (SMART pool siRNA M-019566–00 from Dharmacon, Inc., Boulder, CO) or an unrelated scramble (5′-ACUCUAUCGCCAGCGUGACUUdTdT-3′) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's directions. After 48 h, half of the wells were treated with PCN or rifampicin, and after a further 24 h, the luciferase activity of the XREM-3A4-Luc reporter and the control phRL-tk was measured using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The ratio of XREM-3A4-Luc reporter activity to Renilla luciferase control was calculated for triplicate transfections. Real-time PCR—To measure CYP3A11 mRNA, liver samples were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) with random hexamers as primers. One-twentieth of the cDNA was used for real-time PCR with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector using TaqMan Universal PCR reaction mix and primers for mouse CYP3A11 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control. mPXR Accumulates in the Nucleus of Liver Cells after Drug Treatment—To determine the cellular localization of endogenous mPXR in mouse liver in vivo, Western blotting of liver nuclear extracts was performed using an antibody raised against the hinge region of mPXR (Fig. 1A). Levels of mPXR were lowest in nuclear extracts from untreated mice or mice treated with Me2SO vehicle and increased following PCN treatment but not after PB treatment. When the same blot was stripped and then immunostained using antibody against mouse CAR, levels of CAR were highest in nuclear extracts from PB-treated mice, with no effect of PCN treatment. The results obtained from the present Western blot analysis have now established that mPXR accumulates in the nucleus of liver cells following PCN treatment. This nuclear accumulation of mPXR occurred in a time-dependent manner. Livers were removed from untreated mice and, at various times up to 40 h after treatment with PCN and nuclear extracts, were prepared and used for Western blotting using anti-mPXR antibody. The results (Fig. 1B) show that levels of mPXR in the nucleus increased rapidly after treatment with PCN and were already maximal at the first time point of 3 h after treatment. Levels of mPXR remained high in the nuclear extracts at 8 h after PCN treatment and decreased by the 17-h time point. To compare the time course for gene activation with the accumulation of mPXR in the nucleus after treatment with PCN, levels of CYP3A11 mRNA were measured in the livers by real-time PCR. Levels of CYP3A11 mRNA increased to a maximum at the 17-h time point after PCN treatment and remained elevated over untreated control values at 40 h after treatment. This indicates that activation of the CYP3A11 gene occurred after mPXR accumulates in the nucleus in response to PCN treatment. Thus, mPXR moves into the nucleus in response to PCN treatment, activates transcription of responsive genes, and then is cleared from the nucleus. Structural Components of mPXR That Affect Nuclear Translocation—We investigated the cellular localization of mPXR by in vivo transfection of YFP-tagged mPXR in mouse liver. In untreated liver, YFP-mPXR was localized throughout the cytoplasm of the liver cell (Fig. 2A). However, in liver sections from mice that had been treated with PCN, YFP-mPXR was present predominantly in the nucleus. This cytoplasmic retention and nuclear translocation of YFP-mPXR are reminiscent of what occurs with the endogenous receptor. To identify the structural features of mPXR that affect nuclear translocation in vivo, we expressed mPXR and its various mutants as YFP fusion proteins in mouse livers. These mPXR mutants contained substitutions in the XRS region or the NLS region in the DNA binding domain or had the C-terminal AF2 region deleted (Fig. 2B). We then measured the percentage of cells with mPXR expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm, the percentage with equal nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, and the percentage with primarily nuclear localization of mPXR (Fig. 2A). Wild type YFP-mPXR was located primarily in the cytoplasm in untreated mouse liver and translocated to the nucleus after treatment with PCN. However, mutations in key amino acid residues in the XRS or NLS region or deletion of the AF2 domain prevented nuclear translocation in vivo in response to treatment with PCN. The distribution of the NLS and XRS mutants remained almost entirely cytoplasmic, whereas the AF2 deletion mutant had slightly more nuclear distribution, which was not affected by PCN treatment. These results suggest that the XRS, NLS, and AF2 regions are all required for the nuclear translocation of mPXR after PCN treatment in vivo. Role of CCRP in Cytoplasmic Localization of mPXR—CCRP is involved in maintaining the cytoplasmic localization of CAR (7Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that CCRP could also bind to mPXR and was involved in the retention of mPXR in the cytoplasm. As a first step, we used a GST pull-down assay to demonstrate that GST-CCRP can bind to mPXR as well as binding to CAR (Fig. 3A). Next we expressed mPXR-V5 and CCRP-V5 in HepG2 cells and found that they formed a complex in the cytosol with hsp90 that can be immunoprecipitated by anti-hsp90 antibody (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, when the ratio of CCRP to mPXR used in transfecting the HepG2 cells is increased, the retention of mPXR in the cytosol is also increased. We then did a FRET analysis of mouse liver sections after co-expression of CFP-CCRP and YFP-mPXR. The results indicated that CCRP and mPXR are closely associated in vivo to allow FRET to occur. Before photobleaching of YFP, excitation at 458 nm produced a clear FRET signal from CFP-CCRP to increase the signal observed from YFP-mPXR (Fig. 4A). After photobleaching of YFP, this FRET did not occur, and the CFP signal intensity increased. The CFP and YFP signal intensity was measured before and after photobleaching in four different regions of the cell (Fig. 4B). After photobleaching, the YFP signal intensity decreased rapidly with a concomitant increase in the signal intensity of CFP. Measurements of FRET efficiency in seven different cells ranged from 49 to 66%, which suggested that CFP-CCRP and YFP-mPXR were within an estimated distance of 4.69 ± 0.23 nm of each other. Taken together, these results demonstrated that mPXR forms a complex with CCRP that may promote the retention of mPXR in the cytoplasm of liver cells.Fig. 4Association of mPXR and CCRP FRET assay. pEYFP-mPXR and pECFP-CCRP were injected via the tail vein using the TransIT in vivo gene delivery system, and liver sections were prepared for confocal laser scanning microscopy. A, CFP and YFP protein images before and after bleaching of YFP-mPXR. Before the bleaching of YFP, FRET from CFP increases the signal intensity from YFP and decreases the signal from CFP. After the bleaching of YFP, FRET does not occur; therefore, that signal from CFP is increased. The thickness of the closed arrows in the schematic drawing represents intensity of fluorescence. B, quantification of CFP and YFP intensities from three ROIs (regions of interest) of a cell (boxes 1, 2, and 3) and the whole cell overall (ROI 4) over time. The graphs are showing YFP and CFP fluorescent intensity changes by the photobleaching YFP in each ROI. Photobleaching began after recording the base-line CFP and YFP intensities twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Given that mPXR and CCRP could form a complex with hsp90, we expressed mPXR-V5 and its various mutants in HepG2 cells along with CCRP-V5 to investigate whether the signature motifs (NLS, XRS, and AF2) were involved in the formation of the mPXR·CCRP·hsp90 complex. Immunoprecipitation of cytosols with hsp90 antibody demonstrated that the various mPXR mutants can all form a complex with CCRP and hsp90 in the cytosol with approximately equal efficiency (Fig. 5). Thus, the extent of binding of mPXR mutants to CCRP in the cytosolic complex is not correlated with the amount of the mPXR mutant that translocates to the nucleus after PCN treatment, as shown in Fig. 2A. Thus, the CCRP-mediated retention of mPXR in the cytosol of HepG2 cells does not fully explain the mechanism of nuclear translocation of mPXR in liver in vivo. Role of CCRP in Regulating the Activity of PXR—We next transfected HepG2 cells with pcDNA3.1/mPXR-V5-His and pcDNA3.1/CCRP-V5-His and immunoprecipitated the CCRP·mPXR complex with anti-hsp90 antibody. When the Western blot was stained with anti-CCRP antibody, the endogenous CCRP that was immunoprecipitated along with the CCRP-V5 could be clearly seen, indicating that the endogenous CCRP also forms a complex with endogenous hsp90 and the transfected mPXR in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6A). Immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-V5 antibody also confirmed that hsp90 was precipitated along with mPXR-V5 and CCRP-V5 (data not shown). We then wanted to determine whether CCRP affects the activation of PXR in response to drug treatment. When siRNA for CCRP was transfected in HepG2 cells, a clear decrease in endogenous CCRP protein was observed by Western blotting (Fig. 6B), whereas there was no effect on levels of mPXR in the nucleus. The decrease in CCRP expression by siRNA treatment resulted in an attenuated response in a reporter assay for mouse PXR activity, with a more dramatic response obtained with 50 μm PCN than with 10 μm PCN. In addition, the response of human PXR to activation by rifampicin was also attenuated by treatment with siRNA for CCRP. This clearly demonstrated that CCRP plays a role in the activation of both mouse and human PXRs following treatment with their activators. We produced an antibody directed against the hinge region of mPXR and used this antibody in Western blots to show that the levels of mPXR initially increase in the nucleus of mouse liver cells after PCN treatment, followed by activation of a mPXR-responsive gene, and then levels of mPXR decrease in the nucleus. Expression of YFP-mPXR in mouse liver in vivo revealed that mPXR is expressed in the cytoplasm of untreated liver cells and is translocated in the nucleus after PCN treatment. These data definitively demonstrate that nuclear translocation of mPXR occurs, as with other nuclear receptors such as CAR, GR, and VDR, as a primary step in the activation of mPXR-responsive genes. PXR transfected into transformed cells normally accumulates spontaneously in the nucleus without drug treatment. Using this model, Kawana and his associates (18Kawana K. Ikuta T. Kobayashi Y. Gotoh O. Takeda K. Kawajiri K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) identified a NLS region in hPXR (SXR) that, when mutated, resulted in accumulation of the receptor in the cytosol of transformed cells. They concluded that the NLS is essential in the ligand-independent translocation of human PXR in HeLa cells. They also found that hPXR with the AF2 domain deleted was accumulated in the nucleus, suggesting that the AF2 domain was not necessary for nuclear translocation. The results of our experiments, in which various mutants of mPXR were expressed in mouse liver in vivo, demonstrate that the PCN-dependent nuclear translocation requires not only the NLS but also the AF2 domain. In addition to the NLS and the AF2 domain, mPXR contains the XRS motif that is known to regulate the nuclear translocation of both mouse and human CAR in mouse liver in vivo (17Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that the XRS motif is also required for the nuclear translocation of mPXR to occur in response to PCN treatment. The differences between the findings of Kawana and associates (18Kawana K. Ikuta T. Kobayashi Y. Gotoh O. Takeda K. Kawajiri K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the present work may be due to differences between hPXR and mPXR, cell types used, and/or differences between the model of spontaneous accumulation of PXR in the nucleus and nuclear translocation of PXR in response to drug treatment. Because all of the NLS, XRS, and AF2 domains are required for nuclear translocation of mPXR in vivo, they may all function in the mechanism of nuclear translocation of mPXR. In contrast to mPXR, hCAR does not need either the NLS or the AF2 domain for nuclear translocation, requiring only the ligand binding domain containing the XRS region. CAR lacking its AF2 domain or everything except the C-terminal half of the LB domain (residues 181–348) translocated to the nucleus in mouse liver in vivo following treatment with CAR activators (17Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Sueyoshi T. Moore R. Pascussi J-M. Negishi M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The NLS region of CAR may not be effective for nuclear translocation because of the substitution of a highly conserved lysine by serine in human, rat, and mouse CAR compared with PXR and VDR (18Kawana K. Ikuta T. Kobayashi Y. Gotoh O. Takeda K. Kawajiri K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In fact, a chimeric hPXR containing the NLS of hCAR underwent nuclear translocation as observed with hCAR. 2T. Sueyoshi and M. Negishi, unpublished observation. The AF2 domain regulates receptor function and is activated by the direct binding of ligand. The direct binding of agonistic ligand initiates GR and VDR to translocate into the nucleus (16Racz A. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of nuclear translocation of CAR may be distinct, because the CAR activator PB does not bind to CAR, and the AF2 domain is not required for translocation of CAR. Because PCN binds directly to mPXR and the translocation requires the AF2 domain, the regulatory mechanism for nuclear translocation may be similar to that of GR and VDR. CCRP (a mouse ortholog of human TPR2 (26Murthy A.E. Bernards A. Church D. Wasmuth J. Gusella J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), a co-chaperone of the class III TPR family, which includes proteins that are involved in antiviral interferon response, the stress response, and protein import, was identified as a CAR binding protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse liver cDNA library using CAR as bait. CCRP, acting as a co-chaperone, mediates the formation of the CAR·CCRP·hsp90 complex in the cytosol of HepG2 cells (7Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have shown here that mPXR can also bind to the co-chaperone CCRP to form a complex within the cytosol along with hsp90, increasing the retention of mPXR in the cytosol of HepG2 cells. In addition, our FRET analysis indicates that CCRP and mPXR are closely associated in mouse liver in vivo. CCRP has also been reported to bind to the GR and is required at a narrowly defined expression limit for maximal activation of the GR (27Brychzy A. Rein T. Winklhofer K.F. Hartl F.U. Young J.C. Obermann W.M.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3613-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar to the GR activity, we have found that the mPXR-mediated trans-activation of genes is modulated by CCRP in HepG2 cells. These observations suggest that CCRP may play a role not only in the cytoplasmic retention of the receptors, but also in their activation in the nucleus. The role of hsp90 and TPR proteins in the formation of complexes with signaling proteins, such as steroid receptors, and their movement to the nucleus has recently been reviewed (14Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. DeFranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The GR forms a complex with hsp90 and immunophilins, which are TPR proteins that link the complex to dynein motor proteins for retrograde movement along microtubules to the nucleus. However, the mechanism by which CCRP regulates the retention and activation of these receptors remains an interesting target for further investigations. In summary, we have shown that mPXR is located in the cytoplasm of untreated liver cells and is concentrated in the nucleus following drug treatment. mPXR forms a complex with CCRP and hsp90 that maintains the receptor in the cytosol. The formation of the mPXR·CCRP·hsp90 complex is not dependent on the XRS, NLS, or AF2 domains in mPXR. However, these regions are all required for the nuclear translocation of mPXR. Thus, although CCRP is involved in maintaining mPXR in the cytosol, the binding of mPXR to CCRP does not regulate the nuclear translocation of mPXR in response to PCN treatment. However, CCRP does modulate the activation of mPXR in response to drug treatment. This demonstration of the cytoplasmic localization of mPXR in untreated liver and the role of CCRP should stimulate future research on the mechanism of nuclear localization and activation of PXR following drug treatment."

Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 13Prasil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Top. Photosynth. 1992; 11: 295-348Google Scholar). Maintaining PSII function may require selective replacement of this central PSII subunit including an efficient apparatus to recognize inactive complexes, and remove damaged and insert a new D1 copy (5Bergantino E.

Cyanobacteria are an excellent model organism to study PSII assembly. The strain used most frequently is Synechocystis PCC 6803 because it is easily transformable, grows photoheterotrophically, and its genome has been completely sequenced (17Kaneko T. Tabata S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mutants deficient in photosynthetic activity are easily isolated and defects caused by the mutation can be characterized well by biochemical and genetic means. Many mutants are available that still accumulate PSII complexes despite their functional impairment (18Ikeuchi M. Eggers B. Shen G.Z. Webber A. Yu J.J. Hirano A. Inoue Y. Vermaas W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1454-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas in eukaryotic algae or higher plants, similar mutations often lead to a complete disappearance of the complex making it difficult to investigate the residual assembly capability of the system (18Ikeuchi M.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) described the importance of certain PSII subunits for the accumulation of PSII. Using several mutants they concluded that the D2 protein is necessary for synthesis of other large subunits like CP47 and D1, whereas D1 synthesis was not required for synthesis of D2 and CP47. In the absence of CP47, D1 and D2 were expressed without protein accumulation, and CP43 associated with PSII in the later stage of the assembly process.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11419-11427Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) largely confirmed results from Chlamydomonas. In the absence of CP43, subunits CP47, D1, and D2 accumulated. In the absence of CP47, subunit CP43 accumulated, whereas D1 and D2 proteins became detectable by radiolabeling only. In the absence of D2, only small amounts of CP47, but no D1 were reported, and in the mutant lacking the D1 protein (28Nilsson F.J. Andersson B. Jansson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 14: 1051-1054Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), CP43 still accumulated and small amounts of D2 and CP47 were also detected. Although, these data provided information with respect to subunit composition, the assembly of PSII subunits remained enigmatic. A protein shown to be of importance for the initiation of PSII accumulation in higher plants and cyanobacteria is cytochrome b559. In cyanobacteria, no accumulation of PSII was detected in the absence of one or both subunits (29Pakrasi H.B. Diner B.A. Williams J. Arntzen C.J.

Furthermore, no D2 or D1 was found, but PSII subunits CP47 and CP43 did accumulate (29Pakrasi H.B. Diner B.A. Williams J. Arntzen C.J. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 591-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cytochrome subunits α and β are encoded by genes psbE and psbF, respectively (32Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In plants and cyanobacteria they are part of the psbEFLJ operon and are cotranscribed with PSII subunits L and J. In Chlamydomonas, where psbE is transcribed separately from other PSII genes, D1, D2, and CP47 did not accumulate when psbE was deleted confirming the importance of cytochrome b559 for accumulation of PSII (33Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent characterization of psbJ and psbL deletion mutants in plants confirmed that these proteins do not significantly affect accumulation of PSII RCC monomers but may be involved in proper assembly of the oxygen evolving apparatus in cyanobacteria and higher plant chloroplast (34Anbudurai P.R.

Protein complexes solubilized from thylakoid membranes can be separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (39van Wijk K.J. Andersson B. Aro E.M. J. Biol.

Identification of the subunit composition throughout the gradient is then performed by SDS-PAGE and gel blot analysis. This method is highly useful to study the assembly of photosystem protein complexes when combined with analysis of deletion mutants lacking expression of single complex subunits. This method has been intensively used to study assembly of PSII in isolated chloroplasts and thylakoids from spinach and was later complemented by nondenaturing Deriphat-PAGE and IEF (41van Wijk K.J. Roobol-Boza M. Kettunen R. Andersson B. Aro E.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6178-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Results indicated that PSII assembly requires a sequential attachment of cytochrome b559, psbI, CP47, and CP43 onto an initially formed D1–D2 heterodimer (6Swiatek M. Regel R.E. Meurer J. Wanner G. Pakrasi H.B. Ohad I. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 268: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, because of limited resolution capacity of the sucrose gradient an alternative technical approach was used here. Protein complexes and corresponding protein subunits of thylakoid membranes were resolved by an improved two-dimensional separation technique based on Blue-native electrophoresis (42Schagger H. von Jagow G.

Assembly of protein subunits was followed by pulse-chase radiolabeling of wild type and mutant Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells. In vivo pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments using mutant ΔpsbA, ΔpsbB, ΔpsbC, ΔpsbD, and ΔpsbEFLJ strains indicated that only PSII precomplexes were assembled in the mutants. Data corroborated a sequential assembly of RCC monomers from reaction center (RC) and show that expression of the psbEFLJ operon is a prerequisite for D2 accumulation, which is the key regulatory step for stabilization of the newly synthesized D1 and the consecutive assembly of the PSII RC complex. Strains and Culture Conditions—Synechocystis PCC 6803 strains used for the study are described in Table I. Strains were grown in BG-11 medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose. In addition, plate medium contained 1.5% agar and 0.3% sodium thiosulfate (32Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures of 50–100 ml were gently stirred in conical flasks and irradiated with 80–100 μE m–2 s–1 of white light at 29–30 °C.Table ISynechocystis PCC 6803 mutants and PSII activityStrainsPSII protein missingPSII oxygen evolutionPSIIRef.% of WTWT+10060Williams J.G.

The cell suspension was shaken in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes at 60 μE m–2 s–1 for 1 h at 30 °C. Then 12.5 μl of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added (final activity of 500 μCi ml–1) and illumination was continued for another 30 min. After this period, cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for preparation of thylakoids. Preparation of Thylakoid Membranes—Thylakoid membranes were prepared as described (45Komenda J. Lupinkova L. Kopecky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were broken by vortexing with glass beads and separated from unbroken cells, cell debris, and soluble proteins by differential centrifugation. Protein Analysis and Autoradiography—Prior to analysis, thylakoids (10 μg of Chl) were sedimented and then resuspended in 60 μl of ACA buffer (42Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 43Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) to which 6 μl of 10% dodecylmaltoside was added. Thylakoids were incubated for 10 min on ice and then quickly centrifuged to remove unsolubilized material. Supernatant was mixed with 5 μl of loading buffer and applied on a 6–12% Blue-native polyacrylamide gel (BN-PAGE). When the buffer front had reached about ⅓ of the resolving gel, the upper buffer containing Coomassie Blue G-250 was replaced by the same buffer without the stain and separation was continued until the front had reached the end of the gel. Individual lanes containing the protein complexes were cut out and complexes were denatured within the gel lane by incubation for 20 min in solubilization buffer containing 33 mm Na2CO3, 2% SDS, and 0.66% 2-mercaptoethanol. Lanes were placed on top of a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 4 m urea and protein subunits loaded with SDS were released from the gel and separated by SDS-PAGE along the electrical field gradient according to their molecular mass. To separate D2 and the three D1 forms, a 12–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea was used. First dimension BN-PAGE lanes were fixed with 0.5% agarose in the upper electrophoretic buffer, and SDS-PAGE (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) was run overnight using the Ettan Dalt II system (Amersham Biosciences, 12% gel) or Protean xi cell (Bio-Rad, 12–20% gradient gel). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R, destained, dried, and then exposed to a phosphorimager plate. Alternatively, proteins from the unstained gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the membrane was used for visualization of radiolabeled D1, D2, and CP43 proteins and for identification of proteins by gel blot analysis using specific antibodies raised against the N- and C-terminal parts of D1, D2, and CP47, the complete protein sequence of CP43, and the α subunit of cytochrome b559 protein. Specifically, antibodies were raised against (i) residues 58–86 of D1 from spinach; (ii) the last 16 residues of Synechocystis D1 precursor by Nixon (47Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); (iii) the last 12 residues of plant D2 by Nixon (47Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); (iv) residues 380–394 of barley CP47 by us; and the whole isolated CP43 (v) and α cytochrome b559 protein (vi) from Synechocystis. For estimation of the D1 and D2 protein content, the thylakoids containing 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 μg of chlorophyll were analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE on 12–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immuno-decorated by specific antibodies. In a molecular mass window from 50 to 700 kDa for BN-PAGE and 25–55 kDa for SDS-PAGE, Coomassie-stained proteins that remained undetected by gel blot analysis were identified by de novo sequencing using ESI-MS/MS on a Q-TOF mass spectrophotometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Analysis of Assembly After Two-dimensional Native/SDS-PAGE—A two-dimensional analysis of the assembly process is based on the finding that an assembly step results in binding of a radiolabeled protein subunit to an assembly partner that can be detected during pulse-chase radiolabeling as molecular mass shift of the radiolabeled protein by the first dimension of BN-PAGE. In the second dimension SDS-PAGE, the molecular mass shift caused by assembly of the protein subunit is indicated by a horizontal shift of radiolabel from the low to the high molecular mass region of the two-dimensional gel. If accumulation of radiolabel in a PSII subunit protein is found at a specific x/y position in wild type (WT) cells but cannot be detected in the mutant cell, we conclude that the deleted structural subunit is required for this particular assembly step. In the mutant, lacking expression of a particular structural subunit, an intermediate assembly state awaiting the scheduled subunit, may then accumulate. If the molecular mass of PSII assembly intermediates is compared between mutants, the sequence of single assembly steps is read from the lowest to the highest molecular mass subcomplex. Chlorophyll Content—For measurement of chlorophyll concentrations, cells were sedimented by centrifugation and extracted with 100% methanol. The concentration of chlorophyll was calculated from the absorbance values of the extract at 666 and 720 nm (48Wellburn A.R. Lichtenthaler H.K. Adv. Photosynth. Res. 1984; 2: 10-12Google Scholar). Assembly of PSII Is Monitored by Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE Separation of Thylakoid Membrane Protein Complexes—Assembly of PSII was studied in wild type and mutant Synechocystis 6803 cells illuminated in the presence of [35S]Met. Radiolabeling was necessary to reach the highest level of sensitivity for detection of PSII assembly intermediates in vivo. Synthesis of PSII subunits D2, D1, CP47, and CP43 and their assembly was monitored by radiolabel accumulation in protein complexes, whereas the steady state level of protein subunits in complexes was monitored by Coomassie staining or by Western blotting after two-dimensional native/SDS-PAGE. For two-dimensional analysis, cells were broken and thylakoids were isolated. Thylakoids were solubilized and protein complexes were separated according to molecular mass by BN-PAGE (Fig. 1A). We began by characterizing all proteins detected by Coomassie staining of thylakoids from WT cells. Using gel blot analysis the subunits of five protein complexes could be identified (Fig. 1A, Table II). At about 550 kDa, the α-, β-, and γ-subunits marked the position of the ATPase complex, and at about 400 kDa, the LSU subunit indicated the position of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco). Protein subunits of PSII, CP47, CP43, D2, and D1 accumulated in two complexes at about 300 and 600 kDa in WT cells, corresponding to monomeric and dimeric reaction center core complexes RCC1 and RCC2, respectively. Finally, at a molecular mass of about 70–90 kDa, unassembled CP47 and CP43 were detected. Because it cannot be determined from the BN-PAGE analysis whether these subunits are precursor protein complexes required for assembly of PSII or are released from native complexes during solubilization of the thylakoid membrane or BN-PAGE, we investigated the de novo assembly of PSII by pulse and pulse-chase treatment of Synechocystis cells. Furthermore, mass spectrometry was employed to identify proteins in the BN/SDS-PAGE window stained with Coomassie but not identified as PSII subunits by gel blot analysis (Table II).Table IIIdentification of proteins separated by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGESpotAntibody detectionMS analysis1slr0906, CP472sll0851, CP433Sll0849, slr0927, D24Slr1311, sll1867, D15slr1326 and slr1329, α and β subunits of ATPase6slr1327, γ subunit of ATPase7slr0261, NAD oxidoreductase subunit H8slr0009, large subunit of Rubisco9Sll1363, ketol-acid reductoisomerase10sll0680, putative phosphate-binding periplasmic protein11sll0108, putative ammonium transporter12slr0447, negative aliphatic amidase regulator13sll1694, general secretion pathway protein G Open table in a new tab Pulse radiolabeling of Synechocystis cells for 2.5 min with [35S]Met readily identified PSII subunits CP47, CP43, D2, and D1 because all radiolabeled subunits were located precisely at the molecular mass position of protein subunits identified as RCC1 subunits by two-dimensional gel blot analysis (Fig. 1B, RCC1). Interestingly, one protein was identified in RCC1 with an intermediary molecular mass between a high molecular mass form identified as precursor D1 (pD1) and the mature D1 (D1) in the low molecular mass edge of the BN gel (Fig. 1, B and E). Because all three forms were identified by gel blot analysis with a C-terminal anti-D1 antibody, we termed this unprocessed D1 form intermediate D1 (iD1) (Fig. 1E, also see Fig. 3 and Refs. 49Tichý M. Lupínková L. Sicora C. Vass I. Kuviková S. Prášil O. Komenda J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1605: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and 50Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The iD1 form was also found in a reaction center core subcomplex with a molecular mass of 220 kDa termed RC47, which contained CP47, but no CP43 (Fig. 1B). In addition, two complexes with a molecular mass of 110 and 140 kDa were identified which assembled no mature D1 form (Fig. 1B). Because of the radiolabeling of iD1 and identification of D2 in these complexes (Fig. 3D), we called these complexes reaction center complexes and labeled them with a and b, according to their molecular mass (140 kDa, RCa, and 110 kDa, RCb). In both RCC1 and RC47, D1 radiolabeling was increased relative to D2, pD1, and iD1, whereas pD1 was principally in its free form. Because D2 and D1 contain about equal numbers of Met residues, these results indicate a selective D1 turnover in both complexes. When we extended the pulse labeling time, radiolabeled D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 proteins accumulated primarily in RCC1 (Fig. 1C), whereas only a minority of the radiolabel accumulated in the dimeric RCC (Fig. 1A, RCC2). Also, two RCC-like complexes were detected at a molecular mass intermediary between monomeric and dimeric RCC (Fig. 1, C–E, vertical arrows). Also, in RCC1 radiolabel intensity decreased in CP47 and increased in D1 relative to CP43/D2 (Fig. 1, C and D). Because about the same number of Met residues are present in CP47/CP43/D2/D1 we concluded that turnover rates of proteins and accumulation into the RCC1 complex are regulated independently. By chasing the radiolabel with unlabeled Met, pD1 labeling in the free protein fraction decreased, whereas iD1 labeling disappeared in the RCC1 complex and decreased in the RC47 complex. However, iD1 labeling was maintained in the RCa and RCb complexes and some D1 accumulated in both complexes (Fig. 1C, iD1 and D1). Furthermore, no pD1 could be detected in any of the PSII complexes by gel blot analysis because iD1 was localized to the RC47, RCa, and RCb complexes (Fig. 1E). We therefore concluded that fast processing of pD1 paralleled formation of the reaction center, whereas slow processing of iD1 paralleled formation of RC47. Also, stable accumulation of D1 was only detected after assembly of the RC47 complex, indicating that binding of CP47 increased D1 stability (Fig. 1E). Hence, we concluded that reaction center complexes RCa and RCb are assembly transition intermediates for RC47 formation. During pulse labeling, radiolabel accumulation in CP47 was initially equally distributed between the 70- and 90-kDa region of the two-dimensional gel (CP47) and the RCC1 complex, whereas less label was found in the RC47 complex (Fig. 1B, CP47). Radiolabeled CP43 appeared in RCC1 and in two small complexes termed CP43a and CP43b, according to their decreasing molecular mass (Fig. 1B, CP43). During the chase treatment, radiolabel in CP43b preferentially shifted into CP43a and into the RCC1 complex indicating that CP43a is the direct precursor protein complex for assembly of RCC1. Furthermore, chase treatment of WT cells enabled us to clearly distinguish between D1 forms and non-PSII proteins (Fig. 1, C and D, asterisks).

https://openalex.org/W2140878835,"Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) is a key enzyme in the trans-sulfuration pathway. CSE uses L-cysteine as a substrate to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The CSE/H2S system has been shown to play an important role in regulating cellular functions in different systems. In the present study, we used CSE stably overexpressed HEK-293 cells to explore the effect of the CSE/H2S system on cell growth and proliferation. The overexpression of CSE resulted in increases in CSE mRNA levels, CSE proteins, and intracellular H2S production rates, as well as the inhibition of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. These effects were accompanied by a sustained ERK activation and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip/WAK-1. Blocking the action of ERK with U0126 inhibited the induction of p21Cip/WAK-1, suggesting that ERK activation functions upstream of p21Cip/WAK-1 activation to initiate the CSE overexpression-induced cell growth inhibition. The antiproliferative effect of CSE is likely mediated by endogenously produced H2S because the H2S scavenger methemoglobin (10 μm) significantly decreased the H2S production rate and reversed the antiproliferative effect afforded by CSE. Exogenous H2S (100 μm) also inhibited cell proliferation. However, the other CSE-catalyzed products, ammonium and pyruvate, failed to inhibit cell proliferation. Methemoglobin also abolished the inhibitory effect of exogenous H2S on cell proliferation. Moreover, exogenous H2S induced a sustained ERK and p21Cip/WAK-1 activation. These findings support the hypothesis that endogenously produced H2S may play a fundamental role in cell proliferation and survival.

Exogenous H2S (100 μm) also inhibited cell proliferation. However, the other CSE-catalyzed products, ammonium and pyruvate, failed to inhibit cell proliferation. Methemoglobin also abolished the inhibitory effect of exogenous H2S on cell proliferation. Moreover, exogenous H2S induced a sustained ERK and p21Cip/WAK-1 activation. These findings support the hypothesis that endogenously produced H2S may play a fundamental role in cell proliferation and survival. The endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its physiological functions, including membrane hyperpolarization and smooth muscle cell relaxation, place this gas in the family of gas transmitters, together with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide (1Wang R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 2Wang R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Two pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) 1The abbreviations used are: CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. (EC 4.4.1.1), are responsible for the endogenous production of H2S in mammalian tissues, which use L-cysteine as the main substrate (3Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol.

Cystathionine β-synthase is a predominant H2S-generating enzyme in the brain and nervous system (6Eto K. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and CSE is mainly expressed in liver, kidney, and vascular smooth muscles (7Barber T. Triguero A. Martinez-Lopez I. Torres L. Garcia C. Miralles V.J. Vina J.R. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Zhao W. Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Cystathionine β-synthase and CSE are important for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids (e.g. cystathionine), as well as the production of H2S, ammonium, and pyruvate from L-cysteine. H2S inhibits cell proliferation (9Valitutti S. Castellino F. Musiani P. Ann. Allergy. 1990; 65: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar) and induces cell death predominantly by an apoptotic mechanism in polymorphonuclear cells (10Mariggio M.A. Minunno V. Riccardi S. Santacroce R. De Rinaldis P. Fumarulo R. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1998; 20: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). H2S treatment has also been shown to lead to nasal lesions and olfactory epithelial necrosis (11Brenneman K.A. Meleason D.F. Sar M. Marshall M.W. James R.A. Gross E.A. Martin J.T. Dorman D.C. Toxicol. Pathol. 2002; 30: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, H2S induces serum-independent cell cycle entry in rat intestinal epithelial cells and increases the fraction of colonic mucosa cells in the S phase (12Eplancke B. Gaskins H.R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1310-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Hristl S.U. Eisner H.D. Dusel G. Kasper H. Scheppach W. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1996; 41: 2477-2481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the cellular consequences of an elevated CSE expression or about the associated increase in endogenously produced H2S. In the present study, we overexpressed the CSE gene using a highly effective expression system. The successful overexpression of CSE was confirmed by measuring the CSE protein contents, CSE mRNA expression level, and endogenous H2S production rate. Proliferation of the transfected HEK-293 cells was monitored. We determined whether the CSE overexpression-induced cellular changes were because of overproduced H2S. Finally, the effect of both the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21Cip/WAK-1 and the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on the CSE/H2S system was examined. Our findings support the hypothesis that endogenously produced H2S may play a fundamental role in cell proliferation and survival. Cell Culture and Measurement of H2S Production—HEK-293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. The cultured cells were subjected to gene transfection when they had grown to 70–80% confluence. The H2S production rate in CSE stably transfected HEK-293 cells was measured as described previously (8Zhao W. Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Cloning of CSE cDNA and Stable Transfection—PCR was used to amplify the open reading frame of CSE (GenBank™ accession number AY032875) from rat vascular tissues using the primers 5′-CGTCCCAGCATGCAGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-CAGTTATTCAGAAGGTCTGGCCC-3′. The amplified open reading frame of CSE was subcloned into TA cloning vector (PCR4-TOPO). Positive clone containing CSE open reading frame insert was sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the inserted CSE sequence. The constructs containing CSE cDNA were cleaved and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), which contained the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancers and the SV40 poly(A) signal. For stable transfection, the constructs were linearized with KpnI (MBI Fermentas) and then subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized constructs were mixed with a FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in a ratio of 1 μg to 3 μl in 100 μl of FBS-free minimal essential medium (14Cao K. Tang G. Hu D. Wang R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After incubating for 45 min at room temperature (20–22 °C), the mixture was added to HEK-293 cells in 2 ml of FBS-free minimal essential medium. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were trypsinized, counted, and replated at 1 × 105 cells/plate in 35-mm plates, which contained 500 μg/ml G418 for antibiotic selection. Mock (empty vector) transfection was also performed. In the pIRES2-EGFP vector, the EGFP gene (which encodes the enhanced green fluorescent protein) was expressed separately from the gene of interest and was used as a transfection marker. Non-transfected HEK-293 cells were included as the negative control for antibiotic selection. After 5 weeks of the antibiotic selective culturing, survival-transfected cells were harvested and grown to establish the sublines, which were subsequently examined for the presence of the CSE gene. Stable transfectants were used at passage numbers <15. Wild-type HEK-293 cells were maintained in identical conditions but without selection antibiotic G418 treatment. Western Immunoblotting—Cultured cells (3 × 106) were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer (0.5 m EDTA, 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 μg/ml antipain hydrochloride, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride hydrate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin hemisulfate, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm iodoacetamide). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (15Sun X. Cao K. Yang G. Huang Y. Hanna S.T. Wang R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The primary antibody dilutions were 1:1000 for phosphorylated or total ERK, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH -terminal kinase, 1:500 for p21Cip/WAF-1 and cyclin D1, and 1:5000 for β-actin. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used at 1:5000. The immunoreactions were visualized by ECL and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Scientific Imaging film, X-Omat Blue XB-1). Membranes were stripped by incubation in a buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. mRNA Collection and Reverse Transcription—Total cellular RNA from wild-type, mock, or CSE-transfected cells was harvested after the cells were plated for 48 h. Monolayers were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.6), and RNA was collected using TRIzol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Contaminated DNA was removed using the DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase using random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Controls without reverse transcriptase were used to check for genomic DNA contamination in each sample. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Real time PCR was performed in an iCycler iQ apparatus (Bio-Rad) associated with the iCycler optical system software (version 3.1) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. All PCRs were performed in a 20-μl volume using 96-well optical grade PCR plates and optical sealing tape. Negative controls for this experiment were samples without a template. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 90 s followed by 38 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 20 s. For quantification, the target gene was normalized to the internal standard gene β-actin. The primers of CSE (GenBank™ accession number AY032875) were 5′-AGCGATCACACCACAGACCAAG-3′ (sense, position 432–453) and 5′-ATCAGCACCCAGAGCCAAAGG-3′ (antisense, position 589–609). These primers produced a product of 178 bp. The primers of β-actin (Ambion) produced a product of 295 bp. A standard curve was constructed with a series of dilutions of total RNA (Ambion) transcribed to cDNA using the protocol outlined above to confirm the same amplifying efficiency in the PCR. A standard melting curve analysis was performed using a thermal cycling profile that began at 95 °C for 10 s, increased to 55 °C for 15 s, and then ramped to 95 °C in one-degree increments to confirm the absence of primer dimers. Product size was determined by running PCR products on a 1.8% agarose gel. Relative mRNA quantification was calculated by using the arithmatic formula “2-ΔΔCT” (16Saussoy P. Vaerman J.L. Straetmans N. Deneys V. Cornu G. Ferrant A. Latinne D. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Shu P.Y. Chang S.F. Kuo Y.C. Yueh Y.Y. Chien L.J. Sue C.L. Lin T.H. Huang J.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), where ΔCT is the difference between the threshold cycle of a given target cDNA and an endogenous reference cDNA. Thus, this value yields the amount of the target normalized to an endogenous reference. Measurement of Cellular Proliferation—Cell count was performed first to assay the cell growth curve in CSE-transfected HEK-293 cells. Briefly, an equal number of cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 35-mm Petri dishes, and then cells were counted daily using a hemocytometer. The medium was changed every 3 days. DNA synthesis was assessed by the level of [3H]thymidine incorporation. An equal number of cells seeded in the 24-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) were cultured in growth medium for 48 h. They were washed three times with serum-free medium and then incubated in the same medium for 24 h for synchronization. After the cells were stimulated with 10% FBS in minimal essential medium for 6 h, 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well in growth medium for another 6 h. The medium was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2. The cells were precipitated with 0.5 ml of 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, and then the precipitates were lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS, 0.1 N NaOH. Four-hundred microliters of cell solution were put into scintillation vials and mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS3801). Reagents and Chemicals—H2S stock solution was freshly prepared by directly bubbling distilled water with pure H2S gas (Praxair) to make the saturated H2S solution (0.09 m at 30 °C) (8Zhao W. Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). H2S stock solution was diluted to different concentrations in cell culture medium, and the pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.4. The CSE antibody was kindly provided by Dr. N. Nishi (Kagawa Medical School). The MAPK antibody, ERK/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor U0126, and p21Cip/WAK-1 antibody were obtained from New England Biolabs (Camarillo, CA). Cyclin D1 antibody was from Lab Vision Corporation (Fremont, CA). [3H]Thymidine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Methemoglobin, ammonium hydroxide, and sodium pyruvate were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was from Bio-Rad. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. and represent at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were made using the Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc analysis (Tukey test) where applicable. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Overexpression of CSE cDNA in HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells were transfected with a CSE cDNA/pIRES2-EGFP construct or an identical empty vector lacking a cDNA insert as a control (mock). The transfection of HEK-293 cells with CSE cDNA or the control empty vector did not change the morphological characteristics of the cell. In HEK-293 cells transfected with CSE cDNA or the control empty vector, green fluorescence emitted by green fluorescent protein was observed. In contrast, green fluorescence was not detectable in wild-type HEK-293 cells (data not shown). The expression of CSE was verified by Western blot analysis, real time PCR analysis, and the H2S production rate. Western blot and real time PCR analysis revealed that transfection of CSE cDNA, but not of the mock cDNA, resulted in significant increases in both CSE protein expression and CSE mRNA levels compared with wild-type HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Transfection of HEK-293 cells with CSE cDNA also resulted in a marked increase in the H2S production rate (1.51 ± 0.12 nmol/g/min) compared with mock-transfected cells (0.41 ± 0.06 nmol/g/min, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). Suppressed Proliferation and DNA Synthesis in CSE-transfected HEK-293 Cells—To determine whether overexpression of the CSE gene affects proliferation and DNA synthesis of HEK-293 cells, cell growth curves were constructed. Compared with mock-transfected or wild-type cells, HEK-293 cells transfected with CSE cDNA exhibited a significantly reduced cell growth rate on the second day. At the fourth day, the number of CSE-overexpressed cells was only 72.2 ± 2.8% of the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). An antiproliferative effect of CSE overexpression was also evidenced by the extent of [3H]thymidine incorporation. As shown in Fig. 2B, HEK-293 cells transfected with CSE cDNA had less [3H]thymidine incorporation (19,181 ± 405 cpm) than cells transfected with mock (28,075 ± 1748 cpm) or wild-type cells (30,121 ± 1115 cpm) (p < 0.05). Sustained Activation of MAPK and Up-regulation of p21Cip/WAK-1 by CSE Overexpression—The MAPK family, including ERK, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, plays an important regulatory role in the proliferation and differentiation of cells. Transfection of HEK-293 cells with CSE cDNA, but not the mock cDNA, resulted in a marked accumulation of phosphorylated ERK and p38 MAPK (Fig. 3A). Neither the phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase nor total amounts of MAPK were affected. Incubating cells with 10 μm U0126 or 20 μm SB203580 (the p38 MAPK inhibitor) for 24 h significantly decreased the expression of phosphorylated ERK and p38 MAPK (Fig. 3B). p21Cip/WAF-1 is a cdk inhibitory protein, and it can prevent cell cycle progression by directly binding with cyclin and cdk complexes or binding to a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (18Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 19Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Increased p21Cip/WAF-1 expression is an important indicator for MAPK-dependent cell growth arrest (20Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 21Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 22Hu P.P. Shen X. Huang D. Liu Y. Counter C. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35381-35387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of p21Cip/WAF-1 increased significantly in CSE-transfected HEK-293 cells (∼3-fold that in mock-transfected or wild-type cells). To verify the correlation of MAPK activation with CSE overexpression-mediated p21Cip/WAF-1 upregulation, we tested the effects of U0126 and SB203580 on the expression of p21Cip/WAF-1. After incubating cells with 10 μm U0126, the expression of p21Cip/WAF-1 in CSE-transfected HEK-293 cells decreased almost to the basal level, whereas SB203580 (20 μm) had little effect. This suggests that p21Cip/WAF-1 induction by CSE overexpression may result from activation of the ERK pathway. Cyclin D1 is an activator of cdk4 and cdk6, which limit the rate of cell cycle reentry (23Ullmannova V. Stockbauer P. Hradcova M. Soucek J. Haskovec C. Leuk. Res. 2003; 27: 1115-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). p21Cip/WAF-1 can inhibit cyclin D1 nuclear export by binding to Thr-286-phosphorylated cyclin D1, therefore preventing cyclin D1/CRM1 association (24Kobayashi T. Ikeno S. Hosokawa N. Uehara Y. Hori M. Destruxin E. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results showed that cyclin D1 expression was unchanged in all kinds of cells, and U0126 and SB203580 had little effect on cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 4). Inhibitory Effects of CSE Overexpression on Cell Proliferation Mainly Due to Endogenously Produced H2S—To determine the mechanism by which CSE overexpression inhibited cell growth, we assessed the effects of H2S, ammonium, and pyruvate, three products of CSE-catalyzed cysteine degradation, on cell growth. When confluent serum-starved wild-type HEK-293 cells were stimulated with 10% FBS in the presence of H2S (100 μm), DNA synthesis decreased significantly. However, 100 μm ammonium hydroxide and 100 μm sodium pyruvate failed to inhibit DNA synthesis (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we tested the effect of the H2S scavenger methemoglobin (1Wang R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 25Baumbach G.L. Sigmund C.D. Bottiglieri T. Lentz S.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) on CSE overexpression-mediated cell growth inhibition. As shown in Fig. 5B, methemoglobin at 10 μm partly but significantly reversed the antiproliferative effect of CSE (p < 0.05). Pretreating wild-type HEK-293 cells with 10 μm methemoglobin for 1 h prior to adding 100 μm H2S significantly abolished the antiproliferative effect of H2S (Fig. 5A). Decreased H2S production in CSE-overexpressed cells by methemoglobin also provided evidence that methemoglobin scavenged the endogenous H2S (Fig. 5C). To assess the role of exogenous H2S on MAPK and cell cycle protein expression, we tested the status of ERK and p21Cip/WAF-1 in wild-type HEK-293 cells after exposure to 100 μm H2S. The expression of ERK and p21Cip/WAF-1 increased after incubating wild-type HEK-293 cells with H2S for 2 h (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6), indicating that H2S likely mediates the antiproliferative effect of CSE.Fig. 6Exogenous H2S increases the ERK and p21Cip/WAK-1 activity. The quiescent wild-type HEK-293 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of H2S (100 μm) for the indicated times, and Western blot analysis was used to determine the activation of ERK (A) and p21Cip/WAK-1 (B). The histograms represent the ratio of phosphorylated ERK optical density to total ERK (A)orp21Cip/WAK-1 optical density to β-actin (B) from three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our present study demonstrated that the CSE expression level is an important regulatory element for cell growth. By increasing the endogenous production of H2S, the overexpression of CSE significantly inhibited cell proliferation. In this cascade of signaling transduction, ERK and p21Cip/WAF-1 were consequentially activated by H2S, leading to cell growth inhibition. CSE is a key enzyme of the trans-sulfuration pathway, which interconverts L-methionine and L-cysteine. It also uses L-cysteine as an alternative substrate to form H2S (4Erickson P.F. Maxwell I.H. Su L.J. Baumann M. Glode L.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme, CSE is expressed in a range of mammalian cells and tissues, and it seems to be the main H2S-forming enzyme in the liver, kidney, and cardiovascular system (7Barber T. Triguero A. Martinez-Lopez I. Torres L. Garcia C. Miralles V.J. Vina J.R. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Zhao W. Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Deficiency of H2S-producing enzymes results in some disorders such as homocystinuria, which are characterized by mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities, increased urine homocysteine, increased risks of thromboembolism, and early onset of atherosclerosis (9Valitutti S. Castellino F. Musiani P. Ann. Allergy. 1990; 65: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar, 25Baumbach G.L. Sigmund C.D. Bottiglieri T. Lentz S.R. Circ.

Blood. 2003; 101: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Many previous studies on H2S focused on the toxicological profile rather than the physiological function of the gas. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the biological functions of H2S, including hyperpolarization of cell membranes, relaxation of smooth muscle cells, and decreased neuronal excitability (1Wang R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 2Wang R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 6Eto K. Kimura H. J.

Pharmacol. 2003; 81: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Little is known about the modulatory effect of endogenous CSE/H2S on cell growth and proliferation. In the present study, we used CSE stably transfected HEK-293 cells to explore the effects of CSE overexpression on cell growth and proliferation. Our results indicate that the CSE overexpression increased intracellular H2S production, inhibition of cell proliferation, and DNA synthesis (Figs. 1 and 2). CSE induced the expression of cdk inhibitor p21Cip/WAF-1 following sustained ERK activity, suggesting a cell cycle arrest. The antiproliferative effect of CSE is likely mediated via the release of H2S because the H2S scavenger methemoglobin (1Wang R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 25Baumbach G.L. Sigmund C.D. Bottiglieri T. Lentz S.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) partly and significantly reversed the antiproliferative effect of CSE (Fig. 5B). Exogenous H2S alone also inhibited cell proliferation, evidenced by decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation. The other CSE products, ammonium and pyruvate, failed to inhibit cell proliferation. Pretreatment of wild-type HEK-293 cells with methemoglobin for 1 h prior to the addition of H2S abolished the antiproliferative effect of H2S (Fig. 5A). Moreover, exogenous H2S induced sustained ERK and p21Cip/WAF-1 activation (Fig. 6). These findings support the hypothesis that endogenously produced H2S plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival. The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade plays a crucial role in transducing extracellular signals into responses governing growth and differentiation. The ERK pathway is involved in the stimulation of cellular proliferation (29Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 30Leung D.W.

Yoshida S. Iwabe T. Terakawa N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), although MAPK-induced growth inhibition has also been reported (32Hirakawa T. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Martin S. Favot L. Matz R. Lugnier C. Andriantsitohaina R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that a sustained increase in ERK activity induced by CSE overexpression leads to inhibited cell growth (Fig. 3A). The seemingly conflicting results can partially be explained by the fact that the MAPK pathway plays roles in both progression and inhibition of cell proliferation (21Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 34Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The final cellular response (i.e. cell cycle arrest or cellular proliferation) to activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway depends on the strength and duration of the MAPK signal. Transient or cyclical activation may contribute to cell cycle progression, whereas sustained high levels of ERK may lead to cell growth inhibition. Because active MAPK accumulates in the nucleus, it has been suggested that the duration and magnitude of MAPK activation will direct qualitative changes in gene expression, which in turn will determine whether a cell re-enters the cell cycle, undergoes cell cycle arrest, or remains quiescent. Although p38 MAPK was also increased in CSE-transfected cells, it may not be involved in CSE overexpression-induced p21Cip/WAF-1 up-regulation (Figs. 3B and 4) because the inhibition of p38 activity by SB203580 did not change the expression of p21Cip/WAF-1. p21Cip/WAF-1 is one of the cdk inhibitory proteins, and it plays an important role in growth arrest, cellular differentiation, DNA repair, cell senescence, and apoptosis (35Dotto G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: 43-56PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Increased p21Cip/WAF-1 expression is also an important indicator for MAPK-dependent cell growth arrest (20Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 21Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell.

Investig. 1995; 96: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that the inhibition of growth by CSE overexpression in HEK-293 cells was accompanied by an induction of the cdk inhibitor p21Cip/WAF-1, which was dependent on the ERK activation (Fig. 4). Correlation between p21Cip/WAF-1 induction, prolonged ERK activation, and the inhibition of p21Cip/WAF-1 by U0126 confirmed that p21Cip/WAF-1 induction occurs after prolonged ERK activation. In the progression of the cell cycle, activation of cdks has been demonstrated (23Ullmannova V. Stockbauer P. Hradcova M. Soucek J. Haskovec C. Leuk. Res. 2003; 27: 1115-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of cdks is negatively regulated by cdk inhibitors such as p21Cip/WAF-1. p21Cip/WAF-1 has been shown to directly bind with cyclin, cdk complexes, and DNA polymerase δ cofactor, a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (18Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Blocking the activation of ERK blocked the induction of p21Cip/WAF-1 expression, suggesting that ERK activation is correlated with CSE overexpression-induced up-regulation of p21Cip/WAF-1 and cell growth inhibition. Several studies indicate that sustained ERK activation allows for the induction of cyclin D1 (20Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 21Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). p21Cip/WAF-1 can inhibit cyclin D1 activation and thereby prevent cyclin D1/CRM1 association (24Kobayashi T. Ikeno S. Hosokawa N. Uehara Y. Hori M. Destruxin E. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, our study demonstrated that cyclin D1 was not involved in CSE overexpression-induced cell growth inhibition. Although ERK and p21Cip/WAF-1 likely play roles in CSE overexpression-mediated cell growth inhibition, it is also possible that some other molecules that were not tested here are involved. Furthermore, the linkage between sustained ERK activation and expression of p21Cip/WAF-1 needs to be identified. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the first time that CSE regulates cell proliferation through a H2S-mediated phosphorylation of ERK and p21Cip/WAK-1. Collectively, the ability of the CSE/H2S system to inhibit cell growth suggests that genetic approaches to manipulate CSE expression and H2S production may provide a novel therapeutic avenue in the treatment of CSE/H2S disorder-related diseases."

Furthermore, red color appears to have evolved gradually by small incremental transitions."

To identify the abnormalities of hepatic energy generation that lead to steatosis during fasting, we studied metabolic fluxes in livers lacking hepatic cytosolic PEPCK by NMR using 2H and 13C tracers. After a 4-h fast, glucose production from glycogenolysis and conversion of glycerol to glucose remains normal, whereas gluconeogenesis from tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates was nearly absent. Upon an extended 24-h fast, livers that lack PEPCK exhibit both 2-fold lower glucose production and oxygen consumption, compared with the controls, with all glucose production being derived only from glycerol. The mitochondrial reduction-oxidation (red-ox) state, as indicated by the NADH/NAD+ ratio, is 5-fold higher, and hepatic TCA cycle intermediate concentrations are dramatically increased in the PEPCK null livers. Consistent with this, flux through the TCA cycle and pyruvate cycling pathways is 10- and 40-fold lower, respectively. Disruption of hepatic cataplerosis due to loss of PEPCK leads to the accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates and a nearly complete blockage of gluconeogenesis from amino acids and lactate (an energy demanding process) but intact gluconeogenesis from glycerol (which contributes to net NADH production).

Hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) 1The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; MAG, monoacetone glucose; PCA, perchloric acid; ACAC, acetoacetate; BHB, β-hydroxybutyrate; OAA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; red-ox, reduction-oxidation state. is a major control point for gluconeogenesis (1Hanson R.W.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9151-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), hyperinsulinemia, and increased glucose turnover (3Sun Y. Liu S. Ferguson S. Wang L. Klepcyk P. Yun J.S.

Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, the liver-specific deletion of cytosolic PEPCK yielded a phenotype that, except during fasting and exercise, was virtually indistinguishable from control mice (5She P. Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6She P. Burgess S.C. Shiota M. Flakoll P. Donahue E.P. Malloy C.R.

Even after a 24-h fast, when liver glycogen is depleted and flux through liver PEPCK should be essential to maintain plasma glucose, these animals are euglycemic and glucose turnover is normal. By using NMR spectroscopy and stable isotope tracers, we demonstrated that approximately ∼60% of whole body glucose production in liver-specific PEPCK knock-out animals is derived from lactate and alanine (6She P. Burgess S.C. Shiota M. Flakoll P. Donahue E.P. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggests that either an alternative route to glucose production that bypasses PEPCK in these livers exists or that the majority of whole body gluconeogenesis is extrahepatic (6She P. Burgess S.C. Shiota M. Flakoll P. Donahue E.P. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to the minimal impact that the absence of hepatic PEPCK has on systemic glucose kinetics, these mice develop dramatic hepatic steatosis after fasting (6She P. Burgess S.C.

Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) even though enzymes of the TCA cycle and β-oxidation are up-regulated (5She P. Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in liver tissue. This observation suggests that cataplerosis from the TCA cycle is tightly linked to oxidation of substrate in the TCA cycle (7Magnuson M.A. She P. Shiota M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32485-32488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present work was to clarify the means by which PEPCK null livers contribute to glucose production and to determine how diminished PEPCK activity affects hepatic energy homeostasis. Although the lipid accumulation must be due to an imbalance of fatty acid uptake, β-oxidation (8Bremer J. Wojtczak A.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Scand. 1973; 27: 2893-2901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or lipoprotein export (11Venkatesan S. Ward R.J. Peters T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 960: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we sought to determine exactly how these processes are disturbed. Ideally, such investigations would be done in vivo, but such studies are complicated by the fact that other organs are known to contribute to gluconeogenesis in these animals (6She P. Burgess S.C. Shiota M. Flakoll P. Donahue E.P. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, an isolated perfused liver preparation was chosen for these experiments to remove the influence of other organs and neurohumoral signals from liver function. As previous results (5She P. Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) indicated a dramatic difference in metabolism depending on nutritional state, we chose to compare metabolism in livers from mice after a 24-h fast versus a short term 4-h fast. Here we used NMR and a combination of 2H and 13C tracers, isotopomer analysis, and metabolite assays to investigate the various pathways summarized in Fig. 1. The data provide evidence for near complete impairment of gluconeogenesis from TCA cycle cataplerosis, a reduced mitochondrial red-ox state, build-up of certain TCA cycle intermediates, and a dramatic inhibition of TCA cycle activity in the liver of PEPCK null mice. Chemicals—[U-13C3]Propionate (99%) and 2H2O (99%) were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA). DSC-18 solid phase extraction gel and other common chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Animals—Liver-specific PEPCK knock-out mice, pcklox/lox/AlbCre (PEPCK null), and littermate controls, pcklox/lox (control), were generated as described previously (5She P. Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 3–5-Month-old mice weighing 25–30 g were maintained on standard laboratory chow. Prior to removal of livers for perfusion, animals were either fasted for 24 h (long term or LTfasted) or fasted for 12 h, fed a liquid diet of Ensure™ for 2 h, followed by a 4-h fast (short term or STfasted). Mice were fed in this manner to synchronize nutritional status by ensuring a 2-h feeding period, followed by a standard fast. The liquid diet also minimizes residual stomach contents. 2C. Storey, A. Milde, and S. C. Burgess, unpublished observations. Liver Perfusion Experiments—All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (Ketaset, Aveco, Fort Dodge, IA), and the livers were isolated and perfused as described previously (12Colet J.-M. Muller R.N. Magn. Reson. Mat. Phys. Biol. Med. 1994; 2: 303-305Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but with some modifications. Briefly, a mid-line laparotomy was performed to expose the liver and portal circulatory system. The portal vein was cannulated, and heparin (50 IU) was injected into the portal vein to prevent the formation of blood clots. The hepatic vein and inferior vena cava were dissected, and the perfusate flow through the portal vein was started simultaneously with a peristaltic pump at 8 ml/min. The liver was carefully removed from the carcass and suspended in a container of effluent perfusate, which was not re-circulated but constantly siphoned off and stored on ice for the duration of the experiment. The perfusate was composed of Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 1.5 mm lactate, 0.15 mm pyruvate, 0.25 mm glycerol, 0.2 mm octanoate, 0.5 mm [U-13C3]propionate, and 3% v/v D2O. The livers were perfused for 60 min providing a total of 480 ml of perfusate. For a few livers, perfusions were continued for 2 h to confirm that isotopic steady state had been reached. After perfusion, livers were freeze-clamped using aluminum tongs cooled to –80 °C and stored in a –80 °C freezer until use. Fractions of perfusate were collected every 15 min for the assay of glucose production and oxygen consumption. pO2 was determined on afferent and efferent perfusate by using a blood gas analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA), and oxygen consumption was calculated as detailed previously (13Neely J.R. Liebermeister H. Battersby E.J. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1967; 212: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Glucose was assayed by enzyme-coupled reactions (14Kunst A. Draeger B. Ziegenhorn J. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VCH Verlagsgesllschaft, Weinheim, Germany1984: 163-172Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—After completion of the experiment, the perfusate was frozen until it was worked up completely. The perfusate was evaporated under vacuum at 50 °C. The resulting material was resuspended in 10 ml of 90:10 methanol/water and stirred for 10 min. The solution was decanted, and the step was repeated three times with all fractions combined and dried by evaporation under vacuum. The resulting partially de-salted material was dissolved in a minimum volume of water (about 5 ml) and passed through a column containing 20 ml of Amberlite IRA-67 anion exchange and 20 ml of Dowex 50W-X8-200 cation exchange resins (prepared as described in the product literature) in series. The glucose was removed with 60 ml of water; the pH was adjusted to 6–7, and the sample was lyophilized and stored until further workup. Amino acids were isolated from some perfusate samples (15Sherry A.D. Zhao P. Wiethoff A.J. Jeffrey F.M. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H591-H599PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate alternative carbon disposal by the livers. NMR Analysis—Purified glucose was converted to the 1,2-isopropylidene glucofuranose derivative (monoacetone glucose (MAG)) as described previously (16Burgess S.C. Weis B. Jones J.G. Smith E. Merritt M.E. Margolis D. Dean Sherry A. Malloy C.R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 312: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MAG samples were dissolved in 160 μl of high pressure liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile with 5–10 μl of water and transferred to a 3-mm NMR tube. Deuterium NMR spectra of MAG were collected using a 14.1-tesla Varian INOVA spectrometer and 3-mm broadband probe, tuned to 92-MHz as described previously (17Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Burgess S.C. Nuss M. Chandramouli V. Hardin D.S. Rice M. Landau B.R. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A 90° pulse was applied, and the signal was acquired over 1 s (sweep width = 1000 Hz) with no further delay. 2H NMR spectra were typically signal-averaged for 4 h at 50 °C. 40 μl of deuterated acetonitrile was added to the NMR sample for locking purposes, and 13C NMR spectra of MAG were collected as described previously (17Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the same spectrometer and probe tuned to 150-MHz. A 50° pulse, acquisition time of 1.5 s, and no further delay times were found to give the highest sensitivity for the MAG carbons (19Jin E.S. Jones J.G. Merritt M. Burgess S.C. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 13C NMR spectra of PCA extracts of the liver were recorded using a 45° pulse, 1.5-s acquisition time, and 1.5-s delay. Broad band 1H decoupling was accomplished using the standard WALTZ-16 technique. 2H and 13C spectra were analyzed using the curve-fitting routine supplied with NUTS PC-based NMR spectral analysis program (Acorn NMR Inc., Freemont, CA). Metabolic Profile—During the deuterated water experiment, the hydrogens attached to the carbon backbone of newly released glucose become enriched with 2H at specific locations that depend upon the synthetic pathway (Fig. 1). 2H enrichment of MAG positions H2, H5, and H6S (as evaluated by 2H NMR) were used to determine the origin of glucose. The 1-H2/H5 ratio, has been shown to represent the fraction of glucose originating from glycogenolysis (20Schumann W.C. Gastaldelli A. Chandramouli V. Previs S.F. Pettiti M. Ferrannini E. Landau B.R.

Investig. 1996; 98: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Additionally, enrichment at the H6S (H6S/H2) position reflects gluconeogenesis from carbon units originating from the TCA cycle (oxaloacetate pool) (22Kuwajima M. Golden S. Katz J. Unger R. Foster D. McGarry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2632-2637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Landau B.R. Wahren J. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Ekberg K. Kalhan S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The difference in the H5 and H6S enrichment ([H5-H6]/H2) reflects gluconeogenesis from substrates feeding the gluconeogenic pathway above the TCA cycle (presumably glycerol) (17Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jin E.S. Jones J.G. Merritt M. Burgess S.C. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Pathways intersecting the TCA cycle were evaluated by 13C isotopomer analysis of glucose (i.e. MAG) or glutamate (24Jones J.G. Naidoo R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Cottam G.L. Malloy C.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 13C NMR multiplets in glucose or glutamate generated by the tracer [U-13C3]propionate were evaluated to determine flux (relative to TCA cycle flux) through anaplerosis/cataplerosis and pyruvate cycling (Fig. 1). Together the 2H and 13C data were integrated with total glucose production to determine TCA cycle flux (i.e. citrate synthase activity) as described previously (17Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jin E.S. Jones J.G. Merritt M. Burgess S.C. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Liver Tissue Analysis—Frozen liver samples were pulverized to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle cooled with liquid N2. The powder was agitated in 5 ml of ice cold 3% PCA in a 20-ml centrifuge tube. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The liquid was decanted, and the plug was rinsed with a small volume of PCA that was combined with the decanted portion. The extract was neutralized to pH 7 with KOH, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, decanted, and then lyophilized. The extract was dissolved in 600 μlof 2H2O for 13C NMR isotopomer analysis of liver glutamate (24Jones J.G. Naidoo R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Cottam G.L. Malloy C.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The spectra of the control and null livers were also used to qualitatively observe the pool sizes of various metabolites that become 13C-enriched as a consequence of [U-13C3]propionate metabolism. About 100 mg of the liver tissue was saved for determination of mitochondrial red-ox state by analysis of the red-ox pair acetoacetate (ACAC) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) (25Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). The tissue was extracted, as above, with 600 μl of 3% PCA. After centrifugation, the extract was neutralized with 80 μl of concentrated KH2PO4. The samples were kept on ice, and ACAC and BHB were immediately evaluated by 1H NMR (26Chung Y. Jue T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11159-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 400 μl of the extract was transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube, and an additional 100 μl of a 0.5 mm sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate standard in 99% 2H2O was added. 1024 transients were collected with a 90° pulse width and 3-s acquisition time. Concentrations were determined with external standards of BHB referenced to the same internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate standard. With the sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate resonance set to 0 ppm, the methyl resonances of BHB and ACAC had chemical shifts of 1.20 and 2.27 ppm, respectively. The limit of detection for this technique was about 4 μm. The NAD+/NADH ratio was determined by assuming an equilibrium constant of 4.93 × 10–2 for the β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase reaction (25Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Statistical Methods—All data are reported as the average ± S.D. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, assuming unequal variances. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. A major advantage of using an isolated perfused mouse liver preparation is that tissue oxygen consumption and glucose production can be directly monitored as often as necessary. In experiments described below, oxygen consumption and glucose output were monitored every 15 min. The first 15-min perfusion period yielded sporadic values for oxygen consumption and glucose output, but the last 3 periods provided consistent results. Thus, glucose production and oxygen consumption from the last 3 periods (totaling 45 min) were averaged for each liver. Oxygen consumption (Fig. 2) was lower in livers from PEPCK null mice compared with littermate controls under both STfasted (controlled short term fast, see “Materials and Methods”) and LTfasted (long term fast, see “Materials and Methods”) conditions (p < 0.02, p < 0.03 respectively). Oxygen consumption was also lower in STfastedversus LTfasted livers from both null and control animals. Glucose Production—Glucose production was twice as high in control livers versus PEPCK null livers in LTfasted conditions and also tended to be higher in the STfasted condition (Fig. 3). In general, livers from STfasted mice had higher glucose output than livers from LTfasted mice regardless of genotype. Glucose production may have contributions from glycogen stores (i.e. glycogenolysis) or from gluconeogenesis. The carbon supply for gluconeogenesis can be provided from substrates such as glycerol that feed directly into the triose pool (GNGglycerol) or from substrates such as lactate, pyruvate, or amino acids that must undergo anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate (OAA) followed by cataplerosis via PEPCK to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as the first steps of glucose synthesis (GNGPEP). The sources of glucose in this study were elucidated by using the deuterated water method (17Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Burgess S.C. Nuss M. Chandramouli V. Hardin D.S. Rice M. Landau B.R. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal.

Metabolism. 2001; 50: 47-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This technique most often uses mass spectrometry as the analytical tool but has been shown to work equally well when monitored by 2H NMR (18Burgess S.C. Nuss M. Chandramouli V. Hardin D.S. Rice M. Landau B.R. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows examples of 2H NMR spectra of MAG derived from glucose generated by livers of control and PEPCK null mice. The spectrum of MAG from the PEPCK null liver is clearly lacking substantial 2H in the H6 positions compared with the control. Because chemical exchange at the H6R and H6S occur at the level of alanine aminotransferase and fumarase, respectively (23Landau B.R. Wahren J. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Ekberg K. Kalhan S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the low enrichment at these sites reflect severely limited gluconeogenesis supplied by cataplerotic flux from the TCA cycle. This is in agreement with the expected phenotype of a liver lacking PEPCK. These 2H NMR data were used to determine the contribution of PEP (formed from lactate or amino acids) to glucose production (i.e. GNGPEP). GNGPEP was lower by 11-fold in PEPCK null livers compared with controls under STfasted conditions (Fig. 3A) and 18-fold under LTfasted (Fig. 3B) conditions.Fig. 4Deuterium NMR spectra of MAG derived from glucose produced by LTfasted control (top) and PEPCK null (bottom) livers. Peak areas correspond to the relative deuterium enrichment of the seven hydrogen positions of glucose. H2, H5, and H6S enrichments are diagnostic of glycogenolysis (1-H5/H2), GNGglycerol ((H5-H6S)/H2)), and GNGPEP (1-(H5-H6S)/H2). The diagram shows how H6S enrichment occurs during the fumarase in the TCA cycle but that those intermediates cannot enter the gluconeogenic reaction pathways in the PEPCK null livers, resulting in low H6S enrichment in glucose produced from PEPCK null livers. Note that enrichment at the H6R position occurs during the pyruvate-alanine equilibrium catalyzed by alanine aminotransferase and is also very low in glucose from PEPCK null livers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although gluconeogenesis due to cataplerosis from the TCA cycle is insignificant in PEPCK null livers, gluconeogenesis from glycerol (GNGglycerol) was maintained. Under STfasted conditions, GNGglycerol was significantly higher in control livers (0.61 μmol/min/g) than in null livers (0.31 μmol/min/g) (Fig. 3A). There was no significant difference in GNGglycerol under LTfasted conditions between control livers (0.54 μmol/min/g) and PEPCK null livers (0.37 μmol/min/g) (Fig. 3B). Whereas GNGglycerol is less or equal in PEPCK null livers compared with controls, this source represented 92% of the glucose produced in the null liver compared with only 53% in the control livers. This result is in agreement with our earlier observation that the PEPCK null liver maintains its capacity to make glucose from glycerol (6She P. Burgess S.C. Shiota M. Flakoll P. Donahue E.P. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Glycogenolysis was low in livers of both PEPCK null and control mice in the LTfasted state (Fig. 3B). In contrast, PEPCK null and control livers showed substantial and equal rates of glycogenolysis, 0.69 and 0.73 μmol/min/g, respectively, under STfasted conditions (Fig. 3A). Whereas absolute glycogenolysis was about the same in null and control livers, glycogen contributed a larger percentage of the glucose produced by null livers (68%) than control livers (49%) in the STfasted state. TCA Cycle Associated Pathways—Gluconeogenesis is intimately linked to the TCA cycle by both energy demand and substrate supply. To evaluate potential differences in TCA cycle fluxes, [U-13C3]propionate was used as a vehicle to deliver a 13C tracer into the TCA cycle via succinyl-CoA (28Sherry A.D. Sumegi B. Miller B. Cottam G.L. Gavva S. Jones J.G. Malloy C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6268-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The result is formation of multiple positional isomers of labeled intermediates commonly referred to as 13C isotopomers. The population of groups of 13C isotopomers is reflected by multiplets due to spin-spin coupling between adjacent 13C nuclei (24Jones J.G. Naidoo R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Cottam G.L. Malloy C.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in all metabolites associated with the TCA cycle, and the relative areas of these multiplets is determined by the activity of pathways that intersect in the TCA cycle (e.g. citrate synthase, anaplerosis/cataplerosis, pyruvate cycling, and gluconeogenesis) (24Jones J.G. Naidoo R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Cottam G.L. Malloy C.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The combined information reported by the 2H and 13C NMR spectra plus absolute glucose production rates may then be used to determine absolute flux through PEPCK, pyruvate cycling (OAA → PEP → pyruvate → OAA or malate → pyruvate → OAA) and the TCA cycle (17Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jin E.S. Jones J.G. Merritt M. Burgess S.C. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fluxes Relative to TCA Cycle Turnover—13C NMR spectra of MAG from effluent glucose synthesized by control and PEPCK null livers are shown in Fig. 5A. The C2 resonance of MAG from control livers showed multiplets typical of cataplerosis of TCA cycle intermediates into glucose. In contrast, the 13C spectrum of MAG derived from PEPCK null livers was almost devoid of multiplets, consistent with a lack of gluconeogenesis from TCA cycle intermediates. The low levels of multiplets in the C2 resonance of MAG from PEPCK null livers precluded a determination of anaplerotic/cataplerotic, gluconeogenic, and pyruvate cycling fluxes in the usual way (24Jones J.G. Naidoo R. Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Cottam G.L. Malloy C.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, given that glucose and glutamate share the common TCA cycle intermediate, OAA, we turned our attention to analysis of the multiplets in the C2 resonance of liver glutamate (17Jones J.G.

https://openalex.org/W1975809719,"Previously, D2 dopamine receptors (D2 DARs) have been shown to undergo G-protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation in an agonist-specific fashion. We have now investigated the ability of the second messenger-activated protein kinases, protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC), to mediate phosphorylation and desensitization of the D2 DAR. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the D2 DAR and then treated with intracellular activators and inhibitors of PKA or PKC. Treatment with agents that increase cAMP, and activate PKA, had no effect on the phosphorylation state of the D2 DAR, suggesting that PKA does not phosphorylate the D2 DAR in HEK293T cells. In contrast, cellular treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in D2 DAR phosphorylation. The phosphorylation was specific for PKC as the PMA effect was mimicked by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, but not by 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, active and inactive, phorbol diesters, respectively. The PMA-mediated D2 DAR phosphorylation was completely blocked by co-treatment with the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide II, and augmented by co-transfection with PKCβI. In contrast, PKC inhibition had no effect on agonist-promoted phosphorylation, suggesting that PKC is not involved in this response. PKC phosphorylation of the D2 DAR was found to promote receptor desensitization as reflected by a decrease in agonist potency for inhibiting cAMP accumulation. Most interestingly, PKC phosphorylation also promoted internalization of the D2 DAR through a β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathway, a response not usually associated with PKC phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments resulted in the identification of two domains of PKC phosphorylation sites within the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Both of these domains are involved in regulating sequestration of the D2 DAR, whereas only one domain is involved in receptor desensitization. These results indicate that PKC can mediate phosphorylation of the D2 DAR, resulting in both functional desensitization and receptor internalization.

Sheffler D.J. Roth B.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4867-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Wise A. Jupe S.C. Rees S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 43-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Most cells maintain homeostatic control of their responsiveness to signals through regulating the expression and functional activity of their cell surface GPCRs. One widely studied form of GPCR regulation is that of agonist-induced desensitization. In this process, activation of the GPCR by an agonist also triggers a sequence of events that results in the dampening of the receptor-mediated signal. The mechanisms associated with this “homologous” form of desensitization have been most thoroughly investigated for the β2-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylyl cyclase system (3Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 4Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the following paradigm. Agonist occupancy of the receptor promotes its phosphorylation by a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family leading to the binding of an arrestin-like protein, ultimately resulting in uncoupling of the receptor from its cognate G-protein and decreased functional signaling. The binding of an arrestin-like molecule also promotes internalization of the receptor through clathrin-coated pits into an endosomal compartment where it may be de-phosphorylated and recycled to the cell surface or degraded via a lysosomal pathway. Although in many instances this desensitization paradigm has been shown to be operative for other G-protein-coupled receptors, recent studies have suggested that there may be significant exceptions and variations to this general scheme.Much less is known about “heterologous” forms of regulation in which activation of one GPCR, or other receptor system(s), may lead to the desensitization of multiple unrelated receptors in the same cell. Evidence to date suggests that heterologous regulation of receptor-mediated signaling pathways frequently involves phosphorylation of various signaling components by second messenger-regulated protein kinases that are activated by the initial signal (4Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 6Hosey M.M. Am. J.

Typically, phosphorylation of GPCRs by second messenger activated kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA) or C (PKC) has been suggested to dampen the ability of the receptor to couple to G-proteins and elicit a response, although precise mechanistic details are lacking. It is highly likely that heterologous forms of desensitization may play a critical role in fine-tuning GPCR responses in cells such as neurons that may concurrently receive numerous hormonal or neurotransmitter signals.Dopamine receptors (DARs) are members of the GPCR superfamily and consist of five structurally distinct subtypes (8Neve K.A. Neve R.L. Neve K.A. Neve R.L. The Dopamine Receptors. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 27-76Crossref Google Scholar). These can be divided into two subgroups on the basis of their structure and pharmacological and transductional properties. The first subgroup, termed “D1-like” comprises the D1 and D5 DARs that stimulate adenylyl cyclase and raise intracellular levels of cAMP. The second DAR subgroup includes the D2, D3, and D4 receptors and is termed “D2-like.” The D2-like DARs are coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase as well as the modulation of potassium and calcium ion channels. As with other GPCRs, DARs are subject to a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms, which can either positively or negatively modulate their expression and functional activity (9Sibley D.R. Neve K.A. Neve K.A. Neve R.L. The Dopamine Receptors. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 383-424Crossref Google Scholar).The mechanisms underlying various forms of DAR regulation have only begun to be elucidated. The greatest information has been derived from studies using the D1 DAR, which appears to be phosphorylated and internalized in a GRK-dependent fashion upon agonist activation, although some notable differences from the scheme described above exist (10Gardner B. Liu Z.F. Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Chaar Z.Y. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7999-8010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies of the D2 DAR have revealed that regulation of this receptor is extremely complex with agonist activation variably resulting in functional desensitization, sensitization, receptor up- or down-regulation, or no effect at all (reviewed in Ref. 9Sibley D.R. Neve K.A. Neve K.A. Neve R.L. The Dopamine Receptors. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 383-424Crossref Google Scholar). Given that the D2 DAR is the primary target for all known antipsychotic drugs (antagonists) and drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (agonists), more information concerning the regulatory mechanisms for this receptor may lead to improved therapeutics for treating D2 DAR-related diseases (16Kapur S. Mamo D. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 27: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 17Noble E.P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 116: 103-125Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Recent information has, in fact, suggested that the D2 DAR is a substrate for GRKs in cellular expression systems and that GRK-mediated phosphorylation promotes receptor internalization (18Ito K. Haga T. Lameh J. Sadee W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

In contrast, little information is available concerning phosphorylation and regulation of the D2 DAR by second messenger-activated protein kinases, although earlier studies have suggested potential roles for PKA and PKC (20Cubeddu L.X.

In our present study, we have now investigated phosphorylation of the D2 DAR by second messenger-activated protein kinases, and we demonstrate that PKC phosphorylates the D2 DAR on multiple sites within two domains of the third intracellular loop. This PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the D2 DAR was demonstrated to promote both functional desensitization and internalization of the receptor protein via a β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—HEK293-tsa201 (HEK293T) cells (25Heinzel S.S.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. HEK293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Clontech). Cells were seeded in 100- or 150-mm plates, and transfection was carried out at ∼50% confluency according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 18 h of transfection, the transfection media were replaced with fresh media, and the cells were divided for subsequent experiments.Whole-cell Phosphorylation Assays—Metabolic labeling of cells and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the D2L DAR was carried out as described previously (10Gardner B. Liu Z.F. Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with pSF-D2L using the calcium-phosphate method. One day after transfection, cells were seeded at 1–1.5 × 106 per well of a poly(D)-lysine-coated 6-well plate for phosphorylation assay and ∼2 × 106 cells on a 100-mm dish for radioligand binding assay to quantify the level of receptor expression. The next day, the cells were washed with Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) and incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Media were removed and replaced with 1 ml of fresh media supplemented with 200 μCi/ml [32P]H3PO4. After 45 min at 37 °C, the cells were then challenged with 1 μm PMA or various drugs. Cells were then transferred to ice, washed twice with ice-cold EBSS, and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) + 150 mm NaCl supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors (40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF). The samples were cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and the protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). The level of D2 DAR expression for each transfection was quantified via radioligand binding assays using the cells from the same transfection. After receptor/protein quantification, equal amounts of receptor protein were then transferred to fresh tubes with 40 μl of washed M2-agarose and incubated overnight with mixing at 4 °C. The samples were then washed once with solubilization buffer and 500 mm NaCl, once with solubilization buffer and 150 mm NaCl, and once with Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 1 h at 37 °C before being resolved by 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. After developing, the band intensity was quantitated by LabWorks™ software (UVP Inc., Upland, CA).Intact Cell [3H]Sulpiride Binding—HEK293T cells expressing rat D2L DAR were seeded 1 day after transfection at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in poly(D)-lysine-coated 24-well plates. The following day, cells were incubated in the absence (control) and presence of 1 μm PMA in DMEM for 2 h. Stimulation was terminated by quickly cooling the plates on ice and washing the cells three times with ice-cold EBSS. Cells were then incubated with 0.5 ml of [3H]sulpiride in EBSS (final concentration, 6.4 nm)at4 °Cfor3h30 min. For saturation binding assays, cells were incubated with 0.2–30 nm [3H]sulpiride. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 5 μm (+)-butaclamol. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold EBSS, and 0.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100 was added. Samples were mixed with 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture and counted with a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter.Membrane [3H]Methylspiperone Binding—HEK293T cells were harvested by incubation with 5 mm EDTA in EBSS and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 4 °C; 5 mm MgCl2) and were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 34,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The membrane suspension was then added to assay tubes containing [3H]methylspiperone in a final volume of 1.0 ml. (+)-Butaclamol was added at the final concentration of 3 μm to determine nonspecific binding. The assay tubes were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h, and the reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Radioactivity bound to the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.Determination of cAMP Production—HEK293T cells were seeded into poly(D)-lysine-coated 24-well plates 1 day before the assay at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. To assess the effect of PMA, the cultures were first incubated for 10 min in the absence (control) and presence of 1 μm PMA in DMEM. Subsequently, the cells were washed once with pre-warmed EBSS. For the control group, the cells were further incubated with various concentrations of dopamine in a total volume of 0.4 ml at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 3 μm forskolin, 30 μm Ro-20-1724 (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), 0.2 mm sodium metabisulfite (to prevent oxidation of dopamine), and 10 μm propranolol (to block endogenous β-adrenergic receptors) in 20 mm HEPES-buffered DMEM. For the PMA-treated group, the cells were incubated with same composition of buffer as in the control group except for containing 1 μm PMA. The supernatant was aspirated, and perchloric acid (3%, 200 μl/well) was added. After incubating on ice for 30 min, 80 μl of 15% KHCO3 was added to the wells, and the plates were further incubated for 10 min. The plates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,300 × g. Supernatant from each well was used for cAMP radioassay (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA).Data Analysis—All binding assays were routinely performed in triplicate and were repeated three to four times. Cyclic AMP experiments were performed in duplicate and were repeated three to four times. Estimation of the radioligand binding parameters, KD and Bmax, as well as the EC50 values for dopamine inhibition of cAMP accumulation were calculated using the GraphPad Prizm curve-fitting program. The curves presented throughout this paper, representing the best fits to the data, were generated using this software program as well.RESULTSPKC-mediated Phosphorylation of D2 DARs in HEK293T Cells—As an initial approach to investigating the role of second messenger-activated protein kinases in D2 DAR phosphorylation, we treated transiently transfected HEK293T cells with various activators and inhibitors of PKA and PKC (Fig. 1). The major phosphorylated protein in FLAG-tagged D2 DAR-expressing cells runs as a broad band of 60–85 kDa and is not present in immunoprecipitates of untransfected cells (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 1A, the D2 DAR is phosphorylated under basal conditions, and treatment of the cells with PMA, a phorbol ester that directly activates PKC, increases the phosphate content of the D2 DAR by ∼3-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). Most interestingly, treatment of the cells with bisindolylmaleimide II (BIMII), an inhibitor of PKC, decreases the phosphorylation state of the D2 DAR by about 50% (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, cellular treatment with agents that lead to PKA activation, including forskolin, which raises intracellular cAMP levels, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′,5′ cyclic AMP-cAMP, a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, have no effect on D2 DAR phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, treatment with H89, a PKA inhibitor, does not affect the phosphorylation state of the D2 DAR (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggest that PKC activation promotes D2 DAR phosphorylation and that the basal receptor phosphorylation might be partially explained by constitutive PKC phosphorylation. The phosphorylation was specific for PKC, as the PMA effect was mimicked by PDBu but not by the biologically inactive phorbol ester 4αPDD (Fig. 1C).Agonist activation of the D2 DAR has also been shown to promote its phosphorylation, an effect that is known to involve G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (18Ito K. Haga T. Lameh J. Sadee W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because in some cells D2 DARs can stimulate phospholipase C-β to elevate intracellular calcium and diacylglycerol levels through activation of G-protein βγ subunits (28Hernandez-Lopez S. Tkatch T. Perez-Garci E. Galarraga E. Bargas J. Hamm H. Surmeier D.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8987-8995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vallar L. Muca C. Magni M. Albert P. Bunzow J. Meldolesi J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10320-10326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that agonist-induced D2 DAR phosphorylation at least partly involves PKC. To investigate whether PKC-mediated phosphorylation is involved in the agonist-induced D2 DAR phosphorylation, we incubated the cells with the PKC inhibitor BIMII before and during dopamine treatment. As shown in Fig. 2, dopamine-induced D2 DAR phosphorylation was not affected by BIMII treatment, but PMA-stimulated D2 DAR phosphorylation was totally abolished by the PKC inhibitor. Agonist activation using dopamine resulted in a doubling of the phosphorylation state of the D2 DAR in both the absence or presence of BIMII (Fig. 2). Overall, this suggests that PKC is not involved in homologous phosphorylation of the D2 DAR but may occur heterologously through the activation of Gq-linked or other receptors that lead to PKC activation.Fig. 2The effect of PKC inhibition on agonist- and PMA-stimulated D2 DAR phosphorylation. Whole-cell phosphorylation assays were performed as described in Fig. 1. HEK293T cells were incubated with the indicated agents for 20 min. For PKC inhibition, the cells were preincubated with 10 μm BIMII for 20 min prior to the addition of additional agents. Following solubilization, the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described under “Experimental Procedures” and resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. A, representative autoradiogram is shown. The extent of receptor phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. The treatment conditions are as shown in the histogram below.

Fig. 3, A and B, shows that in M1 receptor-transfected, but not in mock-transfected, cells, treatment with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol results in a 2-fold increase in D2 DAR phosphorylation. These results show that activation of PKC through a Gq-coupled receptor pathway can lead to phosphorylation of the D2 DAR.Fig. 3The effect of Gq-coupled receptor activation or overexpressing various PKC isoforms on basal and PMA-induced D2 DAR phosphorylation. Cells were transfected with pSF-D2L along with pcDNA (empty vector) or mouse M1 muscarinic receptor cDNA or various PKC expression constructs. Whole-cell phosphorylation assays, autoradiography, and quantification were performed as described in Fig. 1.

It has been shown that HEK293 cells abundantly express the μ and ζ isoforms of PKC and have moderate levels of the βI isoform (31Wagey R. Hu J. Pelech S.L. Raymond L.A. Krieger C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To elucidate which PKC isoform may be involved in D2 DAR phosphorylation, we overexpressed several PKC isoforms with the D2 DAR, and we examined their effects on receptor phosphorylation. Co-transfection of PKCβI increased basal and PMA-stimulated D2 DAR phosphorylation, whereas co-transfection of PKCδ, PKCμ, or PKCζ did not change D2 DAR phosphorylation compared with mock (empty pcDNA vector) transfections (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, we observed that cellular treatment with the PKCβ isoform-specific inhibitor, LY333531 (32Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Gonzalez C.M. Heath W.F. McDonald J.H. II I Neel D.A. Rito C.J.

According to sequence homology to yeast prototypes, known mammalian HDACs have been grouped into three classes (2Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell.

Among class II members, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 constitute a subclass (IIa), whereas HDAC6 and HDAC10 form class IIb. It is well established now that class IIa members are enzymatic transcriptional corepressors whose functions are regulated by nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (5Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G.

Inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export results in accumulation of murine HDAC6 (mHDAC6) in the nucleus (23Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 747-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), so its cytoplasmic localization may be regulated. Different from the Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and murine orthologs, human HDAC6 (hHDAC6) possesses eight consecutive Ser-Glu-containing tetradecapeptide (SE14) repeats between the second deacetylase domain and the C-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (11Bertos N.R. Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Here we report that the cytoplasmic localization of hHDAC6 is resistant to treatment with leptomycin B (LMB), demonstrate that the SE14 repeat domain is responsible for this resistance, and show that hHDAC6 possesses intrinsic nuclear import and export signals. Thus, these results unexpectedly reveal that, compared with its murine ortholog, hHDAC6 possesses additional mechanisms for its cytoplasmic retention. Plasmid Constructs—Mammalian expression plasmids for hHDAC6 and deletion mutants were constructed on pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen) by standard methods. GFP constructs were derived from pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences). Additional HDAC6 mutants were generated by PCR with Expand (Roche Applied Science) thermostable DNA polymerase or by site-directed mutagenesis with single-stranded uracil-containing templates and T7 DNA polymerase. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing with T7 Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from murine kidney, liver, and lung using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. A One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) was used to amplify cDNA fragments corresponding to nucleotides 2607–3133 of mHDAC6 (GenBank™ accession number NM_010413) with primers NDA57 (5′-TCC TGT ATC AGC TAA GGA AA-3′) and NDA58 (5′-GGG TAT TAA AGT CCC CAA AT-3′). An aliquot of 200 ng of RNA was used in a total volume of 10 μl per RT-PCR. After 30 cycles of amplification in the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned for subsequent sequencing. Preparation of Extracts from HeLa S3 Suspension Culture—For suspension culture, adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in Joklik's-modified essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 5% fetal bovine serum. The suspension culture was grown in spinner flasks at 37 °C with stirring (100 rpm). For extract preparation, cells were harvested at 0.8–1.7 × 106 cells/ml. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). Sizing Chromatography—Cell extracts were fractionated on a prepacked Superose 6 column (HR 10/30; Amersham Biosciences) linked to a BioLogic protein purification system (Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) containing 0.15 m KCl. For extract injection, 0.5- or 1.0-ml static loops were used. For molecular weight calibration of the column, a gel filtration HMW calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Expression of hHDAC6 in Sf9 Cells—The hHDAC6 coding sequence was cloned into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) along with a C-terminal FLAG tag. Recombinant baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) and then used to infect Sf9 insect cells, growing as a suspension culture in Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Pluronic F68, and antibiotics. 48 h post-infection, cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Extracts were prepared in buffer B containing 0.15 m KCl and subjected to affinity purification on anti-FLAG M2-agarose. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. HDAC Assays—HDAC activities were determined by measuring the release of [3H]acetate from [3H]acetyl-histones as described previously (25Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 0.2 ml of buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF) containing [3H]acetyl-histones (20,000 dpm). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 2 h and was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 0.1 m HCl, 0.16 m acetic acid. Released [3H]acetate was extracted with 0.6 ml of ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, 0.45 ml of the upper organic phase was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Tubulin Deacetylation—In vivo tubulin deacetylation assays were performed as described (18Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N.

For in vitro assays, 6-well plates containing COS cells at 75% confluency were transfected with 2 μg of expression vectors encoding hHDAC6 and mutants. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 12% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.65 mm spermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 50 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA)) and kept at room temperature for 30 min prior to the addition of the SDS sample buffer for subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Ubiquitin Binding Assays—Extract preparation and ubiquitin pulldown assays were performed as described previously (12Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S.

The purified maltose-binding protein fusion protein was dialyzed against PBS and then injected into a rabbit for antiserum production. Small Scale Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractionation—A procedure described previously (26Wang A.H. Kruhlak M.J. Wu J. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Posner B.I. Bazett-Jones D.P. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, cultured cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in situ using 0.5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After 5 min on ice with occasional agitation, the cell lysate was harvested by scraping and centrifuged for 10 min in a benchtop centrifuge (1,300 × g) at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, cleared by high speed centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 × g) at 4 °C, and saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet from the low speed centrifugation was suspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. After the high speed centrifugation, supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Fluorescence Microscopy—Green fluorescence and indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analyses were performed as described (28Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5992-6005Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SE14 Repeat Domain of hHDAC6 —Besides its tandem catalytic domains and the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger, hHDAC6 possesses eight SE14 repeats with the consensus sequence XLXQTXSEXAXGGA, where X represents any amino acid residue and invariant residues are shown in boldface (Fig. 1, A and B). A slightly different alignment allows 10 repeats with the consensus sequence SEXAXGGATLXQTX (Fig. 1C). It is presently unclear which alignment represents the structure of this domain, but the presence of such repeats suggests that this domain may have a unique structure and thereby play a role in regulating the function of hHDAC6. Most intriguingly, this SE14 repeat domain is not present in the published sequences of C. elegans, Drosophila, mouse, and rat HDAC6 proteins (GenBank™ accession numbers NP_500788, NP_034543 and XP_228733 (8Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Barlow A.L. van Drunen C.M. Johnson C.A. Tweedie S. Bird A. Turner B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To confirm that the published mouse HDAC6 sequence (8Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) does not just represent an isoform lacking an SE14 repeat domain, total RNA was isolated from three murine tissues and subjected to RT-PCR with primers flanking the potential SE14 repeat domain (Fig. 1A). Based on the published mouse HDAC6 sequence (8Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the fragment was predicted to be 530 bp. If there were an isoform with an SE14 repeat domain, the corresponding cDNA fragment would be ∼1 kb. As shown in Fig. 1D, only a fragment of ∼530 bp was amplified from all three tissues. DNA sequencing confirmed that this fragment corresponds to the published mouse HDAC6 sequence. Exon-intron organization of the hHDAC6 gene and RT-PCR analysis indicated that there are no alternatively spliced hHDAC6 isoforms lacking the SE14 repeat domain (data not shown). Therefore, the SE14 repeat domain is present in human, but not murine, HDAC6. Role of the SE14 Repeat Domain in Modulating the Apparent Size of HDAC6 —The unusual feature of the SE14 repeat domain suggests that it may affect the overall structure of fulllength hHDAC6. To address this, size-exclusion chromatography was performed to determine the apparent size of hHDAC6. HeLa S3 cell extracts were fractionated on a Superose 6 column, and the resulting fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HDAC6 antibody. Endogenous hHDAC6 was detected in fractions 24–26, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼500 kDa (Fig. 2A). This is larger than the predicted molecular mass of monomeric hHDAC6 (∼150 kDa). To assess whether the apparent size of native hHDAC6 is due to association with other proteins, we expressed FLAG-tagged hHDAC6 in Sf9 insect cells. Extracts from these cells were fractionated on the same Superose 6 column, and the resulting fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Similar to what was observed with endogenous hHDAC6, FLAG-tagged hHDAC6 from Sf9 cells peaked at fraction 24, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼500 kDa (Fig. 2B, top). No signal was detected at the expected molecular mass of monomeric hHDAC6 (∼150 kDa). Coomassie staining of FLAG-tagged hHDAC6, affinity-purified from Sf9 cells, revealed that the purified protein is almost homogeneous (data not shown), suggesting that the apparent size of hHDAC6 is not due to association with other proteins. To investigate whether the apparent size of hHDAC6 is due to oligomerization, we determined its self-association ability. For this, FLAG-tagged hHDAC6 was coexpressed with GFP-hHDAC6 in 293 cells. These two fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-hHDAC6 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, FLAG-hHDAC6 and GFP-hHDAC6 did not coimmunoprecipitate with each other, indicating that they do not oligomerize. In agreement with this, Drosophila HDAC6 is mainly monomeric (29Barlow A.L. van Drunen C.M. Johnson C.A. Tweedie S. Bird A. Turner B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To assess how the SE14 repeat domain contributes to the apparent size of hHDAC6, two C-terminal deletion mutants, 1–1043 and 1–888, were utilized. Whereas the former lacks the HUB finger, the latter possesses neither the HUB finger nor the SE14 repeat domain (Fig. 1A). Full-length hHDAC6 and these two mutants were expressed in 293 cells as FLAG-tagged proteins. Extracts were prepared and subjected to sizing chromatography as described above. As shown in Fig. 2B (lower three panels), like endogenous HDAC6 from HeLa S3 cells, FLAG-tagged hHDAC6 migrated on the Superose 6 column as an ∼500-kDa species. Mutant 1–1044 was detected as a peak slightly smaller than hHDAC6, suggesting that the HUB domain does not grossly affect the migration of hHDAC6 on the gel filtration column. By contrast, mutant 1–888 peaked at fraction 30, corresponding to ∼150 kDa, suggesting that the SE14 repeat domain is responsible for the anomalous migration of hHDAC6 in size-exclusion chromatography. These results indicate that the SE14 repeat domain may form an unusual structure and affect the overall structure of hHDAC6. Requirement of the SE14 Repeat Domain for Deacetylase Activities of hHDAC6 —We next investigated whether the SE14 repeat domain affects functions of hHDAC6. For this, FLAG-tagged hHDAC6 was expressed in Sf9 cells and affinity-purified to near-homogeneity. As shown in Fig. 2D, the purified hHDAC6 protein possessed similar activity as that expressed in and affinity-purified from 293T cells. To assess how the SE14 repeat domain might affect the HDAC activity of hHDAC6, we analyzed the deletion mutants 1–1043 and 1–888. As shown in Fig. 2D, both mutants were found to be as active as the full-length hHDAC6 proteins, indicating that the SE14 repeat domain is not required for the HDAC activity of hHDAC6. Besides its deacetylase activity toward histones, HDAC6 also deacetylates α-tubulin (16Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 18Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S.

Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), so we asked whether the SE14 repeat domain regulates the tubulin deacetylase activity of hHDAC6. For this, BalbC3T3 cells were transfected with expression vectors for GFP-tagged hHDAC6 and mutant ΔSE14. In this mutant, residues 888–1024 were removed to delete the SE14 repeat domain. Cells expressing GFP-hHDAC6 or -ΔSE14 were treated with 50 nm TSA and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, like the wildtype HDAC6 protein, mutant ΔSE14 deacetylated α-tubulin in vivo. Consistent with this, the wild-type and mutant HDAC6 proteins both efficiently deacetylated α-tubulin in vitro (Fig. 3B), indicating that the SE14 repeat domain is dispensable for the tubulin deacetylase activity of hHDAC6. Role of the SE14 Repeat Domain in Ubiquitin Binding—The HUB finger of HDAC6 binds to ubiquitin (12Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13Hook S.S. Orian A. Cowley S.M. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13425-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because of its close proximity to this finger (Fig. 1A), the SE14 repeat domain may affect the ubiquitin binding activity of hHDAC6. To address this, mouse and human HDAC6 proteins were expressed in COS cells, and extracts were tested for the ability to bind ubiquitin-agarose. As a control, we tested mHDAC6 and its point mutant, m2, in which His-1094 and His-1098, residues critical for ubiquitin binding, are replaced with alanine (12Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As reported (12Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), wild-type mHDAC6, but not m2, was retained on ubiquitin-agarose (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–4). Wild-type hHDAC6 and mutant ΔSE14 were retained on the agarose to similar levels (Fig. 3C, lanes 5–8), indicating that the SE14 repeat domain does not affect the ubiquitin binding ability of hHDAC6. Moreover, the SE14 repeat domain itself did not bind to ubiquitin (data not shown). LMB-resistant Cytoplasmic Localization of hHDAC6 — mHDAC6 is mainly cytoplasmic (23Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 747-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), so we examined the subcellular localization of hHDAC6. For this, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from 293, 293T, and HeLa cells. Immunoblotting analysis of these extracts with a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal third of hHDAC6 revealed that endogenous hHDAC6 was predominantly cytoplasmic (data not shown). Moreover, GFP-hHDAC6 was found to be mainly cytoplasmic in 293 and HeLa cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, like mHDAC6, hHDAC6 is a cytoplasmic protein. mHDAC6 is actively exported from the nucleus in a CRM1-dependent manner (23Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 747-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), so we asked whether hHDAC6 is similarly regulated. To address this question, 293 and HeLa cells expressing GFP-hHDAC6 were treated with LMB (30Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-hHDAC6 was minimally affected by this treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). As reported (23Verdel A. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Rousseaux S. Lemercier C. Yoshida M. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 747-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), LMB treatment stimulated the nuclear accumulation of GFP-mHDAC6 (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that the cytoplasmic localization of hHDAC6 is controlled differently from that of mHDAC6. Role of the SE14 Repeat Domain in LMB-resistant Cytoplasmic Localization of hHDAC6 —The SE14 repeat domain is the major difference between murine and human HDAC6 proteins (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this domain regulates the cytoplasmic retention of hHDAC6, mutant ΔSE14 was expressed as a GFP fusion protein in 293 cells, and its subcellular localization was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Without LMB treatment, GFP-ΔSE14 was mainly cytoplasmic in 293 cells (Fig. 4C). 2 h after LMB treatment, GFP-ΔSE14 started to enter the nucleus; at 4–6 h, it became almost pancellular; and at 20 h, it was enriched in visible nuclear dots. These dots appeared to be nucleoli (Fig. 4D, top). To understand how ΔSE14 is associated with subnucleolar compartments, 293 cells expressing GFP-ΔSE14 were treated with LMB along with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D (ActD). At this concentration, ActD leads to segregation and subsequent dispersal of nucleolar compartments (31LaMorte V.J. Dyck J.A. Ochs R.L. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4D (bottom), GFP-ΔSE14 remained associated with punctate structures corresponding to compacted nucleoli that are known to contain condensed nucleolar chromatin.

Here, we report that Rab5 and Rab7 in the enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, EhRab5 and EhRab7A, are involved in steps that are distinct from those known for mammals. EhRab5 and EhRab7A were localized to independent small vesicular structures at steady state. Priming with red blood cells induced the formation of large vacuoles associated with both EhRab5 and EhRab7A (“prephagosomal vacuoles (PPV)”) in the amoeba within an incubation period of 5–10 min. PPV emerged de novo physically and distinct from phagosomes. PPV were gradually acidified and matured by fusion with lysosomes containing a digestive hydrolase, cysteine proteinase, and a membrane-permeabilizing peptide amoebapore. After EhRab5 dissociated from PPV, 5–10 min later, the EhRab7A-PPV fused with phagosomes, and EhRab7A finally dissociated from the phagosomes. Immunoelectron and light micrographs showed that PPV contained small vesicle-like structures containing fluid-phase markers and amoebapores, which were not evenly distributed within PPV, suggesting that the mechanism was similar to multivesicular body formation in PPV generation. In contrast to Rab5 from other organisms, EhRab5 was involved exclusively in phagocytosis, but not in endocytosis. Overexpression of wild-type EhRab5 enhanced phagocytosis and the transport of amoebapore to phagosomes. Conversely, expression of an EhRab5Q67L GTP form mutant impaired the formation of PPV and phagocytosis. Altogether, we propose that the amoebic Rab5 plays an important role in the formation of unique vacuoles, which is essential for engulfment of erythrocytes and important for packaging of lysosomal hydrolases, prior to the targeting to phagosomes.

Altogether, we propose that the amoebic Rab5 plays an important role in the formation of unique vacuoles, which is essential for engulfment of erythrocytes and important for packaging of lysosomal hydrolases, prior to the targeting to phagosomes. Phagocytosis is a critically important element of host defense against invading pathogens in higher organisms and its molecular mechanism in professional phagocytes, e.g. macrophage, has been extensively studied at the molecular level (1Tjelle T.E. Lovdal T. Berg T. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Greenberg S. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A number of steps including cell surface binding to ligands and the activation of a signaling pathway leading to F-actin polymerization have been identified as essential for phagocytosis. In addition, membrane trafficking plays an important role in the controlled maturation of phagosomes. The maturation is accompanied by sequential fusion with the endocytic compartment to form a phagolysosome, and is orchestrated by small GTPase, Rab proteins, which act as molecular switches regulating the fusion of vesicles with target membranes through the conformational change between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) forms (3Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Rab5 and Rab7 play an important role in the maturation of phagosomes in macrophages (4Desjardins M. Celis J.E. van Meer G. Dieplinger H. Jahraus A. Griffiths G. Huber L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32194-32200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab5 was initially shown to be localized to early endosomes and the plasma membrane, and involved in endocytosis and the endosome fusion (5Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 6Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3509-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab5 was also observed on nascent phagosomes, and has been implicated to play an important role in the fusion between phagosomes and early endosomes (7Jahraus A. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Habermann A.

Expression of the GTP form Rab5Q67L mutant or down-regulation of wild-type Rab5 by antisense oligonucleotides perturbed the regulated fusion between phagosomes and endosomes, and resulted in the formation of giant phagosomes in the former case, and reduced activity for killing of ingested bacteria because of the inhibition of phagosome maturation in the latter case (8Duclos S. Diez R. Garin J. Papadopoulou B. Descoteaux A. Stenmark H. Desjardins M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3531-3541PubMed Google Scholar, 9Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

In addition to Rab5 per se, some of the Rab5 effectors that were implicated in endosome fusion, e.g. EEA1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Vps34) (10Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 11Christoforidis S. Zerial M. Methods. 2000; 20: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), also have been identified on the phagosome membrane, suggesting that phosphoinositide metabolism is important for phagosome maturation as seen in the endocytic pathway (12Vieira O.V.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and also in the late stage of phagosome maturation (4Desjardins M. Celis J.E. van Meer G. Dieplinger H. Jahraus A.

It has also been recently demonstrated that a novel effector protein, RILP, is recruited to the phagosomal membrane by Rab7, which promotes fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes (17Harrison R.E.

Besides professional phagocytes from higher eukaryotes, some unicellular organisms such as Dictyostelium discoideum and Entamoeba histolytica show an inherent ability of phagocytosis. E. histolytica, an enteric protozoan parasite that causes an estimated 50 million cases of amebiasis: amebic colitis, dysentery, and extraintestinal abscesses (18Petri Jr., W.A. Curr. Opin.

An additional 50 putative Rab genes showing significant homology to Rab from other organisms were found in the E. histolytica genome data base (data not shown, www.tigr.org). A few EhRab proteins have been shown to participate in phagocytosis. EhRabB was shown to be located on the plasma membrane and phagocytic mouths in the early phase (up to 5 min) of phagocytosis (29Rodriguez M.A. Garcia-Perez R.M. Garcia-Rivera G. Lopez-Reyes I. Mendoza L. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Orozco E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Putative EhRab7 and EhRab11 proteins were reported to be abundant in the endosome fraction labeled with iron-dextran, similar to their putative homologues from mammals (30Temesvari L.A. Harris E.N. Stanley Jr., S.L. Cardelli J.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To dissect the molecular mechanism of Rab proteins involved in the phagosome biogenesis in Entamoeba, we characterized, in the present study, two amebic Rab proteins, EhRab5 and EhRab7A, that show significant homology to mammalian and yeast counterparts. The amoebic Rab5 homologue has several unique characteristics that are dissimilar to those of the mammalian and yeast Rab5. First, EhRab5 is primarily involved in phagocytosis, not endocytosis. Second, in contrast to mammalian Rab5, which is immediately recruited to phagosomes after the engulfment of bacteria or beads, EhRab5 is not recruited directly to phagosomes, but colocalizes with EhRab7A, forming prephagosomal vacuoles (PPV) prior to fusion with phagosomes. Third, EhRab5 is required for the formation of PPV and efficient engulfment of red blood cells. Fourth, EhRab5 plays an important role in the transport of the major membrane-permeabilizing peptide amoebapore. Therefore, in conjunction with EhRab7A, EhRab5 plays a key role in the biogenesis of phagosomes by regulating the formation of PPV and transport of membranolytic and hydrolytic factors during phagocytosis in this parasite. Organism and Culture—E. histolytica trophozoites of HM-I:IMSS cl 6 (32Diamond L.S. Mattern C.F. Bartgis I.L. J. Virol. 1972; 9: 326-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured axenically in BI-S-33 medium at 35 °C as described previously (33Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Isolation of EhRab5 and EhRab7A cDNAs—A full-length EhRab5 cDNA was obtained by a degenerate PCR approach, followed by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends as previously described (28Saito-Nakano Y. Nakazawa M. Shigeta Y. Takeuchi T. Nozaki T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A full-length EhRab7A gene was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using oligonucleotide primers designed based on sequences previously reported (30Temesvari L.A. Harris E.N. Stanley Jr., S.L. Cardelli J.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Tanaka T. Tanaka M. Mitsui Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We identified at least eight genes showing significant homology to Rab7 from other species (data not shown). We designated the EhRab7 gene showing highest homology to mammalian and yeast Rab7 as EhRab7A in the present study and describe the characterization of other EhRab7 isotypes elsewhere. Plasmid Constructions to Produce Transgenic Amoeba Lines— EhRab5 and EhRab7A cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR using sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing appropriate restriction sites at the end. Three tandem repeats of hemaggulutinin (HA) or c-Myc tags, made of annealed complementary oligonucleotides, were inserted in the engineered NheI site, which was located at the fourth or second amino acid codon of EhRab5 or EhRab7A cDNA fragments, respectively (Fig. 1). An expression plasmid, pEhEx, contains the 5′-flanking region cysteine synthase gene (AB000266) containing a putative promoter (35Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), BglII and XhoI sites between cysteine synthase 5′- and 3′-flanking regions to insert a gene of interest, cysteine synthase 3′-flanking regions and neomycin resistance gene flanked by the 5′ and 3′ regions of actin gene, obtained from pA5′A3′NEO (36Hamann L. Buss H. Tannich E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), for drug selection. The 3HA-EhRab5 cDNA fragment was inserted into the BglII-XhoI sites of pEhEx to produce pH5. For construction of a plasmid to co-express EhRab5 and EhRab7A (pH5-M7), a 1.7-kb fragment containing the 3Myc-EhRab7A protein-coding region flanked by cysteine synthase 5′ and 3′ regions was cloned into the SpeI site of pH5. EhRab5Q67L and EhRab5S22N mutants were constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (37Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Two EhRab5 mutants were fused with the 3-HA tag and cloned to pEhEx to produce pH5L or pH5N, respectively. Plasmids to co-express either EhRab5Q67L or EhRab5S22N and EhRab7A were constructed as described above (pH5L-M7 or pH5N-M7, respectively). A plasmid to express green fluorescent protein (GFP)-EhRab5 fusion protein in amoebae was constructed. GFP was amplified by PCR from GIR222 as a template (38Ramakrishnan G. Rogers J. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Parasitol. Int. 2001; 50: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and cloned into pKT-3M, which contained the cysteine synthase promoter, 3-Myc tag, and SmaI and XhoI restriction sites to produce pKT-MG. The EhRab5 protein coding region without the stop codon was ligated into SmaI-XhoI sites of pKT-MG to produce pKT-GFP5. Detailed information, e.g. nucleotide number based on sequences deposited in the data base and positions of inserted restriction sites and 3-HA or 3-Myc epitope, are also shown in Fig. 1B. Establishment of Epitope-tagged EhRab-expressing Amoeba Cell Lines—Wild-type trophozoites were transformed with plasmids by liposome-mediated transfection as previously described (39Nozaki T. Asai T. Sanchez L.B. Kobayashi S. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32445-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transformants were initially selected in the presence of 3 μg/ml of Geneticin (Invitrogen). The Geneticin concentration was gradually increased to 6–20 μg/ml during the following 2 weeks before the transformants were subjected to analyses. Antibodies—Affinity purified anti-EhRab5 or anti-EhRab7A rabbit antibodies were commercially produced at Oriental Yeasts Co. (Tokyo, Japan) using recombinant amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-HA 16B12 and anti-Myc 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Berkeley, CA). Alexa Fluor anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-amoebic CP2 and human band 3 rabbit antibodies were gifts from Iris Bruchhaus and Egbert Tannich (40Hellberg A. Leippe M. Bruchhaus I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and Yuichi Takakuwa (41Tomishige M. Sako Y. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), respectively. The production of anti-amoebapore A antibody was previously described (42Leippe M. Ebel S. Schoenberger O.L. Horstmann R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Amoeba transformants in a logarithmic growth phase were harvested and transferred to 8-mm round wells on glass slides and incubated for 30 min at 35 °C to let trophozoites attach to the glass surface. Gerbil red blood cells were added to each well at 107 cells/ml and incubated for 5–50 min at 35 °C. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed as follows. Amoebae were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Ingested red blood cells were stained with diaminobenzidine (0.84 mm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 0.048% H2O2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5) for 5 min (43Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Davis C. Quintana N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1972; 20: 1006-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cells were then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, PBS for 5 min. Samples were reacted with 16B12 (1:1000), 9E10 (1:400), anti-amoebapore A antibody (1: 1000), or affinity-purified anti-EhRab5, anti-EhRab7A, or CP2 antibody (1:200). In most experiments, we used a rabbit antibody raised against recombinant EhRab5, amoebapore, and CP, and anti-Myc mouse antibody to detect 3Myc-EhRab7A unless mentioned otherwise. The samples were then reacted with Alexa Fluor anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). The mouse monoclonal antibodies gave no background signal in the non-transformants because of nonspecific antibody binding under the conditions described above. For the staining of endosomal and lysosomal compartments, amoebae were pulsed with either 2 mg/ml FITC-dextran (Sigma) for 10 min or LysoTracker™ Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) (1:500) for 12 h at 35 °C. Samples were examined on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Images were further analyzed using LSM510 software. Time-lapse Microscopy—Amoeba transformants expressing GFP-EhRab5 were plated onto a 35-mm glass-bottom culture dish (D111100, Matsunami Glass Ind. Inc., Osaka, Japan) to settle amoebae at 30 °C. After the medium was removed, the glass chamber was enclosed by a glass coverslip. Time-lapse microscopy was performed with a Leica AS MDW system on a Leica DM IRE2 inverted microscope. Images of 18 slices (1.5 μm apart on the z-axis) were captured at 2.85-s intervals. This z-spacing was optimized to: 1) monitor the entire depth of amoebae from the top to the bottom, and 2) to accomplish fast capturing of a moving amoeba. Obtained raw images were further deconvoluted using Leica Deblur software. For each time point, images were three-dimensionally reconstituted and only a selected plane containing a PPV or a GFP-EhRab5-associated compartment was shown. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunoelectron microscopy was performed by pre-embedding labeling method (44Jaunin F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Martin T.E. Fakan S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Amoebae were transferred to slide glass and incubated with red blood cells for 10 min as described above. Samples were prefixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 20 min, and then incubated with 0.1 m glycine, PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were reacted with anti-amoebapore A (1:50), and subsequently with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 5-nm gold (1:30). These cells were embedded into 2% soft agar, and further fixed with 0.1% OsO4, PBS for 30 min followed by dehydration, and embedded in Epon 812 (TAAB Laboratories Equipment LTD., UK). Ultrathin sections were made on an LKB-ultramicrotome (LKB-Produkter, Bromma, Sweden), and sections were stained with uranyl acetate and examined with a Hitachi-H-700 electron microscope. Measurement of FITC-dextran Uptake—Transformants were cultured in BI-S-33 medium containing 2 mg/ml of FITC-dextran for given periods at 35 °C. After the incubation, cells were washed three times with 6 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 2% glucose, and solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml of trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64). Fluorescence emission at 520 nm was measured with excitation at 490 nm on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (VersaFluor Fluorometer, BioRad) and compared with standards of known concentrations. Identification of Entamoeba Homologues of Rab5 and Rab7 (EhRab5 and EhRab7A)—We isolated cDNAs coding for a putative homologue of Rab5 and Rab7, and designated them EhRab5 and EhRab7A, respectively. EhRab5 and EhRab7A showed 45 and 48% identity to mammalian Rab5 and Rab7, respectively. The effector region and α2 helix loop, which are important to the specificity of Rab proteins (45Stenmark H. Olkkonen V.M. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (Reviews 3007)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were well conserved among mammalians, yeasts, and E. histolytica (Fig. 2). To examine whether the amoebic Rab5 and Rab7A play a role similar to that in other organisms, we attempted to rescue defects of a yeast Δypt51/Δvps21 mutant (46Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 47Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and Δypt7 mutant (14Wichmann H. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1992; 71: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) through ectopic expression of EhRab5 and EhRab7A, respectively. Overexpression of EhRab5 on a single-copy plasmid under the regulation of a GAL1 promoter did not complement either the fragmented vacuole morphology or a temperature-sensitive growth defect in Δypt51/Δvps21 cells (data not shown). Neither did overexpression of EhRab7A in the Δypt7 mutant rescue vacuole fragmentation (data not shown). These results indicate that amoebic Rab5 and Rab7A play a role distinct from that of yeast Ypt51p and Ypt7p. Dynamics of EhRab5 and EhRab7A during Phagocytosis and Identification of Unique PPV Associated with EhRab5 and EhRab7A—We examined the subcellular localization of EhRab5 and EhRab7A during phagocytosis of red blood cells. We constructed a stable transformant that constitutively expressed an 3HA-tagged EhRab5 and a 3Myc-tagged EhRab7A. EhRab5 and EhRab7A were estimated to be overexpressed by 3–5- and 1.5–2-fold, respectively, in the transformant when compared with wild-type cells by quantitation of immunoblots using an antibody raised against recombinant EhRab5 and EhRab7A (data not shown). Neither expression of the epitopetagged EhRab5 alone nor co-expression of both epitope-tagged EhRab5 and EhRab7A affected cell growth or morphology (see below and Fig. 8A). Immunofluorescence imaging using anti-EhRab5 and anti-Myc antibody, the latter of which reacts with 3Myc-tagged EhRab7A, showed that, at steady state (i.e. without red blood cells), EhRab5 and EhRab7A were localized to small non-overlapping vesicles throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A–D). The distribution of EhRab5 and EhRab7A dramatically changed upon incubation with red blood cells. After 5 min, large vacuoles (4.0 ± 0.9 μm in diameter) that colocalized with both EhRab5 and EhRab7A emerged (Fig. 3, E–H). At 10 min, EhRab5 began to dissociate from some of these vacuoles, whereas EhRab7A remained associated with them (Fig. 3, I–L). These EhRab5/EhRab7A-positive vacuoles also formed in the amoebae that did not ingest red blood cells (a trophozoite in Fig. 3, E–H, and a trophozoite on the right in Fig. 3, I–L). We designated these vacuoles PPV as this compartment emerged prior to fusion with phagosomes (see below). At 30 min, when the amoebae ingested an average of 3–4 red blood cells per cell, EhRab5/EhRab7A double-positive PPV disappeared and EhRab5 dispersed into the cytosol as seen at steady state. Approximately 40% of phagocytosed red blood cells were surrounded by EhRab7A (Fig. 3, N, P, and Q). EhRab5 was not localized to phagosomes containing red blood cells at any time point (Fig. 3, A, E, I, and M), which is in good contrast to the dynamics shown for mammalian Rab5 in macrophages, where phagosomes are simultaneously associated with both Rab5 and Rab7 (4Desjardins M. Celis J.E. van Meer G. Dieplinger H. Jahraus A. Griffiths G. Huber L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32194-32200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To unequivocally demonstrate the dynamics of the maturation of PPV and phagosomes, we counted (i) EhRab5/EhRab7A double-positive PPV, (ii) EhRab7A single-positive PPV, (iii) EhRab7A positive phagosomes, and (iv) EhRab7A negative phagosomes (Fig. 3Q). The number of these vacuoles per cell changed during the course of phagocytosis. The number of EhRab5/EhRab7A double-positive PPV peaked at 5 min and gradually decreased after 10 min, whereas the number of EhRab7A single-positive PPV increased at 5–10 min, and remained elevated up to 30 min. The proportion of EhRab5/EhRab7A double-positive PPV among all PPV (i.e. i/(i + ii)) sharply decreased between 5 and 30 min (78, 37, and 8% at 5, 10, and 30 min, respectively). The number of phagosomes increased linearly during 30 min (0.8 per cell at 5 min to 5.3 per cell at 30 min). However, the proportion of EhRab7A-positive phagosomes among all phagosomes (i.e. iii/(iii + iv)) did not significantly change during the course (30–40%). These results support the following model: 1) upon interaction with red blood cells, EhRab5/EhRab7A double-positive PPV forms; 2) EhRab5 is dissociated from EhRab5/EhRab7A double-positive PPV; 3) EhRab7A is subsequently targeted to phagosomes; and 4) EhRab7A is finally dissociated from phagosomes. We also verified that PPV was not an artifactually misi"
https://openalex.org/W2016978148,"TRPM2 is a cation channel unique within the transient receptor potential family because of its gating by ADP-ribose (ADPR). ADPR gating is enabled by a cytosolic C-terminal Nudix box sequence motif embedded into a region homologous to the NUDT9 ADPR pyrophosphatase. A recently discovered splice variant of TRPM2 (TRPM2-ΔC) lacks 34 amino acid residues in the NUDT9 domain and is insensitive to ADPR. To analyze in detail which parts of the deleted sequence (ΔC-stretch) are critical for ADPR gating, we tested mutants that lacked 19, 25, and 29 amino acid residues in the N-terminal part or had amino acid residues substituted in the remaining C-terminal part of the ΔC-stretch. All of these mutants displayed typical ADPR-induced currents. However, the deletion or substitution of the amino acid residue Asn-1326 immediately downstream of the ΔC-stretch abrogated ADPR gating. We furthermore analyzed the mutation I1405E/L1406F in the Nudix box of TRPM2, because a considerably decreased AD-PRase activity of the TRPM2 NUDT9-H protein in comparison to the NUDT9 pyrophosphatase has been attributed to the reverse exchange EF → IL. The I1405E/L1406F variant of TRPM2 failed to respond to ADPR even at concentrations up to 10 mm. We concluded that the ΔC-stretch contains no individual amino acid residues essential for ADPR gating but may act as a spacer segment stabilizing a conformation necessary for the essential residue Asn-1326 to interact with other channel regions. Enhancing the enzymatic activity of the Nudix box abolishes the ADPR gating of TRPM2, pointing to the requirement of prolonged binding rather than degradation.

A detailed analysis of the C terminus of TRPM2 reveals a homology region termed NUDT9-H that is distinctly larger than the actual Nudix box (7Perraud A.-L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P.

This region with ∼300 amino acid residues shows 39% sequence homology to the human NUDT9 ADPR pyrophosphatase (12Shen B.W. Perraud A.-L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The refined crystal structure analysis as well as biochemical studies indicate that the human NUDT9 enzyme can be functionally divided into a N-terminal domain of 105 amino acid residues, which possibly supports ADPR binding and a 179-amino-acid residue C-terminal domain containing the catalytic active site (12Shen B.W.

Accordingly, a substitution of two neighboring amino acid residues (mutation EF → IL) in the TRPM2 Nudix box accounts for a decreased enzymatic activity of the NUDT9-H domain in comparison to NUDT9. However, the importance of any residual enzymatic activity of NUDT9-H for the ADPR gating of TRPM2 remains unclear. It may be hypothesized that the binding of ADPR to the NUDT9-H domain rather than degradation of ADPR by the NUDT9-H domain is decisive for channel gating. Moreover, although ADPR-binding seems to be supported by the N-terminal part of NUDT9, it is poorly understood which structures within this region govern the interaction with ADPR. Recently, we have identified a C-terminal splice variant of TRPM2 (TRPM2-ΔC) in neutrophil granulocytes. This variant is insensitive to ADPR but develops typical cation currents in the presence of H202 (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The corresponding deletion of 34 amino acid residues (the ΔC-stretch) is located within the N-terminal domain of TRPM2 NUDT9-H (13Perraud A.-L. Schmitz C. Scharenberg A.M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to analyze in detail which parts of the ΔC-stretch are critical for the ADPR gating of TRPM2. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact on channel function when the Nudix box of TRPM2 was changed such that the two amino acid residues essential for the full enzymatic activity are the same as in the NUDT9 pyrophosphatase. We report that the substitution of these two amino acid residues of TRPM2 abrogates stimulation by ADPR, but no individual amino acid residue of the ΔC-stretch is essential for channel gating. However, the deletion or substitution of an asparagine residue immediately downstream of the ΔC-stretch completely abolished ADPR-gating. Molecular Cloning—For expression in eukaryotic cells the plasmid construct pcDNA3-EGFP containing the full-length open reading frame of TRPM2 was used. For the generation of TRPM2 mutants with C-terminal deletions similar to the TRPM2-ΔC splice variant, as described by (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), several BspDI recognition sites were introduced in pairs into the TRPM2 open reading frame. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed, using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene) and defined oligonucleotides (see Table I) obtained from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Subsequently, the DNA (pcDNA3-EGFP-TRPM2) was digested with BspDI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) yielding two DNA fragments. After separation on a 1% agarose gel the excised small DNA fragment was discarded, and the large DNA fragment with the corresponding deletion was isolated using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and circularized using the Quick Ligation kit (New England Biolabs), The resulting TRPM2 expression constructs contain open reading frames with defined deletions between 19 and 39 amino acids in length.(see Fig. 1) Every point mutation or deletion was verified by DNA sequencing with the Big-DYE-Terminator Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The presence of inadvertent mutations in other regions of the channel could be excluded, because for each deletion mutant or point mutant two clones were tested yielding the same results. All procedures were performed in accordance to the respective manufacturers' instructions, if not indicated otherwise.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis experimentsOligonucleotideSequencePrimer A5′-gccatggaccccatcgatgacaccctggagcc-3′Primer B5′-gtggatggcctgatcgatcgccggagcttccacg-3′Primer C5′-gaccgccggagcatcgatgggccgtacacagtgc-3′Primer D5′-cacgggccgtacatcgatcaggccgggttgcccc-3′Primer E5′-ctgaaccccatcgatcgcacaggactgcgtggg-3′Q1320E5′-gggccgtacacagtggaggccgggttgccc-3′G1322W5′-acagtgcaggcctggttgcccctgaacccc-3′P1324Q5′-caggccgggttgcaactgaaccccatgggccgc-3′L1325D5′-caggccgggttgcccgacaaccccatgggc-3′L1325G5′-caggccgggttgcccgggaaccccatgggccgc-3′N1326D5′-gccgggttgcccctggaccccatgggccgc-3′ΔAsn-13265′-caggccgggttgcccctg(Δ)cccatgggccgc-3′P1327V5′-gggttgcccctgaacgttatgggccgcacagg-3′I1405E/L1406F5′-aagctgaagcgggaattccggcaggagcactgg-3′ Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese ovary hamster cells K1 were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured in Ham's F12 medium (Biochrome, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biochrome). Cells were seeded on glass coverslips at a density of <103 cells/mm2 and grown for 24 h. Subsequently, the pcDNA3-EGFP-TRPM2/TRPM2ΔC expression constructs were transiently transfected into the Chinese hamster ovary cells, using the Trans-Fast transfection reagent (Promega). As controls, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-enhanced green fluorescent protein vector alone. The transfection procedure was as described elsewhere (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Patch clamp measurements were carried out 24–48 h after transfection in cells visibly positive for enhanced green fluorescent protein. Electrophysiology—Transfected cells were analyzed with the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell mode, using a EPC 9 equipped with a personal computer with Pulse and X chart software (HEKA, Lamprecht, Germany). The standard extracellular bath solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted with KOH to 7.4. For Na+-free solutions, Na+ was replaced by 150 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine, and the titration was performed with HCl. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 145 cesium-glutamate, 8 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 Cs-EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH). When a high (1 μm) intracellular Ca2+ concentration was desired, the EGTA concentration in the pipette fluid was reduced to 1 mm, and 0.89 mm CaCl2 was added. Immediately before measurements, ADP-ribose was added to the pipette solution from a stock, yielding a final concentration of 0.3 mm. In distinct experiments with the mutants N1326D, ΔAsn-1326, and I1405E/L1406F, the ADP-ribose concentration in the pipette solution was increased up to 10 mm. Cells were held at a potential of –60 mV at room temperature. The current-voltage (I-V) relations were obtained during voltage ramps from –90 to +60 mV applied over 400 ms. In a previous study (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we have identified a C-terminal splice variant of the cation channel TRPM2 (Δ1292–1325 or TRPM2-ΔC) in which the gating of the channel by ADPR is lost. The deleted sequence of 34 amino acids (the ΔC-stretch) is located within the N-terminal part of a region homologous to the human NUDT9 ADPRase (Ref. 12Shen B.W. Perraud A.-L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 1). To localize the amino acid residues of the NUDT9-H region critical for the ADPR-sensitivity of TRPM2, we first performed modifications of TRPM2 that allowed us to delete the ΔC-stretch in total or in part. Therefore, we introduced two BspDI recognition sites into the full-length TRPM2 open reading frame localized immediately upstream and downstream of the ΔC-stretch (Fig. 1). After digestion with BspDI we obtained two DNA-fragments, the excised short ΔC-stretch, which was discarded, and the large TRPM2-ΔC expression vector construct lacking the desired 39 amino acids (Δ39); this construct was religated. The obtained deletion is congruent with the original ΔC-stretch but additionally two N-terminal and three C-terminal amino acid residues are lacking. Furthermore, one amino acid codon is changed at each end of the deletion because of the two BspDI recognition sites introduced previously (see Fig. 1). To test TRPM2 variants functionally, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were transfected with the respective constructs. We did not use human embryonic kidney-293 cells as the expression system, because we had not found activation of TRPM2 currents by NAD in these cells (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E.

ADPR (0.3 mm) was applied to the cytosolic side of the channels by dialysis into the cells through the patch pipette. As expected, cells expressing the Δ39 variant of TRPM2 (which is almost identical with the previously characterized ADPR-insensitive TRPM2-ΔC variant) failed to respond to ADPR with a development of currents (Fig. 2 and Table II). The duration of each experiment after obtaining the whole-cell configuration was at least 5 min to exclude the effects of variable diffusion of ADPR from the pipette into the cytosol.Table IIDifferential stimulation of TRPM2 variants with ADP-ribosePhenotype (n)ADPR sensitivityCurrent densitypA/pFWild type (3)+150.9 ± 55.2Δ39 (9)-0.38 ± 0.3Δ19 (3)+109.7 ± 68Δ25 (4)+118.3 ± 33Δ29 (6)+77.6 ± 34Q1320E (3)+78.6 ± 54G1322W (4)+141.4 ± 36P1324Q (3)+113.1 ± 19L1325D (7)+51.5 ± 24L1325G (3)+88.4 ± 58N1326D (15)-1.75 ± 1.0ΔAsn-1326 (13)-1.87 ± 1.5P1327V (3)+45.0 ± 37I1405E/L1406F (33)-1.00 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab In the next step we changed the localization of the 3′-BspDI recognition site, which was shifted upstream in steps of 10, 14, and 20 amino acid residues. We obtained three additional TRPM2 channel variants designated Δ29, Δ25, and Δ19 in which the ΔC-stretch was shortened at its C terminus (see Fig. 1). During infusion of 0.3 mm ADPR into cells expressing these Δ29, Δ25 and Δ19 channels, respectively, an inward current developed rapidly and consistently (Fig. 2 and Table II). The current was characterized by a reversal potential of ∼0mVand was blocked in the inside direction when the extracellular Na+ was substituted by the large impermeable cation N-methyl-d-glucamine (Fig. 4). Thus, these experiments show the typical ADPR-induced non-selective cation currents previously demonstrated characteristic for TRPM2 (7Perraud A.-L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Hence, we had excluded for the 28 N-terminal amino acid residues of the ΔC-stretch that their deletion is responsible for the loss of function of TRPM2-ΔC. This left us with a remaining stretch of six amino acids in the C-terminal part of the original ΔC-stretch that might be critical for ADPR gating of the channel (Fig. 1). Their potential importance is implied by the fact that some of these amino acid residues are conserved between TRPM2 and NUDT9 (12Shen B.W. Perraud A.-L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To test their functional relevance, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis in the TRPM2 wild-type channel. The individual amino acid residues were substituted such that their structure or charge were profoundly altered. In particular, we generated four TRPM2 mutants: Q1320E, G1322W, P1324Q, and L1325G (see Fig. 1). Surprisingly, none of these point mutations affected the normal ADPR sensitivity of the channel (Figs. 3 and 4 and Table II). This suggests that no single amino acid residue of the ΔC-stretch is essentially involved in the ADPR gating of TRPM2 channels. (Only for Ala-1321 and Leu-1323 is no information available because these were not mutated). The data imply that the region C-terminally of the ΔC-stretch might be critical. Hence, we next generated the mutations N1326D and P1327V of the full-length TRPM2 that affect the two amino acid residues located immediately downstream of the ΔC-stretch (Fig. 1). Both these residues are the first ones within a stretch of 12 amino acid residues almost completely conserved between TRPM2 and NUDT9 (Ref. 12Shen B.W. Perraud A.-L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 1). The P1327V channel showed typical cation currents in the presence of ADPR (Fig. 4, Table II). In distinct contrast, the N1326D channel did not display any ADPR-induced activity (Fig. 3, Table II). Even with higher than standard (0.3 mm) ADPR concentrations (1 and 10 mm), no currents were evoked (Table II). To further confirm the importance of Asn-1326, we deleted this amino acid residue. Indeed, the deletion mutant ΔAsn-1326 did not display currents in response to ADPR (Fig. 3, Table II). These data and the fact that during the splice process generating TRPM2-ΔC channels an acidic residue (Glu-1291) is transferred immediately upstream of Asn-1326 (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) let us hypothesize that the findings may fit to the simple model, no acidic residue is tolerated in the region around Asn-1326. To test this hypothesis, we studied the mutation L1325D and a construct produced in preparation of the channel-variant Δ39. This construct was identical with full-length TRPM2 but already contained the two BspDI recognition sites, resulting in four amino acid substitutions, notably G1329D (Fig. 1). Indeed, no currents were induced by ADPR in cells transfected with this channel construct (n = 4, data not shown). However, the mutant L1325D displayed normal ADPR-induced channel activity (Fig. 3, Table II), demonstrating that not every acidic substitution close to Asn-1326 causes a loss of function. It has been shown in vitro that the EF → IL substitution in the Nudix box of the purified NUDT9-H domain of TRPM2 is responsible for the drastic decrease of the enzymatic activity, if compared with human NUDT9 ADPRase (14Perraud A.-L. Shen B. Dunn C.A. Rippel K. Smith M.K. Bessman M.J. Stoddard B.L. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of this domain for ADPR gating, we performed the reverse substitution IL → EF in TRPM2, i.e. we reintroduced the two amino acid residues decisive for the high enzymatic activity of NUDT9 (see Fig. 5A). This mutant I1405E/L1406F did not respond to ADPR in the standard concentration of 0.3 mm (Table II). Our assumption that the IL → EF substitution may restore the full ADPR hydrolase activity in vivo implies that the reinforced degradation of the substrate might impair the ADPR gating. Therefore, we performed additional experiments in which the ADPR concentration was considerably increased to 0.6, 0.9, and 10 mm, respectively. Moreover, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was raised from <10 nm to ∼1 μm because it was demonstrated by Ref. 18McHugh D. Flemming R. Xu S.-Z. Perraud A.-L. Beech D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1002-11006Google Scholar that the intracellular Ca2+ provides essential positive feedback for channel activation. However, even at the highest concentration, no ADPR-induced current was observed at low (Fig. 5B, Table II) or high intracellular Ca2+ (data not shown). Thus, the TRPM2 mutants N1326D, ΔAsn-1326, and I1405E/L1406F are not ADPR-activated channels. This raises the question whether they might develop currents in the presence of other activators. Both wild-type TRPM2 and its functional mutants with substitutions in the ΔC-stretch (exemplary shown for G1322W in Fig. 6) displayed typical currents with NAD (1 mm) in the patch pipette. However, we detected no NAD-dependent channel activation with the ADPR-insensitive mutants N1326D, ΔAsn-1326, and I1405E/L1406F (data not shown). In a previous study (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) using human embryonic kidney-293 cells as an expression system, we demonstrated characteristic currents through the splice variant TRPM2-ΔC induced by H2O2. Unfortunately, we were not able to demonstrate a H2O2 induction of currents in the Chinese hamster ovary expression system using wild-type TRPM2 with a sufficient consistency. Therefore, we did not rigorously test H2O2 on mutants insensitive to ADPR. As the main finding of the present study, we have identified the amino acid residues within the ΔC-stretch (Δ1292–1325) of wild-type TRPM2 that can be deleted (Δ1292–1318) or mutated (V1319D, Q1320E, G1322W, P1324E, L1325G, L1325D) without disturbing ADPR gating. Thus, although the ΔC-stretch is essential for ADPR-induced channel activation, it most probably contains no amino acid residues that are directly involved in the ADPR gating of TRPM2. In contrast, the amino acid residue Asn-1326 located immediately downstream and therefore outside of the ΔC-stretch is essential, because the substitution of N1326D as well as the deletion of ΔAsn-1326 disrupts the ADPR gating of the channel. Recent biochemical studies as well as crystallization analyses with the homologous human NUDT9 ADPRase indicate that the NUDT9-H domain of TRPM2 is composed of a N-terminal part supporting ADPR binding and a C-terminal part containing the Nudix box motif critical for the enzymatic activity (12Shen B.W. Perraud A.-L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Perraud A.-L. Schmitz C. Scharenberg A.M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ΔC-stretch, which is deleted in the ADPR-insensitive splice variant TRPM2-ΔC, is located adjacent to the transition of these two subdomains of NUDT9-H. Interestingly, Asn-1326 represents the N-terminal residue of a sequence of 12 amino acids that is almost completely conserved between TRPM2 NUDT9-H and NUDT9 (with the exception of Met-1328 and Arg-1334, Ref. 12Shen B.W. Perraud A.-L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the mutation of further residues within this region showed diverging results. The equally conserved amino acid residue Pro-1327 was changed to valine without a negative effect on ADPR-gating, whereas a construct with the double mutation M1328I/G1329D did not exhibit ADPR-induced currents. Thus, Asn-1326 is a residue of singular importance for the function of TRPM2. The deletion of the ΔC-stretch of the previously described TRPM2-ΔC-splice variant (15Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) appears to induce localized structural disruptions specifically affecting Asn-1326. Other residues in the vicinity such as Met-1328 and Gly-1329 may also be involved. TRPM2 represents a channel protein that additionally may possess enzymatic activity. However, the enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated for the complete channel but only for its purified NUDT9 domain (7Perraud A.-L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 14Perraud A.-L. Shen B. Dunn C.A. Rippel K. Smith M.K. Bessman M.J. Stoddard B.L. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzymatic activity was considerably lower than in the human NUDT9 ADPR pyrophosphatase because of the amino acid exchange E1405I/F1406L. This could be interpreted as an evolutionary adaptation, producing an extended dwell time of ADPR at its binding site, which may be required for channel gating. In this context, it is noteworthy that stimulation of TRPM2 specifically depends on ADPR, whereas degradation products of ADPR are without effect (7Perraud A.-L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). When we performed the reverse substitution I1405E/L1406F in TRPM2, with the idea that any enzymatic activity might be strongly increased, any current induction by ADPR was lost. These data are in line with the hypothesis that the restored ADPRase activity of the TRPM2 Nudix box mutant interfered with the ADPR gating of the channel, because the channel activator was rapidly degraded. One may expect that higher ADPR concentrations can compensate for the degradation. However, this was not the case in our experiments because even with the highest ADPR concentrations and in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (that facilitate ADPR gating, Ref. 18McHugh D. Flemming R. Xu S.-Z. Perraud A.-L. Beech D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1002-11006Google Scholar), no current development was observed. Thus, if we assume that the mutation I1405E/L1406F does not disturb normal channel assembly and/or trafficking, we conclude that ADPR gating of TRPM2 does not tolerate manipulations that enhance the putative ADPR pyrophosphatase activity of the Nudix box. Because we observed the complete loss of ADPR-dependent channel activity for the mutants N1326D, ΔAsn-1326, and I1405E/L1406F, we tested the alternative channel activators NAD and H2O2. TRPM2 variants showing ADPR gating also developed currents in the presence of NAD. The mutants N1326D, ΔAsn-1326, and I1405E/L1406F failed to respond to ADPR as well as to NAD (data not shown). Therefore, ADPR-dependent gating and NAD-dependent gating were indistinguishable in our expression system. We think that TRPM2 channel activation by NAD cannot be clearly separated from that by ADPR so far, because it cannot be excluded that NAD at the required high concentrations is contaminated by or intracellularly interconverted to ADPR (19Guse A.H. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 272-283Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Guse A.H. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we were not consistently able to evoke the characteristic currents of wild-type and mutant TRPM2 channels by the application of H2O2. TRPM2 activation by oxidative stress appears to represent a cell-specific process not only in heterologous expression models but also in cells with endogenous expression of TRPM2. For example, TRPM2 is stimulated in cell lines derived from pancreatic β cells by H2O2 (21Inamura K. Sano S. Mochizuki H. Yokoi A. Miyake K. Nozawa C. Kitada H. Matsuhime K. Furuichi K. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but not in neutrophil granulocytes (17Heiner I. Eisfeld J. Halaszovich C.R. Wehage E. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present study identified the highly conserved Asn-1326 as essential for ADPR gating of TRPM2. Furthermore, the data suggest that the ΔC-stretch of TRPM2 represents a structural element stabilizing the interactions of N1326 (and probably further residues immediately downstream) with other parts of the channel protein. Although the relevance of any ADPRase activity of TRPM2 remains unclear, our data demonstrated that the restitution of two amino acids that presumably enhance the enzymatic activity abolished the ADPR gating of TRPM2.

https://openalex.org/W2019243307,"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1- and COX-2-derived prostaglandins are implicated in the development and progression of several malignancies. We have recently demonstrated that treatment of ovarian carcinoma cells with endothelin-1 (ET-1) induces expression of both COX-1 and COX-2, which contributes to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. In this study, we show that in HEY and OVCA 433 ovarian carcinoma cells, ET-1, through the binding with ETA receptor (ETAR), induces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, as the more represented PG types, and increases the expression of PGE2 receptor type 2 (EP2) and type 4 (EP4). The use of pharmacological EP agonists and antagonists indicates that ET-1 and PGE2 stimulate VEGF production principally through EP2 and EP4 receptors. At the mechanistic level, we prove that the induction of PGE2 and VEGF by ET-1 involves Src-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation. Finally, we demonstrate that ETAR-mediated activation of PGE2-dependent signaling participates in the regulation of the invasive behavior of ovarian carcinoma cells by activating tumor-associated matrix metalloproteinase. These results implicate EP2 and EP4 receptors in the induction of VEGF expression and cell invasiveness by ET-1 and provide a mechanism by which ETAR/ET-1 can promote and interact with PGE2-dependent machinery to amplify its proangiogenic and invasive phenotype in ovarian carcinoma cells. Pharmacological blockade of ETAR can therefore represent an additional strategy to control PGE2 signaling, which has been associated with ovarian carcinoma progression.

At the mechanistic level, we prove that the induction of PGE2 and VEGF by ET-1 involves Src-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation. Finally, we demonstrate that ETAR-mediated activation of PGE2-dependent signaling participates in the regulation of the invasive behavior of ovarian carcinoma cells by activating tumor-associated matrix metalloproteinase. These results implicate EP2 and EP4 receptors in the induction of VEGF expression and cell invasiveness by ET-1 and provide a mechanism by which ETAR/ET-1 can promote and interact with PGE2-dependent machinery to amplify its proangiogenic and invasive phenotype in ovarian carcinoma cells. Pharmacological blockade of ETAR can therefore represent an additional strategy to control PGE2 signaling, which has been associated with ovarian carcinoma progression.

Among these, PGE2, the most common prostanoid, is involved in tumor progression by inducing angiogenesis (2Dannenberg A.J. Subbaramaiah K.

PGE2 exerts its autocrine/paracrine effects on target cells by coupling to four subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), which have been classified as EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (4Gupta R.A. DuBois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). These receptors are often co-expressed in the same cell and utilize alternate and, in some cases, opposing intracellular signaling pathways (8Ashby B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Among these, EP2 and EP4 are the principal receptors implicated in mediating tumor progression through their ability to induce proangiogenic factor and/or tumor cell invasiveness (6Dohadwala M.

The study of EP receptor signaling pathways is becoming of clinical relevance especially in tumors, such as ovarian carcinoma, in which the overexpression of COX-2, the principal enzyme implicated in PGE2 synthesis, has been identified as an independent prognostic factor associated with reduced survival and poor response to standard combination chemotherapy (11Denkert C.

ET-1 and its selective receptor ETA (ETAR) are overexpressed in primary and metastatic ovarian carcinoma as compared with normal ovarian tissue (22Bagnato A. Tecce R. Moretti C. Di Castro V. Spergel D. Catt K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). ET-1/ETAR interaction results in activation of a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein that stimulates phospholipase C activity and increases intracellular Ca2+ levels as well as activation of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), paxillin, and p125 focal adhesion kinase (23Nelson J.B. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Among downstream events after ETAR activation, ET-1 also causes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation, which is partly responsible for MAPK phosphorylation (24Vacca F. Bagnato A. Catt K.J. Tecce R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5310-5317PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that ET-1 through ETAR induces COX-1 and COX-2 expression and that both enzymes contribute to PGE2 and VEGF production in ovarian carcinoma cells (25Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4670-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ETAR blockade by the selective receptor antagonist, ABT-627, has been shown to inhibit the growth of ovarian carcinoma xenografts concomitantly with a reduction of microvessel density and MMP-2, VEGF, and COX-2 expression (25Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4670-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Rosanò L. Spinella F. Salani D. Di Castro V. Venuti A. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2447-2453PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the contribution of the COX pathway in the mechanism by which ET-1 participates in ovarian cancer progression, we investigated the effect of ET-1 on prostaglandin type secretion and EP receptor expression and their roles in ET-1-induced VEGF production and cell invasiveness in the human ovarian carcinoma cells. We demonstrate that in HEY and OVCA 433 cells, 1) ET-1 through ETAR increases the production of PGE2, PGF2α, and PGD2 and the expression of EP2 and EP4 receptor transcripts, 2) ET-1-induced PGE2, VEGF, and cell invasion are mediated through the binding of PGE2 to EP2 and EP4 receptors, 3) ET-1-induced Src-mediated EGFR transactivation is involved in PGE2 and VEGF production and cell invasiveness. Thus, for the first time, we defined the prostaglandin secretion pattern and the PGE2 receptor subtype expression in ovarian carcinoma cells, providing evidence for the involvement of EP2 and EP4 in ET-1-mediated PGE2-dependent pathways. Moreover, the present findings indicate that blockade of ETAR signaling may result in targeting EP receptor activation and related signaling cascades, which contribute to ET-1-mediated ovarian cancer cell invasion. Cells and Cell Cultured Conditions—Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, HEY and OVCA 433, previously characterized for ET-1 receptor expression and for ET-1 production (14Bagnato A. Salani D. Di Castro V. Wu-Wong J.R. Tecce R. Nicotra M.R. Venuti A. Natali P.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bagnato A. Tecce R. Moretti C. Di Castro V. Spergel D. Catt K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air. The cells were serum-starved by incubation for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All culture reagents were from Invitrogen. ET-1 (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA), EGF (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), PGE2 (Sigma), 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (EP1 and EP3 agonist), butaprost (EP2 agonist), sulprostone (EP3 agonist), and 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 (EP2–4 agonist) (Cayman, Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were incubated with the cells for the indicated times. Pretreatment of cells with BQ 123 (Peninsula Laboratories), SC19220 (EP1 antagonist; Cayman Chemical), AH23848 (EP4 antagonist; Sigma), and AG1478 and PP2 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was performed for the indicated times prior to the addition of ET-1 or PGE2. Western Blot Analysis—For the detection of VEGF, EGFR, and phospho-EGFR, whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5–12.5%) and revealed by Western blotting using antibodies anti-VEGF (Sigma) or anti-EGFR or anti-phospho 845-EGFR (Cell Signaling). Blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were reprobed with anti-β-actin to assure the equal amount of protein (Oncogene, CN Biosciences, Inc., Darmastadt, Germany). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from HEY and OVCA 433 cells was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using an AccessQuick RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers sets were as follows: EP1, 5′-CCTGTCGGTATCATGGTGGTGTC-3′ and 5′-GGTTGTGCTTAGAAGTGGCTGAGG-3′; EP2, 5′-GCCACGATGCTCATCCTCTTCGCC-3′ and 5′-CTTGTGTTCTTAATGAAATCCGAC-3′; EP3, 5′-GCATAACTGGGGCAAACCTTTTCTTCGCC-3′ and 5′-CTTAACAGCAGGTAAACCCAAGGATCC-3′; EP4, 5′-TGGTATGTGGGCTGGCTG-3′ and 5′-GAGGACGGTGGCGAGAAT-3′; VEGF, 5′-GGCTCTAGATCGGGCCTCCGAAACCAT-3′ and 5′-GGCTCTAGAGCGCAGAGTCTCCTCTTC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Thirty-five cycles of amplification was performed under the following conditions: melting at 95 °C for 30 s; annealing at 58 (EP1–4, GAPDH) and 60 °C (VEGF) for 30 s; extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. ELISA—The VEGF protein levels in the cell-conditioned medium were determined in triplicate by ELISA using the Quantikine human VEGF immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The sensitivity of the assay is less than 5.0 pg/ml. Intra-assay variation is 5.4%, and inter-assay variation is 7.3%. Levels of PGE2 and PGF2α released into the medium of treated cells were measured by the PGE2 Correlate-EIA and PGF2α Correlate-EIA kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The detection of PGD2 was performed by the quantitative determination of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, one of its ultimate dehydration products (27Azuma Y. Watanabe K. Date M. Daito M. Ohura K. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), using 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 Correlate-EIA (Assay Designs, Inc.). The sensitivity of the assay is 13.4 pg/ml for PGE2, 6.71 pg/ml for PGF2α, and 36.8 pg/ml for PGD2. Intra-assay variation is 5.8% for PGE2, 6.8% for PGF2α, and 5.7% for PGD2, and inter-assay variation is 5.1% for PGE2, 5.5% for PGF2α, and 13.0% for PGD2. Gelatinase activities in cell-conditioned medium were determined using an MMP gelatinase activity assay kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sensitivity of the assay is less than 5 ng/ml MMP in a range of 10–200 ng/ml. Chemoinvasion Assay—Chemoinvasion was assessed using a 48-well modified Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe, Pleasanton, CA) and 8-μm pore polyvinyl pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate Nucleopore filters (Costar, New York, NY) as described previously (28Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). The filters were coated with an even layer of 0.5 mg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The lower compartment of chamber was filled with chemoattractants (100 nm ET-1 and 1 μm PGE2) and/or inhibitors and/or antagonists (27 μl/well). Serum-starved HEY cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested and placed in the upper compartment (55 μl/well). Where indicated, the cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the EP4 antagonist AH23848 or AG1478 or PP2 or BQ 123. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the filters were removed and then stained with Diff-Quick (Merz-Dade, Dudingen, Switzerland), and the migrated cells in 10 high power fields were counted. Each experimental point was analyzed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Results are representative of at least three independent experiments each performed in triplicate. All statistical analysis was assessed using a two-tailed Student's t test. ET-1 Increases Prostaglandin Levels through ETAR—Ovarian carcinoma cells produce prevalently PGE2, PGF2α, and PGD2 types of PG (29Gupta R.A. Tejada L.V. Tong B.J. Das S.K. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). Because ET-1 up-regulates COX-1 and COX-2 expression, which is implicated in PG synthesis in ovarian cancer cells (25Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4670-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we evaluated the role of ET-1/ETAR binding on the production of three major PG metabolites by measuring their levels in HEY and OVCA 433 cell-conditioned medium. By ELISA, we found that both cell lines released constitutively high levels of PGE2, PGF2α, and PGD2 and that stimulation with ET-1 increased their levels 2.4-, 1.9-, and 1.73-fold, respectively, in HEY cells (Fig. 1, left panel) and 1.84-, 1.82-, and 1.63-fold in OVCA 433 cells (Fig. 1, right panel). Because the selective ETAR antagonist, BQ 123, blocked the ET-1-induced PG release in both cell lines (Fig. 1), these results show that ET-1 through ETAR is a potent PG inducer and that PGE2 is the predominant prostaglandin type induced by ET-1 in ovarian carcinoma cells. ET-1 Induces EP2 and EP4 Receptor Subtype Expression— PGE2 exerts its effects through interactions with four types of EP receptor (4Gupta R.A. DuBois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether ET-1 could modulate the expression pattern of EP subtype receptors in ovarian carcinoma cells, we performed RT-PCR analysis with specific EP receptor primers. mRNAs of EP2 and EP4 subtype receptors were easily detected in untreated HEY (Fig. 2, right panel) and OVCA 433 (Fig. 2, left panel) cells, whereas the levels of EP1 and EP3 mRNAs were extremely low. After 6 h of ET-1 stimulation, the mRNA levels of EP2 and EP4 subtype receptors were increased (2.1) in a dose-dependent manner, reaching maximum responses (∼2.1-fold higher than control) at 10 and 100 nm ET-1. On the contrary, EP1 and EP3 receptor mRNAs remained unchanged (Fig. 2). A similar induction was observed in ovarian carcinoma cells treated with PGE2 (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that ET-1 is endowed with the capacity of selectively up-regulating EP2 and EP4 receptor mRNA levels in human ovarian cancer cells. ET-1 and PGE2 Induce VEGF Up-regulation via EP2 and EP4 Receptor Subtypes—To investigate whether the induction of PGE2 by ET-1 may be responsible for VEGF secretion and to identify the EP receptor subtype involved in this effect in ovarian carcinoma cells, we examined the role of ET-1, PGE2, and EP receptor-specific agonists on VEGF protein production and gene expression by ELISA and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. In HEY cells, ET-1, as well as PGE2, induced a significant increase in VEGF expression and secretion. Among EP agonists tested, only butaprost, an EP2 agonist, and 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2, an EP2–4 agonist, induced an increase in VEGF secretion and mRNA expression (Fig. 3, A and B) with an extent similar to that induced by ET-1 or PGE2. In contrast, 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2, an EP1- and EP3-selective agonist, produced only a weaker VEGF induction, and sulprostone, an EP3 agonist, failed to up-regulate VEGF gene and protein expression (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, we treated HEY cells with ET-1 or PGE2 alone or in combination with SC19220, antagonist, or AH23848, an EP4-specific antagonist, and measured VEGF secretion by ELISA (Fig. 3C). AH23848 significantly reduced the secretion of VEGF after ET-1 and PGE2 stimulation. On the contrary, SC19220 was unable to significantly inhibit ET-1- and PGE2-induced VEGF production (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that ET-1 and PGE2 induce VEGF secretion and that the EP2 and EP4 subtypes are the principal prostaglandin receptors involved in this signaling in ovarian carcinoma cells. ET-1 Induces PGE2 and VEGF Secretion by Src-mediated Transactivation of EGFR—To gain further information on the mechanism by which ET-1 leads to PGE2 and VEGF up-regulation, we evaluated whether ET-1-induced EGFR transactivation could participate in these effects. We previously demonstrated that in ovarian cancer cells, ET-1 rapidly activates Src and that this tyrosine kinase could represent a potential intracellular mediator of EGFR transactivation (30Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41294-41301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 4, ET-1, as well as PGE2, induced a significant increase in the level of EGFR-phosphorylated form (Fig. 4A). Pretreatment of HEY cells with the specific EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478, as well as with the Src-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, significantly reduced both ET-1- and PGE2-induced EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), indicating that activation of Src is essential for ET-1- and PGE2-induced EGFR transactivation. As shown in Fig. 4B, the interruption of EGFR signaling induced by AG1478, as well as by PP2, resulted in a concomitant reduction of PGE2 secretion, as well as of VEGF expression at protein (Fig. 4C, upper panel, and D) and mRNA levels (Fig. 4C, lower panel), indicating that Src-mediated EGFR transactivation is involved in ET-1-induced PGE2 and VEGF production. Taken together, our results delineate a novel mechanism underlying ET-1-induced up-regulation of PGE2 and VEGF expression involving the ET-1-dependent transactivation of EGFR, which requires Src function. ET-1-induced PGE2 Stimulates Cell Invasion and VEGF Production via EP4 Receptors—PGE2 plays a relevant role in modulating the invasive properties of human cancer cells (2Dannenberg A.J.

Thus, we investigated the pathways whereby ETAR-induced EGFR transactivation could impact the invasive behavior via EP receptor signaling. Remarkably, inhibition of ETAR by BQ 123 completely blocked ET-1-induced cell invasion (Fig. 5A) and MMP activity (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that ET-1 signaling is mediated by ETAR. Pretreatment of HEY cells with AG1478, PP2, and AH23848 resulted in a reduction of the ET-1 and PGE2 capacity to induce cell invasion (Fig. 5A) and MMP activity (Fig. 5B), measured by chemoinvasion and MMP gelatinase activity assays, respectively. These data indicate that ET-1 signaling implies ETAR-dependent EGFR transactivation, via Src, leading to cell invasiveness, MMP activity, and VEGF production through the activation of the PGE2-induced EP4 receptor pathway. Epidemiological and clinical studies have clearly defined that COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes play a key role in the progression of ovarian carcinoma (11Denkert C. Kobel M. Pest S. Koch I. Berger S.

The study of PGE2 signaling pathways is becoming essential from the biological as well as from the therapeutic point of view. We previously demonstrated that in ovarian cancer cells, ET-1 induces COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes (25Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Clin.

Recently, much attention has been focused on the identification of ET-1 receptor pathways involved in ovarian cancer progression to characterize potential therapeutic targets in cancer prevention and treatment (23Nelson J.B. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that ET-1 through the binding with ETAR significantly increases PGE2, PGF2α, and PGD2 secretion and EP2 and EP4 receptor subtype expression and that ET-1-induced PGE2 pathways actively participate in promoting VEGF production, MMP activity, and cell invasion. Furthermore, we prove that the ET-1-induced effects involve an active cross-talk between ETAR and EGFR signaling pathways. Cross-talk between cell surface receptors, which has been recognized early as the mechanism capable of expanding the cellular communication signaling network, is now receiving further interest. Receptor cross-talk can, in fact, also occur among distinct families of receptors such as tyrosine kinase receptor and GPCR (32Schäfer B. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 33Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6329-6336PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, we have previously shown that in ovarian cancer cells, EGFR transactivation following ETAR is in part responsible for MAPK activation (24Vacca F. Bagnato A. Catt K.J. Tecce R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5310-5317PubMed Google Scholar) by a ligand-dependent mechanism involving a non-receptor tyrosine kinase such as c-Src (30Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41294-41301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present study, we described that Src-mediated transactivation of EGFR by ET-1 is also responsible for PGE2 and VEGF up-regulation underlying the key role played by the cross-talk between GPCR and tyrosine kinase receptor in tumor biology. In this regard, ETAR-induced EGFR transactivation may serve as a prototype of inter-receptor signaling since multiple, apparently independent, pathways are in fact coactivated by this network (23Nelson J.B. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that ETAR-mediated EGFR transactivation is responsible for ET-1-induced MMP activity and ovarian cancer cell invasion, resulting in tumor progression. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting that transactivation of EGFR by GPCRs is a recurrent theme in cell signaling to promote migration and invasion (32Schäfer B. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 33Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6329-6336PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that in ovarian carcinoma cells, EGFR transactivation by ETAR stimulates the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, leading to the activation of the transcriptional complex β-catenin T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) that is involved in epithelial to mesenchimal transition and in the development of an invasive phenotype. 2L. Rosanò, F. Spinella, V. Di Castro, P. G. Natali, and A. Bagnato, unpublished results. These interconnected signalings allow ETAR to expand the cellular communication network and to amplify its tumor-promoting actions. The natural history of most tumors is invariably characterized by the acquisition of migratory, invasive, and angiogenic phenotype (34Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have demonstrated that in ovarian cancer cells, the ET-1/ETAR pathway contributes to the disruption of host-tumor interaction by impairing the gap junctional intercellular communication system (30Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41294-41301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and promoting tumor invasiveness by up-regulating protease in terms of expression and activity (26Rosanò L. Spinella F. Salani D. Di Castro V. Venuti A. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2447-2453PubMed Google Scholar). Because in ovarian carcinoma cells all the invasive effectors are triggered by the ETAR activation, blockade of this receptor by the specific antagonist ABT-627 results in antitumor effect in the experimental animal model that is associated with decreased microvessel density and MMP-Z, VEGF, and COX-2 expression (25Spinella F. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4670-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Rosanò L. Spinella F. Salani D. Di Castro V. Venuti A. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2447-2453PubMed Google Scholar). There is increased evidence that PGE2 also contributes to tumor progression by promoting tumor angiogenesis and that this effect is mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of VEGF (4Gupta R.A. DuBois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 5Fukuda R. Kelly B. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2330-2334PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously (19Salani D. Taraboletti G. Rosanò L. Di Castro V. Borsotti P. Giavazzi R. Bagnato A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1703-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) that ET-1 was expressed in 84% of the ovarian carcinomas with a strong correlation between ET-1 and VEGF expression and vascularization. Moreover, we demonstrated that, in ovarian carcinoma cell lines, ET-1 stimulates VEGF expression through ETAR and that this effect is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α accumulation and activation (21Bagnato A. Spinella F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 44-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Bagnato A. Tecce R. Moretti C. Di Castro V. Spergel D. Catt K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that, in HEY and OVCA 433 cells, the ET-1-induced PGE2/EP2 and EP4 signaling is involved in VEGF production, indicating that ET-1-induced VEGF expression may be regulated through a dual mechanism including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α activation and PGE2 signaling. The reduction of ET-1-induced VEGF production, cell invasion, and MMP activity by the specific EP4 receptor antagonist strongly suggests that the production of PGE2 by ETAR-mediated EGFR transactivation could activate EP4 receptor-mediated signaling and in turn stimulate angiogenic and migratory action, thus identifying a novel mechanism underlying ET-1/ETAR tumor-promoting properties. This hypothesis is sustained by several observations correlating PGE2-EP4 receptor interaction and tumor phenotype in various tumor types and in other model systems (6Dohadwala M. Batra R.K. Luo J.

Moreover, previous reports demonstrate that EP2 and EP4 receptor transcripts are inducible by cytokine (39Narko K. Saukkonen K. Ketola I. Butzow R. Heikinheimo M. Ristimaki A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that PGE2 may regulate EP4 receptor expression in non-small cell lung cancer cells (6Dohadwala M. Batra R.K. Luo J. Lin Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50828-50833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and EP2/4 receptors in COX-1-transfected cervical carcinoma cells (40Sales K.J. Katz A.A. Howard B. Soeters R.P. Millar R.P. Jabbour H.N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 424-432PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, in endometrial cancer cells, elevated EP2 receptor expression may facilitate the PGE2-induced release of proangiogenic factors (38Sales K.J. Maudsley S. Jabbour H.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The increased EP2 and EP4 receptor expression observed after ET-1 stimulation opens the intriguing possibility of the presence of a positive feedback mechanism in which ET-1-induced PGE2 up-regulation could modulate the expression of PG receptors and in turn facilitate PGE2 activity to enhance and sustain tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ET-1-induced PGE2 promotes the expression and secretion of VEGF and induces invasiveness in ovarian carcinoma cells through EP2 and EP4 receptors via the intracellular transactivation of the EGFR. These data suggest that targeting the PGE2- and EP2- and EP4-related signaling cascade through the blockade of ETARin ovarian carcinoma could effectively impair the transcription of target genes associated with angiogenesis and invasiveness. This study therefore provides further support for the incorporation of ETAR antagonists into clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer. It has been reported that enhanced COX-2, PGE2, and VEGF expression plays a significant role in resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (41Tran J. Master Z. Yu J.L. Rak J. Dumont D.J. Kerbel R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4349-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 42Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that drug resistance may occur from the activation of a non-canonic escaping pathway that can modulate sensitivity to antitumor therapy is now emerging. Because of the potential for compensation, interruption of a single signaling network of transforming molecules will not be curative in late invasive cancers. Therefore, a novel approach to ovarian cancer therapy may be the treatment with multiple selective inhibitors to growth factor receptor or to key post-receptor signaling pathways. In this regard, because multiple signaling networks are coactivated by ETAR, combination treatment with ETAR antagonist may represent a new therapeutic approach to ovarian cancer treatment, which could result in increased susceptibility of the cells to apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2093877167,"We report microstructural and isotopic analyses of two presolar Al2O3 grains. Aluminum oxide is important cosmically, because its presence has been detected in the infrared spectra of the circumstellar envelopes of O-rich asymptotic giant branch stars and because it is predicted to be the first solid to condense in these stellar environments. The two grain structures, one corundum and the other amorphous, confirm that asymptotic giant branch stars produce both phases. The variation in structure and Ti content demonstrates that Al2O3 can condense in the absence of TiO2 seed clusters but that Ti may be important in determining the crystal structure."

Cell recognition molecules play significant roles in the building of neuronal networks in the central nervous system. The cadherin superfamily is a large family of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules, which have been implicated in the morphogenesis of nonneuronal and neuronal tissues (1Yagi T. Takeichi M.

Overexpressed classic cadherins are generally expressed on the cell surface and elicit cell adhesion activity in several cell lines.

The protocadherins (Pcdhs) and cadherin-related neuronal receptor (CNR) are putative trans-synaptic recognition molecules that have six EC domains and a cytoplasmic domain (9Sano K. Tanihara H.

Genes for the CNR/Pcdhs are organized into clusters (termed α (CNR), β, and γ (11Wu Q. Maniatis T.

Genomics. 2000; 63: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Within the α and γ clusters, three exons encode the cytoplasmic domain for each Pcdh, making these domains identical within a cluster. The extracellular regions of Pcdhγ proteins have been shown to mediate weak, homophilic cell adhesion (13Obata S. Sago H. Mori N. Davidson M. St John T. Suzuki S.T. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The CNR/Pcdhα proteins appear not to possess homophilic-binding activity, whereas CNR/Pcdhα-v4 becomes a calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule upon interacting with integrins. The interacting site is an RGD motif in the EC1 region, which is highly conserved among mammalian CNR/Pcdhα members (14Mutoh T. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We previously transfected full-length CNR/Pcdhα-v4 into several cell lines and did not detect the overexpressed protein on the cell surface of L1, Neuro2A, COS7, Chinese hamster ovary, CHP212, or MDCKII cells. In these cell lines, the CNR/Pcdhα-v4 was concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, in HEK293T cells, low levels of CNR/Pcdhα-v4 were detected on the cell surface, although most remained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicated that in the cell lines tested, almost no CNR/Pcdhα protein is transported to the cell surface, except for HEK293T cells, where there is a low level of surface expression (14Mutoh T. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The immunolocalization of Pcdhγs in hippocampal neurons showed it to be strongly expressed on a subpopulation of tubulovesicular structures and to be recruited to the synapse in Pcdhγ-positive neuron pairs (15Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins have molecular features that enable the regulation of their expression on the surface of the synaptic plasma membrane from intracellular compartments. CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ are widely expressed in the brain. Single cell analyses using reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization have revealed that each neuronal cell expresses distinct sets of CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins (10Kohmura N. Senzaki K.

The biochemical and functional interactions of CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ, however, remain unknown. Here we show that CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ formed a protein complex in the brain and neuroblastoma. They bound each other at sites in both their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. Formation of the complex enhanced the cell surface expression of the CNR/Pcdhα proteins. Thus CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins form a hetero-protein complex, which plays a role in the regulation of protein localization to the plasma membrane. Plasmids—Full-length mouse Pcdhγ-a2, -a3, -a12, -b1, -b2, and -b4 were amplified using reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. Full-length mouse CNR/Pcdhα-v4 was tagged by PCR with the c-myc epitope (EQKLOSEEDL), recognized by the 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody. The tag was introduced after amino acid 32 of the nascent CNR/Pcdhα-v4 protein. The CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ deletion mutants were generated by PCR from these full-length and tagged cDNAs. Myc-CNR/Pcdhα-v4delCP (aa 1-724) and delEC (aa 681-947) were generated by PCR reactions from full-length Myc-CNR/Pcdhα-v4. Pcdhγ-a12delCP (aa 1-717) was generated by PCR from full-length Pcdhγ-a12, then cloned into pcDNA3.1. Pcdhγ-a3, -a12, and -b1delCP-Myc were generated by fusing the Myc epitope tag to the carboxyl terminus of Pcdhγ-a3 (aa 1-712), -a12 (aa 1-717), and -b1 (aa 1-702), respectively. Pcdhγ-a12EC-His and Pcdhγ-b1EC-His were generated by fusing His8 to the extracellular domain of Pcdhγ-a12 (aa 1-688) and -b1(aa 1-675). CNR/Pcdhα-v4EC-Myc and CNR/Pcdhα-v7EC-Myc were generated by fusing the myc epitope tag to the extracellular domains of CNR/Pcdhα-v4 (aa 1-695) and -v7 (aa 1-695). GST-CNR/Pcdhα-v4CP was generated by subcloning the cytoplasmic region of CNR/Pcdhα-v4 (aa 722-948) into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The identity of all the constructs was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C1300 and NB2a cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of plasmid DNA into HEK293T cells was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's procedure (Invitrogen). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-CNR/Pcdhα, guinea pig polyclonal anti-Pcdhγ, and rabbit polyclonal anti-Pcdhγ-a12EC1-3 antibodies were raised against GST-Pcdhα-v4 (aa 796-948), GST-Pcdhγ-a12 (aa 809-932), and GST-Pcdhγ-a12EC1-3 (aa 1-347), respectively. The rabbit polyclonal anti-CNR/Pcdhα and guinea pig polyclonal anti-Pcdhγ were affinity-purified by GST fusion protein covalently coupled to NHS-activated Sepharose beads. Another rabbit polyclonal anti-CNRA was prepared as described previously (18Takei Y. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Mutoh T. Sugino H. Yagi T. Genomics. 2001; 72: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal, anti-Pcdhγ-pep, was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to Pcdhγ-a12 (aa 838-852) and purified using the synthetic peptide. The anti-N-cadherin was a kind gift from Dr. Takeichi (Kyoto University). Immunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells were lysed with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. The lysates were spun at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Mouse P7 brains were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose. The homogenate was spun at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant (S1) was spun at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to obtain the pellet fraction (P2). The P2 fraction was lysed with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm EDTA or 1 mm CaCl2 and spun at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant (S3) was used for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of anti-CNRA, anti-CNR/Pcdhα, anti-Pcdhγ-pep, or anti-Pcdhγ at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the sample, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 1 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A or Buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 2% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. In Vitro Binding Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with Pcdhγ-a12, -b2, -a12-delCP-Myc or -b2-delCP-Myc. The transfected cells were lysed with Buffer B containing 1 mm EDTA. The lysates were spun at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST-CNR/Pcdhα-v4CP immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with Buffer B. The Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. CNR/Pcdhα-v4EC-Myc, Pcdhγ-a12EC-His, Pcdhγ-b1EC-His, both CNR/Pcdhα-v4EC-Myc and Pcdhγ-a12EC-His, or both CNR/Pcdhα-v4EC-Myc and Pcdhγ-b1EC-His were transfected into HEK293T cells. Opti-Mem (Invitrogen) supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection. ProBond Resin nickel beads (Invitrogen) or Protein G-Sepharose beads containing immobilized anti-Myc antibodies (1 μg) were incubated with the supernatants for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed with Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100) for nickel beads or Buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100) for Protein G-Sepharose beads. The proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to the PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with anti-His or anti-Myc antibody. Flow Cytometry—Transfected cells were detached from the plates with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EDTA. Detached cells (1 × 106) were incubated with anti-Myc antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the surface expression of the tagged proteins was quantified using an EPICS Altra (Beckman Coulter). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Transfected HEK293T cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and incubated 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS)-S-S-biotin (Pierce) in cold PBS. After washing with ice-cold PBS three times, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and spun at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were added to the supernatants, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the beads were extensively washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Subcellular Fractionation of Mouse Brain—Subcellular fractionation of the mouse brain was performed as described previously (19Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 20Ueda T. Greengard P. Berzins K. Cohen R.S. Blomberg F. Grab D.J. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult mouse brains were homogenized in an ice-cold solution containing 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4, and spun at 1,000 × g and then 13,800 × g, each for 10 min. The resulting pellet (P2) was further fractionated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 82,500 × g for 2 h to obtain the crude synaptosome fraction. This fraction was lysed by osmotic shock, and the lysate was spun at 38,500 × g for 20 min to yield a crude synaptic membrane fraction pellet. The pellet was solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and spun at 201,800 × g for 20 min to obtain the post-synaptic density fraction. Immunohistochemistry—ICR mice (postnatal days 10-14) were used for the immunohistochemical detection of CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins. Mice were deeply anesthetized and decapitated. The brains were rapidly removed and immersed in embedding material (OCT compound, Miles). The brains were quickly frozen by isopentane cooled with dry ice. The fresh-frozen sections were then cut on a cryostat (Leica CM3050) and thaw-mounted on slides. Prior to the immunohistochemical procedure, the sections were fixed with cold methanol (-20 °C) for 15 min. The sections were blocked with blocking reagent for 1 h and then incubated with the affinity-purified antibodies (1 μg/ml) diluted in PBS containing 5% blocking reagent and 0.1% sodium azide, overnight at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the sections were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG in PBS containing 5% blocking reagent for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the sections were rinsed with PBS, coverslipped with glycerol-PBS containing p-phenylenediamine, and analyzed using a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope, Axiovert 135. Hippocampal neurons were prepared as described (21Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). In brief, hippocampi were isolated from ICR mouse embryos (E16.5), dissociated, plated on 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and cultured in Neurobasale medium (Invitrogen) with B27 supplement (Invitrogen). After 14 days in culture, neurons were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and in methanol at –20 °C. HEK293T cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. For blocking, fixed cells were incubated in PBS containing 5% goat normal serum for 30 min in the presence or absence of 0.05% Triton X-100 with the primary antibody, followed by washing with PBS and incubation with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa-594-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG for 1 h. After washing, the cells were mounted in 1% p-phenylenediamine and analyzed using a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope, LSM 410, or an Olympus light microscope, Power BX51. Localization of CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ Proteins—CNR/Pcdhα family proteins are localized, in part, to synaptic regions (10Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishii H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and the Pcdhγ proteins are targeted to subsets of synapses and intracellular organelles in the hippocampal neurons (15Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address the protein localization of both CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ family proteins, we produced affinity-purified antibodies to the constant cytoplasmic domain of CNR/Pcdhα (anti-CNR/Pcdhα) and Pcdhγ (anti-Pcdhγ). The variable exons are cis-spliced to the common exon of the CNR/Pcdhα or Pcdhγ transcript in each gene cluster; therefore, the antibodies should mark the regions in which any of the 14 CNR/Pcdhα or 25 Pcdhγ proteins is localized, respectively. We tested the antibodies for specificity against lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with mouse CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins. The anti-CNR/Pcdhα and anti-Pcdhγ antibodies reacted specifically with the transfected CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins (data not shown). We next evaluated the distribution of the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons. The CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ staining occurred as fine puncta, and their expression patterns were partially colocalized (Fig. 1A). A similar distribution of Pcdhγ was reported for cultured hippocampal neurons (15Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using adult brains, subcellular fractionation analysis showed both CNR/Pcdhαs and Pcdhγs to be concentrated in the synaptic membrane and post-synaptic density fractions (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ are colocalized in the brain. To elucidate their colocalization in the hippocampus, we performed immunostaining with the anti-CNR/Pcdhα and anti-Pcdhγ antibodies. The CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins were both detected in the molecular layers of the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3 regions in the hippocampus (data not shown). At high magnification, the signals of the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins showed similar punctate patterns (Fig. 1C). Double staining analysis revealed some double-stained puncta, in addition to the single-stained puncta (Fig. 1B). That is, the patterns of the puncta stained for CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ, respectively, were not identical, but partially overlapped. The staining pattern and subcellular fractionation of the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins suggested that they might form a complex in vivo. To investigate this possibility, we performed immunoprecipitation analyses of the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins. Lysates from mouse brains at postnatal day 7 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the antibody to CNR/Pcdhαs (anti-CNRA) followed by immunoblotting with anti-Pcdhγ-pep, an antibody raised against the Pcdhγ-a12 peptide. As shown as in Fig. 2A, Pcdhγ was identified as a 100- to 120-kDa band and coimmunoprecipitated with CNR/Pcdhαs. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of the lysate with anti-Pcdhγ-pep followed by immunoblotting with anti-CNRA revealed an association between CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ. N-cadherin and Pcdhγ proteins are reported to be detected in the same fractions of synaptic components and intracellular membranes (15Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5096-5104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither CNR/Pcdhα nor Pcdhγ formed a protein complex with N-cadherin (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that CNR/Pcdhα specifically associates with Pcdhγ in vivo. To further confirm the protein interaction between CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ in vivo, we used two neuroblastoma cell lines, C1300/N1 and NB2a, which endogenously express both proteins. Fig. 2B shows that extracts immunoprecipitated with the anti-CNRA antibody contained CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins. This result indicated that CNR/Pcdhα also specifically associated with Pcdhγ in neuroblastoma cells. Both CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ have putative calcium-binding motifs, which are conserved in the cadherin family. In the classic cadherins, the calcium-binding motifs are necessary for homophilic binding activity. To test the effect of calcium ions on the association between the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins, we performed the coimmunoprecipitation analysis in the presence of 1 mm of calcium ions or EDTA. Regardless of the presence of calcium ions or EDTA, CNR/Pcdhα associated with Pcdhγ, suggesting that the formation of the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ complex was independent of calcium ions (Fig. 2C). To examine the features of the binding between the CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins, we used HEK293T cells that were transiently transfected with CNR/Pcdhα-v4 (= CNR1 in Ref. 10Kohmura N. Senzaki K.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) or Pcdhγ-a12 (= Pcdh2c in Ref. 9Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or both. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed and their proteins immunoprecipitated using the anti-CNRA or anti-Pcdhγ-pep polyclonal antibodies. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The blots were probed with the anti-Pcdhα or anti-Pcdhγ antibody, which detected the coimmunoprecipitation of CNR/Pcdhα-v4 and Pcdhγ-a12 (Fig. 3A). To further examine whether CNR/Pcdhα-v4 could be coimmunoprecipitated with other Pcdhγs, we used HEK293T cells transformed with CNR/Pcdhα-v4 and expression vectors for Pcdhγ-a1, -a3, -b2, or -b4. The immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the CNR/Pcdhα-v4 protein could interact with all the Pcdhγ proteins tested (Fig. 3B). Similarly, when we examined the binding activity of CNR/Pcdhα-v7 protein against each Pcdhγ-a1, -a3, -b2, or -b4, the CNR/Pcdhα-v7 protein could also associate with all the Pcdhγ proteins tested (Fig. 3B). These data suggested that different CNR/Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins can interact with each other. CNR/Pcdhα Associated with Pcdhγ at Regions in Their Cytoplasmic and Extracellular Domains—Using PCR amplification from full-length CNR/Pcdhα or Pcdhγ, we constructed deletion, chimeric, Myc-tagged, or His-tagged constructs and subcloned them into mammalian expression vectors or bacterial expression vectors, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These protein structures are shown in Fig. 4. To identify the domain of CNR/Pcdhα-v4 responsible for its interaction with Pcdhγ, we performed a GST pull-down assay with a bacterially produced GST and GST-CNR/Pcdhα-v4CP, which contained only the cytoplasmic domain of CNR/Pcdhα-v4, against full-length Pcdhγ-a12 or -b2 proteins, or these proteins with the cytoplasmic region deleted, Pcdhγ-a12delCP and -b2delCP. We could detect GST-CNR/Pcdhα-v4CP binding to the full-length Pcdhγ-a12 and -b2 proteins, but not to Pcdhγ-a12delCP or -b2delCP (Fig. 5A). The control, GST protein alone, did not interact with any of the Pcdhγ proteins used here. These results indicated that the cytoplasmic region of CNR/Pcdhα had binding activity with the cytoplasmic region of the Pcdhγ proteins. To further examine the interaction between CNR/Pcdhα with Pcdhγ, we constructed expression vectors, Pcdhγ-EC-His and CNR/Pcdhα-EC-Myc, that contained only the extracellular domains of Pcdhγ and CNR/Pcdhα. The carboxyl terminus of Pcdhγ was tagged with His8 and that of CNR/Pcdhα was tagged with the Myc-epitope. The Pcdhγ-a12-EC-His or -b1-EC-His was then transfected into HEK293T cells along with the control vector or CNR/Pcdhα-v4-EC-Myc. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the proteins tagged with His or Myc were affinity-purified from the culture medium using a nickel column or Protein G-Sepharose containing immobilized anti-Myc antibody. The purified proteins were then detected by Western blotting with an anti-His or anti-Myc antibody. All the tagged proteins were affinity-purified: the His-tagged and Myc-tagged proteins were pulled down by the nickel column and anti-Myc antibody, respectively. In addition, the association of CNR/Pcdhα-v4EC-Myc with Pcdhγ-a12-EC-His or with -b1-EC-His was also detected in the culture mediums from HEK293 cells coexpressing both CNR/Pcdhα-EC-Myc and Pcdhγ-EC-His (Fig. 5B). Thus, the extracellular domains of CNR/Pcdhα-EC and Pcdhγ-EC associated with each other. We also confirmed that the extracellular domain of CNR/Pcdhα-v7 also binds to that of Pcdhγ-a12 and -b1 (data not shown). The above results indicated that the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions of the CNR/Pcdhα protein could interact with those of the Pcdhγ protein. To further confirm these interactions, we performed immunoprecipitation assays of the full-length Pcdhγ proteins (Pcdhγ-a12 and -b2) with extracellular domain-deleted CNR/Pcdhα-v4 (Myc-CNR/Pcdhα-v4delEC) or cytoplasmic region-deleted CNR/Pcdhα-v4 (Myc-CNR/Pcdhα-v4delCP). Transfected cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody. Both the Pcdhγ-a12 and -b2 full-length proteins were detected in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with both the extracellular- and cytoplasmic domain-deleted CNR/Pcdhα-v4, using the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 5C). These data indicated that both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of CNR/Pcdhα could interact with full-length Pcdhγ. There appeared to be slightly more Pcdhγ precipitated with the delCP than with the delEC protein, suggesting that the EC regions were more tightly associated than the cytoplasmic regions. Pcdhγ Increased the Cell Surface Expression of CNR/Pcdhα—In previous reports, we demonstrated that CNR/Pcdhα-v4 overexpressed in several cell lines was detected mainly in the cytoplasm and hardly at all on the cell surface (10Kohmura N.

Interestingly, the cellular localization of the Myc-CNR/Pcdhα-v4 protein was different when it was expressed alone versus when it was coexpressed with Pcdhγ-a12 (Fig. 6). Witho"
https://openalex.org/W2168207023,"OREBP (osmotic response element-binding protein), also called TonEBP or NFAT5, is thought to induce the expression of genes that increase the accumulation of organic osmolytes to protect cells against a hypertonic environment. To investigate the consequences of lacking OREBP activity, transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress OREBPdn (dominant negative form of OREBP) specifically in the epithelial cells of the renal collecting tubules were generated. These mice showed impairment in their urine concentrating mechanism, most likely due to reduced expression of the aquaporin AQP2 and the urea transporter UT-A1 and UT-A2 mRNAs. When deprived of water or after the administration of a vasopressin analogue, urine osmolality of the Tg mice was significantly increased but not to the same extent as that of the wild type mice. The expression of AQP2 and UT-A1, but not UT-A2 mRNAs, was increased to the same level as that of the wild type mice in the water deprivation state, indicating that the vasopressin regulatory mechanism was not affected by OREBPdn. These data indicate that in addition to vasopressin, OREBP is another essential regulator of the urine concentrating mechanism. Furthermore, the OREBPdn Tg mice developed progressive hydronephrosis soon after weaning, confirming the osmoprotective function of OREBP implicated by the in vitro experiments.

The mammalian kidney plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of osmolality and the electrolyte concentrations of the circulating fluid. The osmolality of the kidney inner medulla is highly hypertonic to facilitate the reabsorption of water from the urine. The cells in the collecting tubules guard against hypertonic stress by increasing the synthesis or import of several organic “compatible” osmolytes. These include sorbitol, which is synthesized by the enzyme aldose reductase, and betaine, myo-inositol, and taurine, which are imported by the betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter, the Na+-dependent myo-inositol transporter, and taurine transporter, respectively (1Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The transcription of these genes is induced by a hypertonic medium and regulated by a protein called the osmotic response element-binding protein (OREBP) 1The abbreviations used are: OREBP, osmotic response element-binding protein; ORE, osmotic response element; OREBPdn, dominant negative form of OREBP; AVP, arginine vasopressin; dDAVP, 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin; AQP, aquaporin; CsA, cyclosporine A; DBA, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin; IMCD, inner medullary collecting ducts; Ntg, non-transgenic; Tg, transgenic; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; UT, urea transporter.

This protein is also called NFAT5 because of its homology to the NFAT family of transcription factors (4Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). OREBP consists of a nuclear localization signal near the N terminus followed by a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain, and a transactivation domain at the carboxyl end. Upon stimulation by hypertonicity, it is rapidly translocated into the nucleus and binds to the osmotic response elements (OREs) (5Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Jung K.Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) in the promoter region of the osmoprotective genes (2Ko B.C. Turck C.W. Lee K.W. Yang Y. Chung S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to stimulate transcription. OREBP is highly expressed in the inner medulla as well as in the inner stripe of the outer medulla in the rat kidney (6Cha J.H. Woo S.K. Han K.H. Kim Y.H. Handler J.S. Kim J. Kwon H.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to water loading, OREBP in the initial portion of the inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs) is primarily located in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. In dehydrated animals, most of the protein is found in the nucleus of these cells, supporting its role as a hypertonicity-stimulated transcription enhancer for the osmolyte-accumulating genes. Interestingly, in the middle and terminal portions of the IMCD, OREBP is located in the nucleus of the cells in both euhydrated and dehydrated animals. This may be due to the fact that the osmolality in this region of the medulla is high even in the euhydrated state, and, hence, OREBP is constitutively activated. Because the activity of OREBP is primarily deduced from cell culture experiments and its in vivo functions are inferred from correlation studies, we developed OREBP gene knock-out mice to determine its physiological functions. Unfortunately, these mice died at embryonic stages. 2A. K. M. Lam, B. C. B. Ko, S. K. Chung, and S. S. M. Chung, unpublished results. Because the postulated role of OREBP is to induce the expression of genes that might provide protection against hypertonic stress in the kidney, we therefore developed transgenic mice (Tg) that overexpress, specifically in the renal collecting tubules, a dominant negative form of OREBP (OREBPdn) to determine its role in kidney function. These Tg mice developed polyuria and polydipsia, indicating that OREBP is an important regulator for the urine concentrating mechanism. These mice also developed progressive bilateral hydronephrosis, confirming the role of OREBP as a regulator of osmoprotective genes. Generation of OREBPdn Tg Mice—OREBPdn Tg mice were developed by injecting the vector DNA as shown in Fig. 1a into fertilized F1 (C57BL/6J X CBA hybrid) oocytes. Tg mice were identified by PCR amplification using a pair of PCR primers, pFLAG1 (5′-TAAGCTAGCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG-3′) and Rp4 (5′-GGATATTGTCCACACAACATAGGGC-3′), and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization using the transgene as a probe. All Tg mice used in the experiments were heterozygous Tg mice that had been backcrossed with the C57BL/6J strain for four generations. Animal Care and Metabolic Cages Studies—Mice were kept in daily 12-h light and 12-h dark cycles with free access to standard mouse chow and water unless stated otherwise. Mice were kept individually in metabolic cages for the measurement of water consumption and urine output. For water deprivation experiments, water bottles were removed for 24 h, and urine samples collected by spontaneous voiding before and after the 24 h water deprivation period. To study the effects of 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) administration, urine samples were collected by spontaneous voiding just before injection and 2 h after intraperitoneal injection of dDAVP (0.4 μg/kg of body weight). Body weights were recorded before and after the 24-h water deprivation. Assays for Urine and Serum Electrolytes—Serum samples were collected by cardiac punctures. Serum sodium, potassium, calcium, chlorine, urea, and creatinine levels were measured with a Hitachi-747 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostic). Urine samples were collected from the metabolic cages in a 24-h period, and sodium, potassium, calcium, chlorine, urea, and creatinine levels were measured with the Synchron CX5 analyzer (Beckman-Coulter Inc.). Urine osmolality was measured by the vapor pressure method using the Vapro vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor Inc.). Serum osmolality was measured by the freezing depression method using the Advanced Micro-Osmometer 3300 (Advanced Instruments, Inc.). The urine arginine vasopressin (AVP) level was measured by a competitive enzyme assay method with an AVP enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs Inc.). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (15 μg/lane) extracted from the medulla was separated by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane. Hybridization was carried out using 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The OREBPdn DNA fragment was used as the probe for detecting the transgene, and the aldose reductase cDNA containing exons 5–8 (7Ho H.T.

Probes for detecting the aquaporin and urea transporter transcripts were amplified by PCR using the mouse kidney cDNA library as a template (Clontech) and cloned into the pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen). AQP2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF020519) was amplified using forward primer (bp 1–24) and reverse primer (bp 816–793).

To determine whether the transgene was expressed in the renal tubule epithelial cells, kidney sections were co-incubated with primary antibody against the FLAG epitope along with 100 μg/ml the fluorescein-conjugated collecting duct epithelial cell marker Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and subsequently with a TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes). The sections were mounted in Fluorsave™ Reagent (Calbiochem), and photomicrographs were taken. Renal Inner Medullary Epithelial Cell Culture—Epithelial cells from the inner medullary collecting duct were prepared as described (14Zhang Z. Cai Q. Michea L. Dmitrieva N.I. Andrews P. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F302-F308Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The renal collecting duct epithelial cells were confirmed by staining with a monoclonal epithelium-specific antigen antibody (1:200 dilution; clone VU-1D9; Sigma) and fluorescein-conjugated-DBA. The cells were mounted with Fluorsave™ Reagent and examined with a confocal microscope. Total RNA from the epithelial cell cultures was isolated using the Absolutely RNA reverse transcription PCR mini prep kit (Stratagene). Treatment with OPC-31260 —The orally active V2R antagonist OPC31260 (a gift from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 60 mg/ml. Mice were allowed free access to water and food until 3 h before the start of the experiment, at which time the water bottles were removed and urine was collected by spontaneous voiding. These mice were then divided into four groups as follows: 1) those with free access to water; 2) those with free access to water and OPC31260; 3) those with no access to water; and 4) those with no access to water but with OPC31260. OPC31260 was administered at 0 and 6 h by gastric tube at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight. At 12 h urine was collected by spontaneous voiding, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their kidneys were collected for RNA extraction. Generation of Tg Mice That Overexpress the OREBPdn Specifically in the Epithelial Cells of the Collecting Tubules—It has been shown that a mutant OREBP lacking the transactivation domain inhibits the function of a normal OREBP (3Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 15Trama J. Go W.Y. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore fused part of the mouse OREBP cDNA containing the amino acid residues 57–562 (and lacking 56 amino acids at the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal transactivating domains) to the kidney-specific cadherin promoter that has been shown to direct the expression of heterologous genes specifically in the epithelial cells of the renal collecting tubules (16Igarashi P. Shashikant C.S. Thomson R.B. Whyte D.A. Liu-Chen S. Ruddle F.H. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F599-F610PubMed Google Scholar). A FLAG epitope was inserted at the amino terminus of OREBPdn to facilitate the detection of transgene expression (Fig. 1a). The Tg mice were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization (data not shown). Ten lines of Tg mice were developed, and three lines were found to express detectable levels of the transgene. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of OREBPdn was only present in the kidney of the transgenic mice and not in the other tissues tested, including the brain, lung, liver, and heart (Fig. 1b). All three lines of mice had similar polyuric and polydipsic phenotypes (see below), and data from one of the lines (line 4449) are shown here. Immunocytochemical staining of OREBPdn (Fig. 1c) showed that the expression of OREBPdn was primarily localized in the medullary region of the kidney and, to a lesser extent, in the cortical region as well. To verify that the transgene was expressed in the collecting ducts, fluorescein-conjugated DBA, a lectin that specifically binds to the cells of the collecting duct, and antibodies against the FLAG epitope were used to confirm the site of the transgenic expression. As shown in Fig. 1d, cells expressing the transgene were also positive for fluorescein-DBA staining. Furthermore, there is no detectable transgenic expression in the glomeruli, proximal tubules, and loop of Henle. Collectively, these data demonstrated that the expression of the transgene was located exclusively in the collecting ducts of the kidney. Phenotypic Analysis of the Tg Mice—The OREBPdn Tg mice were viable and fertile. However, ∼9% of Tg mice died around 6–9 months. The body weights of the Tg mice were 15–30% less than that of their non-transgenic (Ntg) littermates. The average body weight of the 5-week-old Ntg mice was 19.01 ± 0.48 g and that of the age-matched Tg mice was 15.28 ± 0.46 g (p < 0.001). The Tg mice exhibited marked polyuria and polydipsia. Measured at 5 weeks after birth, the volume of the urine excreted in 24 h was 0.088 ± 0.005 ml/g body weight for the Ntg mice and 0.418 ± 0.037 ml/g body weight for the Tg mice (p < 0.001), and the volume of water consumed in 24 h was 0.454 ± 0.024 ml/g body weight for the Ntg mice and 1.122 ± 0.052 ml/g body weight for the Tg mice (p < 0.001). Around 8 weeks after birth, the kidneys of most of the Tg mice began to develop progressive bilateral hydronephrosis (Fig. 2a). Histological examination revealed that the kidneys of the 5-week-old Tg mice appeared quite normal except that some had dilation of the collecting tubules in the cortical region (Fig. 2c). Kidneys from the 8-week-old Tg mice typically showed atrophy of the renal medulla and cortical thinning (Fig. 2b). Kidneys with severe hydronephrosis were enlarged and accompanied by the loss of the medulla structure. However, the severity of the kidney lesion varied even among the Tg siblings within the same litter. This may explain why some Tg mice died within a few months after birth, whereas others survived beyond 9 months. Urine Concentrating Ability of the Tg Mice—To assess the urine concentrating ability of the Tg mice, urine from the 5-week-old Tg mice and their Ntg littermates was collected in a 24 h period, during which time they had free access to water. The osmolality of the urine, as well as the urinary concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ions from the Tg mice, was significantly lower than that from the Ntg mice (Table I), indicating that the Tg mice may have developed primary polydipsia or that their urine concentrating mechanism was impaired. However, the serum osmolality and urea concentrations were significantly higher in the Tg mice, suggesting these mice develop a defect in their urine concentrating mechanism (Table I). There was no significant difference between the Tg and Ntg mice in the amounts of AVP excreted in 24-h period, suggesting that there is no significant difference in the levels of the circulating AVP between the Tg and Ntg mice.Table IUrine and serum solutes of Ntg and Tg mice under the water ad libitum condition Values are means ± S.E.

After 24 h of water deprivation, the Ntg mice lost 12.9 ± 0.83% of their body weight, whereas the Tg mice lost 20.89 ± 0.98% (p < 0.0001, n = 12), indicating that the water conservation mechanism in the Tg mice was not as efficient as that of the Ntg mice. However, the water-deprived Tg mice were able to partially concentrate their urine, as the osmolality of the urine was significantly increased, suggesting that the kidneys in the Tg mice were responsive to AVP activation but not to the same extent as the kidneys from the Ntg mice (Fig. 3a). This was confirmed by intraperitoneal injection of dDAVP. The osmolality of the urine from Tg mice administered with dDAVP was significantly higher than that from mice receiving a bolus injection. Similar to the water deprivation situation, the increase in urine osmolality in the Tg mice was much less than those in the Ntg mice (Fig. 3a). These results demonstrated that the AVP-dependent water reabsorption system was functional in the Tg mice, although not as effective as that of the Ntg mice. Expression of Aquaporin and Urea Transporter mRNAs in the Tg Mice under Water ad Libitum and Water-deprivation Conditions—UT-A, AQP2, and AQP3 are important for the water reabsorption in the kidney. To determine whether the impairment in the urine concentrating ability in the Tg mice was due to the abnormal expression of these genes, their mRNA levels in the kidney medulla were assessed by Northern blot hybridization. As shown in Fig. 4a under the condition when the mice had free access to water, the AQP2 mRNA level of the Tg mice was significantly down-regulated, whereas the expression of AQP3 mRNA (Fig. 4b) was not affected. Moreover, UT-A1 and UT-A2 mRNA levels were also significantly lower in the Tg mice (Fig. 4c). Western blot experiments confirmed that the AQP2 and UT-A1 protein levels in the inner medulla of the Tg mice were dramatically reduced under the water ad libitum condition (Fig. 4e). Interestingly, when the mice were deprived of water, the levels of AQP2 and UT-A1 mRNAs in the Tg mice were elevated to the same extent as that of their Ntg littermates (Fig. 4, a and c), indicating that the AVP regulatory system was not affected by OREBPdn. Expression of Aquaporin and Urea Transporter mRNAs in Renal Epithelial Cells of the Tg Mice—It is possible that the down-regulation of AQP-2 and UT-A was an indirect effect of polyuria or a consequence of structural changes resulting from loss of OREBP activity and not due to the negative interference by OREBPdn. This possibility was tested by assessing the level of expression of these genes in renal epithelial cell cultures where the osmolalities of the culture media were kept constant and the hormonal effects of diuresis were absent. Similar to the in vivo situation, renal epithelial cells from the Tg mice showed a dramatic reduction in the expression of AQP2, UT-A1, and UT-A2 mRNA (Fig. 4d), indicating that the down-regulation of these genes was the direct effect of OREBPdn. In the epithelial cells from the Tg mice, the mRNA level of aldose reductase was reduced to 50% that of the Ntg mice (data not shown), indicating that OREBPdn did inhibit the expression of osmoprotective genes. Effect of OPC-31260 on Urine Concentrating Mechanism in Tg Mice—To further confirm that OREBP and AVP are independent regulators of the water reabsorption mechanism in the kidney, OREBPdn Tg and Ntg mice were treated with OPC-31260, a V2R antagonist (17Yamamura Y. Ogawa H. Yamashita H. Chihara T. Miyamoto H. Nakamura S. Onogawa T. Yamashita T. Hosokawa T. Mori T. Tominaga M. Yabuchi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 18Tsuboi Y. Ishikawa S. Fujisawa G. Okada K. Saito T. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 143: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), under water ad libitum and water deprivation conditions. Under the water ad libitum condition in the Ntg mice, OPC-31260 dramatically lowered the urine osmolality as expected, indicating the significance of AVP in regulating water reabsorption (Fig. 3b). In the OREBPdn Tg mice the low urine osmolality was further reduced by the V2R antagonist, indicating that the AVP-V2R system was functional in the absence of OREBP activity. The urine osmolality of the OPC-31260-treated Tg mice was significantly lower than that of the OPC-31260-treated Ntg mice (135 ± 45.56 mosmol/kg versus 335.2 ± 42.32 mosmol/kg; p < 0.05), suggesting an additive effect of OREBPdn and the V2R antagonist in blocking water reabsorption in the kidney. Under the water deprivation condition, OPC-31260 also significantly lowered the urine osmolality in the Ntg and Tg mice (Fig. 3c). Similar to the situation in mice under ad libitum condition, under the water deprivation condition the osmolality of the OPC-31260-treated Tg mice was significantly lower than that of the OPC-31260-treated Ntg mice (656.3 ± 56.64 mosmol/kg versus 1864 ± 139.3 mosmol/kg; p < 0.001). The dual control of the urine concentrating mechanism by OREBP and AVP was reflected in the level of AQP2 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 3d, OPC-31260 significantly reduced the levels of AQP2 mRNA in the Ntg mice under ad libitum and water deprivation conditions, indicating that AVP is required for its expression under both conditions. In the OREBPdn Tg mice, similar to the results in the previous section, the AQP2 mRNA was greatly reduced in the water ad libitum state but restored to a level similar to that of the Ntg mice under the water deprivation condition, suggesting that OREBP is involved in the regulation of expression of this gene in the water ad libitum state but not in the water deprivation state. We demonstrated that the inhibition of OREBP activity in the epithelial cells of the kidney collecting tubules dramatically impaired the urine concentrating mechanism. This was not due to hydronephrosis in the OREBPdn Tg mice, because all the urine and mRNA measurements were done on 5-week-old mice, which had no significant structural abnormality in their kidneys. The decrease in urine concentrating ability is due in part to the down-regulation of UT-A1, UT-A2, and AQP2 expressions. It is generally accepted that urea accumulation in the renal inner medulla is important for the maintenance of maximal urinary concentrating ability and that UT-A1 and UT-A2 play important roles in the urea accumulation process (19Sands J.M. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Sands J.M. Nonoguchi H. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F823-F832PubMed Google Scholar). UT-A1, located in the terminal segment of the IMCD, transports urea from the lumen to the interstitium, whereas UT-A2, located in short and long descending limbs of the loops of Henle, transports urea from the interstitium back into the lumen of the duct to complete the cycle. Therefore, it is likely that down-regulation of these two genes would reduce urea recycling and impair the ability of the kidney to conserve water. Aquaporins are also crucial for water reabsorption. They greatly increase the water permeability of the collecting ducts. AQP2 in particular, is the major water channel in the apical membrane of the collecting duct's principal cells. In humans, defective AQP2 causes hereditary diabetes insipidus (21Deen P.M. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). AQP2 gene knock-out mice also have a severe defect in water reabsorption, leading to early death (22Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2775-2779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation of this gene would also cause impairment in urine concentration. It is well established that AVP, acting through its receptor V2R, regulates water reabsorption in the kidney by regulating the expression of aquaporin (AQP) and urea transporter (UT-A) genes as well as the intracellular translocation of some of their gene products (23Promeneur D. Bankir L. Hu M.C. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1359-1366PubMed Google Scholar, 24Marples D. Knepper M.A. Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C655-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is also evidence that some of these genes are regulated by a mechanism independent of AVP. UT-A2 is induced in mIMCD3 cells grown in hypertonic medium in the absence of AVP (25Leroy C. Basset G. Gruel G. Ripoche P. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Rousselet G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Nakayama Y. Naruse M. Karakashian A. Peng T. Sands J.M. Bagnasco S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the IMCD cell cultures hypertonicity evokes a large increase in AQP2 expression (27Storm R. Klussmann E. Geelhaar A. Rosenthal W. Maric K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F189-F198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and in the V2R antagonist-treated rat cultures dehydration leads to an up-regulation of AQP2 protein and a partial restoration of the urine concentrating ability of the cells (28Marples D. Christensen B.M. Frokiaer J. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F400-F409PubMed Google Scholar). There are suggestions that OREBP may be involved in the AVP-independent induction of these genes (26Nakayama Y. Naruse M. Karakashian A. Peng T. Sands J.M. Bagnasco S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol.

Physiol. 1991; 261: F554-F566PubMed Google Scholar), but evidence is unclear. UT-A2 is one of the four isoforms of urea transporters. UT-A1, -A3 and -A4 are alternately spliced mRNAs of the same transcript initiating from the UT-Aα promoter at the 5′-end of the gene, whereas UT-A2 is transcribed from an internal UT-Aβ promoter of the same gene (26Nakayama Y. Naruse M. Karakashian A. Peng T. Sands J.M. Bagnasco S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Fenton R.A. Cottingham C.A. Stewart G.S. Howorth A.

Physiol. 2001; 281: F400-F406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An ORE consensus sequence is located in the UT-Aα promoter, but there is no ORE sequence in the internal UT-Aβ promoter responsible for UT-A2 transcription (32Fenton R.A. Cottingham C.A. Stewart G.S. Howorth A. Hewitt J.A. Smith C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F630-F638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An ORE consensus sequence is also present in the promoter region of AQP2 gene (27Storm R. Klussmann E. Geelhaar A. Rosenthal W. Maric K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F189-F198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear if it is functional. Our findings that UT-A1 and AQP2 mRNA expression was down-regulated by OREBPdn suggests that the OREs in the promoters of these gene are functional. The down-regulation of UT-A2 is somewhat puzzling. Although its expression is also induced by hypertonicity independent of AVP (25Leroy C. Basset G. Gruel G. Ripoche P. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Rousselet G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), its promoter does not contain the ORE sequence. Moreover, it is predominantly expressed in the descending limbs of the loops of Henle where the OREBPdn transgene was not expressed at a detectable level, suggesting that the down-regulation of UT-A2 may be an indirect effect of the overexpression of OREBPdn in the collecting ducts. Interestingly, the primary cultures of renal epithelial cells express UT-A2 mRNA, presumably due to dedifferentiation. Nevertheless, the cells from the Tg mice also showed down-regulation of UT-A2 mRNA, indicating that OREBPdn could directly down-regulate its expression. It is possible that the expression of UT-A2 is regulated by OREBP via the ORE sequence located in the upstream UT-Aα promoter for UT-A1 or another enhancer site far from the UT-Aβ promoter (32Fenton R.A. Cottingham C.A. Stewart G.S. Howorth A. Hewitt J.A. Smith C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F630-F638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear why UT-A2 expression is down-regulated by an OREBPdn mutation in vivo. One possible explanation is that the transgenic OREBPdn was expressed at low levels in the descending loops of Henle, undetectable by immunocytochemical analysis but sufficient to interfere with the expression of UT-A2. It is also possible that the down-regulation of UT-A2 by OREBPdn is a consequence of polyuria or other indirect effects of OREBP suppression. Our data show that in addition to AVP, OREBP is another essential regulator of the urine concentrating mechanism and that its action is independent of AVP. This finding was demonstrated by the fact that AVP and OREBP regulate the aquaporin and urea transporter genes differently. The osmolality of the urine from the OREBPdn Tg mice was increased when they were deprived of water for 24 h or when they were injected with dDAVP, but it was much lower than the osmolality of the urine from the similarly treated Ntg mice. Northern blot experiments revealed that water deprivation induced the expression of AQP2 and UT-A1 in the Tg mice to the same level as that of the Ntg mice, indicating that the AVP-V2R system was unaffected by OREBPdn. However, UT-A2 expression in the Tg mice was not increased by water deprivation, making them unable to concentrate their urine to the same osmolality as that of the Ntg mice. These results indicate that under the water ad libitum condition, OREBP is essential for the expression for AQP2, UT-A1, and UT-A2. In the water deprivation state the expression of AQP2 and UT-A1 is entirely under the control of AVP, whereas the expression of UT-A2 is induced by OREBP. During the preparation of this manuscript, the development of NFAT5 null mutant mice was reported (34Lopez-Rodriguez C. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Lin F. Novobrantseva T.I. Bronson R.T. Igarashi P. Rao A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Similar to what we observed for our OREBP knock-out mice, the homozygous NFAT5 mutant mice died at the embryonic stages, except that a few managed to survive to adulthood (7 of the expected 205). These mice showed severe renal atrophy with loss of nephrons and marked reduction in the levels of aldose reductase, betaine transporter, and sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporter mRNAs. Renal atrophy in these NFAT5 mutant mice was attributed to the reduced expression of these osmoprotective genes. The morphology of the kidneys of the NFAT-5 null mutant mice is somewhat different from that of the OREBPdn Tg mice, presumably because the OREBPdn transgene was only expressed in the epithelial cells of the collecting ducts. The cause of hydronephrosis in the OREBPdn Tg mice needs further investigation. It could be the consequence of the reduced expression of osmoprotective genes. On the other hand, hydronephrosis may be a consequence of polyuria because other animals with defective urine concentrating mechanism also exhibit similar hydropic renal morphology (35Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Kihara M. Umemura S. Sumida Y. Yokoyama N. Yabana M. Nyui N. Tamura K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Ishii M. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 548-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Chronic treatment with the powerful immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA) often causes renal injuries as manifested by polyuria, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis (37Burdmann E.A. Andoh T.F. Yu L. Bennett W.M. Semin. Nephrol. 2003; 23: 465-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CsA blocks the nuclear translocation of OREBP and consequently inhibits the hypertonic activation of the ORE-mediated reporter gene transcription and induction of osmoprotective genes (38Sheikh-Hamad D. Nadkarni V. Choi Y.J. Truong L.D. Wideman C. Hodjati R. Gabbay K.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2732-2741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report shows that long-term administration of CsA to the rats decreases the expression of aquaporins and urea transporters in their kidneys, accounting for the polyuric effect of CsA (39Lim S.W. Li C. Sun B.K. Han K.H. Kim W.Y. Oh Y.W. Lee J.U. Kador P.F. Knepper M.A. Sands J.M. Kim J. Yang C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F139-F151Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the urine volume and urine osmolality of the CsA-treated rats were normalized by dDAVP treatment, indicating that CsA did not affect the AVP-V2R regulatory system. These findings, together with our observation that OREBPdn down-regulates AQP2, UT-A1, and UT-A2 to impair the urine concentrating ability, suggest that the polyuric effect of CsA is in part due to its inhibition of OREBP. Because OREBPdn Tg mice develop severe kidney lesions, it will be interesting to determine whether other aspects of CsA nephrotoxicity such as tubular atrophy and interstitium fibrosis may also be the consequence of inhibition of OREBP.

During this interval, referred to as the Middle Paleozoic Marine Revolution, the diversity of shell-crushing predators increased, and antipredatory morphologies among invertebrate prey, such as crinoids, became more common. Crinoid arm regeneration data suggest an increase in nonlethal attacks at this time and represent a causal link between those patterns, which implies an important role for predator-driven evolution."

Mammalian SWI/SNF is a chromatin-remodeling complex involved in the modulation of gene expression. We demonstrate that Brahma (Brm) and Brahma/SWI2-related gene 1 (Brg-1), alternative ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF, potentiate reporter gene activation mediated by HIF-1 in an ATPase-dependent manner. Brm was more potent than Brg-1 in the reporter gene assays. Simultaneous depletion of both Brm and Brg-1 by small interfering RNAs significantly compromised the transcription of the endogenous EPO gene triggered by hypoxia. Whereas knocking down Brm alone resulted in a moderate reduction in transcription of the EPO gene, depletion of Brg-1 resulted in an augmentation of transcription of both the EPO gene and the Brm gene, indicating that Brm can compensate for loss of Brg-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP (re-ChIP) analysis showed that both Brm and Brg-1 associate with the enhancer region of the EPO gene in vivo in a hypoxia-dependent fashion and that each is present in a complex with HIF-1. Brm and Brg-1 were also recruited to the promoter of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene in a hypoxia-dependent fashion, although hypoxic induction of VEGF transcription was not affected by depletions of either or both Brm and Brg-1. Together these studies reveal a novel role for SWI/SNF in the activation of transcription of the EPO gene, indicate an important communication and compensation between Brm and Brg-1, and suggest that the requirement for SWI/SNF during hypoxic induction is gene-specific.

In general, gene expression is not determined by the simple additive influences of individual transcription factor binding sites. Adjacent sites interact with each other to produce effects that range from repressive to highly synergistic. Multiprotein complexes involving transcription factors, coactivator proteins, and other proteins are thought to integrate signals and create the specificity and control required for the precise regulation of gene transcription. Despite similarities among hypoxia-responsive genes, there are important differences. Whereas EPO expression can be induced as much as 100-fold, other responses to hypoxia are less robust. Hypoxic inducibility can be modulated by other environmental stimuli as well as tissue-specific cues (12Semenza G.L. Koury S.T. Nejfelt M.K. Gearhart J.D. Antonarakis S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8725-8729Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of the EPO gene is achieved by the concerted action of several transacting factors interacting with the proximal promoter region and with the 3′-untranslated region of the gene (13Semenza G.L.

In the 3′-untranslated region there is a hypoxia-responsive enhancer element located 120 bp 3′ from the polyadenylation site. This enhancer element is functionally tripartite. One site binds HIF-1 (17Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). The second site is necessary for transactivation of the EPO gene mediated by HIF-1, but factors interacting with this site have not yet been described. The third is a binding site for the orphan receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (18Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, a binding site for Smad4 was recently identified that partially overlaps the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 binding site (19Sanchez-Elsner T. Ramirez J.R. Rodriguez-Sanz F. Varela E. Bernabeu C. Botella L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The coactivator protein p300 has been shown to interact with HIF-1α and to be required for enhanced transcription of the EPO and VEGF genes in response to hypoxia (20Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-129731Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Both the HIF-1 site and the adjacent, functionally critical nuclear hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 site are required for high affinity binding of p300 and the formation of a hypoxically inducible multiprotein complex (21Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The regulation of transcription initiation requires that transcription factors function in the context of eukaryotic chromatin. Several classes of chromatin remodeling enzymes have been identified that facilitate transcription from the chromatin template in vivo, including histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes. One important ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor is the SWI/SNF multi-subunit complex, which was first identified in yeast and is highly conserved among eukaryotes (22Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The human SWI/SNF complexes contain either Brg-1 or Brm as an essential ATPase subunit together with a variable number of Brg-1-associated factors. Interestingly, Brg-1 and Brm are highly homologous, yet they appear to direct very different cellular pathways. They associate with different promoters during cellular proliferation and differentiation and act in response to specific signaling pathways via their preferential interaction with different classes of transcription factors (23Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated that mice homozygous for a null mutation in the Brg-1 gene are embryonic lethal, whereas Brm homozygous null mice are viable but have increased body weight. This suggests that the Brg-1 protein may functionally replace Brm in SWI/SNF complexes (24Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 25Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D. La Mantia C. Nicholson J. Gilliam A. Randazzo F. Metzger D. Chambon P. Crabtree G. Magnuson T.

It was also shown that Brm could compensate for Brg-1 functionally in the regulation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor activity (27Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Angus S.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4782-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), indicating that Brm and Brg-1 activities are partially redundant. We provide evidence here that both Brm and Brg-1 specifically potentiate the transcription of the EPO gene mediated by HIF-1 by associating with its 3′-enhancer region. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Brm and Brg-1 can compensate for each other functionally to potentiate hypoxia-induced transcription of the EPO gene. To our knowledge, this is the first reported investigation on the roles of ATPase-containing chromatin remodeling factors in transcription activation by HIF-1, and it reveals a novel mechanism through which Brm and its homolog, Brg-1, functionally compensate each other to facilitate chromatin remodeling.

Cell Culture and Antibodies—The SW-13 adrenal carcinoma and Hep3B cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Omega), l-glutamine (Invitrogen), fungizone, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The Brm (N-19), Brg-1 (H-88), and HIF-1α (H-206) antibodies used for the ChIP assays were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Brm antibody used for Western blotting was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The antibody to Ac-K5,K8-H4 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to Arnt was described previously (30Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol.

Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assay—Expression plasmids were transfected into SW-13 cells cultured in 12-well plates by using the GenePorter 2 (Gene Therapy System) transfection reagent. After 24 h, some of the plates were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 94% N2, and 5% CO2) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase system (Promega) with the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate. RNA Interference in Hep3B Cells—Small interfering (si)RNA for Brm (siBrm) was prepared using the Dicer siRNA generation kit (Gene Therapy System) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, Brm cDNA between 141 and 733 downstream of the translation start site was amplified by PCR using a forward primer (5′-CCTGGACCTCCAAGTGTCTC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GGCCAGATGGTCTGTTGTAG-3′). The amplicon was used as the template for in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The double strand RNA so produced was cleaved into 22-bp fragments by the Dicer enzyme. The siRNA for Brg-1 (siBrg-1), the siRNA for both Brm and Brg-1 (siB/B), the scrambled RNA oligonucleotide (SCX), and the respective complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized by Qiagen and annealed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sense sequences of siBrg-1, siB/B, and SCX are r(GCCCAUGGAGUCCAUGCAU)d(TT), r(GCUGGAGAAGCAGCAGAAG)d(TT), and r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU)d(TT). Hep3B cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected at 30% cell confluency using the OligofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse Transcription and Real Time PCR—Cells transfected with siRNAs were harvested 24 or 48 h after transfection. For measuring the mRNA of EPO and VEGF, some of the plates were exposed to hypoxia 72 h after transfection and cultured for a further 24 h. Total RNA was prepared from transfected cells using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). 1.5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a Super script III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Bio-Science). The primer sets for RT-PCR are as follows: Brm, 5′-TGGAAATTCTGCAAGAGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCACGGTTGCTTTGGTTCTTAA-3′; Brg-1, 5′-AAGAAGACTGAGCCCCGACATTC-3′ and 5′-CCGTTACTGCTAAGGCCTATGC-3′ for Brg-1; the ribosomal 36B4 gene, 5′-CCACGGTGCTGAACATGCT-3′ and 5′-TCGAACACCTGCTGGATGAC-3′; EPO, 5′-ATGTGGATAAAGCCGTCAGTGG-3′ and 5′-TGATTGTTCGGAGTGGAGCAG-3′; and VEGF, 5′-TACCTCCACCATGCCAAGTG-3′ and 5′-ATGATTCTGCCCTCCTCCTTC-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The procedure was performed using a kit purchased from Upstate Biotechnology according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, Hep3B cells were treated with hypoxia or 100 μm CoCl2 for the indicated times. Cross-linking was achieved by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted at 700 × g at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.3 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor mixtures), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were sonicated to give a DNA size range from 200 to 900 bp. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture). The solutions were pre-cleared with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C and then treated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected using 60 μl of a salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose slurry. The beads were pelleted and washed sequentially in the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100); high salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100); LiCl wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), and Tris-EDTA buffer (twice). Immunocomplexes were extracted from the beads with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. Cross-linking was reversed by heating the eluates at 65 °C overnight. The eluates were then digested with proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h. The solutions were extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol. DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation. The 3′-enhancer regions (39 to 295 from the 3′ end of the exon 5), the 5′-promoter region (–368 to 18 from the transcription start site) of the EPO gene, and 5′-promoter region (–1136 to –889 from the transcription start site) of the VEGF gene were amplified by PCR. The primer sequences for the enhancer, the promoter of the EPO gene, and the promoter of the VEGF gene were 5′-AATCCCCTGGCTCTGTCCC-3′ and 5′-CCTTGATGACAATCTCAGCGC-3′, 5′-GACCCAGCTACTTTGCGGAACTCAGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCCCAGGGACTCTGCGGCTCTGG-3′, and 5′-GTAGGTTTGAATCATCACGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GCACCAAGTTTGTGGAGCTGA-3′, respectively. Re-ChIP assays utilized a similar protocol, except that the primary immunocomplex obtained with the HIF-1a antibody was eluted by 10 mm dithiothreitol with agitation at 37 °C for 30 min. The eluate was diluted 50 times with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated with the second antibodies. Transcriptional Induction of the EPO Gene Is Associated with Modifications of Histones at the EPO Promoter—Histone-modifying complexes are thought to cooperate with histone-remodeling complexes to reconfigure chromatin, thereby establishing a local chromatin structure that is permissive for the subsequent assembly of an active preinitiation complex at the promoter (31Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 32Maher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4244-4249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine if hypoxia-induced expression of the EPO gene is associated with modifications of histones at its promoter, we performed ChIP assays using an antibody directed to acetylated lysines at positions 5 and 8 of histone H4 at different time points after induction with 100 μm CoCl2, a hypoxia-mimicking reagent. As shown in Fig. 1B, histone H4 was acetylated at lysine 5 and/or 8 as early as 35 min after induction by CoCl2. The acetylation reached a peak at 50 min and then decreased. Taken together, these results suggest that the EPO promoter may have a nucleosomal structure that undergoes changes upon being stimulated by hypoxia and imply that histone-remodeling complexes, such as SWI/SNF may be involved in hypoxic induction of the EPO gene. Brm and Brg-1 Potentiate Reporter Gene Transcription Mediated by HIF-1—To test the potential involvement of ATP-dependent mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes in the transcriptional activation of the EPO gene, transient transfections were carried out in the Brg-1- and Brm-deficient human adrenal carcinoma cell line SW-13 with the EPO enhancer-SV40-luc (Fig. 2A), a reporter in which the luciferase gene is driven by an EPO 3′-enhancer fragment containing all the cis-DNA elements described above and a minimal SV40 promoter. We found that both Brm and Brg-1, alternative ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF, enhanced the reporter luciferase activity in a hypoxia-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Because the activity of this reporter is relatively weak and the expression of HIF-1α appeared to be relatively low in SW-13 cells, we also cotransfected a HIF-1α-expressing plasmid together with Brg-1 and/or Brm along with the reporter in most transfections to obtain maximal expression of the reporter gene. Whereas transfection of HIF-1α alone only marginally increased the reporter activity, this activity was further increased markedly by cotransfection with either Brg-1 or Brm. The expression of the reporter was in some instances also enhanced to some extent by Brm and Brg-1 even under normoxic conditions, most probably due to the overexpression of HIF-1α, leading to its activity under these conditions. Interestingly, when Brm and Brg-1 were cotransfected, we did not observe a further enhancement of the reporter activity, indicating that the two factors do not enhance EPO transcription in an additive or synergistic manner. We found that Brm was more potent than Brg-1 with regard to enhancing reporter gene transcription (Fig. 2C). However, the transcription of the reporter reached a saturated state with lower amounts of transfected Brg-1 than of Brm, suggesting either that the affinity of the Brg-1-containing SWI/SNF complex to the HIF-1 transcriptional complex is greater than that of the Brm-containing SWI/SNF complex or that more of the Brm-containing SWI/SNF complex than of the Brg-1-containing SWI/SNF complex associate with the HIF-1 transcription complex. The capabilities of Brm and Brg-1 to enhance the transcription of the reporter are dependent on their ATPase activities, because the mutated derivatives deficient for ATPase activities (Brm-M and Brg-1-M in Fig. 2C) exhibited much reduced efficiencies at enhancing the reporter gene expression. Brm and Brg-1 Act Specifically through the HIF-1 Binding Site—To confirm that SWI/SNF acts specifically through the HRE, we performed transient transfection assays using 6xHRE-SV40-Luc, a reporter in which a luciferase gene is driven by six randomly concatenated HREs and the minimal SV40 promoter (Fig. 3A). We obtained very similar results with this reporter compared with those obtained using the EPO enhancer-SV40-Luc reporter. As shown in Fig. 3B, both Brm and Brg-1 substantially enhanced the reporter activity in a hypoxia-dependent manner, and the mutated versions lacking ATPase activities lost most of their capability to augment reporter gene transcription. Overexpression of Coactivators Possessing HAT Activity Cannot Compensate for Lack of Brm and Brg-1 with Regard to HIF-1-dependent Transcription—Members of the p160 coactivator family and CBP/p300 have been shown to be essential for the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes mediated by HIF-1 (20Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-129731Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 33Carrero P. Okamoto K. Coumailleau P. O'Brien S. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In yeast, Swi/Snf and Gcn5, a histone acetyltransferase, have partially redundant roles in the control of SUC2 transcription, suggesting a functional overlap between the two different processes of nucleosome remodeling and histone acetylation (34Sudarsanam P. Cao Y. Wu L. Laurent B.C. Winston F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To investigate if the above mammalian coactivators can compensate for SWI/SNF in regulating transcription of the EPO gene, we transfected plasmids expressing the coactivators together with 6xHRE-SV40-Luc. As shown in Fig. 3C, those coactivators failed to potentiate the reporter activity in the absence of Brm or Brg-1, indicating that they are incapable of substituting for SWI/SNF in the regulation of transcription of the EPO gene and that their functions might be SWI/SNF-dependent. However, when SRC-1 was cotransfected with Brm or Brg-1, the reporter activities were further enhanced, indicating that the coactivators cooperate in an additive way. Brm or Brg-1 Is Required for Hypoxia-induced Transcription of the Endogenous EPO Gene—To further examine the roles played by Brm and Brg-1 in hypoxia-induced transcription of the EPO gene, we used RNA interference to deplete endogenous Brm or Brg-1 individually or together. First, we studied the role of Brm using a pool of siRNA oligonucleotides (siBrm). Endogenous Brm was knocked down at both the mRNA and protein level in the human hepatoma Hep3B cell line transfected with siBrm, whereas the level of Brg-1 mRNA was not affected (Fig. 4A). Depletion of Brm resulted in a moderate reduction in transcription of the endogenous EPO gene triggered by hypoxia (Fig. 4B). The expression of endogenous Brg-1 was knocked down by a single siRNA oligonucleotide (siBrg-1) at both the mRNA and protein level in Hep3B cells. Interestingly, the level of Brm mRNA was increased by this treatment (Fig. 4C). Also surprisingly, the level of EPO mRNA in the cells exposed to hypoxia was enhanced by the depletion of endogenous Brg-1 (Fig. 4D). Because Brm is more effective than Brg-1 in enhancing the HIF-1-mediated transcription of the reporter genes, the enhancement might result from the increased amount of Brm compensating for the lack of Brg-1. Brm may take the place of Brg-1 in SWI/SNF complexes, and such complexes may potentiate transcription of the EPO gene more efficiently than SWI/SNF containing Brg-1. Finally, we depleted Brm and Brg-1 simultaneously using a siRNA oligonucleotide that recognizes both Brm and Brg-1 mRNAs (siB/B). As shown in Fig. 4E, both Brm and Brg-1 were knocked down at the mRNA and protein level, and this resulted in a significant reduction in transcription of the EPO gene induced by hypoxia (Fig. 4F). To investigate whether SWI/SNF potentiates transcription of HIF-1-regulated genes in general, we examined the transcription of VEGF. Interestingly, although the transcription of VEGF is induced by hypoxia via HIF-1, none of the three siRNAs affected the levels of its mRNA induced by hypoxia (Fig. 4, B, D, and F, right sides), indicating that SWI/SNF does not function during the transcriptional activation of this gene. Taken together, these results suggest that EPO is a target gene of SWI/SNF and that the requirement for SWI/SNF is dependent on the nature of the gene promoter and/or enhancer. Brm and Brg-1 appeared to functionally compensate for each other with regard to potentiating transcription of the EPO gene, and their functions are ATPase-dependent. Brm and Brg-1 Are Recruited to the 3′-Enhancer Region of the EPO Gene in Response to Hypoxic Stimulation—Studies in yeast demonstrate that SWI/SNF complexes can localize to specific gene promoters, disrupting nucleosomal DNA to modulate transcription (35Goldmark J.P. Fazzio T.G. Estep P.W. Tsukiyama T. Cell. 2000; 103: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 36Larschan E. Winston F.

The precise mechanism through which SWI/SNF regulates gene promoters in mammals is unresolved; however, it was reported recently that in mammalian cells SWI/SNF complexes can be recruited by transcription factors to specific gene promoters in vivo (38Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 39Wang S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The observed requirements of Brm and Brg-1 for transcription of the EPO gene coupled to the known role of SWI/SNF in chromatin remodeling suggested that they might be associated with HIF-1 in vivo and be recruited in a hypoxia-dependent manner to the 3′-enhancer region of the EPO gene. The complex containing HIF-1, HNF-4, and SWI/SNF might then interact with the transcriptional initiation complex at the 5′-promoter through a DNA looping mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP and re-ChIP assays. A pair of primers spanning 250-bp DNA of the 3′-region of the EPO gene encompassing the functional HRE were used for PCR (Fig. 5A). In these studies, Hep3B cells were treated or untreated with hypoxia for 3 h followed by formaldehyde cross-linking. The cells were lysed, sonicated, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation by HIF-1α, Arnt, Brm, and Brg-1 antibodies. Antibodies against HIF-1α, Arnt, Brm, and Brg-1 efficiently precipitated the 3′-enhancer region of the EPO gene in a hypoxia-dependent fashion (Fig. 5B), indicating that each associates with this region after hypoxic induction. We obtained the same results using Hep3B cells treated with CoCl2, a hypoxia-mimicking reagent (data not shown). To investigate whether Brm or Brg-1 associates with HIF-1-containing templates in vivo, we performed re-ChIP analysis. Briefly, cross-linked chromatin from CoCl2-treated Hep3B cells was first treated with the HIF-1α antibody. The resulting immunocomplex was then eluted and subjected to immunoprecipitation with Arnt, Brg-1, and Brm antibodies. We found that the 3′-enhancer region of the EPO gene present in the first immunocomplex was pulled down again by the last three antibodies, indicating that Brg-1 and Brm (and Arnt) are each associated with HIF-1α at the gene enhancer (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, although depletion of Brm or/and Brg-1 did not affect the levels of VEGF mRNA induced by hypoxia, ChIP analysis showed that both Brm and Brg-1 were recruited to the promoter of the VEGF gene in a hypoxia-dependent fashion (Fig. 5D). Erythropoietin plays a central role in regulating the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. In mammalian systems, the EPO gene is the most hypoxia-responsive gene found to date and can be induced by hypoxia up to 100-fold. Transcriptional regulation is achieved by the concerted action of several transacting factors interacting with the 5′-proximal promoter region and with the 3′-untranslated region of the EPO gene, which are widely separated from each other. Coactivators harboring HAT activity, such as the p160 proteins and p300, have been shown to be involved in transcription of the EPO gene. This gene therefore provides an ideal system to study the roles played by coactivators and chromatin-remodeling complexes and to study communication between promoter and enhancer. In this study, we found that lysine 5 and/or lysine 8 of H4, which are targets of p300 and Src-1 in vitro, were acetylated after hypoxic induction in the promoter region of the EPO gene. This finding prompted us to investigate the role of SWI/SNF in the transcription of the gene, because the HATs and ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes are usually coupled and cooperate with each other in the regulation of gene transcription. For example, the bromodomains of Brm and Brg-1 are known to bind acetylated lysine in histones with high affinity (40Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), indicating that HAT coactivators may create a preferred target for the SWI/SNF complex. As we hypothesized, we found that both Brm and Brg-1 could substantially enhance expression of an EPO enhancer-driven reporter gene in a hypoxia-dependent manner in transient transfection experiments. We obtained similar results using 6xHRE-SV40-Luc, a reporter in which luciferase is driven by six randomly concatenated HREs, indicating that SWI/SNF complexes act specifically through the HRE. Though much less efficiently, some enhancement of the reporters' transcription was observed with the ATPase-abolished mutants of Brm and Brg-1, which are unable to carry out chromatin remodeling. It is possible that Brm and Brg-1, apart from participating in nucleosomal remodeling, can facilitate the formation and stabilization of the transcription initiation complex independently of their ATPase activities. In fact, we obtained similar results previously when we carried out transient transfection assays using a luciferase reporter driven by a cluster of xenobiotic response elements, in that we observed that ATPase-defective mutants of Brm and Brg-1 could enhance 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced reporter gene transcription to some extent (39Wang S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although some studies in yeast suggest that activations of certain genes can occur via either nucleosome remodeling or histone acetylation, recent studies in mammalian systems indicate they may fulfill different roles in alleviating nucleosomal repression. Coincident with this notion, we found that none of the three members of the p160 family of coactivators or CBP could substitute for Brm and Brg-1 with regard to HIF-1-mediated transcription. Importantly, we observed that Brm and Brg-1 are required for hypoxia-induced EPO transcription in vivo and that they appeared to compensate for each other functionally. Depletion of both Brm and Brg-1 by siRNA treatment significantly diminished the transcription of the EPO gene. Knocking down Brm on its own resulted in a moderate reduction of gene transcription, whereas knocking down Brg-1 on its own resulted in an augmentation of gene transcription. This last finding may be attributed to our interesting observations that Brm appears to be more potent that Brg-1 with regard to HIF-1-mediated transcription and that the expression of Brm mRNA is increased when Brg-1 is depleted. It is of interest that the Brg-1 protein was known to be increased in Brm-null mice, indicating that compensatory up-regulation of the ATPase subunits also appear to occur in the whole animal. Alhough the transcription of VEGF is also mediated by HIF-1, our data indicate that Brm and Brg-1 are not essential for its HIF-1-dependent transcription. Nevertheless, our ChIP analysis shows that both Brm and Brg-1 are recruited to the promoter of the VEGF gene in a hypoxia-dependent fashion. It is interesting that although Brm and Brg-1 are not required for hypoxic induction of the VEGF gene, they are nevertheless recruited to the VEGF promoter upon hypoxia treatment. It is possible that these coactivators are routinely recruited by HIF-1 irrespective of whether they are required or not. It is possible that the VEGF gene maintains an open chromatin structure that is accessible to transcription factors even under normoxic conditions. The modest hypoxic induction of the VEGF gene may be due to the relatively high level of transcription occurrence under these conditions. Our ChIP assays demonstrate recruitment of Brm and Brg-1 to the enhancer region of the EPO gene, indicating that Brm and Brg-1 may directly regulate the transcription of the EPO gene. Using re-ChIP analysis, we found that Brm and Brg-1 are each present in a complex that also contains HIF-1, suggesting that Brm and Brg-1 may be recruited to the enhancer by an “enhancersome” consisting of HIF-1, HNF-4, p300, and other coactivators. It remains to be elucidated if HIF-1 can interact with Brm and Brg-1 directly. In conclusion, our observations indicate that the EPO gene is a novel target gene of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex but that the requirement for this complex is gene-specific. To our knowledge, this is the first reported investigation on the roles of ATPase chromatin-remodeling factors in transcriptional activation by HIF-1, and it reveals a novel mechanism through which Brm and its homolog Brg-1 might compensate for each other functionally to fulfill chromatin remodeling."

GRIP1 (glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein) is a member of the steroid receptor coactivator family. Here, we show that GRIP1 is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) that induces its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. GRIP1 was down-regulated in transiently transfected COS-1 cells after treatment with 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cAMP or forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and in adrenocortical Y1 cells after incubation with adrenocorticotropic hormone. Pulse-chase experiments with transiently transfected COS-1 cells demonstrated that the half-life of GRIP1 was markedly reduced in cells overexpressing the PKA catalytic subunit, suggesting that activation of PKA increases the turnover of GRIP1 protein. The proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin abolished the PKA-mediated degradation of GRIP1. Using ts20 cells, a temperature-sensitive cell line that contains a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme, it was confirmed that PKA-mediated degradation of GRIP1 is dependent upon the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation studies of COS-1 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding GRIP1 and ubiquitin using anti-GRIP1 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies showed that the ubiquitination of GRIP1 was increased by overexpression of PKA. Finally, we show that PKA regulates the intracellular distribution pattern of green fluorescent protein-GRIP1 and stimulates recruitment of GRIP1 to subnuclear foci that are colocalized with the proteasome. Taken together, these data demonstrate that GRIP1 is ubiquitinated and degraded through activation of the PKA pathway.

Recently, the basic helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim domain of GRIP1 was also demonstrated to function as an activation domain by recruiting a secondary coactivator, coiled-coil coactivator (20Kim J.H.

CBP, p300, and CARM1 contribute to the gene transcription potentiation through histone acetylation and methylation, respectively (3Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

It has been also suggested that CBP and CARM1 may modify other components of the transcriptional complex (22McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

GRIP1 is widely expressed, but the levels of expression differ between cell types and organs (11Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Mice lacking functional GRIP1 exhibit nearly normal somatic growth, but the fertility is significantly reduced in both the male and female (24Gehin M. Mark M. Dennefeld C. Dierich A. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5923-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that a high fat diet induces GRIP1 expression in white and brown adipose tissues. Moreover, it has been shown that GRIP1 plays an important role in lipid metabolism through its interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, as evidenced by the fact that GRIP1 -/- mice exhibit higher body temperature, less fat accumulation, lower levels of both triglyceride and fasting glycemia, and higher insulin sensitivity (25Picard F.

Interestingly, it has been shown that the transcriptional coactivator function of GRIP1 was induced through phosphorylation at Ser-736 by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (27Lopez G.N. Turck C.W. Schaufele F. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22177-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We reported previously that stimulation of the PKA-dependent pathway down-regulates the activity of GRIP1 by reducing its protein level (30Børud B. Hoang T. Bakke M. Jacob A.L. Lund J. Mellgren G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 757-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas this stimulation further potentiates p300/CBP cointegrator protein-mediated coactivation of the NR steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). This finding suggests that extracellular signals may modulate the transcriptional activity of NRs via regulation of coactivator level and availability. The major system for selective degradation of proteins in eukaryotic cells is the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, where target proteins are covalently attached with one or several molecules of the highly conserved 76-aa ubiquitin protein and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex (31Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins proceeds via a three-step cascade mechanism: (i) the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (UBA) activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent manner to generate a high energy thiol ester intermediate E1-S∼ubiquitin; (ii) one of several ubiquitin carrier or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2 (UBCs) transfers the ubiquitin moiety from E1 to target proteins that are specifically bound to E3, a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family; and (iii) E3 finally catalyzes covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate (31Glickman M.H.

The ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system is implied to be a key component in the regulation of transcriptional activity for several nuclear hormone receptors including estrogen receptor (ER) (32Nawaz Z.

A recent investigation has also demonstrated that the SRCs are targets of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway and that the process depends on UBA and specific UBCs (36Yan F. Gao X. Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1315-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms that control this regulated degradation are still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of the PKA pathway leads to down-regulation of GRIP1 protein via targeting it to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Plasmid Constructs—The expression plasmid pCMV5-SF-1, and the luciferase reporter plasmid pT81–4CRS2-luc (4CRS2-luc) that contains four copies of the SF-1 binding site from the proximal promoter region of the bovine cyp17 gene, have been previously described (37Bakke M. Lund J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 327-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmids pSG5-HA-GRIP1 encoding wild type GRIP1 and pM-GRIP1 encoding GAL4-GRIP1 were generously supplied by Dr. M. R. Stallcup (Los Angeles, CA). Deletions of potential PEST sequences of GRIP1 in the pSG5-HA-GRIP1 plasmid were performed using the XL QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), resulting in pSG5-HA-GRIP1 ΔPEST1 (Δ aa 648–666), ΔPEST2 (Δ aa 713–731), and ΔPEST3 (Δ aa 788–826). The pG5-luc reporter plasmid for GAL4 was purchased from Promega. The reporter construct MMTV-luc-GRE, which contains the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat with four GR-response elements (GREs), and the pSG5-hGR expression plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. E. Treuter (Stockholm, Sweden). The pCMV5-Cα expressing the catalytic subunit of PKA was a gift from Dr. G. S. McKnight (Seattle, WA). The expression plasmid for ubiquitin pCW7-Ub was purchased from LGC Promochem (Sweden). The pSG5-GFP-GRIP1 expression plasmid encoding GRIP1 as a fusion with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its N terminus, was provided by Dr. Fred Schaufele (San Francisco, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection Experiments—COS-1 African monkey kidney cells, Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells, and MSC-1 mouse Sertoli cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml. Chinese hamster lung cells (E36) and its derived temperature-sensitive cell line (ts20) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium, minimal essential medium-α (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and antibiotics as described above, at 30 °C in 5% CO2. For transfections, the cells were seeded into 12 or 6-well plates or 60-mm Petri dishes 1 day before. COS-1, ts20, and E36 cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Y1 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (30Børud B. Hoang T. Bakke M. Jacob A.L. Lund J. Mellgren G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 757-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MSC-1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were washed once with PBS and harvested 48 h (COS-1, E-36, ts20, and MSC-1) or 24 h (Y1) post-transfection. Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay kit (BIOThema AB, Sweden) or the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The data shown are representative of 3–5 independent experiments. To ensure that the transfection experiments carried out at different times were reproducible, cell cultures were cotransfected with the reporter construct pRL-TK (Promega), and the Renilla luciferase activity was used as a reference for normalizing the firefly luciferase activity produced by the luc reporter constructs. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 100 nm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mm PMSF, supplemented with Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, the cell lysates were analyzed by 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting was performed by first blocking the membrane with PBS-T containing 5% (w/v) dried skimmed milk for 1 h. After several washes, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody for an additional 1 h and secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) for 30 min. Visualization of proteins was achieved by using the enhanced SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrates (Pierce) and by exposure to Hyperfilm™ ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-HA (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), mouse anti-GRIP1 monoclonal antibody (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), and mouse anti-β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Quantification of GRIP1 protein expression levels was performed using the NIH Image software (available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Relative GRIP1 expression was calculated either as density percentages of corresponding GRIP1 protein bands over the control GRIP1 band or as ratios between GRIP1 and the corresponding GAPDH or β-actin band densities and expressed relative to controls, as indicated in the figures. Pulse-Chase Analysis—COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 3.3 × 105 cells/60-mm Petri dish and transfected with pSG5-HA-GRIP1 (3.0 μg) and pCMV5-SF-1 (0.25 μg). After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 30 min. The cells were then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) for 1 h. Thereafter, the medium was rapidly removed, and the cells were washed twice in PBS before being incubated in a chase medium of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing a 50× excess of methionine and either the vehicle Me2SO or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm) for the desired chase times. After 1 h, the cells were treated with forskolin (10 μm), IBMX (50 μm), and 8-CPT-cAMP (500 μm), as indicated. At each desired time point, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in an immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 0.2 mm PMSF, and Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were subjected to a coimmunoprecipitation procedure, as described below, using mouse anti-GRIP1 antibody (NeoMarkers). The resulting GRIP1-bound protein G-Sepharose beads were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography using BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for detection of 35S-labeled GRIP1 protein. GRIP1 expression levels were quantified as described above. Coimmunoprecipitation—The procedure was used for detection of ubiquitinated GRIP1 protein and during the pulse-chase analysis of GRIP1. Cell lysates in the immunoprecipitation buffer were supplemented with four volumes of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 0.2 mm PMSF, and Complete Mini protease inhibitors and then incubated with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Thereafter, the samples were briefly centrifuged. The supernatants were incubated with 25 μl of mouse anti-GRIP1 antibody (NeoMarkers) overnight and subsequently incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h. The precipitated protein G-Sepharose beads were washed five times with an ice-cold washing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 0.2 mm PMSF, and Complete Mini protease inhibitors. The immunoprecipitates were then heated in 30 μl of 2× SDS-loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 200 mm mercaptoethanol) at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Confocal Microscopy, Immunofluorescence, and Image Analysis— COS-1 cells were plated onto microscopic coverglasses in 35-mm Petri dishes and transfected with expression plasmids encoding GFP-GRIP1 (400 ng), SF-1 (100 ng), and PKA-Cα (100 ng) as described above. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were subsequently exposed to a blocking buffer of 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, followed by 1-h incubations with the primary and then the secondary antibody at 37 °C. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PA28α (Affiniti Research Products, Devon, UK) and mouse monoclonal anti-PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used as primary antibodies, together with Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit (Abcam) and anti-mouse (Southern Biotech) antibodies as secondary antibodies. For each experiment, the intracellular distribution of GFP-GRIP1 was examined in more than 250 cells. Microscopy was performed by using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg GmbH). Green fluorescence was monitored by excitation with the 488-nm line from an argon/argon krypton laser, whereas red fluorescence was monitored with the 496-nm line from a helium/neon II laser. Emissions for green and red fluorescence were viewed through a 490–580- and a 596–700-nm band pass filter, respectively. The percentage of cells containing nuclear foci was determined by counting the number of foci-positive and -negative cells within a defined area of the cell monolayers. The green fluorescence intensity of the cells was measured by using the Leica Confocal Software quantifying program. Area-corrected fluorescence intensity of the GFP-GRIP1-expressing nucleus and a random chosen background area outside the cell was calculated. The background intensity was then subtracted from the fluorescence intensity of the nucleus. Down-regulation of GRIP1 by Activation of PKA—It has previously been demonstrated that GRIP1 possesses intrinsic activation function when linked to GAL4 (11Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Using COS-1 cells transiently transfected with GAL4-GRIP1 expression plasmid and a GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid (pG5-luc), we observed that cotransfection with an expression plasmid encoding the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-Cα) resulted in a marked decrease in GRIP1 activation function (Fig. 1A). To further study the role of PKA in regulation of GRIP1 function, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding GRIP1 and GR together with the reporter construct MMTV-luc-GRE, which contains the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat with four GREs (38Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Since GRIP1-mediated coactivation of GR was very low in the absence of ligand, the transfected cultures were treated with dexamethasone. As expected, GRIP1 strongly potentiated GR-dependent transcription, whereas coexpression of PKA-Cα resulted in a marked decrease of luciferase activity (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our previous report (30Børud B. Hoang T. Bakke M. Jacob A.L. Lund J. Mellgren G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 757-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Western blot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of PKA-Cα led to a decreased level of GRIP1 protein (Fig. 1B, inset). GRIP1 down-regulation appeared to be unaffected by overexpression of GR, since we observed no change in GRIP1 protein levels in the presence or absence of coexpressed GR (Fig. 1B) (30Børud B. Hoang T. Bakke M. Jacob A.L. Lund J. Mellgren G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 757-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). GRIP1 has been reported to have an essential role in mouse reproduction function, and one major expression site is apparently the Sertoli cells (24Gehin M. Mark M. Dennefeld C. Dierich A.

https://openalex.org/W2101804995,"Accumulation of cerebral amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to be part of the pathogenic process in Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is derived by proteolytic cleavage from a precursor protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a type-1 membrane-spanning protein, and its carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain binds to X11beta, a neuronal adaptor protein. X11beta has been shown to inhibit the production of Abeta in transfected non-neuronal cells in culture. However, whether this is also the case in vivo in the brain and whether X11beta can also inhibit the deposition of Abeta as amyloid plaques is not known. Here we show that transgenic overexpression of X11beta in neurons leads to a decrease in cerebral Abeta levels in transgenic APPswe Tg2576 mice that are a model of the amyloid pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, overexpression of X11beta retards amyloid plaque formation in these APPswe mice. Our findings suggest that modulation of X11beta function may represent a novel therapeutic approach for preventing the amyloid pathology of Alzheimer's disease."

Positioning of the box C/D guide RNA within the intron of this pre-tRNA led to the assumption that nucleotide methylation is guided by the cis-positioned box C/D RNPs. We have now investigated the mechanism of 2′-O-methylation for the H. volcanii pre-tRNATrpin vitro by assembling methylation-competent box C/D RNPs on both the pre-tRNA and the excised intron (both linear and circular forms) using Methanocaldococcus jannaschii box C/D RNP core proteins.

Methylation by in vitro assembled RNPs prefers but does not absolutely require Watson-Crick pairing between the guide and target nucleotides. We also demonstrate for the first time that methylation of two nucleotides guided by a single box C/D RNA is sequential, that is, box C′/D′ RNP-guided U39 methylation first requires box C/D RNP-guided methylation of C34. Methylation of the two nucleotides of exogenous pre-tRNATrp added to an H. volcanii cell extract also occurs sequentially and is also accomplished in trans using RNPs that pre-exist in the extract. Thus, this trans mechanism is analogous to eukaryal pre-rRNA 2′-O-methylation guided by intron-encoded but trans-acting box C/D small nucleolar RNPs. This trans mechanism could explain the observed accumulation of the excised H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp intron in vivo. A trans mechanism would also eliminate the obligatory refolding of the pre-tRNA that would be required to carry out two cis-methylation reactions before pre-tRNA splicing.

Eukaryotic cells possess numerous small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 1The abbreviations used are: sno, small nucleolar; sRNA, sno-like RNA; sRNP, sno-like RNP; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; nt, nucleotide; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine.1The abbreviations used are: sno, small nucleolar; sRNA, sno-like RNA; sRNP, sno-like RNP; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; nt, nucleotide; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine. the primary function of which is to guide the 2′-O-methylation and pseudouridylation of specific nucleotides within pre-rRNA and other target RNAs (1Maxwell E.S.

Members of this snoRNA family are defined by conserved box C (RUGAUGA) and D (CUGA) consensus sequences located in the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, of the snoRNA. Often, imperfect copies called C′ and D′ boxes are found internally. Regions of 10–21 nucleotides located upstream of boxes D and D′ function as guide sequences, pairing with those regions in rRNA containing the nucleotide to be modified. The nucleotide sugar to be methylated resides within the snoRNA-rRNA duplex and is located 5 nucleotides upstream of box D or D′.Box C/D RNAs are also found in Archaea, in which they are designated snoRNA-like RNAs or sRNAs (8Omer A.D.

Archaeal sRNAs are generally smaller than the eukaryal snoRNAs and typically possess C′ and D′ boxes that vary little from the terminal box C and D sequences. The primary function of the archaeal box C/D sRNAs also is to guide the 2′-O-methylation of targeted nucleotides, and their mechanism of nucleotide modification is analogous to the eukaryal snoRNAs.Both the eukaryal and archaeal box C/D RNAs are bound to core proteins to establish snoRNP and sRNP complexes, respectively. Four snoRNP core proteins are bound to the box C/D snoRNAs: fibrillarin (Nop1p), Nop56p, Nop58p (Nop5p), and the 15.5-kDa (Snu13p) protein (4Filipowicz W. Pogacic V. Curr. Opin.

The methylation activity resides in the proteins of the snoRNP, with fibrillarin functioning as the methyltransferase. The differential distribution of the 15.5-kDa Nop56 and Nop58 proteins on the box C/D and C′/D′ motifs establishes an asymmetric snoRNP complex (12Cahill N.M. Friend K. Speckmann W. Li Z.H.

Core protein binding follows an order of assembly in which L7Ae binds first followed by aNop5p and then afibrillarin. Efficient catalysis requires that the box C/D and C′/D′ RNPs be juxtaposed within the full-length sRNA (18Tran E.J. Zhang X. Maxwell E.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The tRNATrp of Haloferax volcanii is derived from an intron-containing pre-tRNA (22Daniels C.J. Gupta R. Doolittle W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and possesses 2′-O-methylated nucleotides at positions 34 (Cm) and 39 (Um) (where “m” is 2′-O-methylation of the residue) (23Gupta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the pre-tRNATrp structure (see Fig. 1, upper left) revealed that the intron contains box C/D and C′/D′ motifs with guide sequences complementary to the pre-tRNA regions encompassing modified nucleotides Cm34 and Um39, respectively (8Omer A.D.

Subsequent investigations that involved deleting regions of the pre-tRNA intron and then examining nucleotide methylation in vitro led to the conclusion that these intron-encoded box C/D motifs are indeed responsible for guiding the methylation of pre-tRNATrp nucleotides C34 and U39 (21Bortolin M.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4518-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These investigations also led to the proposal that the box C/D RNPs of the unspliced intron are responsible for guiding in cis the methylation of the pre-tRNATrp nucleotides (21Bortolin M.L. Bachellerie J.P. Clouet-d'Orval B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6524-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Clouet d'Orval B. Bortolin M.L. Gaspin C. Bachellerie J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4518-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The presence of a cis mechanism for intramolecular methylation would be unique and provide a stark contrast from the box C/D RNP-guided trans-methylation in eukaryal and other archaeal systems. Although box C/D snoRNAs are frequently found in the introns of eukaryal pre-messenger RNAs, they are excised from the host pre-mRNA as snoRNPs before they guide the 2′-O-methylation of target nucleotides.In this investigation, we have assembled in vitro a box C/D sRNP using recombinant Methanocaldococcus jannaschii core proteins L7Ae, aNop5p, and afibrillarin and H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp. This complex is enzymatically active and methylates tRNATrp nucleotides C34 and U39. However, the experiments demonstrated that modification of the pre-tRNA target nucleotides was accomplished in trans using box C/D RNPs assembled in another unspliced pre-tRNA or in the excised intron (both linear and circular). Certain non-Watson-Crick pairings between target and guide nucleotides permitted 2′-O-methylations, although less efficiently. Nucleotide modification was also sequential, that is, modification of U39 guided by the C′/D′ RNP first required methylation of C34 guided by the box C/D RNP. Pre-tRNATrp methylation carried out in an H. volcanii cell extract confirmed the sequential methylation of these two nucleotides guided by trans-acting box C/D RNP complexes already present in the extract. Collectively, these observations indicate that the sequential methylation of the H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp nucleotides guided by the intron-encoded box C/D RNP occurs via an intermolecular or trans mechanism rather than an intramolecular or cis mechanism as previously assumed. This trans mechanism could explain the accumulation of the excised introns of this pre-tRNA in vivo (25Salgia S.R. Singh S.K. Gurha P. Gupta R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Template Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The following DNA oligonucleotide primers were used in PCR-amplification of plasmid pVT9P11 (25Salgia S.R. Singh S.K. Gurha P. Gupta R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to produce DNA templates for in vitro transcription: 1) TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCTGTGGCCAAGC; 2) TGGGGCCGGAGGGATTTGAAC; 3) TCAGTATATCAGCTGGAGTGT; 4) TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTTGGCGCCCGGGA; and 5) ATCTCCGGTGGGCACCT. Primer pairs 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 4 and 5 were used to prepare full-length H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp (177 nt), 5′-half pre-tRNA (78 nt), and intron RNA (102 nt), respectively. Specific nucleotide mutations at pre-tRNA target or guide positions C34G (C at position 34 mutated to G), C34U, C34A, G117C, G117A, G117U, U39A, and A70U were introduced into the pVT9P11 templates using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate DNA oligonucleotides. These residues correspond to target or guide nucleotides of the box C/D and C′/D′ motifs contained within the H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp.In Vitro RNA Synthesis—Generally, in vitro transcription was carried out in 20-μl reactions at 37 °C for 2–3 h in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 10mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 10 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) (MP Biomedicals), 0.6 mm unlabeled ATP, and unlabeled GTP, CTP, and UTP each at 1.0 mm, PCR-amplified DNA, and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Radiolabeled RNA transcripts were purified by denaturing PAGE, and amounts were approximated by Cerenkov counting. High specific activity transcripts were prepared similarly except that unlabeled ATP was omitted.RNP Assembly and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Recombinant M. jannaschii L7Ae, aNop5p, and afibrillarin proteins were prepared, and RNP complexes were assembled as described previously (18Tran E.J. Zhang X. Maxwell E.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼0.2 pmol of radiolabeled RNA was incubated at 70 °C with 10 pmol of L7Ae in 20-μl reactions (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) for 10 min. Assembly of higher order RNP complexes was accomplished by incubating 10 pmol of L7Ae, 32 pmol of aNop5p, and 33 pmol of afibrillarin with radiolabeled RNA transcripts in the presence of 10 μg of Escherichia coli tRNA. Assembled RNP complexes were resolved by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 2% glycerol as described previously (18Tran E.J. Zhang X. Maxwell E.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Resolved RNPs were visualized by phosphorimaging using a Packard Cyclone system.In Vitro RNP-directed Nucleotide 2′-O-Methylation and Thin Layer Chromatography Analysis of Modified Nucleotides—Generally, RNP complexes were assembled in the presence of 0.05 mmS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) using recombinant core proteins and 0.2 pmol of [α-32P]ATP-labeled RNAs as described above. After incubation at 70 °C for 2 h, radiolabeled RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. In cases in which two different transcripts were included in the reaction, the amount of each transcript was 0.1 pmol. RNA samples were digested with RNase T2, and the digestion products were resolved on cellulose plates (EM Science) using two-dimensional TLC. The solvents for TLC were isobutyric acid, 0.5 n NH4OH (5:3, v/v) for the first dimension and isopropanol/HCl/H2O (70:15:15, v/v/v) for the second dimension (23Gupta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled nucleotides resolved by TLC analysis were visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging. The identity of dinucleotides was established based on our previous study (23Gupta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small aliquot of RNA was obtained before the RNase T2 digestion and saved. These RNAs were checked by denaturing PAGE for RNA stability and integrity, especially for those cases in which methylation was not observed. Target nucleotide 2′-O-methylation was calculated by dividing the amount of radioactivity in the corresponding dinucleotide spot on the TLC plate by 33 (number of A residues in the pre-tRNA) of the sum of the total radioactivity in all spots and expressed as the percentage of modification.The amount of radiolabeled wild type pre-tRNA transcript used in the reactions and their incubation times varied (up to 2 h) for the kinetic study experiments (see Fig. 2D). Incubation at 70 °C beyond this time leads to RNA degradation. In some reactions, small amounts (<0.08 fmol) of high specific activity transcript were included as tracers to quantify the minimal levels of detectable modification. Two specific and more sensitive experiments using the G117C mutant pre-tRNA were carried out. In one experiment, instead of the typical 0.2 pmol, 2 pmol of pre-tRNA was used for the standard 2-h reaction. For wild type pre-tRNA, more than 80 and 40% of C34 and U39, respectively, were methylated under these conditions (see Fig. 2D). In another experiment, 0.2 pmol of normally radiolabeled and 2.25 fmol of high specific activity tracer transcript (in place of the typical <0.08 fmol transcript) were used in the reaction. We are able to detect methylation of a given residue as low as 2.5% under these conditions.Fig. 2The kinetics of H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp methylation indicate that nucleotides C34 and U39 are modified sequentially by trans-acting box C/D RNPs. Radiolabeled pre-tRNATrp transcripts (0.2 pmol) were incubated with recombinant M. jannaschii sRNP core proteins in the presence of AdoMet for 0 min (A) and 15 min (B). TLC analysis of RNase T2-digested pre-tRNA revealed C34 and U39 methylation with the appearance of dinucleotides CmCp and UmCp, respectively. C, methylation reaction was identical to B except that the pre-tRNA concentration was 2.0 pmol. D, the time course of nucleotide C34 and U39 methylation at different pre-tRNA concentrations is shown. Dinucleotides CmCp and UmCp produced at different time points were quantified by phosphorimaging analysis and plotted with respect to reaction time. Each curve, except for the U39 methylation curves at the two lowest pre-tRNA concentrations, was fitted as a single exponent. E, reaction rates (kapp) were calculated from each fitted C34 methylation curve and plotted versus pre-tRNA substrate concentration (pmol).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Pre-tRNA Methylation in Cell Extracts—Some in vitro methylation reactions were carried out in cell extracts. Extracts were prepared by growing H. volcanii cells to an A550 density of 0.5–0.6 as described previously (23Gupta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pelleted cells were resuspended in three volumes (w/v) of solution D (3.4 m KCl, 0.1 m MgOAc, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6) and lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 psi. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min followed by two additional centrifugations each at 32,000 × g for 30 min. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%, and the cell extract was stored at –70 °C. Approximately 0.4 pmol of radiolabeled RNA was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a 35-μl reaction containing 30 μl of cell extract and 0.05 mm AdoMet. Purification of the RNA, RNase T2 digestion, and TLC analysis of digested nucleotides was performed as described above.Pre-tRNA Splicing Reactions—Splicing endonuclease and ligase reactions to produce linear and circular forms of H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp introns were carried out as described previously (25Salgia S.R. Singh S.K. Gurha P. Gupta R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Zofallova L. Guo Y. Gupta R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RNA products were separated by denaturing PAGE, and specific introns were eluted from the gels.RESULTSM. jannaschii sRNP Core Proteins Bind the H. volcanii Pre-tRNATrp and Its Derivative Introns in Vitro to Assemble Box C/D RNP—The folded H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp transcript shown in Fig. 1 (upper left) contains the bulge-helix-bulge motif recognized by the archaeal splicing endonuclease and possesses intron-encoded boxes C/D and C′/D′ in their characteristic conformation. Pre-tRNA is spliced after nucleotide methylation because the two exon-intron junctions are located within the target sequences of the box C/D RNPs. Both the linear intron formed after endonuclease cleavage of the pre-tRNA and the circular intron formed after ligation of the excised intron (25Salgia S.R. Singh S.K. Gurha P. Gupta R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) retain the essential features of the box C/D sRNA motifs (Fig. 1, upper middle and right); thus, both forms of the intron have the potential to guide the intermolecular, trans-2′-O-methylation of other pre-tRNATrp molecules.H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp as well as the linear and circular forms of its spliced intron can bind recombinant M. jannaschii box C/D sRNP core proteins in vitro to assemble sRNP complexes (Fig. 1, lower panels). Consistent with previous investigations (16Omer A.D. Ziesche S. Ebhardt H. Dennis P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Tran E.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6524-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), electrophoretic mobility shift assay also demonstrated that core protein binding is ordered, with L7Ae binding first followed by aNop5p and then afibrillarin (data not shown). The mouse U14 box C/D core motif (19Kuhn J.F. Tran E.J. Maxwell E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) is an effective competitor for protein binding (data not shown), indicating that core protein binding is specific for the box C/D motif. When the RNA products of a pre-tRNATrp splicing reaction were incubated with L7Ae, only the introns (both linear and circular forms) bound this core protein (data not shown). Thus, box C/D RNP assembly requires the box C/D and C′/D′ RNA motifs contained within the intron of this pre-tRNA.In Vitro Assembled Box C/D RNPs Guide the 2′-O-methylation of Target Nucleotides in Pre-tRNATrp—Box C/D RNPs assembled on the H. volcanii pre-tRNATrp with the three recombinant M. jannaschii sRNP core proteins guided the AdoMet-dependent, 2′-O-methylation of C34 and U39 target nucleotides in the tRNATrp precursor. Following RNP assembly and incubation in the presence of AdoMet, TLC of the nucleotides generated by RNase T2 digestion of the [α-32P]ATP-labeled pre-tRNATrp transcript revealed radiolabeled residues corresponding to the dinucleotides CmCp and UmCp (where “p” is 3′-phosphate of the residue) (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3A). (RNase T2 cleaves after every ribonucleotide to produce ribonucleoside 3′-monophosphate (Np), except when nucleotides are methylated at the 2′ position of the sugar.) Dinucleotides CmCp and UmCp are derived from 2′-O-methylation of residues C34 and U39, respectively. Specificity of methylation for these two nucleotides has been confirmed by dNTP concentration-dependent, primer extension (27Maden B.E. Methods. 2001; 25: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) analysis (data not shown) as well as by mutation studies described later. Nucleotide methylation required box C/D RNP assembly because neither dinucleotide was observed when any one of the three sRNP core proteins was omitted from the reaction (data not shown). These studies therefore demonstrate that the in vitro assembled box C/D RNPs function to guide the 2′-O-methylation of pre-tRNATrp nucleotides C34 and U39. The amount of the CmCp dinucleotide was always greater than the UmCp dinucleotide (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. 3A), suggesting that modification of U39 follows that of C34 and/or occurs at a significantly slower rate.Fig. 32′-O-Methylation of pre-tRNATrp nucleotides C34 and U39 is sequential; pre-tRNATrp nucleotide methylation in an H. volcanii cell extract is also sequential but utilizes pre-existing box C/D RNPs. Radiolabeled wild type and mutant pre-tRNATrp transcripts possessing altered guide and/or target nucleotides were incubated for 2 h with recombinant M. jannaschii sRNP core proteins in the methylation reactions. A–G, TLC analyses of RNase T2-digested pre-tRNAs are shown. The pre-tRNAs used in each reaction are indicated in the individual panels. Pre-tRNAs with wild type and mutant guide and/or target nucleotides are illustrated at the side (mutated nucleotides are designated by asterisks). Target (uppercase) and guide (lowercase) nucleotides are shown with target:guide nucleotide pairs for the box C/D motif and C′/D′ motif indicated in black squares and black circles, respectively. AA–GG, radiolabeled wild type and mutant pre-tRNATrp transcripts possessing altered guide and/or target nucleotides were incubated in an H. volcanii cell extract, and nucleotide methylation was assessed with the TLC analysis of RNase T2-digested pre-tRNAs. Pre-tRNAs for each reaction are indicated in the individual panels and illustrated at the side (mutated nucleotides are designated by asterisks).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Kinetics of C34 and U39 Methylation Indicate That These Modifications Occur Sequentially and Are Guided via a trans Mechanism—A time course study of C34 and U39 nucleotide methylation was carried out in which the concentration of the pre-tRNA substrate was increased while the amount of core proteins was held constant. The initial rates and the extent (total percentage) of methylation for both nucleotides increased as pre-tRNA concentrations increased (Fig. 2D). Reaction rates for C34 methylation (kapp) were calculated and then plotted versus pre-tRNA substrate concentration (Fig. 2E). Consistent with a trans reaction, kapp increased as pre-tRNA substrate concentration increased. Lower reaction rates for U39 methylation, particularly at low substrate concentrations, caused a similar plot of the methylation rate of this nucleotide to be more problematic. However, visual inspection of the initial reaction rate for U39 at substrate concentrations of 0.2 and 2 pmol (Fig. 2D) clearly revealed increasing rates with respect to increasing pre-tRNA concentration. Indeed, the kapp rates at these two concentrations revealed values of 0.041 (0.2 pmol) and 0.059 (2 pmol). The fact that these rates are significantly less than C34 methylation rates at these same pre-tRNA substrate concentrations is consistent with the sequential methylation of these two target nucleotides (see below). Collectively, these kinetics are consistent with an intermolecular or trans reaction mechanism, thus suggesting that C34 and U39 nucleotide methylation do not occur via an intramolecular or cis mechanism as assumed previously (see below). Interestingly, inspection of the C34 methylation rate at higher substrate concentrations revealed the deviation of this curve from linearity (Fig. 2E). This suggests th"

To study the mechanism responsible for protein stabilization, pico-second time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the thermal unfolding of a model protein, Staphylococcus aureus recombinant nuclease A (SNase), in the presence or absence of mannosylglycerate. The fluorescence decay times are signatures of the protein state, and the pre-exponential coefficients are used to evaluate the molar fractions of the folded and unfolded states. Hence, direct determination of equilibrium constants of unfolding from molar fractions was carried out. Van't Hoff plots of the equilibrium constants provided reliable thermodynamic data for SNase unfolding. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to validate this thermodynamic analysis. The presence of 0.5 m potassium mannosylglycerate caused an increase of 7 °C in the SNase melting temperature and a 2-fold increase in the unfolding heat capacity. Despite the considerable degree of stabilization rendered by this solute, the nature and population of protein states along unfolding were not altered in the presence of mannosylglycerate, denoting that the unfolding pathway of SNase was unaffected. The stabilization of SNase by mannosylglycerate arises from decreased unfolding entropy up to 65 °C and from an enthalpy increase above this temperature. In molecular terms, stabilization is interpreted as resulting from destabilization of the denatured state caused by preferential exclusion of the solute from the protein hydration shell upon unfolding, and stabilization of the native state by specific interactions. The physiological significance of charged solutes in hyperthermophiles is discussed. 2-O-α-Mannosylglycerate, a negatively charged osmolyte widely distributed among (hyper)thermophilic microorganisms, is known to provide notable protection to proteins against thermal denaturation.

In molecular terms, stabilization is interpreted as resulting from destabilization of the denatured state caused by preferential exclusion of the solute from the protein hydration shell upon unfolding, and stabilization of the native state by specific interactions. The physiological significance of charged solutes in hyperthermophiles is discussed. The accumulation of low molecular mass compounds is known to be a common strategy used by microorganisms to cope with environmental and stressful conditions, such as high osmolarity or elevated temperature. (Hyper)thermophiles accumulate compatible solutes rarely encountered in mesophiles (1Martins L.O. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2da Costa M.S. Santos H. Galinsky E.A. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 117-153PubMed Google Scholar, 3Santos H. da Costa M.S. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These solutes are generally negatively charged, whereas mesophiles accumulate primarily neutral solutes. This suggests that the unique charged solutes of hyperthermophiles were especially selected through evolution to preserve cell components at high temperature. The use of osmolytes to improve protein stability is a well established practice, but the molecular mechanisms that govern this stabilization remain largely elusive. The demand for correctly folded and stable proteins from many biotechnological and clinical applications fosters the active research and vivid ongoing debate in this area (4Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 5Davis-Searles P.R. Saunders A.J. Erie D.A. Winzor D.J. Pielak G.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

A general mechanism proposed to explain the stabilizing effect of solutes upon proteins takes into account the exclusion of the solute from the protein hydration shell. Briefly, the theory states that a stabilizing solute raises the Gibbs energy of both native and unfolded states of the protein, but because the peptide backbone is more exposed to the osmolyte in the denatured state, is raises preferentially the Gibbs energy of the unfolded state, thus inducing a net stabilization effect, by shifting the equilibrium to the native state. This mechanism is particularly important with neutral osmolytes, or compounds known to act nonspecifically, i.e. independently of pH and the protein surface charge, and usually requires high concentrations to be effective. Fewer studies have been performed with charged solutes, but the ability of certain ions to bind and stabilize proteins has been reported, and it is generally believed that direct protein-solute interactions play a relevant role in the mechanism of protein stabilization by salts (7Faria T.Q.

In the present study we used time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) 1The abbreviations used are: TRFS, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MG, 2-O-α-mannosylglycerate (potassium salt); SNase, recombinant nuclease A from S. aureus; NAWA, N-acetyltryptophanamide. and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate the effect of mannosylglycerate (MG), a widespread compatible solute among microorganisms adapted to grow in hot environments (3Santos H. da Costa M.S. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), on the thermal denaturation of a model protein, nuclease A from Staphylococcus aureus (SNase). Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used to monitor protein conformational changes. However, derivation of thermodynamic quantities from these data involves a number of unproven assumptions on the unfolding mechanism and on the fluorescence properties of the native and denatured protein structures. Moreover, calculations depend critically on the extrapolation to the transition region of data obtained outside this region, the detection of intermediate unfolding states is rarely direct, and only the use of a combination of techniques can validate their presence (14Robertson A.D. Murphy K.P. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1251-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To overcome these drawbacks, we used TRFS, which has two important advantages. First, it is possible to discriminate the emission of the native and unfolded protein conformations through their decay times, a crucial bit of information for the characterization of the unfolding pathway. Second, the contribution of each species to the total fluorescence emission can be quantified and monitored during protein denaturation. TRFS provides data to directly determine the evolution of the unfolding equilibrium constant during the entire unfolding process, allowing for an accurate thermodynamic analysis of this process. The fluorescence emission of the single tryptophan residue was used to probe the structural changes of SNase during thermal denaturation. The photophysical properties of the tryptophan residue in the protein were analyzed in comparison with those of N-acetyltryptophanamide (NAWA) in dioxanewater mixtures at different temperatures. NAWA is a consensual analogue for a tryptophan residue within a polypeptide chain (15Lakowicz J.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 421-437Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and dioxane-water mixtures mimic the range of microenvironments sensed by tryptophan in the folded and unfolded protein conformations. Materials—NAWA was purchased from Sigma. 1,4-Dioxane from Riedel-de-Haën was used after a distillation step to remove all emitting impurities, as confirmed by emission measurements. Mannosylglycerate (MG) was purified from cell extracts of Rhodothermus obamensis as described previously (7Faria T.Q. Knapp S. Ladenstein R. Maçanita A.L. Santos H. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To remove an absorbing contaminant present in the MG solution, a series of washing steps with dry activated charcoal were performed until no further absorbance decrease was observed. Typically, the solution with 0.5 m concentration had an absorbance of 0.05 at 280 nm. All other reagents were of analytical grade, and the buffer solutions were of spectroscopic grade.

This plasmid has the nuclease gene cloned immediately after the ompA gene that encodes a signal excretion peptide and was transformed into Escherichia coli HB101 cells by heat shock. E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C, and the recombinant protein production was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was purified by an osmotic shock procedure adapted from Takahara et al. (16Takahara M. Hibler D.W. Barr P.J. Gerlt J.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2670-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Neu and Heppel (17Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and briefly outlined here. Cells were washed three times with Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 7.6) and then suspended in sucrose buffer (20% sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). The suspension was incubated for 10 min on ice with stirring and then centrifuged. The resultant pellet was vigorously suspended in cold water and stirred for 10 min on ice. The periplasmic proteins (supernatant) were recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was suspended in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and stirred on ice (30 min). The supernatant was separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the nuclease was fully released upon washing the membranes with 1 m Tris-HCl buffer. This fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a Mono S column (HR5/5, Amersham Biosciences). SNase was eluted with ∼0.3 m NaCl and was judged pure by SDS-PAGE stained with silver nitrate. The N-terminal sequence was determined to confirm that no residue from the signal peptide was incorporated in the produced nuclease. To improve the reversibility of the thermal unfolding, nuclease was chemically denatured with 2 m guanidinium chloride and refolded by dilution with buffer and extensive dialysis. Pure nuclease was lyophilized and kept at –20 °C until use. The production yield was about 3 mg/liter of culture. Protein concentration was determined from UV absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 0.93 (mg/ml)–1 cm–1. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a MicroCal VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter controlled by the VP-viewer program and equipped with 0.51 ml of cells. Calibration of temperature and heat flow was carried out according to MicroCal instructions. Stock solutions of nuclease were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5), and extensively “washing” with the same buffer in a Centricon tube (molecular mass of 10 kDa). A volume of 2 ml of phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5) without or with solute was prepared and dispensed into two Eppendorf tubes, 1 ml each. An aliquot of the concentrated protein solution or of phosphate buffer was added to each Eppendorf, and these solutions were used to fill up the sample and reference cells, respectively. Both solutions were degassed for 8 min under vacuum, prior to the calorimetric experiments. DSC scans were run at a constant heating rate of 1 °C/min from 20 to 80 °C when no solute was added and up to 90 °C when MG (or glycerol or trehalose) was present. An overpressure of about 30 p.s.i. was applied to the calorimeter cells. Reversibility of SNase thermal unfolding was assessed by performing two sequential DSC scans with each protein solution. In all assays, the area under the heat absorption peak of the second scan had, on average, at least 80% of that obtained in the first scan. The thermodynamic parameters were determined in each case on the basis of five independent runs. Raw calorimetric data were converted to heat capacity by subtracting the buffer baseline, determined under identical conditions, and dividing by the scan rate and the sample protein concentration. The data were analyzed with EXAM software (18Kirchhoff W.H. NIST Technical Note 1401. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1993Google Scholar). This program uses a sigmoidal baseline to yield a van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHvH), a transition temperature (Tm, the temperature at half the peak area), and the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal) that can be obtained from the ratio between the transition peak area and the number of moles of protein in the calorimetric cell. The change in heat capacity (ΔCp) is calculated from the baseline shift by the software in the data-fitting procedure. The expression used in EXAM to fit the calorimetric data was, dQdT=(1−α)[Ba+Ba'(T−Tm)]+N(ΔH(T)2RT2)F(α)+α[Bb−Ba'(T−Tm)] Eq.1 where dQ/dT is the derivative of the heat exchanged with respect to temperature, α is the extent of reaction (F(α) = α(1–α)), [Ba – Ba′(T – Tm)] is the pre-transition baseline, [Bb – Bb′(T – Tm)] is the posttransition baseline, ΔH is the van't Hoff enthalpy, and N is the number of protein moles present in the calorimeter cell. Protein concentrations around 16 μm were typically used. Steady-state Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Measurements were carried out using a SPEX spectrofluorometer, Fluorolog 212I at 90° geometry with excitation and emission slits of 1 mm. Spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the emission monochromator and the photomultiplier. Excitation was set to 280 nm for NAWA measurements and 292 nm for the SNase measurements to assure that only the tryptophan residue was excited. To remove oxygen NAWA solutions were left for 1 h under a nitrogen flow. Temperature was controlled with a circulating water bath. Fluorescence quantum yields of NAWA and nuclease were calculated from the integral of the emission bands, using p-terphenyl in cyclohexane at 20 °C as standard, ϕ = 0.77 (19Murov S.L. Carmichael I. Hug G.L. Handbook of Photochemistry. 2nd. Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1993: 1-53Google Scholar). Nuclease fluorescence emission spectra were performed in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5) in the absence and presence of 0.5 m MG at different temperatures. Nuclease concentration was adjusted to ∼16 μm, which corresponds to an absorbance of ∼0.1 at 292 nm. Time-resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence decays were measured using a time-correlated single-photon-counting apparatus (20Giestas L. Yihwa C. Lima J.C. Vautier-Giongo C. Lopes A. Maçanita A.L. Quina F.H. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003; 107: 3263-3269Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Vertically polarized excitation light at 292 nm was obtained with the third harmonic of the output (876 nm) of a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics Tsunami) pumped by a Millenia X (Spectra-Physics) laser. Fluorescence emission was collected at 90° geometry, passed through a Glen-Thompson polarizer at 54.7° (magic angle) and a monochromator (360 nm) (Jobin-Yvon H20 Vis), and finally detected with a microchannel-plate photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R3809u-50). Automated alternate measurements (1 kilocount per cycle) of the excitation pulse, and sample emissions were made until 5–30 kilocounts at the maximum were reached. The fluorescence decays were deconvoluted from the excitation pulse using G. Striker's Sand program, which allows for individual and global analyses of the decays with individual shift optimization (21Striker G. Subramaniam V. Seidel C.A. Volkmer A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 8612-8617Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Thermodynamic parameters associated to SNase unfolding with and without MG were determined. Very high reproducibility of baselines was obtained both in the absence and presence of MG (Fig. 1). This is an important premise to obtain reliable parameters from DSC data. In the absence of solute, the van't Hoff enthalpy obtained from the fitting was 84 ± 4 kcal mol–1, and the calorimetric enthalpy was 83 ± 5 kcal mol–1, with a Tm of 53.9 ± 0.3 °C and a value of 1.7 ± 0.5 kcal K–1 mol–1 for the heat capacity change (Table I). The transition is thus perfectly described by a two-state model (ΔHvH/ΔHcal = 1.0). The enthalpy values are in good agreement with those reported in the literature, which vary between 84.1 and 88.8 kcal mol–1 (22Shortle D. Meeker A.K. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4761-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Griko Y.V. Privalov P.L. Sturtevant J.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The heat capacity change (ΔCp) of SNase during thermal unfolding was determined from the calorimetric curve with the EXAM software using a sigmoidal baseline. The use of this procedure to extract ΔCp is fully reasonable given the high sensitivity and reproducibility of the VP DSC calorimeter (25Hinz H.-J. Schwarz F.P. Pure Appl. Chem. 2001; 73: 745-759Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The value of ΔCp obtained for SNase, in the absence of solute, is within the range of values found in the literature, which vary between 1.7 kcal K–1 mol–1 (22Shortle D. Meeker A.K. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4761-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and 2.7 kcal K–1 mol–1 (26Eftink M.R. Biophys.

The calorimetric enthalpy at Tm was 88 ± 6 kcal mol–1 and the van't Hoff enthalpy was 95 ± 3 kcal mol–1. This slight deviation from a two-state model (ΔHvH/ΔHcal = 1.07 ± 0.08) was not significant. An increase in ΔCp of about 2-fold was observed (Table I). DSC was also used to study the effect of MG concentration (up to 1 m) on the Tm of SNase (Table II). At 0.5 m concentration, glycerol or trehalose increased the Tm of SNase by 0.8 °C and 4.2 °C, respectively, a much lesser effect than that provided by MG (Table II).Table IIEffect of mannosylglycerate concentration on the melting temperature of SNase in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, determined by DSCSoluteMannosylglycerateGlycerolTrehaloseConcentration (m)00.10.250.51.00.50.5Tm (°C)53.9 ± 0.354.9aSingle experiments were carried out; the standard deviation of this type of measurements is lower than 2 °C.58.2aSingle experiments were carried out; the standard deviation of this type of measurements is lower than 2 °C.61.0 ± 1.667.4aSingle experiments were carried out; the standard deviation of this type of measurements is lower than 2 °C.54.7aSingle experiments were carried out; the standard deviation of this type of measurements is lower than 2 °C.58.1aSingle experiments were carried out; the standard deviation of this type of measurements is lower than 2 °C.a Single experiments were carried out; the standard deviation of this type of measurements is lower than 2 °C. Open table in a new tab Absorption and Emission Spectra of SNase and NAWA—The absorption spectrum of SNase in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5) at 20 °C reflects the presence of a single tryptophan and seven tyrosine residues (Fig. 2). As expected, the extinction coefficient of SNase at λmax = 280 nm was identical to the weighted sum of the extinction coefficients of tyrosine and tryptophan. At wavelengths above 290 nm the absorption is mainly due to the single tryptophan residue. Above the melting temperature, a clear decrease of SNase absorption, caused primarily by the exposure of buried tyrosine residues to the aqueous external solvent, was observed (Fig. 2) (27Cowgil R. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence Concepts. 2. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1976: 411-486Google Scholar, 28Bailey J.E. Beaven G.H. Chignell D.A. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 7: 5-14Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Upon increasing the temperature, the fluorescence spectra of SNase in the same buffer, measured with 292-nm excitation, showed an increase of the maximum emission wavelength (λem) accompanied by a pronounced decrease of the quantum yield (ϕf) (Figs. 2 and 3). This effect was particularly evident between 45 and 65 °C, the temperature range for SNase unfolding. Fluorescence quantum yields and maximum emission wavelengths of SNase, measured as a function of temperature, are presented in Fig. 3. This figure also shows the temperature dependence of the quantum yields and emission wavelengths of the model compound NAWA in different dioxane-water mixtures with polarities ranging from dioxane to water. The values of the maximum emission wavelength of NAWA increased with solvent polarity and, as expected, were independent of the temperature, whereas the quantum yield gradually decreased with either the increase of the solvent polarity (Table III) or temperature (Fig. 3).Table IIIFluorescence maximum wavelength (λem), quantum yield (ϕf) and lifetime (τf) of NAWA in dioxane-water mixtures at 23 °CϵnD2λemϕfτfkfknrnmns107 s-1NAWA water (% v/v)02.22.0213260.275.25.014.22010.92.0113330.265.14.814.54027.81.9953380.244.84.716.06045.01.9663410.204.14.619.58063.01.8893450.173.64.323.410078.41.7773540.133.13.828.5SNaseNo solute3290.275.64.813.0MG3290.275.74.712.8 Open table in a new tab Below 45 °C, the quantum yield and emission wavelength of SNase were similar to those of NAWA in a low polarity environment (∼90:10 v/v dioxane-water mixture). However, in the 45–65 °C temperature range, the quantum yield of SNase decreased abruptly while the maximum emission wavelength increased; finally, above 65 °C, the quantum yield and emission wavelength of SNase became similar to the values of NAWA in an environment with polarity close to that of water. These observations clearly indicate that, within the 45–65 °C temperature range, SNase unfolds, exposing its tryptophan residue to water, whereas below 45 °C, the tryptophan residue inside the native SNase probes a relatively low polarity environment. Fluorescence Decays of SNase and NAWA—Fluorescence decays of NAWA in dioxane-water mixtures were measured at temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 80 °C, with excitation at λexc = 292 nm, emission at λem = 360 nm and a time resolution of 24.3 ps/channel. The decays were strictly single exponentials, independent of the number of counts at the maximum (up to 30 kilocounts). Single exponential decay laws of NAWA in water were also observed in other laboratories (29Petrich J.W. Chang M.C. McDonald D.B. Fleming G.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3824-3832Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 30Szabo A.G. Rayner D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 554-563Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The presence of 10 mm phosphate buffer or 0.5 m MG did not affect the NAWA decay in water, but the effect could not be assessed in dioxane or dioxane-water mixtures due to the low solubility of these compounds. The fluorescence lifetime of NAWA at room temperature decreased from 5.2 ns in dioxane to 3.1 ns in water, following a trend with solvent polarity similar to that of the quantum yield (Table III). For each solvent or mixture, increasing temperature induced the expected decrease of the fluorescence lifetime (Fig. 4A). The radiative (kf) and the sum of the radiationless (knr) decay rates of NAWA in dioxane-water mixtures were calculated from quantum yields (ϕf) and fluorescence lifetimes (τf) by kf = ϕf/τf and knr = (1 – ϕf)/τf (Table III). The radiative rate constant (kf) shows the expected proportionality to the squared refractive index of the mixture, decreasing from dioxane to water, while knr increases with solvent polarity. The combined effect of the two variations induces the observed decrease of both fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime from dioxane to water. A similar increase of knr has been observed for other compounds in dioxane-water mixtures and has been attributed to the increase of the internal conversion rate constant upon increasing water content (31Maçanita A.L.

The values of the radiative and radiationless rate constants of SNase at 23 °C were similar to those of NAWA in dioxane (Table III), thus indicating a low polarity environment of the tryptophan residue in the native protein. At 70 °C, the quantum yield and the major lifetime (τ2) of SNase were similar to those of NAWA in water at the same temperature, reflecting the high degree of exposure of the tryptophan residue to water in the unfolded protein. The quantum yield and emission wavelength profiles led to a similar conclusion. The nature of the fluorescence decay of SNase in water at 23 °C, measured with a time resolution of 24.3 ps/channel, was not so simple. Typically, the decays could be fitted only with double-exponential functions, although the long-lived component (∼5.5 ns) accounted for more than 95–99% of the total fluorescence emission. The minor component had a poorly defined lifetime ranging from 1 to 3 ns, whose weight varied with the protein preparation, but in one of the preparations it was undoubtedly absent (Fig. 5A). The observation of this single-exponential function means that the decay of the tryptophan fluorescence in the native form of SNase is genuinely single-exponential, and, therefore, the residual short time appearing in most SNase samples"
https://openalex.org/W2072568946,"The stimulation of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux by apolipoprotein A-I is mediated by the activity of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Individuals with Tangier disease harbor loss-of-function mutations in this transporter that have proven useful in illuminating its activity. Here, we analyze a mutation that deletes the last 46 residues of the 2261 amino acid transporter (Δ46) and eliminates its lipid efflux. As the final four amino acids of the C terminus represent a putative PDZ-binding motif, we initially characterized deletion mutants lacking only these residues. Although a moderate decline in lipid efflux was detected, this decline was not as profound as that seen in the Δ46 mutant. Subsequent systematic analysis of the ABCA1 C terminus revealed a novel, highly conserved motif (VFVNFA) that was required for lipid efflux. Alteration of this motif, which is present in some but not all members of the ABCA family, did not prevent trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane but did eliminate its binding of apoA-I. Chimeric transporters, generated by substituting the C termini of either ABCA4 or ABCA7 for the endogenous terminus, demonstrated that ABCA1 could stimulate cholesterol efflux without its PDZ-binding motif but not without the VFVNFA motif. When a peptide containing the VFVNFA sequence was introduced into ABCA1-expressing cells, ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux was also markedly inhibited. These results indicate that the C-terminal VFVNFA motif of ABCA1 is essential for its lipid efflux activity.

In Tangier disease, loss of ABCA1 activity results in the near absence of circulating high density lipoproteins and the deposition of massive amounts of cholesterol esters in peripheral tissues. At the cellular level, loss of ABCA1 function eliminates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids in response to stimulation with the major apolipoprotein of the high density lipoproteins, apoA-I. At the molecular level, a variety of evidence indicates that ABCA1 forms a high affinity complex with apoA-I by binding amphipathic helices within the apolipoprotein (9Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P.

Analysis of naturally occurring and engineered ABCA1 mutations has proven to be a fruitful approach in studying the efflux mechanism. We have previously elucidated the ABCA1 transporter's topology and characterized some of its interactions with apoA-I using this approach (11Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P.

In our ongoing effort to define the structure/function relationships that underlie the ABCA1 efflux mechanism, we focused on a truncation mutant that we had originally identified in a patient with Tangier disease (8Brousseau M.E. Schaefer E.J. Dupuis J. Eustace B. Van Eerdewegh P. Goldkamp A.L. Thurston L.M. FitzGerald M.G. Yasek-McKenna D. O'Neill G. Eberhart G.P. Weiffenbach B. Ordovas J.M. Freeman M.W. Brown Jr., R.H.

The deleted sequences were of interest, as they included a cytoplasmic motif (ESYV) that conforms to the consensus sequence for binding to PDZ domain-containing proteins. PDZ proteins are named for the founding members of the group (PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1) and have been shown to play a critical role in cellular physiology through their participation in the formation of multimeric protein complexes (20Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). This diverse group of proteins contains one or more copies of a 90-amino acid domain that can bind the C termini of proteins ending in consensus motifs such as (S/T)XV-COOH, as is the case for class I PDZ binding domains (21Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Indeed, using yeast two-hybrid screens and either the last 165 or 120 amino acids of the ABCA1 C terminus, two groups have recently reported the interaction of ABCA1 with three proteins containing PDZ domains (the α1 and β2 syntrophins and Lin7) and one non-PDZ protein (Fas-associated death domain protein) (22Buechler C.

To functionally characterize the importance of the putative PDZ-binding motif and to explore the impact of the loss of the C-terminal 46 amino acids in detail, we generated a series of ABCA1 C-terminal mutants. Initially, it was observed that the loss of the four amino acids composing the PDZ-binding motif, although detrimental to function, did not recapitulate the loss of all 46 amino acids at the C terminus. Further analysis demonstrated that the sequence between -41 and -46 (VFVNFA) was critical for efflux activity and that its loss abrogated apoA-I binding to ABCA1. This sequence is shared by some but not all members of the ABCA class of transporters. This finding was exploited to demonstrate that ABCA1 can efflux lipid normally when the VFVNFA-containing ABCA4 C terminus is substituted for that of ABCA1. That this activity is reconstituted despite the absence of the PDZ-binding motif in this chimeric protein indicates that the motif is not required for ABCA1 activity in all cell types. Substitution of the ABCA7 C terminus, which lacks the VNVNFA sequence but retains the PDZ motif, did not produce an active transporter, further corroborating this conclusion. When these results are coupled with our finding that an intracellular peptide containing the VFVNFA motif was able to strongly inhibit ABCA1-dependent efflux, the data suggest that this motif in the C terminus of ABCA1 plays a critical role in facilitating its interactions with other proteins required for the transporter's lipid efflux activity. Reagents—The following reagents were purchased from the indicated suppliers: LipofectAMINE 2000, the Anti-Xpress mouse monoclonal antibody, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's cell culture medium were from Invitrogen; dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was from Pierce; Gamma Bind Plus Sepharose came from Amersham Biosciences; the anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody was from Sigma; poly-d-lysine-coated tissue culture plates were from BD Biosciences; apoA-I was purchased from Biodesign, Saco, ME; radionucleotides were from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences; nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and pQE-30 vector were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); and the rabbit anti-Rab6 antibody came from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). DNA Constructs—Deletions in the C terminus of ABCA1 (Δ117, Δ46, Δ40, Δ30, Δ20, Δ10, and Δ4) were generated by PCR using a common forward primer that anneals to nt position 6088 of the open reading frame and unique reverse primers annealing at nt 6719, nt 6935, nt 6953, nt 6983, nt 7013, nt 7043, and nt 7061, respectively. The C-terminal mutant products were cloned into the ABCA1 cDNA using the BamHI site at nt position 6275 of the ABCA1 open reading frame. To generate tagged mutants, GFP was fused at the N terminus or a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was inserted in the N-terminal extracellular loop as described previously (11Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S.

Wild type tagged ABCA1 transporters interact with apoA-I and retain normal efflux activity (11Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Fitzgerald M.L. J. Biol.

Mutations of the VFVNFA motif of ABCA1 (2215VFVNFA2220 → 2215AAAAAA2220, 2215VFVNFA2220 → 2215VFLYFS2220, V2215A, F2216A, V2217A, V2217L, N2218A, and F2219A) were generated by overlap PCR. The ABCA1/A4 and A7 chimeras were generated by cloning the last 171 and 189 amino acids from the ABCA4 and A7 open reading frames, respectively, into the BamHI site at nt position 6275 of the ABCA1 open reading frame, replacing the terminal 184 amino acids of the protein. The human ABCA4 cDNA template was a generous gift of Dr. Jeremy Nathans (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). ABCA1/A4 and A7 chimeras in which the C terminus of ABCA1 was replaced from Val-2215 of the VFVNFA motif were generated by overlap PCR. All mutations were verified by sequencing of the resulting cDNA. Efflux Assays and Parallel Measurement of Total and Cell Surface ABCA1—Cholesterol efflux of both HEK293 (henceforth referred to as 293) and 293-EBNA-T cells transfected with mutant and wild type ABCA1 was measured in 24-well plates (two plates with FLAG constructs and two plates with GFP constructs). 24 h post-transfection, the media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/10% fetal bovine serum media containing 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol or with media containing an equivalent amount of unlabeled cholesterol. To measure efflux activity, after 24 h the cells receiving [3H]cholesterol were washed twice with warm PBS, incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 mg/ml BSA) for 2 h, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 mg/ml BSA) with or without 10 μg/ml apoA-I for an additional 20 h. In parallel, the plates of unlabeled cells were chilled on ice for 10 min and cell surface expression of ABCA1 was detected by an M2 anti-FLAG antibody, while total ABCA1 expression was measured in GFP-ABCA1-transfected cells by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur System; BD Biosciences). The percentage of cholesterol efflux (cpm media/(cpm media + cell-associated cpm) × 100) was calculated by scintillation counting. Cell surface ABCA1 expression was calculated as cpm 125I-labeled secondary antibody bound per milligram of total cell protein (Bio-Rad protein assay), and total transporter expression was expressed as the average GFP-ABCA1 fluorescent intensity. Cholesterol efflux was normalized by subtracting the efflux activity of mock transfected cells and then dividing by the cell surface or total expression of ABCA1. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The S.D. of these measures was calculated and propagated after normalization using formulas for the subtraction and division of errors. PDZ Domain Binding Assays—The interaction of PDZ domains with the ABCA1 C terminus was measured by overlay and oligopeptide binding assays (26Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For overlay assays, His-tagged ABCA1 polypeptides containing amino acids 2076–2261 or 2076–2257 (Δ4) were generated. To express the PDZ domains 1 and 2 of PSD-95, a pRSETB plasmid (generous gift of Dr. Morgan Sheng, Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) containing a sequence corresponding to amino acids 84–398 of human PSD-95 was used. As a positive control for binding to PSD-95, glutathione S-transferase fused with amino acids 1453 to 1482 of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR2BC was used (26Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His6-tagged Rab6 and Rab11 polypeptides were used as negative controls for PDS-95 binding (27Fitzgerald M.L. Reed G.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Polypeptides were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and allowed to renature in 1× PBS (with 3% BSA) overnight. The transferred polypeptides were incubated with PSD-95 (1× 250 nm PBS and 3% BSA) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with 1× PBS (with 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with anti-express mouse monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution). Membranes were washed, and bound antibody was detected with an anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:30,000 dilution) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal; Pierce). Blots were stripped and sequentially re-probed with rabbit anti-ABCA1 antibody (25Fitzgerald M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-Rab6 antibody. To assess whether ABCA1-PDZ interactions have class I binding specificity, we used 20- and 16-mer biotinylated peptides representing the C termini of ABCA1 with and without the PDZ binding motif, respectively, immobilized on a streptavidin column. In vitro transcribed RNAs representing E-tag PDZ fusions of the first PDZ domain of PSD-95 (residues 41–161), the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 (residues 123–267), and Dlg-1 (residues 209–332) or the first and second PDZ domains of syntenin (residues 101–285) were translated in 500 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions (Novagen) in the presence of 200 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The E-tag PDZ fusions were purified from the lysate using an anti-E-tag column (Amersham Biosciences) and buffer was exchanged into 1× TnT (40 mm triethylamine, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, and 100 μg/ml BSA) using NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The purified PDZ domains were applied to 200 μl of the streptavidin-charged agarose and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The columns were washed with 10-column volumes of 1× TnT, and the bound fraction was eluted with free wild type ABCA1 peptide. The amount of input and eluted protein was quantitated by scintillation counting and expressed as percent bound. Peptide Synthesis and Inhibition Assays—To test whether the VFVNFA motif alone could act in trans to modulate ABCA1 efflux activity, we generated peptides containing VFVNFA or six alanines fused to the C terminus of the third α-helix of the Antennapedia homeo-domain (N-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKVFVNFA-C and N-RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKAAAAAA-C) (28May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 29Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified to >95% homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry. To measure the efficiency of cellular uptake, peptides were biotinylated and incubated with 293-EBNA-T cells for 2 h. The cells were washed extensively, trypsinized to remove any cell surface-associated peptide, and lysed to determine the amount of internalized peptide. Equivalent amounts of cellular protein were spotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). For efflux assays, 293-EBNA-T cells transfected with wild type ABCA1 or empty vector were loaded with [3H]cholesterol for 24 h, washed extensively, and treated with the Antennapedia peptides (50 μm) or vehicle (1% EtOH) for 2 h. Cells were then exposed or not exposed to apoA-I (10 μg/ml) for an additional 20 h, and the amount of cholesterol efflux was measured as described above. For acute inhibition assays, after incubation with the Antennapedia peptides for 2 h a wash step was added to remove free peptide before the addition of apoA-I. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue uptake and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assays (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) to ensure that the peptides were not cytotoxic. All assays were performed on triplicate samples. Pattern Searches for the VFVNFA Motif—A BLAST-P (2.2.9 release) search of the non-redundant translated data bases was done using the VFVNFA motif as a query sequence (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Search parameters optimized for finding short, nearly exact matches were used (word size, 2; SEG filter, off; expect value, 20,000; composition based statistics, off, score matrix, PAM30). An additional search using a pattern-hit initiated BLAST using the entire ABCA1 protein sequence confirmed that the VFVNFA sequence was uniquely conserved in the ABCA class members A1, A2, and A4 from vertebrate organisms. Additional searches for ABCA transporters encoded by the genomes of Fugu rubripes and Ciona intestinalis were done through the web portal maintained by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (www.jgi.doe.gov). The ABCA1 C Terminus Is Highly Conserved and Is Bound by Class I PDZ Domains—To characterize the Δ46 Tangier mutation, we first determined whether the deleted sequences were conserved and, if so, whether they could be bound by PDZ domains. The alignment of six ABCA1 orthologues showed that the sequences are strongly conserved (Fig. 1A). There is 91.3% identity between the C termini of human and chicken ABCA1 transporters, which are separated by 300 million years of evolution. This conservation is most striking relative to a comparably sized region in the variable first large extracellular loop of ABCA1 (40.4% identity between the sequences comprising codons 190 to 236). As the final four residues of the C terminus constituted a putative class I PDZ-binding motif, we examined the binding of several PDZ proteins to the ABCA1 C terminus using an overlay binding assay. We first tested the founding class I PDZ protein, PSD-95, in this assay (21Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 31Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The last 186 amino acids of ABCA1 were expressed as a His-tagged polypeptide ending either with a wild type C terminus or with the C-terminal PDZ binding motif truncated (Δ4). The ABCA1 polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose along with a known binding partner of PSD-95, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR2B (26Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An epitope-tagged polypeptide encompassing the PDZ domains 1 and 2 of PSD-95 was incubated with the transferred proteins, and the binding of the polypeptide was detected using an anti-epitope antibody. PSD-95 bound both the wild type ABCA1 polypeptide and the NR2B C terminus (Fig. 1B). Truncation of the ABCA1 ESYV motif largely ablated the PSD-95 interaction. In contrast, PSD-95 did not bind two other His-tagged proteins that did not contain consensus PDZ-binding motifs. Because PSD-95 expression is largely confined to neuronal tissues whereas ABCA1 is ubiquitously expressed, we screened for additional class I PDZ proteins in a library constructed from cells known to express high levels of ABCA1. RNA for reverse transcription PCR reactions was prepared from human THP-1 macrophages treated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which up-regulates ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux (32Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Reactions were run using primers designed to amplify class I PDZ proteins (PSD-95, Dlg-1, NE-dlg, and chapsyn-110) as well as the class II PDZ protein syntenin. In data not shown, we were able to amplify a small amount of a PSD-95 product. In contrast, Dlg-1 expression was easily detected whereas the expression of NE-dlg or chapsyn-110 was not. A product representing syntenin was also reliably amplified. To determine whether ABCA1-PDZ protein interactions have class I specificity, the PDZ domains from PSD-95, Dlg-1, and syntenin, were assessed for their ability to bind the ABCA1 C terminus. As with PSD-95, the second PDZ domain of Dlg-1 bound a C-terminal ABCA1 peptide, whereas the PDZ domains of syntenin did not (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that the highly conserved C terminus of ABCA1 can interact with proteins containing class I but not class II PDZ domains. The ABCA1 C Terminus Is Essential for Efflux but the PDZ Protein-binding Motif Is Not—To test the functional importance of the C terminus, we engineered the 46-amino acid Tangier deletion (Q2215X, Δ46) as well as a larger deletion described by Clee et al. (R2144X, Δ117) (33Clee S.M. Zwinderman A.H. Engert J.C. Zwarts K.Y. Molhuizen H.O. Roomp K. Jukema J.W. van Wijland M. van Dam M. Hudson T.J. Brooks-Wilson A. Genest Jr., J. Kastelein J.J. Hayden M.R. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) into our cDNA constructs. Both mutants showed no efflux activity (data not shown). The activity of a mutant with a deletion of the PDZ binding motif alone (elimination of only the last four amino acids of ABCA1, Δ4) was then compared with the activity of the Δ46 mutant. Both mutants were similarly expressed, as determined by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the N terminus of ABCA1 (Fig. 2A). Δ4, when expressed at moderate levels in 293 cells, consistently showed efflux deficits of up to 60% as compared with wild type ABCA1 activity. This defect, however, was much less apparent in 293-EBNA-T cells, which express our constructs at a much higher level than traditional 293 cells because of replication of the transfected DNA in the EBNA-T-expressing cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast to Δ4, Δ46 showed a complete loss in efflux activity regardless of expression level. The failure of the deletion of the PDZ-binding motif sequence to recapitulate the loss of the terminal 46 amino acids of ABCA1 indicated that other sequences in the C terminus were playing a functionally important role. We next turned our attention to identifying those sequences. C-terminal Deletion Mutants Reveal a Negative Regulatory Region between -30 and -40 —To refine the sequences responsible for the loss of activity of Δ46, a series of 10 amino acid deletions in ABCA1 were constructed. Like Δ4, the Δ10, Δ20, and Δ30 transporters showed similar losses in efflux activity when expressed in 293 cells but were again largely indistinguishable from wild type ABCA1 when expressed in 293-EBNA-T cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Surprisingly, in both cell types Δ40 showed less functional impairment than the shorter truncations, suggesting that a negative regulatory e"

This pathway is thought to diverge from the usual pathway at the mannose-inositol-phospho-ceramide (MIPC) step. To confirm this hypothesis, a C. albicans gene homologue for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUR1 gene was identified and named MIT1 as it coded for GDP-mannose:inositol-phospho-ceramide mannose transferase. Two copies of this gene were disrupted. Western blots of cell extracts revealed that strain mit1Δ contained no PLM. Thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry confirmed that mit1Δ did not synthesize MIPC, demonstrating a role of MIT1 in the mannosylation of C. albicans IPCs. As MIT1 disruption prevented downstream β-1,2 mannosylation, mit1Δ represents a new C. albicans mutant affected in the expression of these specific virulence attributes, which act as adhesins/immunomodulators. mit1Δ was less virulent during both the acute and chronic phases of systemic infection in mice (75 and 50% reduction in mortality, respectively). In vitro, mit1Δ was not able to escape macrophage lysis through down-regulation of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation pathway previously shown to be triggered by PLM. Phenotypic analysis also revealed pleiotropic effects of MIT1 disruption. The most striking observation was a reduced β-mannosylation of phosphopeptidomannan. Increased β-mannosylation of mannoproteins was observed under growth conditions that prevented the association of β-oligomannosides with phosphopeptidomannan, but not with PLM. This suggests that C. albicans has strong regulatory mechanisms associating β-oligomannoses with different cell wall carrier molecules. These mechanisms and the impact of the different presentations of β-oligomannoses on the host response need to be defined.

Besides PPM, PLM is the second C. albicans molecule in which the presence of β-1,2 oligomannosides has been demonstrated chemically (9Trinel P.A. Cantelli C. Bernigaud A. Jouault T. Poulain D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PLM appears as a member of the cell membrane MIPC family from which it diverges by the addition of mannose and phosphate linking long linear chains of β-mannosides (10Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This large polysaccharide moiety confers hydrophilic properties on the molecule that allow it to diffuse into the cell wall (11Poulain D. Slomianny C. Jouault T. Gomez J.M. Trinel P.A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4323-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PLM is shed by C. albicans in contact with host cells (12Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and, through β-oligomannoses of its polysaccharide moiety, induces TNF-α synthesis through a toll-like receptor-2-NFκB activation pathway (13Jouault T. Ibata-Ombetta S. Takeuchi O. Trinel P.A. Sacchetti P. Lefebvre P. Akira S. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The same molecule is also at the center of the host cell response, but the mechanisms for this have not yet been elucidated. Finely tuned mechanisms induced by C. albicans PLM and involving the ERK pathway are among the non-adaptative events (14Lorenz M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 2001; 412: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) but can transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae into a macrophage-surviving yeast through the induction of macrophage apoptosis (15Ibata-Ombetta S. Idziorek T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. Jouault T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13086-13093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In parallel, studies on β-1,2 oligomannoside expression in C. albicans have shown that the association of these sequences with different carrier molecules such as PPM, mannoproteins, and PLM is dependent on growth conditions like pH (16Kobayashi H. Giummelly P. Takahashi S. Ishida M. Sato J. Takaku M. Nishidate Y. Shibata N. Okawa Y. Suzuki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and temperature likely to be encountered in host tissue (17Trinel P.A. Jouault T. Cutler J.E. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5274-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At low pH and high temperature, cell wall β-mannosides are not associated with proteins but almost exclusively with PLM. Depending on the co-receptors involved, these differences in presentation could lead the same molecules to trigger different immune pathways. Despite the recognized role of β-mannosides in C. albicans virulence, the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of β-mannosides and/or the genes encoding them have not yet been identified. In this study, elucidation of the structure of PLM and complete sequencing of the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans genomes enabled the identification of a candidate gene in the MIPC pathway, an analogue of SUR1 in S. cerevisiae (18Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which was named MIT1 in C. albicans. Inactivation of this gene prevented PLM β-mannosylation. The constructed mutants exhibited normal growth and morphotypes but displayed reduced virulence. It was interesting to note that PPM β-mannosylation was altered in the mutant at neutral pH, whereas at low pH the mutant compensated for the absence of β-mannosides in PPM and PLM by β-mannosylating cell wall mannoproteins. These results suggest that the expression of β-1,2 oligomannosides, which are among the virulence attributes of C. albicans, is closely regulated in this species. Strains and Medium—The C. albicans strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains were grown on YPD-uridine medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 20 mg/l uridine) at 37 °C for 16 h. S. cerevisiae strain Su1 was included as a reference strain for the study of yeast-macrophage interactions (19Ibata-Ombetta S. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic dextrose was prepared as described previously (20Rustchenko E.P. Howard D.H. Sherman F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3231-3241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When required, 5-fluoroorotic acid was added to synthetic dextrose medium at a concentration of 1 g/liter. The bacterial strain Escherichia coli XL1-blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for propagation of all plasmids. All procedures for manipulating DNA were performed as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene deletion strategy is shown in Fig. 3. Two ∼1-kb DNA fragments specific to the MIT1 upstream and downstream regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an HFPCR kit (Clontech) and the primer couples MIT1–5′5 (ATGTATGTGCTCATGGGTGCT), MIT-1–5′3 (AGATCTGGAAACAGTTGGTGTTGTTGGG) and MIT1–3′5 (AGATCTGGATCCGGTTGTCATCATCTTCCTCGT), MIT1–3′3 (GACACGATTCTTCCATGGCATC), respectively. Amplified fragments were then cloned in a pGEM-t Easy cloning vector (Promega), resulting in plasmids pAL35 and pAL36, respectively. The BglII-SphI fragment of pAL36 was then cloned at the BglII-SphI sites of the pAL35 plasmid to give plasmid pAL39. Finally, plasmid pAL41 was obtained by inserting the BglII-BamHI fragment of the pCUB-6 plasmid (22Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contained the hisG-URA3-hisG gene at the BglII-BamHI sites of pAL39. mit1-Δ::hisG-URA3-hisG was released from the plasmid by SpeI digestion and used to transform CAI4 by the lithium acetate method described previously (23Sanglard D. Ischer F. Monod M. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2300-2305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clones of MIT1/mit1-Δ::hisG-URA3-hisG were formed on synthetic dextrose plates, and cells were spread onto 5-fluoroorotic acid plates to isolate MIT1/mit1-Δ::hisG clones. A second round of transformation was performed to delete the second allele by the same method. Homologous integration of the cassette was checked by Southern blotting using DNA extracted from each strain and digested with SpeI. Released fragments were revealed with a MIT1-specific probe (pAL38/NotI; see below). Reintroduction of MIT1 into Mutant Cells—The complete MIT1 open reading frame and ∼1-kb 5′ and 3′ regions were amplified by PCR using an HFPCR kit (Clontech) and the primer couples MIT1–5′5 and MIT1–3′3. The amplified fragment was cloned in a pGEM-t Easy cloning vector (Promega), resulting in plasmid pAL38. Plasmid pAL51 was obtained by inserting the NotI-NotI fragment of pAL38 into the SmaI site of plasmid pRC3915 (24Cannon R.D. Jenkinson H.F. Shepherd M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) after fill in of the cohesive ends. Before transformation of the mit1-Δ::hisG/mit1-Δ::hisG strain, the plasmid was cut with SphI to target integration at the LEU2 locus. Microscopic Observations—Hyphae formation was induced on 5% horse serum, 2% agar, and on Spider medium (1% nutrient broth, 1% mannitol, 0.2% K2HPO4, 2% agar). Chlamydospore formation was analyzed in medium containing 17 g/liter corn meal agar (Difco), 0.33% Tween 80, 2% agar. Growth was performed at 28 or 37 °C for 2–5 days. For sensitivity assays to chemical agents, 5 μl of serial 1:10 dilutions of an overnight culture were spotted onto YPD agar (YPD medium, 2% agar) containing either 25 or 50 mm CaCl2, or 10, 20, or 50 μg/ml calcofluor white, or 0.001, 0.01, or 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 day. Whole-cell Extraction—Strains were grown at 37 °C on YPD-uridine at pH 6.0 or 2.0 (the pH was adjusted from 6.0 to 2.0 by adding 6 N HCl; Ref. 25Kobayashi H. Takahashi S. Shibata N. Miyauchi M. Ishida M. Sato J. Maeda K. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 968-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were extracted by alkaline extraction under reducing conditions (26Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated on ice in 1.85 m NaOH and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins and glycoconjugates were then extracted in SDS for 5 min at 100 °C. Extracts were adjusted to the same protein concentration and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) on a 5–20% acrylamide gel slab. Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibody 5B2 specific for β-1,2 oligomannoside epitopes (26Trinel P.A. Faille C. Jacquinot P.M. Cailliez J.C. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3845-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sendid B. Jouault T. Coudriau R. Camus D. Odds F. Tabouret M. Poulain D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2004; 42: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (diluted 1:2000) and then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat IgM (Southern Biotechnology Laboratories, Birmingham, AL). Phosphopeptidomannan Extraction—PPM was extracted as described previously (29Kocourek J. Ballou C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Faille C. Wieruszeski J.M. Lepage G. Michalski J.C. Poulain D. Strecker G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) from cells grown in neutral or acidic YPD-uridine as described above. Briefly, cell pellets were suspended in 0.02 m citrate buffer and autoclaved at 125 °C for 90 min. Suspensions were harvested, and Fehling's solution was added to the supernatant to precipitate PPM. The PPM was then washed in methanol/acetic acid (8/1) and dried in a Speed Vac concentrator. Sugar concentrations were estimated by the sulfuric phenol colorimetric method (31Dubois M. Gilles K. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Nature. 1951; 168: 167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). PPM was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Analysis of Sphingolipids—Strains were grown on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (Sabouraud's dextrose broth (30 g/liter; Difco), agar (15 g/liter)) for 16 h at 37 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. After two washes in water, cells were extracted twice in ethanol/water/diethylether/pyridine/ammonia (15/9/5/1/0.018) (32Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at 60 °C. The supernatants were pooled and dried in a Speed Vac concentrator. Then each sphingolipid extract was treated successively with chloroform/methanol (10/10), chloroform/methanol/water (10/10/1), and chloroform/methanol/water (10/10/3). The different supernatants were pooled, analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on 10 × 5 cm silica gel 60 plates (Merck) using a chloroform/methanol/ammonia 4.2 N (9/7/2) solvent system and revealed with orcinol. The sphingolipid extracts were finally analyzed by mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass measurements were carried out in negative ion mode on a triple quadrupole instrument (Micromass Ltd, Altrincham, UK) fitted with an atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray source. A mixture of polypropylene glycol was used to calibrate the quadrupole mass spectrometer. The samples were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluted in methanol to obtain a final concentration of ∼0.25 μg/μl. Solutions were infused using a Harvard syringe pump at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The quadrupole was scanned from 400 to 2200 Da with a scan duration of 6 s and a scan delay of 0.1 s. The samples were sprayed using a 3.5-kV needle voltage, and the declustering cone was set at 70 V. Animal Model for Assessment of Virulence—Strains were grown on YPD-uridine at 37 °C for 16 h and then suspended at a density of 106 yeasts/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. 200 ml of each suspension were injected intravenously into the lateral tail vein of Swiss mice (7 weeks of age, female). The survival of each mouse was monitored until day 25 after injection. Yeast-Macrophage Interactions—The mouse macrophage-like cell line, J774 (ECACC 85011428), which was derived from a tumor in a female BALB/c mouse, was cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Valbiotech, Paris, France), 5 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml penicillin. Before each experiment, cells were gently scraped with a rubber policeman, distributed into 12-well culture plates at a concentration of 106 cells/well, and incubated for 18 h to allow adherence. Plated cells were incubated with yeasts at a concentration of 20 yeasts/J774 cell. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were washed to remove unbound yeasts and prepared for either biochemical analysis or fungicidal assays. Fungicidal Assays—J774 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with yeast cells, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then recultured at 37 °C for a further 90 min. The cultures were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and endocytosed yeasts were released by lysing the J774 cells with sterile water. The yeast cells recovered were counted, and 100 individual cells in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were plated onto Sabouraud's dextrose agar. After incubation for 24 h, the number of colony-forming units was determined. ERK1/2 Phosphorylation Analysis—Stimulated cells were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm NaF. Cultures were extracted with 500 μl of boiling 2× concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer (1× 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue). Lysates were collected and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Extracted proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-ERK1/2 phospho-specific antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5 (TNT) 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. After washing several times, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Laboratories) in TNT-5% bovine serum albumin. After washing, the membrane was incubated with ECL detection reagents (SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate; Pierce) and exposed to hyperfilm ECL. Identification of C. albicans MIT1 as the Potent Homologue of S. cerevisiae SUR1 Responsible for Mannosylation of the IPC Core, and Construction of mit1Δ and Revertant Strains—Complete elucidation of the C. albicans PLM structure (10Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that it was a member of the MIPC family, from which it differs by the presence of a second phosphate group and extensive mannosylation (Fig. 1, A and B). Among the genes involved in the S. cerevisiae MIPC biosynthetic pathway, SUR1 is responsible for mannosylation of the IPC core (18Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and its inactivation in S. cerevisiae results in viable mutants (18Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It was considered that biosynthesis of PLM in C. albicans uses the MIPC biosynthetic pathway described in S. cerevisiae and that inactivation of the C. albicans homologue of SUR1 could lead to C. albicans viable mutants defective in PLM biosynthesis (Fig. 1C). A SUR1 homologue was identified in the C. albicans genome whose open reading frame is referred to as IPF2067 in the C. albicans CandidaDB data base (genolist.pasteur.fr/CandidaDB/). It encodes a protein sharing 59% similarity in its amino acid sequence with S. cerevisiae Sur1p. As another gene has previously been named SUR1 in C. albicans, the current gene was designated MIT1, according to its putative function of encoding GDP-mannose:inositol-phospho-ceramide mannose transferase. Sur1p and Mit1p sequences contain four putative transmembrane domains and display the conserved “glycosyltransferase sugar-binding region containing the same DXD motif” domain (pfam Gly_transf_sug; PF04488) specific to some classes of glycosyltransferases (33Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The main differences lie in protein size (544 amino acids for Mit1p versus 382 for Sur1p) and in the presence of two asparagine- and serine-rich domains in the Mit1p C-terminal region that are not present in Sur1p (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Conserved regions between Mit1p and Sur1p sequences. The alignment was done with ClustalW 1.83 and edited with Genedoc. The black arrow underlines the glycosyltransferase sugar-binding domain. The aspargine- and serine-rich domains are boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Both alleles of the MIT1 gene were disrupted using the URA-blaster technique (Fig. 3A) described by Fonzi et al. (22Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and generated a set of single- and double-disrupted strains (Table I). A complemented strain was also constructed by reintroduction of a wild copy of the MIT1 gene into the mit-Δ::hisG/mit-Δ::hisG strain. Each strain was tested by Southern blotting to confirm correct integration of the cassette (Fig. 3B). All studies were performed on strains having one copy of the URA3 gene. Deletion of MIT1 Has No Effect on C. albicans Growth and Morphogenesis but Induces Increased Sensitivity to Some Agents Used to Detect Cell Wall Defects—When the growth of each strain in YPD or Sabouraud's broth was monitored, no significant difference was observed among the wild-type, revertant, or null strains (data not shown). Similarly, no difference was observed when strains were incubated in media inducing either yeast-hyphal transition or chlamydospore formation. All strains were able to produce hyphae and chlamydospores (Fig. 4). Therefore, deletion of MIT1 had no obvious microscopic effect on growth or morphogenesis. When strains were incubated on medium containing increasing concentrations of calcium, calcofluor white, and SDS, the mit1Δ strain was more sensitive to calcium and SDS than the wild-type and revertant strains (Fig. 5, A and C) but was equally resistant to calcofluor white (Fig. 5B). These results suggest a plasma membrane or cell wall structural defect in the mutant that could not be observed by microscopic analysis. MIT1 Is Involved in the PLM Biosynthetic Pathway—The effect of MIT1 deletion on expression of β-1,2 oligomannoside epitopes was analyzed on Western blots stained with an anti-β-1,2 oligomannoside monoclonal antibody (Fig. 6). Whole-cell extracts of strains grown at pH 6.0 (Fig. 6A) displayed β-1,2 oligomannoside epitopes on mannoproteins, but no PLM was apparent in the mit1Δ strain (arrow). PPM extracted from mit1Δ grown under the same conditions still displayed α-oligomannosides epitopes (data not shown) but revealed a strong decrease in β-1,2 oligomannoside epitope expression (Fig. 6C). When strains were grown at pH 2.0, a growth condition known to reduce PPM β-mannosylation, all strains displayed a strong reduction in PPM β-1,2 oligomannoside expression compared with growth at pH 6.0 (Fig. 6D). This reduction in expression of β-1,2 oligomannoside epitopes was also observed on mannoproteins but was less pronounced in mit1Δ (Fig. 6B), suggesting that in the absence of PLM and under conditions where PPM is poorly mannosylated a compensatory mechanism promotes additional mannosylation of mannoproteins. These results strongly suggest that in C. albicans all processes of β-mannosylation are related and are under the control of a global regulatory mechanism. MIT1 Is Involved in the Conversion of IPC into MIPC— Under the solvent and staining conditions used for TLC of sphingolipid extracts, PLM remained at the origin with other insoluble components, and two spots corresponding, respectively, to M(IP)2C and MIPC were observed (Fig. 7A). TLC of extracts from all strains showed that mit1Δ (lane 2) did not express MIPC or M(IP)2C. These results were confirmed by mass spectrometry of sphingolipid extracts. Strain CAF2–1 displayed (M-H) molecular-related ions revealing the presence of IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C (Fig. 7B, panel 1). As observed for M(IP)2C from strain VW32 (10Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), each of these sphingolipids displayed a series of five peaks arising from variability in their ceramide moiety, which combines C18 or C20 phytosphingosines with C24-C26 mono- or dihydroxylated fatty acids. The major peak resulted from linkage of the OH C24 fatty acid with C20 phytosphingosine. The mit1Δ strain still displayed IPC peaks but, as expected from TLC analysis, was devoid of MIPC and M(IP)2C (Fig. 7B, panel 2), which were recovered in the complemented strain (panel 3). These results confirm that MIT1 is needed for the conversion of IPC to MIPC. The mit1Δ Mutant Is Less Virulent in a Mouse Systemic Model of Infection—To determine whether MIT1 is involved in virulence, the mortality induced in a murine model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis was determined (Fig. 8). All mice infected with the wild-type or revertant strains died within 12 days postinjection. At this time, 65% of mice infected with mit1Δ were still alive. Fifty percent were fully resistant to infection within 1 month postinjection. These differences"

They bind to phosphorylated protein ligands and regulate their functions by a number of different mechanisms. The C-terminal part of the 14-3-3 protein is known to be involved in the regulation of 14-3-3 binding properties. The structure of this region is unknown; however, a possible location of the C-terminal stretch within the ligand binding groove of the 14-3-3 protein has been suggested. To fully understand the role of the C-terminal stretch in the regulation of the 14-3-3 protein binding properties, we investigated the physical location of the C-terminal stretch and its changes upon the ligand binding. For this purpose, we have used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements and molecular dynamics simulation. FRET measurements between Trp242 located at the end of the C-terminal stretch and a dansyl group attached at two different cysteine residues (Cys25 or Cys189) indicated that in the absence of the ligand, the C-terminal stretch occupies the ligand binding groove of 14-3-3 protein. Our data also showed that phosphopeptide binding displaces the C-terminal stretch from the ligand binding groove. Intramolecular distances calculated from FRET measurements fit well with distances obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of full-length 14-3-3ζ protein. 14-3-3 proteins are important regulators of numerous cellular signaling circuits.

Two canonical 14-3-3 binding motifs have been defined, RSXpSXP and RX(Y/F)XpSXP (5Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C.

Many of the 14-3-3 protein binding partners identified so far contain one of these motifs. Through the functional modulation of a wide range of binding partners, 14-3-3 proteins are involved in many biologically important processes, including cell cycle regulation, metabolism control, apoptosis, and control of gene transcription (1Fu H.

Each monomer consists of nine antiparallel α-helices and an amphipathic groove where the phosphorylated segment of the binding partner is bound. The primary structure of 14-3-3 proteins is highly conserved, with completely conserved residues forming either the dimer interface or the walls of the ligand binding groove. Maximal sequence diversity occurs within the flexible C-terminal stretch, which has been shown to be involved in the regulation of binding properties of 14-3-3 proteins (11Luo Z.J. Zhang X.F. Rapp U.

In addition, the C-terminal stretch of two vertebrate 14-3-3 isoforms (τ and ζ) contains a casein kinase Iα phosphorylation site at position 232 (17Dubois T. Rommel C. Howell S. Steinhussen U.

Phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins has been suggested to be an important regulatory mechanism of individual isoforms, and it has been shown that in vivo phosphorylation of the C-terminal phosphorylation site inhibits the interaction between 14-3-3ζ and Raf-1 kinase (17Dubois T.

Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) suggest that, in the absence of the ligand, the 14-3-3 protein C-terminal stretch could occupy the ligand binding groove and thus has to be pushed away during the ligand binding. Moreover, Truong et al. (14Truong A.B. Masters S.C. Yang H. Fu H. Proteins. 2002; 49: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) show that removal of the C terminus increases the binding affinity of 14-3-3ζ protein for several tested ligands and propose that the C terminus might function as an autoinhibitor by suppressing unspecific interactions between 14-3-3 protein and inappropriate ligands. In addition, we have recently shown that phosphopeptide binding changes the conformation and increases the flexibility of the 14-3-3 protein C-terminal stretch (16Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4531-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To fully understand the role of the C-terminal stretch in the regulation of 14-3-3 protein binding properties, we have attempted to provide evidence for the location of the missing C-terminal part of the 14-3-3 protein molecule. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) 1The abbreviations used are: FRET, Förster resonance energy transfer; 1,5-IAEDANS, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; AEDANS, 5-(((acetylamino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; pRaf-259, phosphorylated peptide Raf-259; MD, molecular dynamics; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. measurements between Trp242 (located within the C-terminal stretch) and a dansyl group (attached at two different cysteine residues) indicate that, in the absence of the ligand, the C-terminal stretch occupies the ligand binding groove of the 14-3-3 protein. Our data also showed that phosphopeptide binding displaces the C-terminal stretch from the ligand binding groove. Intramolecular distances calculated from FRET measurements fit well with distances obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of full-length 14-3-3ζ protein. Expression and Purification of 14-3-3 Proteins—All 14-3-3 protein mutants were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The 14-3-3 proteins were expressed and purified as described by Obsilova et al. (16Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4531-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Labeling of 14-3-3 Protein Mutants by 1,5-IAEDANS—Human 14-3-3ζ protein possesses three cysteine residues (Cys25, Cys94, and Cys189). To prepare proteins suitable for FRET measurements, we constructed three mutants containing a single cysteine residue (either at position 25, 94, or 189, respectively) and a single Trp residue located at the end of the C-terminal stretch at position 242. Covalent modification of the 14-3-3ζ protein containing the single Trp242 and single Cys residues either at position 25, 94, or 189, respectively, with 1,5-IAEDANS was carried out as described previously (19Polit A. Blaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein (50–70 μm) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA and label were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:40 and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h and then at 4 °C overnight in the dark. The free unreacted label was removed by gel filtration in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The incorporation stoichiometry was determined by the absorbance at 336 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5700 m-1 cm-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to check amino acid sequences of 14-3-3 protein constructs with mutated cysteines and verify the modification of cysteine residues by the AEDANS moiety. Samples were first separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the excised protein bands were digested directly in gel (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixtures were extracted by 30% acetonitrile and 0.5% acetic acid and subjected to the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer BI-FLEX (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and gridless delayed extraction ion source. Ion acceleration voltage was 19 kV, and the reflectron voltage was set to 20 kV. Spectra were calibrated externally using the monoisotopic [M+H]+ ion of peptide standards angiotensin I (Sigma). A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in 30% MeCN 0.3% acetic acid was used as a MALDI matrix. A 1-μl sample was loaded on the target, and the droplet was allowed to dry at ambient temperature, overlaid with 1 μl of matrix solution, and then allowed to co-crystallize at ambient temperature. Negative and positive ion mass spectra of peptide maps were measured in the reflection mode to check amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides with mutated cysteines (Cys25 or Cys189) in used 14-3-3ζ protein mutants and to control the labeling of proteins with 1,5-IAEDANS. The detected peak in negative ion mass spectra having the mass of 896.4 (m/z) corresponds to peptide ACSLAK (590.3 m/z) with labeled Cys189 by 1,5-IAEDANS, and similarly, the peak of 1351.6 (m/z) fits to peptide YDDMAACMK (1045.4 m/z) with labeled Cys25 by 1,5-IAEDANS. The identity and structure of these labeled tryptic peptides were further corroborated by analysis of their post-source decay spectra (data not shown). Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were taken on a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer at 22 °C with 5 μm protein in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA in 10-mm cells. Excitation was done at 295 nm; the bandwidths were 5 nm for both excitation and emission. Synthetic peptides LSQRQRSTSTPNVHMV (Raf-259) or LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHMV (pRaf-259), where pS denotes phosphoserine (PolyPeptide Laboratories, Prague, Czech Republic) dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl buffer were used as 14-3-3 ligands. 14-3-3 protein concentration was 6 μm, and ligand (pRaf-259 or Raf-259 peptide) concentration was 25 μm. Fluorescence Peptide Binding Assay—Fluorescence energy transfer between AEDANS and fluorescein has been used to determine the dissociation constant of peptide binding to AEDANS-labeled 14-3-3ζ protein mutants (21Zhang H. Liu X.H. Zhang K. Chen C.K. Frederick J.M. Prestwich G.D. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 407-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer. Peptides Raf-259 and pRaf-259 with a fluorescein group attached to the N terminus (PolyPeptide Laboratories, Prague, Czech Republic) were titrated into the cuvette containing 400 nm 14-3-3ζ protein mutants labeled by 1,5-IAEDANS in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA buffer. After mixing, the samples were incubated for 1 min at room temperature, and then the dansyl fluorescence at 480 nm was recorded using an excitation wavelength of 336 nm. The relative change in the fluorescence signal, fB, was plotted as a function of peptide concentration and was fitted to Equation 1 (22Kohler J.J. Schepartz A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to determine the KD values, fB={1/(2[14-3-3])}{KD+[14-3-3]+[Pep]−(KD+[14-3-3]+[Pep])2−4[14-3-3][Pep]} Eq.1 where KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Nonlinear data fitting was performed using the Origin 6.0 software package (Microcal Software Inc.). Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was observed between the single tryptophan residue Trp242 and the AEDANS moiety covalently attached to Cys25 or Cys189. Fluorescence intensity decays of Trp242 were measured on an apparatus as described by Obsilova et al. (16Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4531-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fluorescence decays were acquired under”magic angle“conditions, where the measured intensity decay I(t) was independent of a rotational diffusion of the chromophore and provided unbiased information about lifetimes. The apparatus response function was done at the excitation wavelength measured with a diluted Ludox solution. The samples were placed in a thermostatic holder, and all experiments were performed at 22 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. 14-3-3 protein concentration was 20 μm, and ligand (pRaf-259 or Raf-259 peptide) concentration was 50 μm. Fluorescence data processing was performed as described previously using the singular value decomposition maximum entropy method (16Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J.

The average efficiency of energy transfer E was calculated from the mean donor lifetime in the presence (τDA) and absence of acceptor (τD). E=1−(τDA/τD) The average distance between the donor-acceptor pair R was calculated from Equation 3, R=R0·61/E−1 Eq.3 where R0 is the Förster critical distance (the distance at which the energy transfer occurs with 50% efficiency). R0 is given by (26Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.

The spectral overlap integral J(λ) of the donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption was calculated from Equation 5 (26Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999Crossref Google Scholar), J(λ)=∫FD(λ)εa(λ)λ4dλ/∫FD(λ)dλ{\\ }[cm3M−1] Eq.5 where FD(λ) and ϵa(λ) represent the fluorescence intensity of the donor and the molar extinction coefficient of the acceptor, respectively, at the wavelength λ expressed in centimeters. The orientation factor κ2 was assumed to be equal to ⅔, which corresponds to randomly oriented dipole moments of donor-acceptor pairs. A value of 1.31 was used for the refractive index of the aqueous solution. Quantum yields of the donor, which is the Trp242 in the single Trp mutant of the 14-3-3ζ protein, were calculated relative to the QD of L-Trp in water (28Chen R.F. Anal. Lett. 1967; 1: 35-42Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed according to the protocol published previously (16Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4531-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The GROMACS version 3.1 (www.gromacs.org) molecular dynamics software package was used with the parameter set ffG43a1p (29Hansson T. Nordlund P. Aqvist J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All MD trajectories were analyzed using GROMACS software. The cluster analysis was performed using the GROMOS software method (30Daura X. Gademann K. Jaun B. Seebach D. Van Gunsteren W.F. Mark A.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 236-240Crossref Google Scholar). A model of the 14-3-3ζ protein with attached AEDANS moieties at residues Cys25 and Cys189 was built using a representative conformation of 14-3-3ζ protein (obtained using a cluster analysis of simulated trajectory with a root mean square deviation cutoff of 1 Å) and AEDANS coordinates obtained from the crystal structure of labeled RNase (Protein Data Bank accession code 1RAS) (31Baudet-Nessler S. Jullien M. Crosio M.P. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8457-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The geometry of the resulting complex was optimized by energy minimization using the molecular modeling package Ghemical (32Hassinen T. Peräkylä M. J. Comput. Chem. 2001; 22: 1229-1242Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and Desktop Molecular Modeler version 4.2 (Polyhedron Software). Construction of 14-3-3ζ Protein Mutants for Förster Resonance Energy Transfer—To provide evidence for the physical location of the C-terminal stretch using FRET, we have constructed three 14-3-3ζ protein mutants containing a single Trp residue within the C-terminal stretch at the position 242 (residues Trp59 and Trp228 were mutated to Phe) and a single Cys residue located at three different positions: Cys25 (this mutant was named 14-3-3w242c25), Cys94 (14-3-3w242c94), and Cys189 (14-3-3w242c189). The Trp residue served as an energy transfer donor, and the Cys residues were selectively labeled with the extrinsic fluorophore 1,5-IAEDANS as energy acceptors. Labeling experiments revealed that only Cys25 and Cys189 can be completely modified by 1,5-IAEDANS. The stoichiometries of AEDANS/mol of these two 14-3-3ζ protein mutants were found to be ∼1 (0.95 and 1.06, respectively). The third cysteine, Cys94, was modified partially by 1,5-IAEDANS (labeling stoichiometry was found to be only ∼0.4) and therefore was not used for FRET measurements. Modification of 14-3-3ζ protein mutants by 1,5-IAEDANS has been verified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A fluorescence binding assay was used to test the binding abilities of both 14-3-3ζ protein mutants (Fig. 1). These experiments revealed that both 14-3-3ζ protein mutants modified with 1,5-IAEDANS bind phosphorylated pRaf-259 peptide with comparable affinity as wild-type protein, which binds pRaf-259 peptide with KD value of 116 nm (5Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). No significant binding of unphosphorylated Raf-259 peptide within the used concentration range has been detected (data not shown). Investigation of the C-terminal Stretch Location Using FRET Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—FRET measurements between Trp242 and AEDANS moiety attached to a cysteine residue of 14-3-3ζ protein mutants were used to investigate the physical location of the C-terminal stretch of the 14-3-3ζ protein. First, we tested the presence of the energy transfer between Trp242 and AEDANS moieties using the steady-state fluorescence. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of 14-3-3ζ protein mutants, unmodified and modified with 1,5-IAEDANS, are shown in Fig. 2. When excited at 295 nm, Trp242 has a fluorescence emission maximum near 350 nm. In the presence of 1,5-IAEDANS, Trp242 fluorescence intensities of both single cysteine-containing mutants were significantly reduced compared with unmodified proteins, indicating the presence of FRET. The sensitized fluorescence emission of AEDANS (induced by the nonradiative transfer of energy from Trp242) was observed as a peak at 485 nm. In the case of the 14-3-3w242c25 mutant, the donor steady-state fluorescence was quenched by ∼24% compared with the emission of unlabeled protein (Fig. 2A). Higher steady-state FRET efficiency was observed for the 14-3-3w242c189 mutant, with ∼50% reduction of the donor fluorescence (Fig. 2C), indicating that AEDANS attached to Cys189 is closer to Trp242 than in the case of Cys25. Next, we tested the effect of the peptide binding on steady-state FRET efficiency between Trp242 and AEDANS. The presence of the unphosphorylated peptide Raf-259 had no effect on steady-state FRET efficiency, irrespective of AEDANS position within the 14-3-3 protein molecule (data not shown). On the other hand, the addition of the phosphorylated peptide pRaf-259, which contains optimal 14-3-3 protein binding motif and binds to 14-3-3ζ protein with high affinity, was found to affect steady-state FRET efficiency. The effect was dependent on the position of AEDANS. In the case of the 14-3-3w242c25 mutant, the pRaf-259 binding slightly reduced FRET efficiency (compare Fig. 2, A and B), whereas for the 14-3-3w242c189 mutant, the FRET remained practically unchanged (compare Fig. 2, C and D). Investigation of the C-terminal Stretch Location Using FRET Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—To quantitatively investigate the physical location of the C-terminal stretch, we employed time-resolved intensity decays of Trp242 to measure distances between residue Trp242 and an AEDANS moiety attached at different positions within the 14-3-3ζ protein molecule. We chose the time-resolved fluorescence approach, because, unlike fluorescence intensities, lifetimes do not depend on the excitation intensity, excited sample volume, protein concentration, or photobleaching, etc. Consequently, time-resolved data are more reliable than and superior to fluorescence intensities for quantitative FRET measurements. To use FRET to measure distances between Trp242 and AEDANS, the Förster critical distance R0 of this donor-acceptor pair must be determined first. The R0 is a distance between the donor and acceptor at which the energy transfer is 50% efficient. The R0 was determined from Equations 4 and 5. The spectral overlap J(λ) between Trp242 and AEDANS (obtained by numerical integration of a product of an area-normalized emission spectrum of 14-3-3w242 protein containing a single tryptophan at position 242 and the absorption spectrum of AEDANS) was found to be 5.876 × 10-15 cm3m-1. The quantum yield of Trp242 fluorescence of 14-3-3ζ protein mutants at 22 °C was determined to be 0.074 ± 0.002 in the absence of the ligand, 0.071 ± 0.002 in the presence of 25 μm pRaf-259 peptide, and 0.073 ± 0.003 in the presence of 25 μm Raf-259 peptide, respectively. The quantum yields were determined relative to a standard solution of tryptophan in water (QD = 0.140) (28Chen R.F. Anal. Lett. 1967; 1: 35-42Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This resulted in the calculated R0 of 19.7 Å in both the absence of the ligand and the presence of unphosphorylated peptide Raf-259. In the presence of the phosphorylated peptide pRaf-259, the R0 is 19.5 Å. These R0 distances are somewhat lower compared with the value of 22 Å reported elsewhere (19Polit A. Blaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), presumably because of the lower quantum yield of Trp242 fluorescence. Time-resolved fluorescence intensity decays were analyzed using a singular value decomposition maximum entropy method as described previously (16Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J.

The intensity decays of Trp242 for all three 14-3-3ζ protein mutants can be adequately described by a lifetime distribution containing three lifetime components (data not shown). Mean excited-state lifetimes (τmean) of Trp242 in the absence and presence of acceptor and the efficiency of the energy transfer are presented in Table I. Upon labeling by 1,5-IAEDANS for both mutants, the τmean of donor was reduced as a result of the energy transfer (Fig. 3). Values of the FRET efficiency were used to calculate the average distances between the donor and the acceptors. Distances between Trp242 and AEDANS attached at Cys25 and Cys189 were calculated to be 30.4 Å and 23.8 Å, respectively. These distances strongly indicate that, in the absence of the ligand, the C-terminal stretch of 14-3-3ζ protein is physically located within the ligand binding groove (see “Molecular Modeling” for details).Table ISummary of energy transfer measurements14-3-3ζ MutantLabelLigandτmeanaMean lifetimes were calculated as(τmean=∑ifiτi), where fi is an intensity fraction of the ith lifetime component τi,bStandard deviation is 0.01 nsEcE, ene"
https://openalex.org/W2052201757,"Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C2,3O) from Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1, which is able to grow on various aromatic substrates as the sole source of carbon and energy, has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, characterized, and found to be very similar to other dioxygenases from Pseudomonas species. Interestingly, the activity of the protein shows a rather unusual pH dependence when assayed on catechol. A model of the catalytic mechanism was developed that is able to reproduce the catalytic behavior of the protein as a function of the pH. The model includes multiple equilibria and four productive intermediates with different ionization states of the enzyme-substrate complex. The fitting of the theoretical curve to the experimental data suggests that a tyrosine and two histidine residues are involved in catalysis. Mutants (H246N)-, (H246A)-, (H199N)- and (Y255F)-C2,3O were produced to investigate the role of highly conserved His-199, His-246, and Tyr-255. The strongly reduced activity of the mutants suggests a primary catalytic role for each of these residues. Moreover, mutants at positions 199 and 246 display pH profiles different from that of the wild-type protein, thus indicating that residues His-246 and His-199 play a role in determining the unusual pH dependence of the enzyme. In addition, electron-withdrawing groups on catechol, which increase the acidity of the phenolic hydroxyl group, are able to counterbalance the effect of the mutation H246N in reducing catalytic activity but cause a further reduction of the activity of (H199N)-C2,3O. This finding suggests that His-246 is involved in the initial catechol deprotonation, whereas His-199 promotes the reaction between oxygen and the aromatic ring.

Many soil bacteria can grow on aromatic molecules as the sole source of carbon and energy, revealing an interesting potential for applications in bioremediation strategies (1Timmis K.N. Pieper D.H. Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Aromatic compounds are first transformed by upper pathways into dihydroxylated intermediates. These intermediates are subsequently metabolized into Krebs cycle intermediates by a limited number of lower pathways (2Harayama S. Rekik M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which are initiated by ring cleavage reactions that are generally catalyzed by ring cleavage dioxygenases. These enzymes catalyze the addition of two atoms from molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring with a substrate specificity more restricted with respect to that of the upper pathway enzymes. As a consequence, ring cleavage enzymes guide and reduce the metabolic flow of aromatic compounds that can be degraded, thus playing a central role in their catabolism (3Reineke W. Knackmuss H.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 263-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Ring cleavage dioxygenases acting on catechol and substituted catechols are classified into two groups (4Harayama S. Rekik M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15328-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), intradiol dioxygenases and extradiol dioxygenases, with the latter producing 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehydes. The majority of known extradiol dioxygenases belong to a single family of evolutionarily related proteins widespread among prokaryotes (5Spence E.L. Kawamukai M. Sanvoisin J. Braven H. Bugg T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extradiol dioxygenase activity depends on the presence at the catalytic center of a Fe(II) ion, with the few exceptions of Mn2+-containing dioxygenases (6Boldt Y.R. Sadowsky M.J. Ellis L.B. Que Jr., L. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whiting A.K. Boldt Y.R. Hendrich M.P. Wackett L.P. Que Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The catalytic metal is bound to two histidine residues and one glutamate residue that are well conserved among the members of the family (5Spence E.L. Kawamukai M. Sanvoisin J. Braven H. Bugg T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are essential for metal binding and activity (8Sato N. Uragami Y. Nishizaki T. Takahashi Y. Sazaki G. Sugimoto K.

It should be remembered that the structures of the Burkholderia cepacia LB400 DHBD (11Vaillancourt F.H. Barbosa C.J. Spiro T.G. Bolin J.T. Blades M.W. Turner R.F. Eltis L.D. J. Am. Chem.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1945-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the iron-dependent HPCD from Brevibacterium fuscum have also been determined (12Vetting M.W. Wackett L.P. Que Jr., L. Lipscomb J.D. Ohlendorf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1945-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and found to be very similar to those shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Multiple alignments show that three other residues also present at the active site, His-246, His-199, and Tyr-255 (P. putida mt2 C2,3O numbering; Fig. 1, A and B), are well conserved (5Spence E.L.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5930-5937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it might be inferred that these residues play a role in substrate binding and/or catalysis. DHBD from Pseudomonas sp.

It should be noted that in all of the structures the oxygen atom of the substrate that is on the same side of Tyr-249 (Tyr-257 in HPCD and Tyr-255 in C2,3O) is closer to the iron ion than is the other catechol oxygen atom (Fig. 1A), suggesting that only this hydroxyl group is in the anionic form (8Sato N. Uragami Y. Nishizaki T. Takahashi Y. Sazaki G. Sugimoto K. Nonaka T. Masai E. Fukuda M. Senda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Vaillancourt F.H.

This hypothesis is confirmed by Raman and electronic absorption studies (11Vaillancourt F.H. Barbosa C.J. Spiro T.G. Bolin J.T. Blades M.W. Turner R.F. Eltis L.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies indicate that P. putida C2,3O also binds catechol as a monoanion (14Shu L. Chiou Y.M. Orville A.M. Miller M.A. Lipscomb J.D. Que Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that Tyr-249 has been proposed to be H-bonded to the anionic oxygen of the catechol ring, acting as H donor, whereas His-194 (His-199 in C2,3O from P. putida mt2) is H-bonded to the non-dissociated hydroxyl group, acting as H-bond acceptor (8Sato N. Uragami Y. Nishizaki T. Takahashi Y. Sazaki G. Sugimoto K. Nonaka T. Masai E. Fukuda M. Senda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, studies on synthetic catalysts that mimic extradiol dioxygenases (15Lin G. Reid G. Bugg T.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5030-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and studies on the manganese-dependent HPCD (16Reynolds M.F. Costas M. Ito M. Jo D.H. Tipton A.A. Whiting A.K. Que Jr., L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicate that the first deprotonation of catechols is the first crucial step of extradiol cleavage reactions. According to these observations, a mechanism was proposed (8Sato N. Uragami Y. Nishizaki T. Takahashi Y. Sazaki G. Sugimoto K. Nonaka T. Masai E. Fukuda M. Senda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Kita A. Kita S. Fujisawa I. Inaka K. Ishida T. Horiike K. Nozaki M. Miki K. Structure Fold.

Biochem. 1983; 5: 167-199PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C) in which conserved His-246 and Tyr-255, or their homologous residues, act in a concerted way to abstract the first proton from catechol, whereas His-199, at a later stage, acts as a basic catalyst by accepting the second proton from the substrate. Finally, the position of O2 attack and the mechanism of its insertion in the aromatic ring have been addressed by density functional theory studies (18Deeth R.J. Bugg T.D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and by studies with model compounds and analogues of the hypothetical reaction intermediates (19Winfield C.J. Al-Mahrizy Z.

However, despite the large number of studies, direct evidence of the roles of His-199, His-246, and Tyr-255 in catalysis is still lacking, with the exception of data available on the involvement of His-200 of the iron-dependent HPCD from B. fuscum (22Groce S.L. Lipscomb J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 11780-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the overexpression in Escherichia coli and the purification and characterization of the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomona stutzeri OX1 and four active site mutants designed for obtaining information on ionizable groups involved in catalysis. The catalytic parameters of C2,3O and the mutants were studied on catechol as a function of pH and by using three acidic catechol derivatives as substrates. The data we have collected confirm the hypothesis that His-246, His-199, and Tyr-255 perform major roles in catalysis. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and plasmid pET22b(+) were purchased from Novagen. Plasmid DNA purification was performed using the purification kit from Qiagen. Bacterial transformation was carried out according to Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pBZ3120 containing a 2-kb fragment coding for a dioxygenase activity isolated from P. stutzeri OX1 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Barbieri (Dipartimento di Biologia Strutturale e Funzionale, Università dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy). DNA Sequencing—Double strand DNA was sequenced by Dr. A. Ciccodicola (Istituto di Genetica e Biofisica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Naples Italy) and analyzed with the programs BLAST, FASTA, and ClustalW (accessible at the addresses www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/, www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33/, and www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/, respectively). Construction of the Expression Vector—Vector pET22b(+)ΔXN was obtained by digesting vector pET22b(+) with XbaI and NcoI. Sticky overhangs were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated. This deletion removes the endogenous ribosome binding site together with the sequence coding for the pelB leader. The sequence of the vector was verified by DNA sequencing. To excise the C2,3O coding sequence, plasmid pBZ3120 was digested with BamHI and EagI. The fragment was purified by electrophoresis and ligated to vector pET22b(+)ΔXN cut previously with the same enzymes. The resulting recombinant plasmid was named pET22b(+)ΔXN/C2,3O. Construction of the Expression Vectors Coding for Mutant C2,3Os— Mutant C2,3Os were produced by the Kunkel method (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 82: 488-492Crossref Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) starting from plasmid pET22b(+)ΔXN/C2,3O. The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′-GGCCACGTCGTTGGCCTTGGTCG-3′ for the mutation H199N, 5′-GAGTGAGGCCGTTGCGGGTTGGGC-3′ for the mutation H246N, 5′-GAGTGAGGCCGGCGCGGGTTGGGC-3′ for the mutation H246A, and 5′-GGGTCGAAGAAGAAGATGGTCTTGCC-3′ for the mutation Y255F. The clones harboring the desired mutations were identified by DNA sequencing and named pET22b(+)ΔXN/(H199N)-C2,3O, (H246N)-C2,3O, (H246A)-C2,3O, and (Y255F)-C2,3O. The DNA sequences of the three clones were completely verified by sequencing. Expression and Purification of C2,3Os—E. coli strain BL21(DE3), transformed with pET22b(+)ΔXN containing the sequences coding for wild-type and the mutant C2,3Os, was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) until optical density at 600 nm was 0.6–0.7. Induction was performed by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 at a final concentration of 0.5 mm and 100 μm, respectively. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), and collected by centrifugation. Cell paste was stored at –80 °C until use. An SDS-PAGE analysis of induced and non-induced cell extracts showed the presence of a protein with a molecular mass of ∼35 kDa only in induced cells (data not shown). The bacterial pellet was suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.08 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) ethanol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 100 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture at the concentration suggested by the manufacturer and sonicated in a cell disruptor (10 × 1 min cycle, on ice). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded at 4 °C onto a 15-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated previously in buffer A and washed with 30 ml of the equilibration buffer. Elution was carried out with 260 ml of buffer A with an NaCl linear gradient ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 m at a flow rate of 13 ml/h. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and an activity assay on catechol. Fractions containing dioxygenase activity were collected and stored at –80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Enzyme Assays—All assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) or 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) in a final volume of 500 μl by spectrophotometric determination of the product of the reaction. Wild-type and mutant C2,3Os were used to start the reaction. The amount of the fission products was measured spectrally using their absorption extinction coefficients. These coefficients were as follows: ϵ375 = 33,000 m–1 cm–1 for 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, the product of catechol; ϵ388 = 13,400 m–1 cm–1 for the product of 3-methylcatechol; ϵ382 = 28,100 m–1 cm–1 for the product of 4-methylcatechol; ϵ281 = 21,000 m–1 cm–1 for the product of 3-methoxycatechol; ϵ380 = 36,000 m–1 cm–1 for the product of 3,4-dihydroxyphenilacetic acid; ϵ381 = 35,000 m–1 cm–1 for the product of 4-ethylcatechol (25Kang B.S.

Kinetic parameters were determined by the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software; www.graphpad.com). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 μmol of the meta cleavage product per minute under the assay conditions. Specific activity is given as units per milligram of protein. Partition ratios were determined as the ratios between the concentration of product formed before the complete inactivation of the enzyme and the concentration of the enzyme in the assay (26Cerdan P. Wasserfallen A. Rekik M. Timmis K.N. Harayama S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6074-6081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation and Reactivation of wt-C2,3O—wt-C2,3O was inactivated by incubation in 0.04% H2O2 at 0 °C for 30 min (27Mars A.E. Kasberg T. Kaschabek S.R. van Agteren M.H. Janssen D.B. Reineke W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4530-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For reactivation studies, 11 μg of the H2O2-inactivated enzyme were incubated at 0 °C in freshly made Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, FeCl3, CoSO4, or MnCl2 solutions (1 mm final concentration) in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h. Enzyme activity was measured using the catechol assay. Determination of Mr Value—The Mr value of the native wild-type enzyme was determined by gel filtration on a Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 (3.2 × 300 mm) column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 10% ethanol (v/v), and 5% glycerol (v/v) using a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular mass markers used as standards were α-amylase (Mr, 200,000 Da), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Mr, 150,000 Da), and aspartate aminotransferase (Mr, 90,000 Da). Determination of Titration Curves and pKa Values—Titration curves were determined spectrophotometrically as described (28Xia M. Dempski R. Hille R. Kim J.H. Ryan M.G. Knaut H. Porras A.G. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3323-3330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The theoretical titration curves were fitted to experimental data by the program GraphPad Prism that was also used to calculate the pKa values. Titration was followed at 238 nm for the determination of 3-formylcatechol pKa, 347 nm for the determination of 4-formylcatechol pKa, and 430 nm for the determination of 4-nitrocatechol pKa. The buffers (50 mm each) used were sodium acetate (pH 4–5.75), MES/NaOH (pH 5.75–6.5), MOPS/NaOH (pH 6.5–7.8), sodium phosphate (pH 6.5–8.2), Tris/HCl (pH 7.1–8.8), and CHES/NaOH (pH 8.6–10). Tris/HCl buffers were not used for the determination of formylcatechol titration curves. All of the buffers were freshly prepared, and the pH of the buffer was measured at the final concentration of use. Determination of kcat Values as a Function of pH—The variations of kcat values as a function of pH were determined spectrophotometrically. When catechol was used as substrate, the reaction was followed at 375 nm (pH 5–10). When 4-formylcatechol was used, the reaction was followed at 400 nm (pH 5–10). When 3-formylcatechol was used, the reaction was followed at 300 nm (pH 5–6.8), 425 nm (pH 6.8–7.5), and 450 nm (pH 7.5–10). Δϵ values as a function of pH were calculated from the differences between the spectrophotometric titration curves of the product and the substrate. Spectrophotometric titration curves were determined as described above under “Determination of Titration Curves and pKa Values.” All kcat values were determined at saturating concentrations of the substrate. Saturation was verified at each pH value by measuring the rate of the reaction at three increasing substrate concentrations. The buffers (50 mm each) used were sodium acetate (pH 4–5.75), MES/NaOH (pH 5.75–6.5), MOPS/NaOH (pH 6.5–7.8), sodium phosphate (pH 6.5–8.2), Tris/HCl (pH 7.1–8.8), and CHES/NaOH (pH 8.6–10). Tris/HCl buffers were not used for the determination of kcat values of formylcatechols. All buffers were freshly prepared, and their pH was measured at their final concentration. Protein Sequence Determination and Mass Spectrometry Measurements—Protein sequencing, electrospray mass spectrometry measurements, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI/MS) analysis of peptide mixtures were performed as described previously (29Scognamiglio R. Notomista E. Barbieri P. Pucci P. Dal Piaz F. Tramontano A. Di Donato A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Verification of C2,3O Primary Structure—The complete primary structure of wt-C2,3O was verified by peptide mapping. Aliquots of the high pressure liquid chromatography-purified protein were digested with either trypsin or Lys-C, and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI/MS. The mass signals recorded in the spectra were mapped onto the predicted sequence of C2,3O on the basis of their mass value and the specificity of the protease. Analytic Methods—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined colorimetrically with the Bradford reagent (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total iron content was determined colorimetrically by complexation with Ferene S (32Newman L.M. Wackett L.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14066-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Chemicals—All chemicals were of the highest grade available and were from Amersham Biosciences, Promega, New England Biolabs, Sigma, ABCR GmbH, Fluka, or Applichem. wt-C2,3O, Sequence of the Gene, Recombinant Protein Purification, and Characterization—The nucleotide sequence of the 2-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment isolated from a genomic library of P. stutzeri OX1 (33, Viggiani, A., Siani, L., Notomista, E., and Di Donato, A.

This sequence was used to search protein databases (Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and TrEMBLnew) with the BLASTX program. Also, the deduced amino acid sequences were used to search for homologous sequences using the BLAST and FASTA programs. These analyses allowed the identification of two complete open reading frames, one coding for a plant-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (34Hugo N. Meyer C. Armengaud J. Gaillard J. Timmis K.N. Jouanneau Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5580-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the other coding for a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (Table I). The open reading frame for C2,3O is 921 base pairs coding for a 307-amino acid polypeptide. Multiple amino acid alignments with other extradiol dioxygenases (Table I) indicate that C2,3O from P. stutzeri belongs to the major family of extradiol ring cleavage dioxygenases that have the substrate binding domain at the C terminus (5Spence E.L. Kawamukai M. Sanvoisin J. Braven H. Bugg T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its sequence is 95% identical to that of the well characterized C2,3O from P. putida mt2; moreover, the two sequences have no insertions or deletions. Only one point mutation is located in the C-terminal domain containing the active site, with Val-225 in the P. stutzeri enzyme replacing Leu-225 in the P. putida enzyme. As this residue is 14 Å away from the catalytic iron ion in the P. putida C2,3O structure, it can likely be concluded that the active sites of the two C2,3Os are identical.Table IComparison of amino acid sequence of P. stutzeri C2,3OProteinaXylE and DMPB, catechol 2,3-dioxygenases; TODE, 3-methylcatechol dioxygenase; NAHC, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase.OrganismSubstrateIdentityAccession no.bSwiss-Prot accession numbers.%XylEP. putida mt-2Catechol95P06622DMPBPseudomonas sp.

Open table in a new tab The purification of the enzyme, carried out as described under “Materials and Methods,” yielded ∼120 mg of protein per liter of culture with a specific activity on catechol of ∼90 ± 10 units/mg, depending on the preparation. The molecular mass of denatured C2,3O was determined by electrospray mass spectroscopy and found to be 35,107.2 ± 3 Da, in agreement with the value of 35,105.5 Da expected from the deduced amino acid sequence. The primary structure deduced from the gene sequence was verified by peptide mapping as described under “Materials and Methods.” The mapping revealed that recombinant C2,3O is expressed in E. coli with the initial Met residue. The native molecular mass of wt-C2,3O was determined by gel filtration on a Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 column. The apparent molecular mass was found to be 117,000 ± 20,000 Da. This value is consistent with the hypothesis that C2,3O is a homotetramer, as expected by its homology with other catechol dioxygenases (10Kita A. Kita S. Fujisawa I. Inaka K. Ishida T. Horiike K. Nozaki M. Miki K. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to oxidation of the wild-type enzyme was verified by incubation in 0.04% H2O2 for 30 min. This treatment resulted in the loss of ∼98% of the activity. Incubation of the H2O2-inactivated enzyme in Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 solutions resulted in the recovery of ∼35% of the activity. When Mn2+,Co2+, and Fe3+ salts were used instead, no recovery of the activity was ever detected, thus indicating the specificity of the enzyme for Fe2+. The ratio of moles of iron to moles of a monomer of C2,3O was found to be 1.1 ± 0.02. Moreover, the Ferene S assay carried out with and without the addition of ascorbic acid yielded the same value, thus indicating that iron is present as Fe2+. The rate of ring fission of wt-C2,3O was determined on catechol and several substituted catechols (Table II). Catechol is the best substrate, followed by 4-methylcatechol a"

Compound I of Mb mutants (Mb-I), a ferryl species (Fe(IV)=O) paired with a porphyrin radical cation, is readily prepared by the reaction with a nearly stoichiometric amount of m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Upon the addition of H2O2 to an Mb-I solution, Mb-I is reduced back to the ferric state without forming any intermediates. This indicates that Mb-I is capable of performing two-electron oxidation of H2O2 (catalatic reaction). Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the evolved O2 from a 50:50 mixture of H218O2/H216O2 solution containing H64D or F43H/H64L Mb showed the formation of 18O2 (m/e = 36) and 16O2 (m/e = 32) but not 16O18O (m/e = 34). This implies that O2 is formed by two-electron oxidation of H2O2 without breaking the O-O bond. Deuterium isotope effects on the catalatic reactions of Mb mutants and catalase suggest that the catalatic reactions of Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalase and F43H/H64L Mb proceed via an ionic mechanism with a small isotope effect of less than 4.0, since the distal histidine residue is located at a proper position to act as a general acid-base catalyst for the ionic reaction. In contrast, other Mb mutants such as H64X (X is Ala, Ser, and Asp) and L29H/H64L Mb oxidize H2O2 via a radical mechanism in which a hydrogen atom is abstracted by Mb-I with a large isotope effect in a range of 10–29, due to a lack of the general acid-base catalyst.

Catalase is a heme enzyme that catalyzes the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide to H2O and O2. In the first step, H2O2 serves as a two-electron oxidant to generate a ferryl porphyrin cation radical (O=Fe(IV) Por+·) called compound I and H2O (Equation 1). In the second step compound I serves as a two-electron oxidant of H2O2, affording O2 (catalatic reaction) accompanied by regeneration of the ferric form of catalase (Equation 2) (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 435-453Google Scholar, 2Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although the catalase reaction has been known since 1940s and it is suggested that the distal histidine is important for the deprotonation of hydrogen peroxide (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases.

Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism for its oxidation by compound I has yet to be clarified, since difficulty in the preparation of catalase compound I by a stoichiometric amount of H2O2 or alkyl peroxides has precluded direct observation of the reaction step of compound I with H2O2 (1Dunford H.B.

Recently, we have proven that the distal histidine (His-64) in sperm whale Mb is a critical residue in destabilizing Mb compound I (Mb-I). In fact, His-64 mutants of Mb gave Mb-I as an observable species under stopped-flow conditions. More importantly, the successful observation of Mb-I has allowed us the direct observation of the oxidation step of H2O2, olefins, thioethers, N-demethylation, and an aromatic ring by Mb-I (10Matsui T.

For example, H64X (X is Ale, Ser, and Asp) mutants are almost completely oxidized to Mb-I by m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), and Mb-I is completely reduced by H2O2, although the reaction is about 1000–3000-fold slower than that reported for catalase (11Matsui T. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9952-9957Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Mb mutants (F43H/H64L and L29H/H64L Mb) have also been found to dismutate H2O2 to O2 and H2O at the rate which is 50- and 5-fold faster than wild-type Mb, respectively (10Matsui T. Ozaki S.

The crystal structures of them suggest that the reactivity is controlled by the presence or absence of distal histidine (10Matsui T. Ozaki S. Liong E. Phillips Jr., G.N. Watanabe Y. J. Biol.

We report herein the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) on catalatic reactions (Equation 2) of catalase and Mb mutants in H2O and D2O. The detailed kinetic studies provide valuable insight into the role of distal histidine for the H2O2 oxidation by compound I of catalase and Mb mutants. Materials—Standard chemicals were obtained from Wako Chemicals and Nacalai Tesque. 99.9% deuterium oxide was purchased from Aldrich and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. mCPBA was obtained from Nacalai Tesque and purified as reported previously (17Groves J.T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 7834-7836Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). H218O2 was prepared from 18O2 as described by Foote and Sawaki (18Sawaki Y. Foote C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 6292-6296Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 18O content in H218O2 was determined by GC-MS analysis of triphenylphosphine oxide formed by the oxidation of triphenylphosphine with H218O2. The concentration of peroxide in a reaction solution was determined by oxidation of potassium iodide in the presence of horseradish peroxidase as a catalyst to produce I3− (ϵ353 = 2.62 × 104m-1 cm-1) (19Cotton M.L.

Beef liver catalase (BLC) and Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalase (MLC) were obtained from Sigma and Nagase ChemteX, respectively. Catalase was purified by Superdex 75 size exclusion chromatography. The concentrations of BLC and MLC were determined by using a molar extinction coefficient of ϵ405 = 3.24 × 105m-1 cm-1 (21Lardinois O.M. Mestdagh M.M. Rouxhet P.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Expression and purification of the mutants were performed according to a method described by Springer et al. (24Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3057-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of D2O Buffer—In a typical run 50 mm sodium acetate buffer was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of acetate acid in D2O and titrated with a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution of D2O. The pD of the buffer solution was determined by using an equation of pD = pHobs + 0.3314n + 0.076n2, where n represents the fraction of deuterium in the solution (25Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and pHobs is the apparent pH reading on an HM-30V pH meter (TOA electronics Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). D2O samples were prepared as follows. To an H2O solution (0.5 ml) containing a protein (1 mm)D2O buffer (4.5 ml) was added, and the resulting mixture was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The same procedure was repeated 5 times. After the completion of H-D exchange, the solution was incubated overnight in D2O buffer at 4 °C. Spectroscopy—Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-2400 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). Spectral changes were monitored either on an SF-43 stopped-flow apparatus (HI-TECH Scientific Co., Wiltshire, UK) equipped with an MG 6000 diode array spectrophotometer or on an RSP-601 stopped-flow rapid-scan spectrometer (Unisoku Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Reaction of MLC and H2O2—For the determination of kinetic parameters k1 and k2, the MLC compound I (MLC-I) formation and the dismutation of H2O2 were monitored by following changes in absorbance at 406 and 240 nm, respectively, by stopped-flow technique in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 5 °C. To determine the apparent rate constant of MLC-I formation (kapp-MLC-I), the MLC (1.0–1.2 μm) was mixed with a small excess amount (2.0–8.9 mol eq to MLC) of H2O2. The rate constant of the H2O2 dismutation by MLC (kapp-H2O2) was determined under steady-state conditions ([MLC] = 50 nm, [H2O2] = 1.8–16 mm). Reactions of Mb Mutants and mCPBA—To obtain the authentic absorption spectra of Mb compound I (Mb-I), Mb mutants (5.5–9.7 μm) were oxidized by more than 10 eq of mCPBA. At the same time, the Mb-I formation rates by mCPBA were determined in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 5 °C by following the decay of absorbance at 408 nm. Bimolecular rate constants are determined by plotting observed pseudo-first-order rates versus oxidant concentration. Reaction of Mb-I and H2O2—The reaction of Mb-I with H2O2 was directly monitored by use of a double-mixing stopped-flow technique. To avoid catalytic catalase reactions (Equations 1 and 2), the first mixing of a Mb mutant (5.5–7.8 μm) to prepare Mb-I was carried out with 1.5 mol eq of mCPBA. Subsequently, at least a 100-fold excess of H2O2 was introduced to start the catalatic reaction (Equation 2) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 5 °C. The catalatic reaction was monitored by following an increase in absorbance at 408 nm. Delay time for the second mixing was in a range of 0.1–1.1 s. The reproduction of Mb-I by remaining H2O2 is too slow to observe under the present experimental conditions. To examine the temperature dependence of the H64A Mb-I reaction with H2O2, the catalatic reaction was repeated at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C. Activation parameters (A and Ea) were determined by an Arrhenius plot: ln k2 = ln A - Ea/RT. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Identification of Evolved Oxygen—An Mb mutant (200 μm in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0)) or BLC (25 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)) was mixed with H216O2/H218O2 (1:1) (200 mm) at room temperature under N2 for 5 min. Three different evolved molecular oxygens, 16O2 (m/e = 32), 16O18O (m/e = 34), and 18O2 (m/e = 36), were separated and quantified by a Shimadzu GC-17A/GC-MS-QP5000 (Shimadzu Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Varian Molsieve 5A PLOT capillary column. Catalase Reaction of MLC in H2O and D2O—UV-visible spectral changes of MLC by the addition of peroxides in H2O and D2O are shown in Fig. 1. The spectral changes with hydrogen peroxide are different from those with methyl hydroperoxide. The steady-state spectra in the presence of hydrogen peroxide show that 45 and 85% of MLCs exist as MLC-I in H2O and D2O buffers, respectively (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the spectra of MLC with methyl hydroperoxide indicate that MLC has been completely converted to MLC-I in both buffers (Fig. 1B). Fig. 2 shows the time course of absorbance change in the reactions of MLC and 2–8.9 mol eq of hydrogen peroxide. The steady-state concentration of MLC-I in each run is almost the same even though the amount of hydrogen peroxide was varied. Thus, we could determine the rate constants, k1 and k2, without considering the equilibrium steps (Equations 3 and 5) under these experimental conditions (see Supplemental Material, Appendices 1 and 2). To obtain the apparent rate constants of MLC-I formation (kapp-MLC-I), the MLC (1.0–1.2 μm) was mixed with a small excess amount (2.0–8.9 mol eq to MLC) of H2O2. The rate constants of the H2O2 dismutation by MLC (kapp-H2O2) were determined under steady-state conditions ([MLC] = 50 nm, [H2O2] = 1.8–16 mm). The apparent second-order rate constants (kapp-MLC-I) for MLC-I formation by H2O2 were determined from the Soret absorbance change at 406 nm as (2.11 ± 0.06) × 107 and (1.19 ± 0.02) × 107m-1 s-1 in H2O and D2O, respectively. In addition, the apparent rate constants (kapp-H2O2) of H2O2 dismutation by MLC-I were determined by the decrease of H2O2 absorption at 240 nm (Fig. 3) as (9.33 ± 0.10) × 106 and (2.86 ± 0.04) × 106m-1 s-1 in H2O and D2O, respectively. The apparent rate constants kapp-MLC-I and kapp-H2O are expressed as a function of k1 (Equation 1) and k2 (Equation 2): kapp-MLC-I = k1 + k2 (see Supplemental Material, Appendix 1, Equation 15) and kapp-H2O2 = 2k1k2/(k1 + k2) (Equation 20 in Appendix 2). Thus, the k1 and k2 values are determined from the kapp-MLC-I and kapp-H2O2 values, and they are listed in Tables I and II, respectively. On the other hand, the observed concentrations of MLCs in equilibrium are given by [MLC]eq = (k2/k1 + k2)[MLC]0 (Equation 8 in Appendix 1). Using this equation, the concentrations of MLC-I in H2O and D2O are calculated from the k1 and k2 values as 43.1 ± 6.8 and 74.1 ± 7.7%, respectively. These values agree with the concentrations of MLC-I estimated from the steady-state spectra in Fig. 1. Such agreement confirms the validity of our kinetic analysis. We have also determined the KIEs on k1 and k2 of MLC to be 1.0 and 4.0, respectively.MLC+H2O2⇄MLC-H2O2(Eq. 3) MLC-H2O2→MLC-I+H2O(Eq. 4) MLC-I+H2O2⇄MLC-I-H2O2(Eq. 5) MLC-I-H2O2→MLC+H2O+O2(Eq. 6) Fig. 2Absorption changes in MLC reaction with deuterium peroxide (2–8.9 μm).

Biochem. 1981; 59: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The H64A mutant affords Mb-I by the addition of mCPBA as shown in Fig. 4A. At 320 ms after the mixing, Soret absorption of H64A decreased to less than half, and a broad band having a peak at 648 nm appeared. The rate constants of the Mb-I formation with mCPBA in H2O and D2O indicate small kH/kD values of 0.8–1.6. On the other hand, H64D Mb-I formation with H2O2 shows a larger k1H/k1D value (Table I). We attempted to observe the other Mb-I formation by H2O2, but the other Mb-Is could not be formed with H2O2 under the same conditions. Catalatic Reaction of Mb Mutants in H2O and D2O—To observe the stoichiometric reaction of Mb-I with H2O2 spectroscopically, we have performed double-mixing stopped-flow experiments at 5.0 °C and pH 5.0. A small excess amount (1.5 mol eq to Mb) of mCPBA was used for the completion of Mb-I formation (23Matsui T. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32735-32738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, H64A Mb gave Mb-I up to 95% yield under these conditions (Fig. 4A). A decrease in the absorbance of the Soret band and an increase in the absorbance at 648 nm are the clear indications of Mb-I formation. Other Mb mutants are also oxidized to Mb-I under the same experimental conditions. Upon the addition of H2O2 to a H64A Mb-I solution (second mixing), Mb-I is reduced to the ferric form without forming any intermediates (Fig. 4B). Similar spectral changes are also observed for the other mutants, revealing that the Mb-I is capable of performing two-electron oxidation of H2O2. The reproduction of compound I by the remaining H2O2 in the solution is too slow to observe under the present experimental conditions. The rate constants of the catalatic reaction in H2O and D2O (k2H and k2D) were determined as described above, and the k2H and k2D values are listed in Table II. Replacement of the H2O solvent by D2O caused 10–29-fold decrease in the rates of the catalatic reactions of H64X and L29H/H64L Mbs. Such large primary kinetic isotope effects suggest the occurrence of tunneling. Accurate measurements of the primary kinetic isotope effects as a function of temperature are very important for the examination of the tunneling effect (27Kwart H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1982; 15: 401-408Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The incidence of tunneling results in the curvature of the Arrhenius plot (ln k = ln A - Ea/RT) in a wide range of temperature, which is larger for hydrogen as compared with deuterium. In the temperature range of measurements (5–25 °C), a larger AD value than AH, derived from an apparent linear Arrhenius plot, can be used as criteria to recognize the tunneling (AH/AD < 0.6) (Table III) (27Kwart H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1982; 15: 401-408Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The AH/AD values (0.07) derived from the Arrhenius plots for H64A Mb, thus, indicate that large KIEs are ascribed to the linear tunneling effect (Fig. 5) (27Kwart H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1982; 15: 401-408Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast to H64A Mb, F43H/H64L Mb and MLC exhibited small KIEs of 2.1 and 4.0, respectively (we could not determine their thermodynamic parameters due to less stability and rapid reaction above 5 °C, respectively).Table IIITemperature dependence of the reaction of H64A Mb-I with H2O2ParameterH64AkH (m-1 s-1a50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5 °C5260kD (m-1 s-1)a50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5 °C232KIEa50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5 °C23ΔEa(H) (kcal·mol-1)b50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C0.47ΔEa(D) (kcal·mol-1)b50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C1.3AH/ADb50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C0.07ΔH1(O-H) (kcal l·mol-1)b50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C0.33ΔH1(O-D) (kcal·mol-1)b50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C1.2a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5 °Cb 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pL 5.0) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C Open table in a new tab Identification of Evolved Oxygen—Preparation of 18O-labeled H2O2 has allowed us to examine the source of the evolved O2. A GC-MS spectrum of the evolved O2 from a solution containing a 50:50 mixture of H218O2/H216O2 and a Mb mutant (H64D or F43H/H64L) shows two peaks for 18O2 (m/e = 36) and 16O2 (m/e = 32) with no indication of 16O18O (m/e = 34) formation within an experimental error of ∼3%. This demonstrates that the catalase reactions by the Mb mutants proceed as the deprotonation process of catalase and chloroperoxidase (28Hager L.P. Doubek D.L. Silverstein R.M. Hargis J.H.

In early studies the rate constants of compound I formation for human erythrocyte, horse liver, and MLC were reported to be in a range of 1.2–6 × 107m-1 s-1 (30Bonnichsen R.K. Chance B. Theorell H.

On the other hand, the k1 and k2 values of BLC in the presence of 0.25–1.00 m ethanol are 5.6 × 106 and 1.2 × 107m-1 s-1, respectively (4Kremer M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The k1 of BLC, which is smaller than those of the other catalases, indicates possible inhibition by acetaldehyde or denaturation of BLC under these conditions. Thus, we have employed MLC to determine k1 and k2 in the absence of ethanol to elucidate a detailed mechanism of the catalatic reaction. In the case of MLC, high catalatic activity has precluded the complete accumulation of MLC-I by H2O2, and the preparation of MLC-I required a large excess of the oxidant even by using methyl hydroperoxide. The rate constant (k2) of the catalatic reaction of MLC could not be determined directly due to a rapid reformation of MLC-I by H2O2 remaining in the reaction solution. Thus, we have determined k1 and k2 by the measurement of the apparent MLC-I formation and its reduction rates by hydrogen peroxide as 9.1 × 106 and 1.2 × 107m-1 s-1, respectively (see Tables I and II). In the case of MLC, a small KIE (1.0) for the formation of MLC-I has been observed. This value is very similar to that reported for horseradish peroxidase I formation (1.6) by Dunford et al. (34Dunford H.B. Hewson W.D. Steiner H. Can. J. Chem. 1978; 56: 2844-2852Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, distal histidine in MLC could serve as a general acid-base catalyst for the formation of MLC-I as proposed for peroxidases. On the other hand, the reaction of H64D Mb and H2O2 shows a large KIE (kH/kD = 15). Because the compound I formation mechanism includes deprotonation from H2O2 to afford a Fe-OOH intermediate, we have assigned that the deprotonation of hydrogen peroxide is a great barrier for the formation of H64D Mb-I due to a lack of the distal histidine. These results suggest that the distal histidine might reduce the pKa value of H2O2 (11.6) by ∼4 pKa units in the active site of MLC. Although the reaction of MLC-I with hydrogen peroxide gave a mixture of MLC and MLC-I in the steady state because the resulting MLC is immediately converted to MLC-I by excess H2O2 remaining in the solution, we have successfully determined the deuterium isotope effect on the catalatic reaction of MLC to be 4.0 on the basis of apparent MLC-I formation and MLC-I reduction rates (Table II). F43H/H64L Mb also gave a small KIE (2.1), determined by the direct observation of the reaction of Mb-I and H2O2. These results indicate that hydrogen peroxide is easily deprotonated by the distal histidine and then reacts with compound I of MLC and F43H/H64L Mb. On the other hand, in the reactions of H2O2 and Mb-I of L29H/H64L and H64X (X = Asp, Ala, and Ser), the KIEs are extremely larger (10Matsui T. Ozaki S. Liong E. Phillips Jr., G.N. Watanabe Y. J.

In previous studies we have proven that the distal histidine (His-43) in F43H/H64L Mb serves as a general acid-base catalyst to form compound I in the reaction with H2O2. On the other hand, distal aspartic acid (Asp-64) in H64D and the distal histidine (His-29) in L29H/H64L Mb hardly participate as the catalyst (10Matsui T. Ozaki S. Liong E. Phillips Jr., G.N.

The crystal structure of F43H/H64L Mb shows the distance between the Nϵ of His-43 and the ferric heme iron to be 5.7 Å, similar to structurally known peroxidases and MLCs (Fig. 6, A, C, and D) (2Fita I.

Thus, the catalatic reaction of MLC and F43H/H64L Mb, in which the general acid-base catalyst is located at a proper position, could proceed via the ionic mechanism with a small KIE (<4) (Scheme 1A), whereas the other Mb mutants oxidize H2O2 via a mechanism that could be different from the ionic mechanism with exhibiting a large KIE (10Matsui T.

There are two possible mechanisms on the formation of O2 in the reaction of H2O2 and compound I without showing 18O/16O scrambling as depicted in Scheme 1. Mechanism A shows an ionic reaction via initial proton abstraction with the help of the distal histidine acting as a general acid-base catalyst for MLC and F43H/H64L Mbs (Scheme 1A). A similar deprotonation process is involved in the formation of compound I (Scheme 1C) (36Ozaki S. Roach M.P. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 818-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In mechanism B the reaction starts by a hydrogen atom transfer from H2O2 to the ferryl species to yield a radical intermediate. The hydrogen abstraction by the ferryl intermediate has been proposed for the alkane hydroxylation by cytochrome P450, its model complexes, and even in non-heme enzymes (37Neshein J.C. Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10240-10247Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 38Sorokin A. Robert A. Meunier B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7293-7299Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In these reactions large KIEs in a range of 9–29 are commonly observed due to a tunneling effect (27Kwart H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1982; 15: 401-408Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We have also observed the tunneling effect (AH/AD = 0.07) for the catalatic reaction of H64A Mb-I with KIE of 23 at 5 °C, suggesting the involvement of hydrogen abstraction through a tunneling process. Although the histidine residue at the position 43 helps the ionic oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, the k2 value of F43H/H64L Mb is virtually the same as that for H64D Mb and smaller than that of L29H/H64L (Table II). The crystal structure of H64D Mb suggests that an Asp residue at position 64 could help to incorporate hydrogen peroxide in the active site due to the enlargement of the active site as well as hydrogen bonding (39Yang H. Matsui T. Ozaki S. Kato S. Ueno T. Phillips Jr., G.N. Fukuzumi S. Watanabe Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10174-10181Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although His at position 29 of L29H/H64L Mb is located too far from the heme iron to play as the acid-base catalyst, L29H/H64L Mb provides a larger space for the accommodation of hydrogen peroxide than the F43H/H64L mutant, and His-29 might help to stabilize the Mb-I form by a polar effect (10Matsui T.

Our results suggest that important factors for the catalatic reaction are not only deprotonation but also enough space and polarity for the accommodation of hydrogen peroxide at a suitable position in the active site. In fact, distal cavity mutation of a Trp residue in catalase-peroxidase completely depressed its catalase activity but retained peroxidase activity. It has been concluded that the indole ring is involved in the binding of a H2O2 molecule (40Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C.

In summary, we have provided solid evidence of the importance of a general acid base catalyst for the ionic catalatic reaction of MLC-I and Mb-I. The KIEs on the reaction of Mb-I mutants with H2O2 indicate that there are two different mechanisms for the catalatic reaction, i.e. ionic and radical mechanisms, depending on the presence and absence of the distal histidine acting as a general acid-base catalyst. In addition, Mb mutants indicate that the reaction of compound I with hydrogen peroxide can be accelerated not only by the acid-base catalyst but also by space and polarity of the amino acid residues in the active site.

https://openalex.org/W1965469825,"Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), present in cruciferous vegetables, is an efficient substrate of human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (hGST P1-1). BITC also acts as an affinity label of hGST P1-1 in the absence of glutathione, yielding an enzyme inactive toward BITC as substrate. As monitored by using BITC as substrate, the dependence of k of inactivation (KI) of hGST P1-1 on [BITC] is hyperbolic, with KI = 66 ± 7 μm. The enzyme incorporates 2 mol of BITC/mol of enzyme subunit upon complete inactivation. S-Methylglutathione and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) each yield partial protection against inactivation and decrease reagent incorporation, whereas S-(N-benzylthiocarbamoyl)glutathione or S-methylglutathione + ANS protects completely. Mapping of proteolytic digests of modified enzyme by using mass spectrometry reveals that Tyr103 and Cys47 are modified equally. S-Methylglutathione reduces modification of Cys47, indicating this residue is at/near the glutathione binding region, whereas ANS decreases modification of Tyr103, suggesting this residue is at/near the BITC substrate site, which is also near the binding site of ANS. The Y103F and Y103S mutant enzymes were generated, expressed, and purified. Both mutants handle substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene normally; however, Y103S exhibits a 30-fold increase in Km for BITC and binds ANS poorly, whereas Y103F has a normal Km for BITC and Kd for ANS. These results indicate that an aromatic residue at position 103 is essential for the binding of BITC and ANS. This study provides evidence for the existence of a novel xenobiotic substrate site in hGST P1-1, which can be occupied by benzyl isothiocyanate and is distinct from that of monobromobimane and 1-chloro-2,4 dinitrobenzene."
https://openalex.org/W2039725419,"Heat shock in Drosophila results in repression of most normal (non-heat shock) mRNA translation and the preferential translation of the heat shock mRNAs. The sequence elements that confer preferential translation have been localized to the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) for Hsp22 and Hsp70 mRNAs (in Drosophila). Hsp90 mRNA is unique among the heat shock mRNAs in having extensive secondary structure in its 5′-UTR and being abundantly represented in the non-heat shocked cell. In this study, we show that Hsp90 mRNA translation is inefficient at normal growth temperature, and substantially activated by heat shock. Its preferential translation is not based on an IRES-mediated translation pathway, because overexpression of eIF4E-BP inhibits its translation (and the translation of Hsp70 mRNA). The ability of Hsp90 mRNA to be preferentially translated is conferred by its 5′-UTR, but, in contrast to Hsp22 and -70, is primarily influenced by nucleotides close to the AUG initiation codon. We present a model to account for Hsp90 mRNA translation, incorporating results indicating that heat shock inhibits eIF4F activity, and that Hsp90 mRNA translation is sensitive to eIF4F inactivation.

Stressful circumstances cause cellular and physiological damage, which when severe can lead to apoptosis and death (1Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1743-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). All cells and organisms have developed responses that enhance their survival following stress. At the cellular level most metabolic processes are repressed by heat stress (3Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), likely to prevent the accumulation of damaged molecules that could irrevocably compromise cellular function. Concurrently, large amounts of a small group of proteins are newly synthesized. These proteins are termed the heat stress, or simply stress, proteins (Hsps), 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat stress or heat shock protein; 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; eIF4F, heterotrimeric complex of eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF4G; eIF4E, eukaryotic cap binding initiation factor; eIF4E-BP, inhibitor of eIF4E (eIF4E-binding protein); Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; IEF, isoelectric focusing. and function to prevent ongoing protein damage, to restore the activity of stress-damaged proteins, and to create a stress-resistant state to ameliorate future stress-based protein injury. Because stress inhibits gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps, the induction of stress protein biosynthesis requires unique mechanisms to evade the general metabolic inhibition. A well characterized transcriptional response activates a latent transcription factor, heat shock transcription factor, which binds to conserved heat shock element sequences in the promoter of the Hsp genes and results in rapid, highly efficient transcription (4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Unique mechanisms also allow Hsp mRNAs to exit the nucleus, whereas the normal processing and transport of mRNAs is blocked (5Yost H.J. Petersen R.B. Lindquist S. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 223-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, the Hsp mRNAs are efficiently translated. For example, polysome analysis of Hsp70 mRNA translation suggests that ribosome loading is near maximal (6Lindquist S. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 137: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Concurrently, the non-heat shock, or normal, mRNAs are virtually excluded from translation, although they are neither degraded nor physically inactivated by any nucleotide modification (7Lindquist S. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, New York1987: 187-207Crossref Google Scholar). The basis for this translational discrimination has been extensively investigated, principally in Drosophila, because the extent of mRNA discrimination and preferential translation is accentuated in this poikilothermic organism. Most of the studies have focused on Hsp70 mRNA, in part because Hsp70 is the most abundantly synthesized Hsp, by about an order of magnitude. However, it has been noted that virtually all the Drosophila Hsp mRNAs share several common features (8Holmgren R. Corces V. Morimoto R. Blackman R. Meselson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3775-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Garbe J.C. Bendena W.G. Pardue M.L. Genetics. 1989; 122: 403-415PubMed Google Scholar), which have been logical candidates as the regulatory feature(s) conferring their concurrent preferential translation (reviewed in Ref. 7Lindquist S. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, New York1987: 187-207Crossref Google Scholar). First, the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of Hsp mRNAs is sufficient to confer efficient translation to a heterologous appended coding region (10Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 11Bonner J.J. Parks C. Parker-Thornburg J. Mortin M.A. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 979-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); and conversely, the Hsp coding sequence and 3′-UTR are unable to be translated during heat shock when a non-heat shock 5′-UTR, or a mutationally disabled Hsp 5′-UTR, precedes it (12McGarry T.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1985; 42: 903-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Hess M.A. Duncan R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, the common features found in virtually all Drosophila Hsp mRNA 5′-UTRs include: (i) long length (200–250 nucleotides); (ii) two conserved sequence segments, and positionally conserved nucleotides within the initial element; (iii) a high frequency of adenosine nucleotides (∼50%); and (iv) a minimal extent of secondary structure (7Lindquist S. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, New York1987: 187-207Crossref Google Scholar). Investigations have been carried out to determine whether any or all of these features are necessary or sufficient for preferential translation. Long length per se is not required, because ∼170 nucleotides can be deleted with only a modest (30–50%) reduction in preferential translation (12McGarry T.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1985; 42: 903-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The remaining translational activity is still >10-fold higher than non-heat shock mRNA translation. Both conserved elements can be deleted, with no significant decrement in heat shock translation (12McGarry T.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1985; 42: 903-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Neither high adenosine content nor a paucity of secondary structure is sufficient to confer preferential translation, because scrambling the order of a tract of nucleotides abolishes translation while retaining adenosine content and minimal structure (14Lindquist S. Petersen R. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 147-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the lack of structure is required. The introduction of a modestly stable stem into the 5′-UTR of the Hsp70 mRNA causes no reduction in translation under normal, non-heat shock conditions, but virtually abolishes preferential translation during heat shock (13Hess M.A. Duncan R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study we have initiated an investigation into the mechanism of Hsp90 mRNA translation during heat shock. The results indicate that this mRNA possesses several unique features that suggest that its translation, and especially its preferential translation during heat shock, occurs by a mechanism that distinguishes it from the other major Drosophila Hsp mRNAs. To date, the prevailing perspective has been that all Hsp mRNAs achieve preferential translation by a common mechanism, but this conclusion has been based on studies on a group of Hsp mRNAs (e.g. Hsp70 mRNA, Hsp22 mRNA) with properties distinct from Hsp90 mRNA. Hsp90 is an abundant protein in Drosophila cells grown at their normal temperature. It plays multiple roles in protein folding, maturation, and the regulation of protein activities (15Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 157-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Its mRNA is the only Hsp mRNA present in significant quantities in the non-stressed Drosophila cell (16Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). Lines of evidence that suggest that its translation is uniquely regulated include: first, whereas virtually all major Hsp mRNAs lack significant 5′-UTR secondary structure, the 5′-UTR of Hsp90 mRNA contains significant structure, consistent with the extent observed in a typical non-heat shock mRNA (for illustration of these features, see Fig. 9A). Second, Hsp90 mRNA translation appears to be inhibited by eIF4F inhibition, whereas translation of the other Hsp mRNAs is not affected to any significant extent (17Zapata J.M. Maroto F.G. Sierra J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16007-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zapata J.M. Martinez M.A. Sierra J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18047-18052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of secondary structure and eIF4F dependence are likely related. It has been hypothesized that preferential translation, embracing both the inhibition of non-heat shock mRNAs and the high activity of Hsp mRNAs, lies in an ability of Hsp mRNAs to bypass an eIF4F activity lesion. However, this proposal presents a dilemma with respect to Hsp90 mRNA, because this mRNA possesses significant secondary structure, is translationally inhibited by eIF4F inhibition, yet is efficiently translated during heat shock. In this study we have investigated the basis for the preferential translation of Hsp90 mRNA, and uncovered several unexpected features that suggest that multiple mechanisms exist that lead to preferential Hsp mRNA translation in a single organism. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The Topo 2.1 vector used for ligation of PCR products was purchased from Invitrogen. Schneider S2 cells were cultured at 22–23 °C in Schneider's Drosophila Medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). 24 h prior to transfection the cells were seeded at a density of 1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml in a T25 flask (Corning). Transfections were carried out as described (13Hess M.A. Duncan R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the eIF4E-BP transfection, a total of 25 μg of plasmid was transfected in each case, made up of equal microgram amounts of eIF4E-BP and Gal4 plasmids (19Miron M. Verdu J. Lachance P.E. Birnbaum M.J. Lasko P.F. Sonenberg N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and 5 μg each of Hsp70ΔCd and Hsp90ΔCd; to retain the total amount of plasmids equally transfected in all cases, a copia (promoter)/β-galactosidase plasmid was added to some transfections. Drosophila S2 cells were scraped from T25 flasks, pelleted by brief centrifugation (3 min, 3000 rpm) in a clinical centrifuge (IEC), and resuspended in Grace's media lacking methionine (Invitrogen). The cells were then transferred to 20-ml glass scintillation vials, with a stir flea, and allowed to recover ≥15 min with stirring prior to analyses (at heat shock or normal growth temperature (22–24 °C)). For heat shock, a portion of the cells was incubated in a 36 °C water bath with stirring for 15 min, at which time ∼5 × 106 cells (1 ml of suspension) were labeled with 15–20 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN Biochemicals) for 15 min (i.e. total 30 min heat shock). For non-heat shock analysis, another equal portion of the same cell sample, maintained at normal growth temperature, was labeled concurrently as described above (for heat shock). At the end of labeling, cells were rapidly pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in and washed twice at 4 °C (50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm dextrose, 8.4 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide) by centrifugation. The cell pellet was lysed with (for two-dimensional gel analyses) 100–150 μl of Ampholyse buffer (∼9.8 m urea, 5% 3.5–10 Biolytes (Bio-Rad), 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% β-mercaptoethanol), microcentrifuged for 3 min at top speed (Eppendorf), and the supernatant was recovered to give a final protein concentration of ∼2 mg/ml. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and radioactivity/μg of protein was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. For samples to be analyzed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, washed protein pellets were lysed in hSDS (0.3% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, at ∼98 °C). The pellet was disrupted by pipetting. 1/20 volume of RNase/DNase solution (5 mg/ml DNase, 2.5 mg/ml RNase A, 500 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm MgCl2) was added for ∼1 min, viscosity was reduced by pipetting, then ¼ volume of 4× Laemmli formula SDS-PAGE buffer was added, and the samples were analyzed on one-dimensional slab gels as described below for the second dimension of the two-dimensional procedure. Two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE was performed basically as described by O'Farrell (20O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications as described by Duncan and Hershey (21Duncan R. Hershey J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 23, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) to promote spot focusing. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 4–15 days. Protein bands/spots were quantitated by densitometry (Bio-Rad VersaDoc 1000 imaging system/Quantity 1 or PDQuest (Bio-Rad) software, or by LabWorks (UVP)). Heat shock translation was calculated as the spot IOD at heat shock (numerator) divided by the spot IOD prior to heat shock (denominator). Transgene mRNA translational efficiency was also calculated as the protein synthesis rate (spot IOD) per unit transgene mRNA (determined by Northern blot analysis, autoradiography, and densitometry). Equal RNA loading was verified by methylene blue staining or endogenous Hsp70 hybridization, as described below. RNA analyses verified that the mRNA levels of the CuSO4-induced transgenes neither increase nor decrease during the 30-min heat shock interval. Similarly, protein synthesis-based analyses of the transgenes are unaffected by the inclusion of actinomycin D during the heat shock interval. Thus, comparative analysis of protein synthesis rates (spot darkness) before and after heat shock accurately quantifies heat shock preferential translation. RNA was extracted from ∼5 × 106 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The ethanol-precipitated RNA pellet was resuspended in a final volume of 25 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water at ∼2–3 μg/μl, as determined in a Beckman UV spectrophotometer. Samples were analyzed by Northern blotting as described (13Hess M.A. Duncan R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and bands on the film were quantified by densitometry using the Bio-Rad VersaDoc 1000 Imaging System/Quantity 1 software. General PCR Procedures—1 ng of template DNA was amplified for 22–25 cycles, gel purified using the GeneClean II Kit (Bio 101 Inc.

Lipschitz) was used as the PCR amplification target. The upstream 5′ primer (DU71) contains Hsp90 5′-UTR nucleotides +3 to +23 preceded by nucleotides that introduce an EcoRI restriction site at the start of transcription to facilitate subsequent plasmid construction. The 5′ end sequence of the transgene-expressed mRNA is GAAUUCUUGA..., whereas the 5′ end sequence of authentic Hsp90 is AGUCUUGA...; the artificial 5′-UTR contains two extra 5′-terminal nucleotides, and the 4th nucleotide in the artificial 5′-UTR is U, whereas the corresponding nucleotide (position +2) in the authentic 5′-UTR is G. All other nucleotides are identical. The expressed mRNA containing the introduced EcoRI site is efficiently translated during heat shock (see Figs. 7 and 8), hence the EcoRI site does not impair heat shock translation. Similar observations were made for Hsp70 mRNA (13Hess M.A. Duncan R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The downstream 3′ primer (DU72) hybridized to 5′-UTR nucleotides +129 to +149 (where +150 is the “A” in the AUG codon). The primer altered nucleotides to create an NcoI site at the initiator AUG (new sequence is CCAUGG, which maintains the initiator AUG in an efficiently recognized context). The amplified sequence was ligated into the Topo 2.1 vector, blue colonies were identified, and accurate integrants were verified by sequencing (all other plasmids were prepared in like fashion). This plasmid was digested using EcoRI/NcoI, and inserted into an EcoRI/NcoI-digested pmthsp44-NcoI vector (13Hess M.A. Duncan R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that has been modified with the introduction of an NcoI site at the start of translation. The resulting MT90-FL vector contains the Drosophila metallothionein promoter precisely fused to the Drosophila full-length Hsp90 5′-UTR linked to an internally deleted Hsp70 coding region and Hsp70 3′-UTR. The expression construct leads to the synthesis of a unique ∼44-kDa protein (12McGarry T.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1985; 42: 903-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Hess M.A. Duncan R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequences of all plasmids used in this study were verified by DNA sequencing.Fig. 8Deletions within the Hsp90 5′-UTR and their effects on preferential translation.Drosophila S2 cells were transfected with a metallothionein promoter-driven expression plasmid into which various portions of the Hsp90 5′-UTR were inserted. The reporter mRNA is an internally deleted Hsp70 coding sequence (Hsp70ΔC) and the Hsp70 3′-UTR. Transfected cells (72 h post-transfection) were incubated with 500 μm CuSO4 for 3 h at normal growth temperature (22–24 °C) to induce mRNA expression. Cells were incubated in a water bath equilibrated to 36 °C for 15 min, or left at 22–24 °C, then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min. Protein samples were prepared as described (see “Materials and Methods”). Equal amounts of protein (equal cell numbers) were loaded into each first dimension gel (based on Bradford assays, and confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gels after electrophoresis). Dried gels were exposed to film and labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Eight plasmid-expressed mRNAs are depicted to the left. The 5′-UTR nucleotides in these eight were: 1–149 (full-length; see “Materials and Methods” for precise description of the 5′-UTR structures for each construct); the cap-proximal deletions that retained 43–149, 77–149, 111–149; the AUG-proximal deletions that retained 1–105, 1–71, 1–36; and a 5′-UTR containing 1–37/112–149 (internal deletion). Segments deleted are indicated by thin dashed line. Heat shock mRNA translation was measured as: cpmspot heat shock/cpmspot normal temperature. Northern analysis indicates that the mRNA content does not change over the ∼30-min analysis interval, so translation rate equals translational efficiency. This analysis has been repeated >5 times for each plasmid-expressed mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MT90-Δ40CAP—Using MT90-FL plasmid as the amplification target, a 5′ upstream primer (DU86) was designed that hybridized to nucleotides +43 to +62 of the Hsp90 5′-UTR (numbering for this and subsequent constructions is based on the authentic Hsp90 5′-UTR; +1 represents the first transcribed nucleotide, an A); preceding (5′) the hybridizing nucleotides it contained in an EcoRI site. The downstream primer (DU69) hybridized at the unique SnaBI site in the coding region of the target. The PCR amplification product deletes the first 42 nucleotides of the authentic Hsp90 5′-UTR, but does reintroduce the EcoRI site nucleotides as +1 to +6 of the expressed 5′-UTR mRNA. The PCR product (∼1160 nucleotides) was digested with EcoRI/SnaBI, and inserted into EcoRI/SnaBI-digested MT90-FL to yield MT90-Δ40CAP. MT90-Δ75CAP and MT90-Δ110CAP—The procedure was identical to that described above, except the upstream primers (DU87 and DU88, respectively) were designed to hybridize to nucleotides +77 to +96 and nucleotides +111 to +130, respectively, in the Hsp90 5′-UTR. The resultant expressed mRNAs have nucleotides +1 to +76 and +1 to +110, respectively, deleted. MT90-Δ40AUG—The 5′ upstream primer (DU68) hybridized at the start of the metallothionein promoter in MT90-FL, where there is a unique MfeI site. The downstream primer (DU85) hybridized to the Hsp90 5′-UTR nucleotides +86 to +105 and contained, at its 5′ end, an NcoI site for cloning purposes. The MfeI/NcoI-digested PCR fragment was inserted into MfeI/NcoI-digested MT90-FL. The resulting plasmid MT90-Δ40AUG retained Hsp90 5′-UTR nucleotides +1 to +105. MT90-Δ75AUG and MT90-Δ110AUG—The procedure was identical to that described above, except the downstream primers (DU84 and DU83, respectively) were designed to hybridize to nucleotides +52 to +71 and +17 to +36, respectively, in the Hsp90 5′-UTR. The resultant expressed mRNAs retained Hsp90 5′-UTR nucleotides +1 to +71 and +1 to +36, respectively. MT90-Δ40–110I—The procedure was identical to that described above for MT90-Δ40CAP, except the upstream primer (DU89) was designed to hybridize to nucleotides +112 to +128 in the Hsp90 5′-UTR. Preceding this hybridization segment the primer contained 5′-UTR nucleotides +1 to +37 (including the EcoRI site at the start of transcription). The resultant expressed mRNA has nucleotides +38 to +111 deleted. MT90ΔCd—The upstream primer (DUC3) was designed to hybridize to 5′-UTR nucleotides +138 to +149, and extend 18 nucleotides into the coding sequence. The downstream primer (DUC4) was designed to hybridize to nucleotides 1160 to 1185 in the Hsp90 coding sequence (based on the numbering in NM 079175 (Entrez nucleotide)). The primer appends an AflII site preceding the coding nucleotides (or, in the orientation of the mRNA, downstream of Hsp90 coding nucleotides) for plasmid construction purposes. The primers were used to amplify the 5′-UTR and coding sequence nucleotides using pDm83 as the amplification target. The PCR amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and AflII, and inserted into MT90-FL digested with the same enzyme pair. The resultant plasmid replaces the Hsp70ΔCd coding sequence with Hsp90ΔCd. In MT90ΔCd the “UAA” sequence within the CTTAAG AflII restriction site is in-frame to constitute the stop codon. The resulting plasmid expresses ∼840 nucleotides of the Hsp90 coding sequence, resulting in a ∼30-kDa protein product (see Fig. 5). Heat Stress Increases the Translation of Hsp90 mRNA— Hsp90 mRNA is unique among the Drosophila Hsp mRNAs in being present in non-heat stressed cells in significant amounts. To investigate the translational characteristics of Hsp90 mRNA (throughout this report), S2 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 10–15 min, and the production of newly synthesized Hsp90 protein was assessed by gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, and densitometry. The rate of synthesis of Hsp90 is rapidly increased by heat shock (Fig. 1A). There is a detectable increase when temperature is raised to 29 °C, a progressively larger induction as temperature is raised from 29 to 35 °C, and then its protein synthesis begins to decrease as temperature is further increased (to 37 °C in this experiment). To assess whether this increase in protein synthesis represented increased translational efficiency (i.e. protein synthesis per mRNA), or simply occurred because there were more Hsp90 mRNAs, transcription was blocked by treatment with actinomycin D. In this case, there was still a significant increase in the synthesis of Hsp90 (Fig. 1B), indicating that the mRNA is relatively inefficiently translated under normal circumstances, and that translation is specifically increased by heating. To more precisely and accurately quantify the amount of Hsp90 synthesized during heat shock, without and with actinomycin D, labeled proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and the Hsp90 mRNA translational efficiency was quantified (Fig. 2B). Hsp90 mRNA increases its translational efficiency proportional to temperature, reaching a maximum activity at 35 °C that is ∼3–4 times that observed at normal growth temperature (22–24 °C). The efficacy of actinomycin D treatment can be observed in the inhibition of Hsp70 synthesis. Hsp70 mRNA is virtually absent in non-heat shocked cells. Hence, all its synthesis requires new, heat-induced transcription. The efficacy of treatment was also directly assessed by analysis of Hsp90 and Hsp70 mRNAs by Northern blotting. The heat shock-induced increase in Hsp90 mRNA was largely suppressed by actinomycin D treatment, and induction of Hsp70 mRNA was reduced by >95% (Fig. 3). This is similar to the extent of Hsp70 protein synthesis inhibition seen in Fig. 2. The increase in Hsp90 synthesis as temperature is raised could theoretically be because of temperature generally activating the translational machinery (a “Q10-like” effect), or could reflect a shared characteristic of all the Hsp mRNAs. However, it is neither because of a general nor class-specific activation; first, there is no significant increase in the translation rate of numerous non-heat shock mRNAs at very mild heat shock temperatures (i.e. 30–32 °C) that do increase the synthesis of Hsp90 (see, for example, bands/spots in Figs. 1 or 2 representing synthesis of non-heat shock proteins (e.g. actin)). Second, the temperature-dependent translational activation is specific to Hsp90 mRNA because when Hsp70 mRNA was expressed at normal temperature (see Fig. 4, legend, for details), its translation did not increase with temperature (Fig. 4). Thus, there is no general increase in translation of Hsp mRNAs as the temperature is increased; Hsp90 mRNA possesses unusual characteristics that may extend to a unique pathway to preferential translation, as detailed below. Hsp90 mRNA Translation Is Cap-dependent, as Is Hsp70 mRNA Translation—A potential unique pathway for Hsp90 mRNA translation would be IRES-mediated cap- (and eIF4F-) independent translation. Considering the sensitivity of Hsp90 mRNA translation in vitro to antibody-mediated eIF4F inhibition (17Zapata J.M. Maroto F.G. Sierra J.M. J. Biol.

We purified recombinant rat TOM40 (rTOM40), which was refolded in Brij35 after solubilization from inclusion bodies by guanidine HCl. rTOM40 (i) consisted of a 63% β-sheet structure and (ii) bound a matrix-targeted preprotein with high affinity and partially translocated it into the rTOM40 pore. This partial translocation was inhibited by stabilization of the mature domain of the precursor.

Based on the domain structure of rTOM40 deduced by protease treatment, we purified the elastase-resistant and membrane-embedded C-terminal segment (rTOM40(ΔN165)) as a recombinant protein with 62% β-structure that exhibited properties comparable with those of full-size rTOM40. We concluded that the membrane-embedded C-terminal half of rTOM40 constitutes the preprotein recognition domain with an enriched β-structure, which forms the preprotein conducting pore containing a salt-sensitive cis-binding site and a salt-resistant trans-binding site.

In yeast, the ∼400-kDa TOM holocomplex is composed of the import receptors Tom70, Tom20, and Tom22, the import channel Tom40 with a predicted β-barrel structure, Tom 5, which regulates precursor transfer from the receptor to the channel, and Tom6 and Tom7, which regulate channel assembly (4Pfanner N.

Upon reconstitution into liposomes, they actively import preproteins destined for the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix (3Künkele K.-P. Heins S. Dembowski M.

Purified recombinant yeast Tom40 reconstituted into liposomes forms a cation-selective and voltage-dependent high conductance channel with multiple conductance states, which specifically bind mitochondria-targeting sequences added to the cis-side of the membrane (12Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Matrix-targeted precursors or synthetic presequence peptides added to the cis-side strongly reduced the channel open probability and increased the frequency of channel gating. In a recent report, site-specific cross-linking revealed that the Tom40 channel binds to unfolded segments of non-native proteins and prevents their aggregation. Furthermore, it has the capacity to sequester ∼90 residues of unfolded or loosely folded preproteins (13Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, mechanism of preprotein recognition and sorting by the Tom40 machinery remains unclear, probably due, partly, to the difficulty in isolating Tom40 in the correctly folded and soluble form. In the present study, we expressed rat mitochondrial TOM40 (rTOM40) (14Suzuki H. Okazawa Y. Komiya T. Saeki K. Mekada E. Kitada S. Ito A. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37930-37936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in Escherichia coli, and we purified it from the inclusion bodies by solubilizing it in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) with subsequent refolding in the non-ionic detergent Brij35. The purified rTOM40 consisted of a ∼63% β-structure and, when incorporated into liposomes, exhibited presequence-sensitive, cation-specific channel activity. A pull-down assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that purified rTOM40 directly bound loosely folded matrix-targeted preprotein, pSU9-DHFR, with high affinity (KD range of 10-10). Salt sensitivity of the binding indicated that rTOM40 recognized preproteins by two distinct sequential interactions: initial ionic interactions followed by salt-resistant hydrophobic interactions. These sequential interactions drove partial translocation of preproteins and sequestration of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP)-processing site of preproteins within the rTOM40 pore. We then narrowed the location of the β-structure-enriched channel domain to the membrane-embedded C-terminal half of rTOM40 (residues 166–361). Purified recombinant rTOM40(ΔN165) was in the oligomeric form of ∼170-kDa, as assessed by gel filtration, and exhibited both structural and preprotein-binding characteristics almost identical to those of rTOM40. Plasmid Constructions—For construction of the E. coli expression plasmid of rat TOM40, the 1086-bp cDNA encoding N-terminal His6-tagged TOM40 was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET28a (Novagen) to obtain pET28-NHis40 (14Suzuki H.

The expression vector of rTOM40(ΔN165) was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment encoding His6-TOM40(ΔN165) was prepared by PCR using pET28a-NHis40 as the template, and the following oligonucleotides as the primer: sense strand, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGCACCAGCTGAGCCCAG GC-3′, and antisense strand, 5′-GCGGGATCCTCAGCCGATGGTGAG GCC AAA-3′. The NdeI and BamHI sites are underlined. The fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET28a to create pET28a-ΔN165. The expression vector for the N-terminal His6-tagged TOM40-(1–165) was constructed as follows. A DNA coding for N-terminal His6-tagged TOM40-(1–165) was amplified by PCR using pET28-NHis40 as the template and the following oligonucleotides as the primers: sense strand, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGGGAACGTGTTGGCTGCT-3′, and antisense strand, 5′-GCGGGATCCTCAGATGACCTGTGCATTGAG-3′. The NdeI and BamHI sites are underlined. The amplified fragment was inserted between the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET28a to create pET28a-(1–165). Purification of rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), and rTOM40-(1–165)— BL21(DE3)LysS cells harboring the expression plasmids for rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), or rTOM40-(1–165) were cultured to A600 = 0.5, and protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galacto-pyranoside and cultured further for 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were suspended in the sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF) and disrupted by sonication. For purification of rTOM40-(1–165), the soluble supernatant fraction obtained by ultracentrifugation was directly applied to a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences). For purification of rTOM40 and rTOM40(ΔN165), the sonicated cell debris was washed with sonication buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and the unsolubilized fraction was recovered by centrifugation. This step was repeated nine times, and the unsolubilized materials were washed once with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 4 m urea, and 1 mm PMSF. After centrifugation, the obtained inclusion bodies were suspended in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 0.5 m NaCl, 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME), and 5 mm imidazole). The ultracentrifuged supernatant was passed through a HiTrap chelating HP column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The column was extensively washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 6 m urea, 1 mm 2ME, and 5 mm imidazole), and then the washing buffer was slowly exchanged (0.2 ml/min) by a concentration gradient from 0 to 100% of the refolding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Brij35, 1 mm 2ME). After the refolding step, rTOM40 or rTOM40(ΔN165) was eluted by 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Brij35, 1 mm 2ME, and 300 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction was applied to a Mono-S column equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.5% Brij35, and eluted by a 0 to 1 m NaCl concentration gradient in the same buffer. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5% Brij35. Approximately 5 mg of rTOM40 or rTOM40(ΔN165) was obtained in high purity from ∼15 g (wet weight) of E. coli cells. Preparation of Elastase Fragments of rTOM40 for the N-terminal Sequencing—The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 3 μg of rTOM40 and elastase (2 μg/ml) was incubated at 0 °C for 30 min. The protein fragments were recovered by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and separated by SDS-PAGE. The fragments were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by Ponceau S-staining. The stained bands were cut out and subjected to protein sequencing. Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Preparation of proteoliposomes containing rTOM40 was essentially according to the method described by Jackson and Litman (15Jackson M.L. Litman B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.2 mg of l-α-phosphatidylcholine and 0.8 mg of l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine in chloroform were mixed in a test tube, and the solvent was evaporated by flushing with N2. One milliliter of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% Brij35 and 20 μg of rTOM40 was added to the tube, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 4 h with intermittent mixing. After incubation, the reaction mixture was diluted in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm sodium acetate. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against 5 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 20 g of Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad). The dialysate was concentrated using a membrane filter. Approximately 80% of the obtained proteoliposomes assumed unilamellar vesicles with ∼0.1 μm diameter. Preparation of Mitochondria from HeLa Cells Expressing the Epitope-tagged rTOM40 —HeLa cells were transfected with N-terminal His6-tagged rTOM40 or C-terminal HA-tagged rTOM40 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and cultured for 24 h. The cells were collected and homogenized in the homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.22 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, and 1 mm PMSF) by passing them through a 27-gauge needle 20 times using a syringe. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. Measurement of Channel Activity—Electrical measurements were performed with nystatin-perforated patch recordings applied on lipid bilayer vesicles containing rTOM40. SCC1–19 (10 μm) dissolved in the perfusate was applied using the Y-tube method, which allowed the external solution to be exchanged within 20 ms (16Nabekura J. Omura T. Akaike N. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resistance between the patch pipette and the reference electrode in the external solution was 10–12 megohms. Ionic currents were measured with a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List-Medical, Germany) and low pass filtered at 1 kHz (E-3210A, NF Electronic Instruments, Japan). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The composition of the pipette solution was 100 mm KCl, 50 mm potassium methane sulfonate, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). The external solution contained 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), and 1 mm CaCl2. In some experiments, the reversal potentials were obtained as the membrane potential at which the current responses to ramp voltage steps from -100 mV to +100 mV with and without SCC1–19 intersected with each other. The presence of the TOM40 pore was verified by measuring release of [14C]sucrose from the proteoliposomes containing rTOM40 or rTOM40(ΔN165). The assay was carried out essentially as described by Zalman et al. (17Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1771-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [14C]sucrose and [3H]dextran (mean Mr, 70,000) as the permeable and impermeable substrates, respectively, except that rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), rTOM40-(1–165), or lactate dehydrogenase, in lieu of mitochondrial outer membrane, was reconstituted into asolectin liposomes. The reaction mixture was passed through a Sepharose CL-4B column (0.9 × 9.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm NaN3. 0.3-ml fractions were collected and assayed for radioactivity by using a liquid scintillation counter. Membrane vesicles were eluted in fractions 6–7 (Fig. 7B). Isolation of Proteoliposomes by Centrifugal Floatation—After reconstitution of proteoliposomes, the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.6 m sucrose, placed under the layers of 1.25 m and 0.25 m sucrose, and centrifuged in a Hitachi RP-S120AT3 rotor at 100,000 rpm for 90 min. Proteoliposomes floated to the 0.25 and 1.25 m sucrose layers were recovered and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Binding Assay of Preproteins to rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), or rTOM40-(1–165) by Co-precipitation—The mixture containing 1 μg of pAd and the indicated amounts of rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), or rTOM40-(1–165) in 200 μl of the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Brij35, and 50 mm NaCl) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 5 min. The obtained supernatant was mixed with 30 μl (50% slurry) of TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with the binding buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting using anti-adrenodoxin IgG. Protection of the MPP-processing Site of pAd by rTOM40 or rTOM40(ΔN165)—Binding of pAd to rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), or rTOM40-(1–165) and isolation of the complex by TALON beads were performed as described above. The isolated beads were suspended in 25 μl of the binding buffer, and the suspension was then incubated with 3 μg of yeast recombinant MPP in the presence of 2 mm MnCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with the sample loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting using anti-adrenodoxin IgG. CD Spectrum Measurement—CD spectra of rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), and rTOM40-(1–165) were measured in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Brij35 at 25 °C using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter and a cuvette with a 1-mm light-path. Each spectrum represents an average of five scans from 195 to 250 nm at 0.1-nm intervals. The base line was established by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer alone. Analysis of the secondary structure was performed using the method of Reed and Reed (18Reed J. Reed T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—The SPR measurements were performed at 25 °C with a Biacore 3000 (Biacore AB). Purified rTOM40, rTOM40(ΔN165), or rTOM40-(1–165) was immobilized onto the sensor chip CM5 by amine-coupling according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the coupling was performed in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) at a protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. The level of immobilization typically corresponded to 2000 resonance units, which corresponded to ∼2 ng of protein/mm2 (Fig. 6, A–D). In Fig. 6E, rTOM40 was immobilized to the chip at 22,000 resonance units (corresponding to ∼22 ng of protein/mm2). Binding analyses were performed in 20 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Brij35 (running buffer) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The sensor chip surface was regenerated by 50 mm HCl. Binding curves were analyzed using BIA-Evaluation software (version 3.2). The kinetic data fitting was performed using a Langmuir 1:1 binding model. Purification of Rat TOM40 —N-terminal His6-tagged rTOM40 expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies was solubilized by 6 m GdnHCl, applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column, and subjected to a refolding reaction by exchanging GdnHCl slowly with Brij35. rTOM40 was then eluted by imidazole and subjected to Mono-S column chromatography. Purified rTOM40 (Fig. 1A) was eluted through a Superose 6 column with a peak at ∼250 kDa, although with a rather broad elution profile (see Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Structural characteristics of purified rTOM40(ΔN165) and its properties of preprotein recognition.A, SDS-PAGE profile of purified rTOM40(ΔN165).

D, binding of pAd by rTOM40(ΔN165) as assessed by pull-down assay. pAd (1 μg) was incubated with the indicated amounts of rTOM40(ΔN165) (N-terminal His6-tagged), and then the reaction mixtures were subjected to pull-down reaction. Other conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 3. E, salt sensitivity of the pAd·rTOM40(ΔN165) complex. The binding assay was performed as in D using 5 μg of rTOM40(ΔN165) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of NaCl. F, sequestration of the MPP-processing site of pAd within rTOM40(ΔN165) molecule. pAd and rTOM40(ΔN165) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were then incubated with Ni-NTA beads. The pAd·rTOM40(ΔN165) complex was incubated with (+) or without (-) MPP at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-adrenodoxin antibodies. In a separate experiment (ΔN165 = 0 μg), pAd was incubated with MPP at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. The band intensities were quantified, and the processing efficiency (mAd/(pAd + mAd)) was calculated by setting the efficiency in the absence of rTOM40(ΔN165) to 100% (shown in the right panel). G, rTOM40-(1–165) binds pAd but does not sequester the MPP-processing site within the molecule. The indicated amounts of N-terminal His6-tagged rTOM40-(1–165) were incubated in 200 μl with 1 μg of pAd, and the reaction mixtures were subjected to the MPP protection assay as described in F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Secondary Structure of rTOM40 —A CD spectrum of rTOM40 in 0.5% Brij35 had a minimum value at 213 nm, crossover of the base line at 201 nm, and zero ellipticity at a wavelength 235 nm (Fig. 1B). The secondary structure of rTOM40 estimated from the CD spectrum using the program of Reed and Reed (18Reed J. Reed T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) comprised 62.9% β-sheet, 10.0% α-helix, 5.9% turn, and 21.1% random structures in the protein. The content of the β-sheet structure of rTOM40 was comparable with that of recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tom40 (>60%) purified from inclusion bodies after solubilization with 8 m urea and either reconstituted into liposomes or solubilized in Mega9, although the CD spectra were distinct (12Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of rTOM40 was significantly different from that of the oligomeric form of N. crassa Tom40, which was purified after dissociation of the purified TOM complex with octyl glucoside (less β-sheet, ∼31%; more α-helix, 30%) (10Ahting U. Thieffry M. Engelhardt H. Hegerl R. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reason for this structural difference between rat and N. crassa Tom40 is not known. Channel Properties of rTOM40 —The purified TOM holocomplex, TOM core complex, oligomeric N. crassa Tom40 isolated from the purified TOM core complex, and recombinant Tom40 of S. cerevisiae form cation-selective high conductance channels when incorporated into lipid membranes and the presequence peptide block the channel in a voltage-dependent manner (3Künkele K.-P.

We therefore examined whether purified rTOM40 was correctly folded to exhibit channel activity. rTOM40 was incorporated into unilamellar ∼0.1-μm-diameter liposomes, and electrical measurements were performed with nystatin-perforated patch recordings. A functional presequence peptide SCC1–19 (10 μm) (20Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3886-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) induced an immediate outward shift of current at a holding potential of -100 mV in less than 1 s (Fig. 2). During SCC1–19 application, there was no desensitization of the current but current noise increased. The current returned to base line within 10 s upon washing out the presequence peptide. Less hyperpolarization of the membrane reduced SCC1–19-induced current amplitude and a positive membrane potential reversed the direction of SCC1–19-induced current inward. The reversal potential of SCC1–19-induced current was 8.3 ± 3.2 mV (mean ± S.E., n = 5). This result suggested that the lipid bilayer with rTOM40 contains cation-permeable ion channels that are rapidly and reversibly blocked by the presequence peptide. Binding of Matrix-targeted Preproteins to Purified rTOM40— Confirming that recombinant rTOM40 had refolded to constitute a dominant β-sheet structure and to exhibit channel activity, we examined its interaction with matrix-targeted preproteins. Recombinant preadrenodoxin (pAd) (21Iwahashi J. Furuya S. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was incubated with rTOM40 (N-terminal His6-tagged), and rTOM40 was recovered with nickel resin. Immunoblot analysis with anti-adrenodoxin antibody revealed that pAd was recovered to the nickel resin depending on the amount of rTOM40 added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 3A). As a control, the mature form of adrenodoxin (mAd) did not bind to rTOM40 (data not shown). The interaction between rTOM40 and pAd was sensitive to NaCl, and the interaction was almost completely abolished by 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 3B). The pAd·rTOM40 complex, once formed, was stable in high salt (Fig. 3B, Af in the lower panel). These results suggested that the preprotein initially binds to rTOM40 mainly through ionic interactions, which is followed by the other interactions involving hydrophobic interactions. The so-called “cis-binding sites” or “cis-sites” of mitochondria or mitochondrial outer membranes, which are located in the protease-sensitive surface receptors Tom20 and Tom22, are sensitive to salt concentrations as low as 100 mm (22Mayer A.

Therefore, the “cis”-site of TOM40 involved in the initial precursor recognition binds preproteins through stronger ionic interactions than that for the cis-binding site of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2153975304,"The S1 site (Asp189) of factor Xa (fXa) is located on a loop (residues 185–189) that contains three solvent-exposed charged residues (Asp185, Lys186, and Glu188) below the active-site pocket of the protease. To investigate the role of these residues in the catalytic function of fXa, we expressed three mutants of the protease in which the charges of these residues were neutralized by their substitutions with Ala (D185A, K186A, and E188A). Kinetic studies revealed that E188A has a normal catalytic activity toward small synthetic and natural substrates and inhibitors of fXa; however, the same activities were slightly (∼2-fold) and dramatically (∼20–50-fold) impaired for the D185A and K186A mutants, respectively. Further studies revealed that the affinity of D185A and K186A for interaction with Na+ has also been altered, with a modest impairment (∼2-fold) for the former and a dramatic impairment for the latter mutant. Both prothrombinase and direct binding studies indicated that K186A also has an ∼6-fold impaired affinity for factor Va. Interestingly, a saturating concentration of factor Va restored the catalytic defect of K186A in reactions with prothrombin and the recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide that is known to interact with the Na+ loop of fXa, but not with other substrates. These results suggest that factor Va interacts with 185–189-loop for fXa, which is energetically linked to the Na+-binding site of the protease.

The catalytic efficiency of fXa in the prothrombinase complex is five orders of magnitude higher than that of fXa alone (1Nesheim M.E. Kettner C. Shaw E. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Most of the accelerating effect of the prothrombinase complex assembly is attributed to the cofactor function of factor Va (fVa), which can bind to and alter the kinetic properties of fXa by inducing conformational changes in the structure of the protease and also by providing secondary binding sites for the substrate prothrombin in the activation complex (6Betz A.

However, recent results have indicated that the mutagenesis of the basic residues of the heparin binding 162-helix on the protease domain (especially Arg165 in the chymotrypsinogen numbering system (11Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar)) dramatically impairs the ability of fXa to interact with fVa in the prothrombinase complex (12Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to the 162-helix, other basic residues of the heparin binding site of fXa have been implicated in fVa binding (12Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5123-5128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); however, the exact contribution of these residues to the recognition mechanism of the protease-cofactor interaction has not been studied in detail. Similar to other coagulation proteases, fXa is an allosteric enzyme, and thus the binding of metal ions and protein cofactors to several solvent exposed surface loops near or remote from the catalytic pocket can modulate the activity and specificity of the protease. For instance, the binding of both Ca2+ to the 70-loop and Na+ to the 225-loop is known to markedly promote the activity of fXa toward synthetic substrates and natural target inhibitors (14Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21495-21499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recent thermodynamic linkage analyses have indicated that both of these metal ion binding sites are energetically linked in fXa (15Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Camire R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, the same studies have demonstrated that the Na+ and the S1 sites of fXa are also allosterically linked (16Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37863-37870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Underwood M.C. Zhong D. Mathur A. Heyduk T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The S1 site of fXa and other coagulation proteases is a conserved Asp residue at position 189 that is known to interact with a basic residue of all substrates and inhibitors and thus is responsible for determining the P1-Arg specificity of these proteases (11Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 18Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The S1-Asp189 of coagulation proteases is located on an exposed surface loop (185–189-loop) immediately below the Na+-binding 225-loop (18Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W.

A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This loop has several non-conserved residues that are unique for each coagulation protease. In the case of thrombin, a recent mutagenesis study showed that the charged residues of this loop are critical for the catalytic activity and the monovalent cation binding specificity of the protease (20Prasad S. Wright K.L. Banerjee Roy D. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The same loop in fXa has three charged residues, Asp185, Lys186, and Glu188, with unknown functions (18Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In this study, we substituted these residues with Ala in three separate constructs and expressed the mutants in mammalian cells. The characterization of these mutants in appropriate kinetic assays revealed that both Asp185 and Lys186 alter the Na+ affinity of fXa, suggesting that they are allosterically linked to the metal ion binding site of the protease. The ability of the Lys186 mutant to bind to the S1 site specific probe p-aminobenzamidine was also dramatically impaired. Moreover, both kinetic and equilibrium binding data suggested that Lys186 is a binding site for fVa, as shown by an ∼6-fold impaired affinity of the mutant for the cofactor. The Lys186 mutant also exhibited a dramatic impairment in amidolytic and proteolytic activity and reactivity with antithrombin (AT), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (rTAP). Interestingly, fVa restored the proteolytic defect of the K186A mutant in both prothrombin activation and rTAP binding assays; however, the cofactor did not influence other activities of the mutant. The defective activity of the K186A mutant was also partially corrected at 0.5 m NaCl. Taken together, analysis of these results suggests that fVa, Na+, and S1 sites of fXa are allosterically linked. Moreover, there appears to be a similarity between the fXa-fVa interaction with prothrombin and rTAP. Because the crystal structure of the fXa-rTAP complex is known (21Wei A. Alexander R.S. Duke J. Ross H. Rosenfeld S.A. Chang C.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the interaction of the fXa mutant with the inhibitor can be used as a model system to understand how the cofactor may function in the prothrombinase complex during prothrombin activation. Mutagenesis and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The expression and purification of wild-type factor X in HEK293 cells was described previously (22Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R.

After confirmation of the accuracy of the mutagenesis by DNA sequencing, the constructs were introduced into HEK293 cells and the mutant proteins were isolated from 20 liters of cell culture supernatants by a combination of immunoaffinity and ion exchange chromatography using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody and a Mono Q ion exchange column as described (22Manithody C.

Human plasma proteins including fVa, fXa, prothrombin, AT, the factor X-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom, and Oregon Green 488 (OG488)-labeled glutamylglycinylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (EGR) active-site-blocked human fXa (OG488-EGR-fXa) were purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). TFPI was from Monsanto Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). rTAP was a generous gift from Dr. G. Vlasuk (Corvas International, Inc., San Diego, CA). The active AT-binding pentasaccharide (H5) fragment of heparin (fondaparinux sodium) was purchased from Quintiles Clinical Supplies (Mt. Laurel, NJ). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described (25Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

The chromogenic substrate, Spectrozyme FXa (SpFXa, MeO-CO-d-Chg-Gly-Arg-pNA), was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT); S2765 (Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-pNA) and S2222 (Bz-Ile-Glu-(γ-OR)-Gly-Arg-pNA) were purchased from Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). Polybrene and p-aminobenzamidine (PAB) were purchased from Sigma. Activation of Factor X Derivatives by Russell's Viper Venom—Factor X derivatives were converted to active forms by Russell's viper venom as described (22Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, each factor X derivative (∼250–500 μg) was incubated with Russell's viper venom (50 nm) at 37°C for 1 h in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mm Ca2+. Time course analysis of the activation reactions indicated that all factor X zymogens were converted to their active forms under these experimental conditions. Factor Xa derivatives were separated from the snake venom by a heparin-Sepharose column chromatography as described (12Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Active-site concentrations of fXa derivatives were determined by an amidolytic activity assay and titrations with human antithrombin assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry as described (22Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These concentrations were within 80–100% of those expected based on zymogen concentrations as determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a published absorption coefficient (26DiScipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Chromogenic Substrates—The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of SpFXa (7.8–2000 μm) by fXa derivatives (1–10 nm) was determined in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% PEG 8000, 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 m of different monovalent chloride salts (NaCl, KCl, and LiCl). The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature by a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) as described (15Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Km and kcat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation. The specificity constant for each chloride salt was expressed as the ratio of kcat/Km. Apparent Dissociation Constant (Kd(app)) for Na+—The Kd(app) values for the Na+ interaction with each protease was determined from the effect of varying concentrations of Na+ on the activity of the protease toward three chromogenic substrates SpFXa (100 μm), S2765 (50 μm), and S2222 (200 μm) at room temperature in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% PEG 8000 containing 5 mm Ca2+ (TBS/Ca2+) as described (15Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The concentrations of chromogenic substrates used in the reactions were near their Km values for fXa. The protease concentrations ranged from 1–5 nm. The Kd(app) values were calculated from the hyperbolic increase in the rate of substrate hydrolysis as a function of increasing concentrations of Na+ as described (15Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that the amidolytic activity of fXa is not dependent on the ionic strength of the reaction buffer (15Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Underwood M.C. Zhong D. Mathur A. Heyduk T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, no compensating chloride salt was added to the reactions. The background amidolytic activities at the zero Na+ were deducted from the activities in the presence of increasing concentrations of Na+ (0–800 mm), and data were fit to the Langmuir binding isotherm. Inactivation by Antithrombin—The rate of inactivation of fXa derivatives by AT in both the absence and presence of H5 was measured under pseudo-first-order rate conditions by a discontinuous assay as described previously (22Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the absence of H5, each protease (1–5 nm) was incubated with AT (0.5–4.0 μm) in TBS/Ca2+ for 10–30 min in 50-μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene assay plates at room temperature. In the presence of H5, the reaction conditions were the same except that the proteases were incubated with the AT (25–200 nm) in the presence of a saturating concentration of H5 (1 μm) for 0.5–6 min in the same TBS buffer system. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of SpFXa (final concentration of 0.2 mm) in TBS containing 1 mg/ml Polybrene. The remaining activities of enzymes were measured by a Vmax kinetic microplate reader at 405 nm as described above. The observed pseudo-first-order and second-order rate constants (k2) were calculated as described (22Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interaction with TFPI and rTAP—The ability of fXa derivatives to bind either TFPI or rTAP was evaluated by incubating each fXa (1–2 nm) with different concentrations of TFPI or rTAP (0.2–25 nm) in TBS/Ca2+ in 80 μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene plates. Following 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 20 μl of SpFXa or S2765 was added to a final concentration of 100–250 μm, and the Ki values were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of data using the quadratic equation describing the tight binding interactions as described (27Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Inhibition by PAB—The affinity of fXa derivatives for interaction with the active-site directed serine protease probe, PAB, was determined by incubating each protease (1–3 nm) with increasing concentrations of PAB (0–6.4 mm) in the presence of different fixed concentrations of S2765 (12.5–4250 μm) in TBS/Ca2+ at room temperature. The enzyme activities were measured from the cleavage rate of the chromogenic substrate as described above, and the Ki values were determined by global fitting of data to a competitive binding equation as described (28Rezaie A.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Activation of Prothrombin—The initial rate of prothrombin activation by the wild-type and mutant fXa derivatives was measured in both the absence and presence of factor Va as described (22Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the absence of the cofactor, the concentration dependence of prothrombin activation was studied by incubating each fXa derivative (5–10 nm) with increasing concentrations of the zymogen (20–2500 nm) on PC/PS vesicles (25 μm) in TBS/Ca2+ at room temperature. Following 5–10 min activation, small aliquots of the activation reactions were transferred into wells of a 96-well assay plate containing S2238 (100 μm in TBS containing 20 mm EDTA, and in 100 μl of final volume), and the initial rate of thrombin generation was monitored at 405 nm by a Vmax kinetic microplate reader. The concentration of thrombin generated in each activation reaction was determined from a standard curve prepared from the cleavage rate of S2238 by known concentrations of thrombin under exactly the same conditions. In the presence of the cofactor, first the apparent affinity of fXa derivatives for binding fVa was evaluated in a prothrombinase assay as described (22Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, fXa (0.1 nm) was mixed with varying concentrations of human fVa (0–20 nm) on PC/PS vesicles (10 μm) in TBS/Ca2+ at room temperature. The activation reaction was initiated with 1 μm human prothrombin for 30 s, following which the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. The concentrations of thrombin generated in the activation reactions were determined from a standard curve as described above. The concentration dependence of prothrombin activation in the presence of fVa on PC/PS vesicles was also studied by a similar prothrombinase assay. In this case, factor Xa (50 pm) in complex with a saturating concentration of fVa (25 nm in all reactions) on PC/PS vesicles (10 μm) was incubated with varying concentrations of human prothrombin (7.8–1000 nm) in TBS/Ca2+. Following 20–30 s of incubation at room temperature, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the concentrations of thrombin generated were determined by an amidolytic activity assay as described above. It was ensured that less than 15% of prothrombin was activated at all concentrations of the substrate. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—The affinities of fXa derivatives for interaction with fVa were evaluated by their ability to displace OG488-EGR-fXa from the bound fVa at equilibrium as monitored by a decrease in the fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled fXa-fVa complex using an Aminco-Bowman series 2 spectrophotometer (Spectronic Unicam, Rochester, NY). First, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction of OG488-EGR-fXa with factor Va was determined by titrating increasing concentrations of fVa (1–50 nm) with a fixed concentration of the labeled fXa (10 nm) on PC/PS vesicles (10 μm) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% PEG 8000 and 5 mm Ca2+. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 490 and 520 nm, respectively. The bandwidths were set at 8 nm for both excitation and emission. The titration was performed by the addition of 1–2 μl of stock solution of fVa (1–4 μm) to the labeled fXa in a quartz cuvette in 1-ml volumes at 25 °C. The titration volume did not exceed 2% of the total volume of the reaction. The increase in the anisotropy of OG488-EGR-fXa upon interaction with fVa was recorded and plotted as a function of the cofactor concentrations. The KD value for the interaction of the labeled fXa for fVa was calculated by nonlinear least-squares computer fitting of the data by the quadratic binding equation as described (29Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The affinity of the mutants for interaction with fVa was then evaluated by their ability to decrease the anisotropy of the OG488-EGR-fXa-fVa complex in a competitive titration assay. The competitive assay was carried out by the addition of small aliquots of increasing concentrations of the wild-type or mutant fXa derivatives to a fixed concentration of OG488-EGR-fXa (10 nm) and factor Va (25 nm) in a 1-ml volume, monitoring the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the reaction upon the displacement of the labeled fXa from the cofactor. Data were collected for up to 50 nm fXa, and the KD values were estimated using a cubic equation as described (30Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Amidolytic Activities—The initial characterization of the fXa mutants indicated that with the exception of E188A, both D185A and K186A exhibit impaired amidolytic activities toward three chromogenic substrates (SpFXa, S2765 and S2222) in TBS/Ca2+. Noting that previous mutagenesis of the homologous loop of thrombin altered the monovalent cation specificity of the protease (20Prasad S. Wright K.L. Banerjee Roy D. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we decided to determine the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of SpFXa in a buffer containing three different monovalent cations. The results presented in Table I suggested that among the three monovalent cations tested, all fXa mutants retained their preference for Na+, as judged by the higher specificity constants (kcat/Km) for all three mutants in the presence of Na+. However, in the presence of all three metal ions, the amidolytic activities of both D185A and K186A mutants were impaired. Thus, in the Na+-containing buffer, a less than 2-fold decrease in both the Km and kcat values of the substrate hydrolysis was observed with the D185A mutant, and a dramatic decrease of ∼51-fold in the specificity constant was observed with the K186A mutant (Table I). The primary defect in substrate hydrolysis by K186A was in the Km parameter, suggesting that the chromogenic substrate cannot effectively bind to the active site pocket of the mutant protease. A close examination of the kinetic data presented in Table I further suggested that the 3-fold impairment in the specificity constant of D185A in the presence of Na+ was decreased to a less than 2-fold decrease in the presence of K+ and nearly no difference was observed in the presence of Li+. This is derived from the observation that both wild-type and D185A fXa cleaved the chromogenic substrate with comparable specificity constant in the presence of Li+ (Table I). Similarly, the ability of the K186A mutant to discriminate between the monovalent cations was some how diminished.Table IKinetic constants for the cleavage of Spectrozyme FXa by fXa derivatives in the presence of three different monovalent cations The kinetic constants were determined from the steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of SpFXa (7.8–2000 μm) by each fXa derivative (1–10 nm) in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% PEG 8000, 3 mM CaCl2 and 0.2 M of each monovalent chloride salt as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic values are the average of 2–3 measurements ± standard errors.Kmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1μm-1 s-1fXaNa+69.0 ± 4.0141.6 ± 2.52.05 ± 0.16K+244.9 ± 6.0137.8 ± 1.20.56 ± 0.02Li+442.6 ± 22.4101.2 ± 2.20.23 ± 0.06D185ANa+130.0 ± 4.692.5 ± 1.00.71 ± 0.03K+289.4 ± 10.794.9 ± 1.40.33 ± 0.02Li+428.1 ± 22.781.9 ± 2.00.19 ± 0.01K186ANa+2200 ± 20089.0 ± 5.50.04 ± 0.006K+3500 ± 30053.1 ± 3.00.02 ± 0.003Li+4700 ± 20057.8 ± 2.20.01 ± 0.001E188ANa+60.6 ± 3.9145.6 ± 2.52.4 ± 0.2K+234.7 ± 6.3137.7 ± 1.40.59 ± 0.02Li+426.4 ± 32.9115.2 ± 3.90.27 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Kd(app) for Interaction with Na+—Previous results have indicated that the 185–189-loop and the Na+-binding 225-loop of thrombin are energetically linked (20Prasad S.

Proteoglycans bind multiple components of the extracellular matrix by serving as important regulators of cell behavior. Given the influence of culture architecture on cell function, we investigated whether switching NIH3T3 fibroblasts from growth on type 1 collagen in monolayer to a collagen gel might influence dermatan sulfate expression. Immunofluorescent staining, immunoblot, and Western blot demonstrated an induction in decorin expression in cells switched to collagen gels. This induction was associated with a 40-fold increase in decorin transcript expression determined by quantitative real time PCR. Disaccharide analysis of extracted glycosaminoglycans from collagen gels showed an increase in total glycosaminoglycan and in the ratio of chondroitin sulfate to heparan sulfate compared with monolayer culture. The ratio of chondroitin sulfate to heparan sulfate likewise increased on syndecan-1 from gel culture. Digestion with chondroitinase B showed that this induced chondroitin sulfate was dermatan sulfate. Syndecan-1 extracted from wounded mouse skin also displayed an increase in dermatan sulfate synthesis compared with unwounded skin. Furthermore, glycosaminoglycans from collagen gel culture activated keratinocyte growth factor, whereas glycosaminoglycans from monolayer culture lacked this ability. These findings suggest that regulation of dermatan sulfate and dermatan sulfate proteoglycan is dependent on extracellular matrix architecture. The ability of collagen gel culture to mimic better the in vivo dermal environment may be due in part to this influence on dermatan sulfate and dermatan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are important ECM components that can influence these cell behaviors. HS has been well described to be involved in a vast number of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions ranging from processes such as development to microbial invasion (4Lin X. Perrimon N. Glycoconj. J. 2002; 19: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 461-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence has identified another GAG, CS-B or dermatan sulfate (DS), as playing a role in large number of similar cellular processes (7Trowbridge J.M. Gallo R.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R117-R125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that DS is released at high concentrations during wound repair, and that it serves as a cofactor for several growth factors important to this process, has made it an attractive molecule for investigating cell-matrix interactions (8Penc S.F.

Rudisill J.A. Ron D. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DS is made up of repeating disaccharide units of iduronic acid and GalNAc and is the predominant GAG in the dermis (7Trowbridge J.M. Gallo R.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R117-R125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The presence of GalNAc identifies DS as a chondroitin sulfate, whereas the presence of the iduronic acid sets DS apart from other chondroitin sulfates. DS and DS proteoglycans (DSPG) bind a long list of proteins influencing a large range of physiological processes. For example, binding of DS to heparin cofactor-II, thrombin, and activated protein C regulates the coagulation cascade (11Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mascellani G. Liverani L. Bianchini P. Parma B. Torri G. Bisio A. Guerrini M. Casu B. Biochem.

Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DS also interacts with basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and keratinocyte growth factor (FGF-7), promoting cell proliferation (8Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E.

Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt G. Robenek H. Harrach B. Glossl J. Nolte V. Hormann H. Richter H. Kresse H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1683-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), develop skin with increased fragility (17Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). These interactions demonstrate the importance of DS, particularly as a regulator of wound repair and skin strength. Although much has been uncovered regarding the role of DS as a multifunctional co-factor, the regulation of DS synthesis is poorly understood. Changing the architecture of a culture environment from monolayer growth to three-dimensional (3D) growth has been shown to have profound effects on cell behavior. A switch to 3D culture architecture influences cell proliferation, matrix protein synthesis, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions (1Senoo H. Imai K. Sato M. Kojima N. Miura M. Hata R. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Cukierman E. Pankov R. Stevens D.R. Yamada K.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1708-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). Given that DS and DSPG are closely involved in these types of interactions, we hypothesized that the 3D culture environment might have an influence on DS and DSPG synthesis. The findings in this report indicate that the transfer of fibroblasts from monolayer to 3D culture induces the synthesis of the DSPG decorin. This change in culture architecture also stimulates an increase in the DS GAG chain synthesis on the cell surface PG syndecan-1. The observation that a similar change is found in skin after wounding demonstrates the biological relevance of this finding. Finally, the influence of 3D culture on fibroblast behavior appears to be functionally important, as GAG from fibroblasts in 3D culture acquired the ability to promote growth factor activity. NIH3T3 Fibroblasts in Monolayer Culture—Cells were cultured in “NIH3T3 media” composed of Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium with 10% FCS, 2.92 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate on plastic coated with 490 μg/ml type I rat tail collagen (Sigma). All cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For treatment of monolayer culture with TGFβ, fibroblasts were cultured with 1–10 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 48 h. NIH3T3 Fibroblasts in 3D Collagen Gel Culture—Type I collagen was solubilized in sterile-filtered 0.1% acetic acid to a stock concentration of 2 mg/ml. 255 μl of the collagen stock were mixed with 196 μl of NIH3T3 media, 8 μlof1 m NaOH to neutralize the solution, and 285 μl of 2× Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium to give a collagen/media solution. This solution was chilled on ice until just prior to pouring gels. Cells from monolayer culture were trypsinized, centrifuged, counted, and resuspended to 4.2 × 105 cells/ml in NIH3T3 media. 300 μl of cell suspension were mixed with 740 μl of a collagen/media solution in 12-well plates. Neutralizing pan-specific transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or preimmune rabbit IgG antibody at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml was added to the collagen media solution prior to combining with the cell suspension when indicated. Gel formation occurred over 20 min at 37 °C, after which the gels were released from well sides with a pipette tip and from the bottom of the well with minimal shaking of the plate. BaF/KFGR Cells—These cells are mouse lymphocyte BaF3 cells engineered to express fibroblast growth factor-2 IIIb (FGFR2 IIIb) receptor and to lack surface GAGs. The preparation and culture of these cells have been described previously (18Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol.

Cells underwent selection for 2 weeks in 5 μg/ml heparin and 10 ng/ml FGF-1 in RPMI containing 2.92 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and then were transferred and cultured in RPMI containing 10% IL-3 conditioned media, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin for at least 1 week prior to use in cell proliferation assays. IL-3 conditioned media were prepared by collecting media from the culture of WEHI-3B cells grown in RPMI with 10% FCS (19Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For fibroblasts grown in monolayer culture, NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured for 7 days on slides coated with collagen (∼90% confluent); media were removed, and cells were fixed with methanol at 4 °C for 30 min. For fibroblasts grown in 3D collagen gels, after 7 days of culture, gels were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, PA) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were then cut onto slides and air-dried. After washing with PBS, samples from the monolayer and 3D culture were blocked with 3% BSA/PBS at room temperature for 30 min, incubated with mouse anti-human DSPG antibody (6-B-6, Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA)) at 1:500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and then incubated in the dark with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:100 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. After slides were washed again with PBS, coverslips were mounted using ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and digital images were taken with Olympus BX41 microscope and digital camera. To verify specificity, slides were also probed with preimmune mouse IgG antibody. For isolation from fibroblasts grown in monolayer culture, media were removed, and PG/GAG extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 7 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Tween 20, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture, pH 8.0) was added. Lysed cells were loosened with a cell scraper, and cellular extracts were collected. For isolation from fibroblasts in collagen gel culture, gels were homogenized by electric homogenizer in PG/GAG extraction buffer to give cellular extract. Cellular extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415c) for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was combined with QAE-Sephadex A-25 beads previously prepared per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the beads three times with PG/GAG wash buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm NaOAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture, pH 4.5), PG/GAG was eluted with PG/GAG elution buffer (2 m NaCl, 50 mm NaOAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture, pH 4.5) and precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95% EtOH, 1.3% potassium acetate. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415c) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was decanted. After air-drying for 5 min, samples were resuspended in water. Total sulfated PG/GAG was quantified using the Blyscan proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Accurate Chemical Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY). For isolation of only the GAGs for cell proliferation assays, cell extracts underwent digestion with proteinase K at 50 °C for 48 h prior to combining with QAE-Sephadex beads. Following elution, precipitation, and resuspension in water, GAGs were then additionally cleaned by use of 3000 molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) Microcon centrifuge filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). GAG in 500 μl of water was applied to a filter and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415c) at 4 °C until the complete volume had passed through retaining only the GAGs. Samples were washed twice more with 500 μl of RPMI with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin and then were resuspended in media for proliferation assay as described below. For immunoblot, 2.0 μg of cellular extracts were transferred to an Immobilon-N membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Minifold I dot blot system (Schleicher & Schuell). 1 ml of culture media from fibroblasts grown on collagen for 48 h (cells were 90% confluent, total media volume was 10 ml) was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415c) for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was also transferred by this dot blot system to an Immobilon-N membrane. For Western blot, 2.0 μg of cellular extracts were boiled in Tris/glycine loading buffer for 5 min, separated via 4–20% Tris/glycine PAGE, and then transferred to an Immobilon-N membrane. Both dot blot and Western blots were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% BSA, 0.15 mm NaCl, 0.03% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 2 h, incubated with primary antibody (either mouse anti-human DSPG antibody at 1:500 or rat anti-mouse syndecan-1 antibody at 1:2000) overnight at 4 °C, washed with 0.3% Tween 20, Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse antibody-horseradish peroxidase at 1:2500 or goat anti-rat antibody-horseradish peroxidase at 1:2000, respectively (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 40 min at 4 °C. Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect electrochemiluminescence. Prior to PAGE, some extract samples were digested with a chondroitinase and/or treated with nitrous acid. For chondroitinase ABC digestion, extract samples were lyophilized, resuspended in chondroitinase ABC buffer (50 mm Tris base, 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0) plus 0.625 milliunits/μl (final concentration) of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma), and incubated overnight at 37 °C. For chondroitinase B digestion, extract samples were lyophilized and resuspended in chondroitinase B buffer (chondroitinase ABC buffer plus 0.05% BSA) plus 40 milliunits/μl (final concentration) of chondroitinase B (Sigma). For nitrous acid digestion, equal parts of 1 m H2SO4 were mixed with 0.5 m barium nitrite hydrate at room temperature, and the precipitate was separated out by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415c) for 5 min at room temperature. Lyophilized extract samples were resuspended in the supernatant (nitrous acid, pH 1.5), incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and then neutralized with a volume of 1 m NaHCO3. Total RNAs were extracted from the monolayer and 3D cultured fibroblasts at different time points in the culture by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. After DNase digestion, RNA samples were passed through RNeasy Mini Spin columns for RNA Cleanup (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed on 2 μg of RNA using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, 4 μlof50 μm Random Decamers were combined with RNA, brought up to 24 μl with water, and incubated at 80 °C for 3 min. The reaction was iced, and 4 μl of 10× RT buffer, 8 μl of dNTP mix, 2 μl of RNase inhibitor, and 2 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase were added. Reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h and 92 °C for 10 min. Real time PCR was performed using a Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System from Applied Biosciences (Foster City, CA). GAPDH-F (5′-CTTAGCACCCCTGGCCAAG-3′) and GAPDH-R (5′-TGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACG-3′) were used to amplify GAPDH. DEcorIN-RT-F1 (5′-AGCTTCAACAGCATCACCGTT-3′) and DEcorIN-RT-R1 (5′-AGGAACATTGGCCAGACTGC-3′) were used to amplify decorin. mTGFβ-RealT-F (5′-TGGAGCTGGTGAAACGGAAG-3′) and mTGFβ-RealT-R (5′-ACAGGATCTGGCCACGGAT-3′) were used to amplify mTGFβ.1 μl of reverse transcriptase reaction was added to 24 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.25 μl of each 20 μm primer. The thermal profile was as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40× (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min). The melting temperature profiles of amplicons were determined to show the specificity of amplification. Results were analyzed using the comparative Ct method, where ΔCt = Ct (mCRAMP) – Ct (GAPDH) and ΔΔCt = ΔCt (K14-Cath-mCRAMP mice) – ΔCt (wild-type mice). Relative expression was calculated as 2–(ΔΔCt). All real time PCRs were performed in triplicate. After back hair was removed by shaving and chemical depilation from Balb/c mice, multiple full-thickness 1-cm incisions were made in their back skin. After 48 h, back skin was excised from mice with wounded skin and from control mice with unwounded skin. No evidence of infection was seen at the incision sites. Skin tissue samples were processed for PG/GAG isolation as described above. Animal procedures were approved by the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System subcommittee on animal studies (protocol 02-037). Cell count of fibroblasts in monolayer culture or 3D collagen gel culture was determined by release of cells from collagen by trypsinization and collagenase treatment, respectively, followed by determination of DNA content using a Hoechst dye (33258, Sigma) DNA assay. Hoechst dye (or bisbenzimide) has been shown to be useful for determining the quantity of DNA in cellular extracts (20Brunk C.F. Jones K.C. James T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The quantity of DNA per fibroblast was determined by collecting ∼5 × 106 cells from the monolayer culture on collagen and then resuspending and sonicating cells in 4 ml of DNA assay buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). The sample was then diluted 1:40 in DNA assay buffer to a total volume of 1 ml and combined with 50 μl of Hoechst dye. 100 μl of sample was transferred to a 96-well plate, and fluorescence was quantified on a fluorescent spectrophotometer (excitation wavelength, 365 nm; emission wavelength, 460 nm). Values were compared with the standard curve of known amounts of DNA. For release of fibroblasts from collagen gel culture, gels were transferred from media to 500 μl of 0.05% collagenase B (Roche Applied Science) in PBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with occasional mixing by inversion, cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of DNA assay buffer, and Hoechst dye DNA assay was carried out as described above. The Glycotechnology Core at the University of California, San Diego performed all steps of the disaccharide analysis. After complete digestion of GAG samples with either chondroitinase ABC or the combination of heparinase I, heparinase II, and heparitinase, the resulting disaccharides were purified by 10,000 MWCO Microcon centrifugal filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Analysis and separation of disaccharides were performed by using reverse phase ion pair chromatography (C18 TosoHaas ODS-120T column, 4-μm particle size) with post-column derivatization based on a method described previously (21Sakai S. Onose J. Nakamura H. Toyoda H. Toida T. Imanari T. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). BaF3/KGFR cells were washed in PBS three times prior to use to remove traces of IL-3. Cells were then transferred to 384-well plates at 5 × 103 per well in a final media volume of 25 μl with varying concentrations of GAG and/or human recombinant FGF-7 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in RPMI containing 10% FCS, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Purified dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B, Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA), molecular mass range of 11 to 25 kDa, at 3 μg/ml was used as a positive control. Cell proliferation was determined using the Cell Titer nonradioactive cell proliferation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) after incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Switch to 3D Culture Environment Induces Decorin Expression by Fibroblasts—DS is an abundant product of fibroblasts in the dermis, representing 0.3% of the dry weight of the skin (7Trowbridge J.M. Gallo R.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R117-R125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms that regulate DS and DSPG synthesis by fibroblasts, decorin expression by NIH3T3 cells, either cultured as a monolayer on type I collagen or in a 3D type I collagen gel, was evaluated. After 7 days of culture, fibroblast monolayers or sections of 3D collagen gels were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining with an antibody against decorin. Sections from 3D collagen gels showed increased staining for decorin compared with monolayer culture (Fig. 1A). Fluorescent staining of decorin in 3D culture formed a reticular pattern exemplifying the structure of the ECM in the collagen gel. To further evaluate and quantify the induction of decorin, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, after 7 days of either monolayer culture or 3D collagen gel culture, were extracted and partially purified by anion exchange chromatography to enrich for GAGs and PGs. These extracts were first analyzed by decorin immunoblot showing a dramatic increase in decorin expression from fibroblasts in the 3D culture environment compared with monolayer culture, where decorin was minimally detectable (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the relative expression of the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-1 was largely unaffected by culture architecture. Decorin was not detected in culture media from fibroblasts in monolayer culture (data not shown). Next, these extracts were analyzed by Western blot to evaluate the nature of GAGs on these PGs. Consistent with the immunofluorescence staining and dot blot analysis, no decorin was detected in extracts from monolayer culture, whereas decorin expression was abundant in extracts from 3D culture, appearing at a mass consistent with the decorin core protein at ∼48 kDa and a proteoglycan at ∼200 kDa (Fig. 1C). The smear seen for decorin represented heterogeneity in the length of its one dermatan sulfate GAG chains as digestion with chondroitinase ABC, which cleaves all chondroitin sulfate GAG chains to disaccharides, left only the core protein. Equivalent digestion with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 1, C and D) or chondroitinase B (Fig. 1D) confirmed that this CS GAG was DS. To determine whether the induction in decorin PG was accompanied by a change in transcription of the decorin core protein, fibroblasts cultured in 3D collagen gels were evaluated by quantitative real time PCR. Decorin gene transcription increased 40-fold over the first 48 h of 3D collagen gel culture and then plateaued (Fig. 2). Analysis of GAGs from Fibroblasts Switched to 3D Culture Environment—The amount, relative CS composition, and sulfation pattern of CS influences cellular behaviors in response to GAGs produced during development, coagulation, and wound repair (7Trowbridge J.M.

The total quantity of sulfated GAG synthesized by fibroblasts after 7 days of culture was measured and normalized to cell number. Total sulfated GAG per cell increased more than 2.5-fold in fibroblasts from 3D compared with monolayer culture (Table I). Analysis of disaccharide composition revealed that extracted sulfated GAGs had 7 or 21.5% CS in total GAG when coming from fibroblasts in monolayer or 3D culture, respectively. Sulfated GAG from fibroblasts also displayed a 4-fold increase in CS to HS ratio compared with total GAG from monolayer culture. Moreover, the switch to a 3D culture environment also influenced CS sulfation patterns. Percent 4-O-sulfated disaccharide in CS was decreased in 3D collagen gel culture associated with a large increase in unsulfated CS.Table IDisaccharide analysis of chondroitin sulfate GAG extracted from fibroblasts transferred to 3D culture environmentMonolayer3DTotal sulfated GAG/106 cells2.8 μg7.8 μg% 4-O-sulfated disaccharide in CS90%53%% 2,4-O-sulfated disaccharide in CS2.1%2.2%% 2-O-sulfated disaccharide in CSNDANDA4-O-sulfated/nonsulfated disaccharide ratio in CS34.11.32CS/HS ratio0.682.4 Open table in a new tab 3D Environment Stimulates Dermatan Sulfate GAG Chain Synthesis on Syndecan-1—Given that culturing fibroblasts in a 3D environment induced their expression of the DSPG, decorin, it seemed possible that levels of DS synthesis may be influenced on other PGs. The cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-1, usually considered a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, can contain both CS and HS GAG chains (25Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Endo E. Koda J. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11046-11052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of CS/HS GAG chains expressed on syndecan-1 has shown to be variable and influenced by external signals such as the presence of TGFβ (26Rapraeger A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2509-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, syndecan-1 appeared to be an appropriate candidate PG to study the influence of matrix architecture on PG GAG chain composition. Western blot analysis of extracts from fibroblast monolayer culture showed that in this environment syndecan-1 runs as one large band (Fig. 3A). This syndecan-1 was reduced to its protein core by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, which cleaves HS chains to oligosaccharides, suggesting that fibroblasts express syndecan-1 almost exclusively with HS chains in the monolayer environment. This was supported by the observation that digestion of syndecan-1 from monolayer fibroblasts with chondroitinase ABC did not alter the migration of the syndecan-1 band (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, syndecan-1 expressed by fibroblasts grown in 3D collagen gels ran as a smaller PG. This c"
https://openalex.org/W2020021386,"The amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a type I transmembrane molecule that undergoes several finely regulated cleavage events. The physiopathological relevance of AbetaPP derives from the fact that its aberrant processing strongly correlates with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal cell death, loss of synapses, and deposition of misfolded protein plaques in the brain; the main constituent of these plaques is the amyloid-beta peptide, a 40-42 amino-acid-long protein fragment derived by AbetaPP upon two sequential processing events. Mutations in the genes encoding for AbetaPP and some of the enzymes responsible for its processing are strongly associated with familial forms of early onset AD. Therefore, the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying AbetaPP metabolism appears crucial to understanding the basis for the onset of AD. Apart from Abeta, upon processing of AbetaPP other fragments are generated. The long extracellular domain is released in the extracellular space, whereas the short cytoplasmic tail, named AbetaPP intracellular domain (AID) is released intracellularly. AID appears be involved in several cellular processes, apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and transcriptional regulation. We have recently reported the cloning and characterization of different isoforms of AID associated protein-1 (AIDA-1), a novel AID-binding protein. Here we further analyzed the interaction between several AIDA-1 isoforms and the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. Our data demonstrated that the interaction between the two molecules is regulated by alternative splicing of the AIDA-1 proteins. Furthermore, we provide data supporting a possible function for AIDA-1a as a modulator of AbetaPP processing."
https://openalex.org/W1966045931,"JC virus (JCV) is a common human polyomavirus that infects over 70% of the population worldwide. JCV has a restricted cell tropism that is caused partly by the initial interaction between the virus and sialic acid-containing host cell receptors. To identify the molecular interactions between the virus and its cellular receptor, we used a combined approach of site-directed mutagenesis and homology-based molecular modeling. A model of the major viral capsid protein VP1 based on sequence alignment with other closely related polyomaviruses allowed us to target specific amino acids in the extracellular loops of VP1 for mutagenesis. An analysis of the growth rates of 17 point mutants led to the identification of VP1 amino acids that are critical in virus-host cell receptor interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations were then used to build and confirm a model of the interaction between VP1 and the sialic acid component of the JCV receptor.

JC virus (JCV) 1The abbreviations used are: JCV, JC virus; mPyV, murine polyomavirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: JCV, JC virus; mPyV, murine polyomavirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a small, non-enveloped human polyomavirus that causes the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is caused by JCV-induced lytic destruction of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells within the central nervous system. Although JCV is a very common virus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy only occurs in immunosuppressed individuals, and approximately 6% of AIDS patients will eventually develop the disease (1Hou J. Major E.O. J. Neurovirol. 2000; 6: 98-100PubMed Google Scholar). JCV has a very restricted cellular tropism and is efficiently replicated only in glial cells, although it can also infect B-cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and tonsillar stromal cells (2Monaco M.C. Atwood W.J. Gravell M. Tornatore C.S. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70 (M. G. C.): 7004-7012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JCV preferentially binds N-linked glycoproteins containing terminal α(2,6)-linked sialic acid, although the protein component of the cellular receptor has not been determined (3Liu C.K. Wei G. Atwood W.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Komagome R. Sawa H. Suzuki T. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Atwood W.J. Nagashima K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12992-13000Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The receptor for murine polyomavirus (mPyV) is known to contain α(2,3)-linked sialic acid, and the small plaque strain of mPyV also is able to bind branched α(2,6)-linked sialic acid (5Freund R. Garcea R.L. Sahli R. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 350-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike JCV and mPyV, the related polyomavirus SV40 does not bind sialic acid but instead uses major histocompatibility complex class I proteins as receptors (6Atwood W.J. Norkin L.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4474-4477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because both JCV and mPyV bind sialic acid (3Liu C.K. Wei G. Atwood W.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fried H. Cahan L. Paulson J. Virology. 1981; 109: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Cahan L.D. Singh R. Paulson J.C. Virology. 1983; 130: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we used the information obtained from the crystal structure of the mPyV VP1 pentamer in complex with a branched disialylated hexasaccharide receptor fragment to identify analogous amino acids on JCV VP1. A model was then developed using the crystal structures of mPyV and SV40 (9Liddington R. Yan Y. Moulai J. Sahli R. Benjamin T. Harrison S. Nature. 1991; 354: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 10Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C.

Using this JCV VP1-sialic acid model, several residues putatively involved in sialic acid binding were identified and experimentally examined using site-directed mutagenesis. Our data demonstrate that the sialic acid binding pocket on JCV VP1 lies in a deep groove formed by the HI and BC loops. The orientation of this binding pocket explains the ability of the virus to interact with straight chain α(2,6)-linked sialic acids but not with branched oligosaccharides or α(2,3)-linked sialic acids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHomology Modeling of VP1—A homology model of JCV VP1 was built using SWISS-MODEL and the structures of other polyomavirus proteins within the Protein Data Bank. The C terminus of JCV (residues 290-354) that facilitates capsid formation was not included in the homology model. The model of the sialic acid-JCV complex was created using the crystal structure of the recombinant polyomavirus VP1 complexed with a branched disialylated hexasaccharide receptor (Protein Data Bank entry 1VPS). The JCV homology model was superimposed onto VP1, and the branched sugar from the crystal structure was replaced with NeuNAc-(α2,6)-Gal-(β1,3)-GlcNAc, a sialyloligosaccharide with terminal α(2,6)-linked sialic acid (see Fig. 5a), given the important role of this carbohydrate in binding to JCV (3Liu C.K. Wei G. Atwood W.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Computer Simulations of the Sialic Acid-JCV Complex—The homology-based JCV VP1-sugar complex was subjected to several cycles of energy minimization to remove initial strain, using the AMBER force field within the InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) program. The complex was then placed centrally in a cube of 12 nm and soaked with water (37,700 water molecules), and energy was minimized using a steepest descent algorithm. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations (at 300 K, with an integration time step of 2 fs and a constant pressure of 1 bar) were carried out with the complex using the GROMACS program (15Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Buren R. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 95: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7001) Google Scholar) operating on Pentium III processors, running Linux software. Each of the mutations that were examined experimentally in this study was introduced, and additional energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. To generate alternative topologies of the sugar binding distance, restraints were applied between charged amino acids of JCV and atoms of the sugar (e.g. among the complexes Arg-75-GlcNAc, Arg-56-NeuNAc, and Arg-273-NeuNAc) during the molecular dynamics simulations. Large force constants (5000 kJ mol-1 nm-1) were initially applied to induce structural changes and were then reduced during the remainder of the simulation.Cells, Virus, and Plasmid—The SVG-A cell line is a subclone of the original SVG cell line established by the transformation of primary human fetal glial cells with an origin-defective SV40 mutant (16Major E.O.

Cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Mediatech) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (HyClone) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. JC12, a subclone of the Mad1-SVEΔ hybrid strain of JCV described previously (17Vacante D.A. Traub R. Major E.O. Virology. 1989; 170: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was linearized at the BamHI site and subcloned into the pUC19 vector for propagation of viral DNA in bacteria.Transfection—The viral DNA was isolated from plasmid DNA by endonuclease digestion with BamHI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and purified using the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega). Linear viral DNA was transfected into SVG-A cells grown on coverslips or in 75-cm2 flasks by lipofection using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen) and Plus™ (Invitrogen) reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions.

Mismatched nucleotides are shown in uppercase letters. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing plasmid DNA isolated from transformants. All sequencing was performed by either the Brown University Sequencing Core Facility or the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Research Laboratory at Yale University. Sequencing reactions from the Brown University facility contained 0.5 μg of DNA and 3.2 pmol of primer in a volume of 10 μl of water. Sequencing reactions from the Yale laboratory contained 0.6 μg of DNA and 2 μl of 4 μm primer in a volume of 24 μl of water. The sequencing primers were JC1468 (5′-atggccccaacaaaaagaaaag-3′), which was used to sequence mutations made on the region that codes for the BC loop, and JCV1982 (5′-ccaaagaatgccacagtgcaatc-3′), which was used to sequence mutations made on the region that codes for the HI loop.Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay—Cells grown on coverslips were washed in PBS and fixed for 10 min in acetone. The cells were incubated with the anti-V antigen monoclonal antibody PAB597 (undiluted hybridoma supernatant) for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa-Fluor-488-labeled goat antimouse secondary antibody for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were again washed three times with PBS, counterstained with PBS containing 0.02% Evan's Blue, and washed again in PBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides and visualized on a Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscope, and images were captured by a Hamamatsu digital camera and processed in Photoshop. Positively stained JCV-infected cells were counted every 3 days starting on the fourth day following transfection to generate a growth curve and to determine the ability of transfected viral DNA to produce viable virus.Electron Microscopy—Four days after transfection, SVG-A cells transfected with linear viral DNA grown on Lab-Tek chamber slides were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 m sodium cacodylate buffer. Cells were rinsed in buffer, scraped from slides, and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 40 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, cells were rinsed several times with buffer. A cell pellet was prepared in which filtered fetal bovine serum was mixed with the cells. To bind the pellet together, the cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was replaced with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and allowed to fix for several days. The pellet was then rinsed, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, infiltrated, and embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin. Using a Reichert Ultracut S microtome, ultrathin sections were prepared and placed on 300 mesh, thin bar copper grids. The sections were stained with 5% uranyl acetate in methanol followed by lead citrate. These sections were examined using a Philips 300 electron microscope.RESULTSJCV VP1 Model Based on Sequence Alignment—Based on the sequence alignment of VP1 with other polyomaviruses, we created a model of a JCV VP1 monomer using the SWISS-MODEL protein modeling server (Fig. 1) (12Guex N.

We then used the crystal structure of mPyV in complex with a sialic acid receptor fragment as a guide to identify homologous amino acids on the JCV VP1 surface that were involved in binding sialic acid. To verify whether these amino acids were critical for the receptor binding pocket of JCV VP1, we made several single amino acid point mutations in the JCV sequence at Arg-56, Gly-57, Lys-60, Asp-66, Glu-69, Asp-71, Arg-75, and Asp-76 on the BC loop, as well as Arg-266 and Arg-273 on the DE loop (Fig. 1). The mutated linear DNA was then transfected into the human glial cell line SVG-A to produce virus that could be evaluated in comparison with the wild type.Fig. 1The predicted JCV VP1 monomer structure from the SWISS-MODEL protein structure homology-modeling server. The BC loop is dark blue, and the BC1 and BC2 portions are labeled. Side chains that are shown for the mutated amino acids on the BC1 and BC2 loops are also dark blue (Arg-56, Gly-57, Lys-60, Asp-66, Glu-69, Asp-71, Arg-75, and Asp-76). The HI loop is purple, and side chains shown for the mutated amino acids on this loop are also purple (Arg-266 and Arg-273). DE and EF loops are also labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression and Nuclear Localization of Wild Type and Mutant VP1—SVG-A cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with either wild type or mutant linear DNA. Following transfection of viral DNA with mutations coding for alanine, glycine, or arginine substitutions at Arg-56, Gly-57, Lys-60, Asp-66, Glu-69, Asp-71, Arg-75, Asp-76, Arg-266, and Arg-273, VP1 expression and cellular localization were examined. Neither conservative nor non-conservative substitutions at the RG motif at positions 56 and 57 disrupted normal localization of VP1 to the nucleus (Fig. 2, b-d). Likewise, replacing the uncharged Gly at amino acid 57 with a positively charged Arg (Fig. 2e) did not disrupt VP1 expression or localization. Other non-conservative mutations were made by substituting the positively charged residues with uncharged amino acids in the K60G, K60A, R75G, R75A, R266G, and R273A mutants (Fig. 2, f, g, n, o, q, and r, respectively) and by replacing the negatively charged amino acids with uncharged glycine or alanine residues in the Asp-66, Glu-69, Asp-71, and Asp-76 mutants (Fig. 2, h-m and p). Viral protein produced in each of these mutants localized to the nucleus in the same manner as wild type JCV VP1 (Fig. 2a). The identification of mutant VP1 molecules in the nucleus indicates that the mutations did not disrupt the normal targeting and expression of viral protein to the site where viral assembly occurs.Fig. 2Mutations in the JCV VP1 DNA sequence did not interfere with normal expression and nuclear localization of mutant VP1 in SVG-A cells. Nuclear V antigen staining is shown for cells transfected with wild type (wt) JCV VP1 DNA (a) and for cells transfected with mutant constructs that resulted in the production of virus with mutations on the BC loop (R56G, R56A, R56K, G57R, K60G, K60A, D66G, D66A, E69G, E69A, D71G, D71A, R75G, R75A, and D76A) (b-p) and on the HI loop (R266G and R273A) (q-r).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Infectivity and Growth of Mutant Viruses—To determine whether the transfection of mutated viral DNA could result in the production of viable virus, we monitored the spread of V antigen-positive cells in culture over time and measured viral growth based on the average number of infected cells/microscopic field at each time point (Fig. 3). Mutations that interfere with the ability of the virus to reinfect cells in culture result in an abortive infection that is evident 7-10 days after transfection. We found that the R56G, R56A, G57R, D66G, D71G, D71A, R75G, R75A, and R273A mutant viruses all failed to propagate (Fig. 3). The mutants D66A and E69A propagated more slowly in culture than did the wild type, with fewer infected nuclei at each time point, resulting, on average, in approximately half as many infected cells by day 13 (Fig. 3). The R56K, D76G, K60G, K60A, E69G, and R266G mutants all propagated at a rate that was similar to wild type JCV (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The ability of wild type and mutant virus to infect cells and spread in culture was determined by scoring the accumulation of V antigen-positive cells following transfection of viral DNA. A growth curve was generated for wild type JCV and each mutant virus based on the average number of V antigen-positive cells/200 cells counted. Cells transfected with both wild type and mutant viral DNA expressed V antigen by day 4 after transfection. Mutations that interfered with the ability of the virus to initiate subsequent rounds of infection expressed V antigen only transiently and only in a small percentage of cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mutations in External VP1 Loops Do Not Interfere with the Ability of Virus to Encapsidate DNA—To rule out the possibility that non-viable mutants were defective in viral assembly, we used electron microscopy to visualize assembled virus in the nuclei of cells transfected with wild type and mutant linear viral DNA. We used the non-viable R56G mutant to compare with the wild type virus because it represents the most drastic change in the side chain and is most likely to result in misfolded VP1. We found that after transfection of both the wild type and R56G linear DNA, virus was assembled in the nucleus of SVG-A cells (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Wild type and mutant virus are assembled in the nucleus of SVG-A cells. Electron microscopy was used to visualize assembled virions (arrowheads) in SVG-A cells 96 h after transfection with linear (a) wild type (b) and R56G DNA.

Extensive molecular modeling of the JCV VP1-sialic acid interactions was then carried out using the data from our mutagenesis studies. To model the interaction, we used the sialyloligosaccharide NeuNAc-(α2,6)-Gal-(β1,3)-GlcNAc because terminal α(2,6)-linked sialyloligosaccharide is known to be an essential component of the receptor that JCV uses on cells (3Liu C.K. Wei G. Atwood W.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can bind JCV with higher affinity than other linkages of sialic acid (4Komagome R. Sawa H. Suzuki T. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Atwood W.J. Nagashima K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12992-13000Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The model resulting from the simulations of the JCV complex reflects many of the same sialic acid-protein interactions seen in the interactions between mPyV VP1 and NeuNAc-1 in the solved crystal structure of the mPyV VP1 pentamer with a disialylated hexasaccharide receptor fragment (11Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5139-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The binding pocket of the NeuNAc ring is illustrated in Fig. 5b. Because of the conserved nature of the RG motif between JCV and mPyV on the BC loop and its importance to mPyV in sialic acid binding (5Freund R. Garcea R.L. Sahli R. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 350-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the RG motif was initially suspected to have a similar role for JCV. The positions of these residues (Arg-56 and Gly-57) in relation to the sugar in our model, however, indicate an alternative orientation for the JCV VP1-sialic acid interaction. As shown in Fig. 5c, the BC loop creates a binding pocket because the BC1 and BC2 loops are oriented in a “boat” shape relative to each other. In our model, the amino acid Gly-57 resides at the point of the “twist” between the BC1/BC2 loops and faces toward the JCV core. Substitution of Gly-57 with a long, bulky arginine side chain would hinder the bend of the BC loop at this position (without a steric clash with other side chains of the virus), in accordance with our biological results (Fig. 3). The arginine in the RG motif is most likely important in binding the sugar. Although the conservative R56K mutant grows almost as well as wild type virus, both the R56G and R56A mutants are non-viable. Within the model (Fig. 5c), the positively charged Arg-56 creates a salt bridge with the carboxylate group (O1B) of sialic acid, stabilizing the negative charge of the bound sugar molecule. Consequently, removing the positive charge at position 56 would destabilize the energetically favorable conformation of sialic acid within the binding groove of JCV and result in virus that is able to assemble properly but is unable to bind the cellular receptor and initiate another round of infection.The opposite side of the binding groove is provided by the HI loop. The model suggests a number of interactions for Arg-273 and may explain the non-viability of the R273A mutant. The charged Arg-273 forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl oxygen on C7 (Fig. 5a) of NeuNAc and the carbonyl group of Gln-271 (not shown). The side chain of Arg-273 stabilizes a hydrophobic pocket with Leu-118 at the base of the DE loop, whereas the guanidyl moiety provides charge-ring interaction with the aromatic ring of the phenylalanine at position 263 (Phe-263). Our data indicate that the mutation of Arg-75, located on the BC2 loop, results in non-viable virus and that this residue is presumably involved in the recognition of sialic acid. In the resulting model, the positively charged Arg-75 is within 4 Å from the terminal oxygen on C6 (O-6) of the GlcNAc group. We would predict a salt bridge between Arg-75 and Asp-76 (Fig. 5c), although it is obviously not vital for sialic binding because the D76G mutant displayed only a slight retardation in viral growth (Fig. 3). According to the model, no direct intermolecular contacts are evident between Asp-76 and the GlcNAc ring because the side chain of the negatively charged aspartic acid faces away from the sugar.Based on the homology model developed here, residues Asp-66, Glu-69, and Asp-71 at the end of the BC2 loop do not appear to be directly involved in binding of α(2,6)-linked sialic acid. Indeed, given their negative charge, these residues would not be expected to be in close proximity to the like-charged sialic acid. The slightly retarded growth rates for D66A, E69A, E69G, D71A, and D71G (Fig. 3) may therefore be indicative of important structural roles for these amino acids and may possibly enhance solubility or surface exposure. The homology model also provides some suggestions for the higher affinity for terminal α(2,6)-linked sialic acid over affinities for branched α(2,6) or α(2,3)-linked sialic acid. The terminal α(2,6) linkage of sialic acid bends the overall sugar structure (Fig. 5a), allowing the negatively charged sialic acid to enter deeply into the binding groove and come into contact with Arg-273 (Fig. 5). A branched α(2,6)-linked sialic acid from C6 of the GlcNAc group would be sterically hindered by the conformation of the BC2 loop (Fig. 5c), providing an explanation for the preferential binding of JCV VP1 to terminal rather than branched sialic acid. Likewise, because the side of the binding groove provided by the HI loop would directly interfere with the NeuNAc ring linked to C3 of the galactose ring in α(2,3)-linked sialic acid, the model also illustrates why JCV has a binding affinity that is stronger for the α(2,6) linkage than the α(2,3)-linked sialic acid.The work described here has given us a better understanding of the nature of the role of sialic acid in binding JCV and helps to explain why terminal α(2,6)-linked sialic acid is an essential part of the JCV cellular receptor. In addition, the model of the interaction between VP1 and sialic acid has important implications in the design of drugs and small molecule inhibitors used to treat progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. We are currently performing additional experiments to confirm and further refine the model presented here. JC virus (JCV) 1The abbreviations used are: JCV, JC virus; mPyV, murine polyomavirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: JCV, JC virus; mPyV, murine polyomavirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a small, non-enveloped human polyomavirus that causes the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is caused by JCV-induced lytic destruction of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells within the central nervous system. Although JCV is a very common virus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy only occurs in immunosuppressed individuals, and approximately 6% of AIDS patients will eventually develop the disease (1Hou J. Major E.O. J. Neurovirol. 2000; 6: 98-100PubMed Google Scholar). JCV has a very restricted cellular tropism and is efficiently replicated only in glial cells, although it can also infect B-cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and tonsillar stromal cells (2Monaco M.C. Atwood W.J. Gravell M. Tornatore C.S. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70 (M. G. C.): 7004-7012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JCV preferentially binds N-linked glycoproteins containing terminal α(2,6)-linked sialic acid, although the protein component of the cellular receptor has not been determined (3Liu C.K. Wei G. Atwood W.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Komagome R. Sawa H. Suzuki T. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Atwood W.J. Nagashima K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12992-13000Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The receptor for murine polyomavirus (mPyV) is known to contain α(2,3)-linked sialic acid, and the small plaque strain of mPyV also is able to bind branched α(2,6)-linked sialic acid (5Freund R. Garcea R.L. Sahli R. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 350-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike JCV and mPyV, the related polyomavirus SV40 does not bind sialic acid but instead uses major histocompatibility complex class I proteins as receptors (6Atwood W.J. Norkin L.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4474-4477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because both JCV and mPyV bind sialic acid (3Liu C.K. Wei G. Atwood W.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fried H. Cahan L. Paulson J. Virology. 1981; 109: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Cahan L.D. Singh R. Paulson J.C. Virology. 1983; 130: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we used the information obtained from the crystal structure of the mPyV VP1 pentamer in complex with a branched disialylated hexasaccharide receptor fragment to identify analogous amino acids on JCV VP1. A model was then developed using the crystal structures of mPyV and SV40 (9Liddington R. Yan Y. Moulai J. Sahli R. Benjamin T. Harrison S. Nature. 1991; 354: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 10Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C.

Using this JCV VP1-sialic acid model, several residues putatively involved in sialic acid binding were identified and experimentally examined using site-directed mutagenesis. Our data demonstrate that the sialic acid binding pocket on JCV VP1 lies in a deep groove formed by the HI and BC loops. The orientation of this binding pocket explains the ability of the virus to interact with straight chain α(2,6)-linked sialic acids but not with branched oligosaccharides or α(2,3)-linked sialic acids. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHomology Modeling of VP1—A homology model of JCV VP1 was built using SWISS-MODEL and the structures of other polyomavirus proteins within the Protein Data Bank. The C terminus of JCV (residues 290-354) that facilitates capsid formation was not included in the homology model. The model of the sialic acid-JCV complex was created using the crystal structure of the recombinant polyomavirus VP1 complexed with a branched disialylated hexasaccharide receptor (Protein Data Bank entry 1VPS). The JCV homology model was superimposed onto VP1, and the branched sugar from the crystal structure was replaced with NeuNAc-(α2,6)-Gal-(β1,3)-GlcNAc, a sialyloligosaccharide with terminal α(2,6)-linked sialic acid (see Fig. 5a), given the important role of this carbohydrate in binding to JCV (3Liu C.K.

https://openalex.org/W2065805006,"We have recently reported that interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-2, which signal through IL-2Rβγ, oppositely regulate expression of the proinflammatory chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Here we delineate molecular mechanisms responsible for this paradox. By using a luciferase reporter plasmid, we identified a 433-bp region spanning the major transcriptional start point of human CX3CR1 that, when expressed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), possessed strong constitutive promoter activity. IL-2 and IL-15 treatment increased and abolished this activity, respectively, mimicking their effects on endogenous CX3CR1. IL-2 and IL-15 have been reported to also have opposite effects on the immunoregulatory transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), and the 433-bp region contains a κB-like NFAT site. The effects of IL-15 and IL-2 on both CX3CR1 reporter activity and endogenous CX3CR1 transcription in PBMCs were abolished by the NFAT inhibitors cyclosporin A and VIVIT. Moreover, mutation of the κB-like NFAT sequence markedly attenuated IL-2 and IL-15 modulation of CX3CR1 promoter-reporter activity in PBMCs. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that IL-15 promoted specific recruitment of NFAT1 but not NFAT2 to the CX3CR1 promoter, whereas IL-2 had the converse effect. This appears to be relevant in vivo because mouse CX3CR1 mRNA was expressed in both PBMCs and splenocytes from NFAT1–/– mice injected with recombinant IL-15 but was undetectable in cells from IL-15-injected NFAT1+/+ BALB/c mice; as predicted, IL-2 up-regulated cx3cr1 in both mouse strains to a similar extent. Thus, by pharmacologic, genetic, and biochemical criteria in vitro and in vivo, our results suggest that IL-15 and IL-2 oppositely regulate CX3CR1 gene expression by differentially recruiting NFAT1 and NFAT2 to a κB-like NFAT site within the CX3CR1 promoter. We propose that expression of CX3CR1 and possibly other immunoregulatory genes may be determined in part by the balance of NFAT1 and NFAT2 activity in leukocytes.

These studies imply that the risk of acquiring certain immunologically mediated/inflammatory diseases may depend in part on the level of leukocyte CX3CR1 expression and that blocking or down-modulating the receptor with drugs or biologics may be an effective treatment strategy in specific settings. In this regard, several recombinant cytokines, including TGF-β1 (27Chen S. Luo D. Streit W.J. Harrison J.K. J. Neuroimmunol. 2002; 133: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), IL-2, and IL-15 (28Barlic J. Sechler J.M. Murphy P.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), have been reported to modulate CX3CR1 expression. Of these IL-2 and IL-15 are particularly interesting because work in mouse, both in vitro and in vivo, has indicated that they have opposite effects on CX3CR1 expression, with IL-2 increasing it and IL-15 decreasing it (28Barlic J. Sechler J.M. Murphy P.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), despite the fact that both cytokines share the same receptor signaling chains, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγc (29Waldmann T.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 2002; 22: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The same pattern has been observed with human peripheral blood lymphocytes and NK cells in vitro (30Hanna J. Wald O. Goldman-Wohl D. Prus D. Markel G. Gazit R. Katz G. Haimov-Kochman R. Fujii N. Yagel S. Peled A. Mandelboim O. Blood. 2003; 102: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). 2Sechler, J.

IL-2 and IL-15 also have quite distinct immunological functions. IL-15 plays a central role in the development and maintenance of NK cells, NK-T cells, TCRδ+ lymphocytes, and memory T cells, as well as in the functional maturation of dendritic cells and macrophages (29Waldmann T.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 2002; 22: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Waldmann T. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4 (Suppl. 3): 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Fehniger T.A.

Negative regulation of CX3CR1 and potentially other chemokine receptors by IL-15 may be desirable in the setting of inflammatory disease but is undesirable in the setting of cell immunotherapy, for which IL-15 is being considered as an ex vivo NK cell growth factor for application in diseases such as cancer (33Fehniger T.A.

IL-2 has for many years been used ex vivo to expand NK cells from PBMCs or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes for adoptive immunotherapy of cancer (40Fehniger T.A. Caligiuri M.A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 503-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with limited success, possibly for a similar reason (41Kershaw M.H. Wang G. Westwood J.A. Pachynski R.K. Tiffany H.L.

Science. 2002; 298: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). How these γc cytokines stimulate distinct physiologic and pharmacologic responses through the same receptors is an interesting and unresolved question in immune cell signaling that could lead to new therapeutic targets (29Waldmann T.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 2002; 22: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Waldmann T. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4 (Suppl. 3): 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both cytokines are known to activate the AKT pathway, the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and Jak-dependent pathways leading to STAT-3 and STAT-5 transcription factor activation (29Waldmann T.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 2002; 22: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, they have opposing effects on the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (43Eicher D.M. Cell. Immunol. 2003; 223: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), a transcription factor implicated in transactivation of numerous immunomodulatory genes in leukocytes, including the chemokine genes CXCL8 and CCL3 (44Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 45Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). As with CX3CR1, IL-15 decreases NFAT activity, and IL-2 increases it (43Eicher D.M. Cell. Immunol. 2003; 223: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which suggested to us that these effects may be connected mechanistically. It is important to note that the NFAT family has five members (45Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Most studies of NFAT1–4, the four immunologically relevant NFAT subtypes, have suggested that there is broad overlap and redundancy in their activities. NFAT1 and NFAT2 are the major subtypes expressed in T lymphocytes, and their relative abundance varies depending on the T cell subset in question. The specificity of IL-2 and IL-15 for activation of these various forms has not been investigated previously. Here we present pharmacologic, genetic, and biochemical evidence in vitro and in vivo that supports the hypothesis that IL-15 and IL-2 oppositely regulate CX3CR1 expression by differentially recruiting NFAT1 and NFAT2 specifically to an NFAT site in the CX3CR1 promoter. Materials—Human recombinant IL-2 and IL-15 were from Roche Diagnostics and PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ), respectively. Phycoerythrin-conjugated mAbs directed against human CD4, CD8, CD56, and CD14 and phycoerythrin-conjugated isotype-matched control mAbs were from Pharmingen. Mouse mAbs recognizing rat, mouse, and human NFAT1 and NFAT2 were from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Rabbit polyclonal Ab specifically recognizing phosphorylated serine residues was from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The human pro-monocytic cell line U937 and RPMI 1640 culture medium were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cyclosporin A (CsA) and the 16-amino acid peptide MAGPHPVIVITGPHEE, commonly known as “VIVIT,” were from Calbiochem. Restriction endonucleases MluI and XhoI were obtained from Fermentas Inc. (Hanover, MD). Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—A 1278-bp fragment from nt 39,247,004 to 39,248,282 (NCBI Human Genome, build 34 version 3) of chromosome 3p21.3 was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA using the 5′ primer 5′-CGACGCGTAGAAAACTGCTGGTGGACTTCTTCCA and the 3′ primer 5′-CCTCGAGCCCACAGGTACCCAACTAGTCC. Cleavage sites for restriction enzymes MluI and XhoI were included in the primers (underlined sequences) to facilitate directional cloning into the corresponding sites of the promoterless firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The insert sequence of the resulting plasmid, named p1278-luc, was identical to the sequence found in NCBI, GenBank™ accession number AY016370. This 1278-bp gene region is located 13,422 bp upstream of the start of the CX3CR1 open reading frame (ORF) and was selected for analysis because we conducted an in silico analysis of all the available 5′-expressed sequence tags and mRNA sequences, and we determined this to be the likely site of the main promoter used in leukocytes. In the course of this work, two groups published slightly different versions of the genomic organization of CX3CR1 (46Garin A. Pellet P. Deterre P. Debre P. Combadiere C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47DeVries M.E. Cao H. Wang J. Xu L. Kelvin A.A. Ran L. Chau L.A. Madrenas J. Hegele R.A. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11985-11994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), both of which noted the location of a functional promoter within this 1278-bp region (Fig. 1). A library of pGL3 plasmids containing portions of the 1278-bp fragment truncated at the 5′ end was created by PCR using the 5′ primers 5′-CGACGCGTTAATGAAGGTGTATTGAAGGCCACA, 5′-CGACGCGTAGATATAGGGCAGGGCTTGAGGTGC, 5′-CGACGCGTCCCATGAGCTCTCCCAGCTTCCTGAA, and 5′-CGACGCGTCGCAGTCTTCCCTGAGGTTTAGATCT, paired with the same 3′ primer used to clone the parent 1278-bp fragment. Each 5′ primer contained a nested MluI site to facilitate cloning (underlined sequence). The resulting plasmids were named p1043-luc, p572-luc, p433-luc, and p287-luc according to the number of bp of the CX3CR1 promoter region that they contained. The 1278-bp sequence was analyzed by the TRANSFAC version 4.0 transcription factor data base (www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess) for potential transcription factor binding sites. An NFAT site located between nt –298 and –291 of this gene region was scrambled (boldface/underlined sequence) using the mutagenesis primers: 5′-GCTCTCCCAGCTTCCTGAATCGCGCCCATTAATGAGAGCTGATGT and 5′-ACAGTCAGCTCATATGGGGCGCGATTCAGGAAGCTGGGAGAGC and the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting mutated pGL3-luciferase plasmid was named p433*-luc. Cell Transfection—A nucleofector, a cell line nucleofector kit V, and a Human T cell nucleofection kit were purchased from Amaxa Biosystems (Cologne, Germany). Heparinized whole blood from healthy human donors was separated at room temperature by centrifugation at 1600 rpm for 30 min using lymphocyte separation medium (Cellgro, Mediatech Inc., Kansas City, MO). The intermediate layer containing lymphocytes and monocytes was harvested, washed once with PBS (Cambrex Bioscience Inc., Walkersville, MD), and resuspended in an equal volume of nucleofection solution containing a proprietary supplement from the human T cell nucleofector kit. Cell line nucleofector kit V was used for transfection of the human promonocytic cell line U937. 1 × 106 U937 cells and 1 × 106 PBMCs were incubated with 1.5 μg of CX3CR1 promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmids or control plasmids (pGL3-luc, which contains the SV40 promoter was used as a positive control, and promoterless pGL3-Basic was used as a negative control) plus 0.25 μg of a Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid in a total volume of 100 μl of the appropriately supplemented nucleofection solution, and were then nucleofected according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following the procedure, the cells were immediately resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 prewarmed to 37 °C and supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. 24 h after transfection, cell viability was examined, and the cells were incubated with various concentrations of cytokines and inhibitors at 37 °C for 12 h. All conditions were tested in triplicate. Luciferase Assay—CX3CR1 promoter activity was measured by the dual-luciferase reporter assay system from Promega (Madison, WI), which has been designed to allow both firefly luciferase reporter and the transfection control Renilla luciferase reporter to yield linear assays with high sensitivities and no endogenous activity of either reporter in experimental host cells. Briefly, transfected cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1400 rpm, and supernatants were removed. Passive lysis buffer was added to the pellet which was lysed by passage 4 times through a 19-gauge needle. Cell lysates were cleared by a brief centrifugation at 5000 rpm, and supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube. A stabilized luminescent signal generated by firefly luciferase in 20 μl of cell lysate was detected immediately upon addition of 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent II and measured on a manual TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). After quantifying the firefly luciferase luminescence, this reaction was quenched, and the Renilla luciferase reaction was initiated upon addition of 100 μl of Stop and Glo Reagent, which produced a stabilized Renilla luciferase signal. Promoter activity is expressed as the adjusted luciferase intensity in relative light units (rlu), which is calculated as follows: firefly Luc × (Renilla Luc/Renilla Lucmax), where Luc denotes luciferase luminescence. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 human PBMCs after culture under various conditions for 12 h using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was also isolated from 0.5 × 106 mouse PBMCs and splenocytes using the same technique. Prior to reverse transcription, RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (1 μg) was used for the synthesis of cDNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System from Invitrogen in the presence of 40 units/μl recombinant RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). Reverse transcription was performed for 120 min at 37 °C and stopped by heating the samples for 10 min at 72 °C. Unique primer sets for human β-actin, human and mouse CX3CR1, and mouse β2-microglobulin were designed, based on sequences deposited with the NCBI, and were synthesized by Invitrogen. PCR was performed using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase with the GeneAmp PCR Gold buffer system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR conditions for human β-actin and CX3CR1 were as follows: 95 °C for 9 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 45 s at 57 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR conditions for mouse β2-microglobulin and mouse cx3cr1 were as follows: 95 °C for 9 min, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 45 s at 61 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR conditions were optimized to allow for semi-quantitative comparison of the results. The plateau for amplification of human CX3CR1 mRNA was 35 cycles; however, maximum amplification of mouse cx3cr1 message was reached at 38 cycles. Expected sizes of the amplified PCR products were 500 bp for β-actin, 310 bp for human CX3CR1, 220 bp for β2-microglobulin, and 410 bp for mouse cx3cr1. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Transcription factors regulated by IL-15 and IL-2 that interact with the CX3CR1 promoter in vivo were determined by using a kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) according to the methods recommended by the manufacturer. Stimulated PBMCs were fixed in 37% formaldehyde, disrupted by Dounce homogenization on ice in a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors supplied by the manufacturer. Cellular DNA was sheared using a Branson Sonifier 450 sonicator (Pierce) with a 3-mm stepped microtip at 25% power, 10 pulses of 5 s each, and 30 s of rest on ice. Precleared chromatin, referred to as input DNA (500 ng), was immunoprecipitated by using 4 μg of mAbs directed against NFAT1 or NFAT2, an isotype control mouse IgG1, or 1.5 μg of polyclonal rabbit TFIIB Ab (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was removed from the immunoprecipitate by incubation with RNase A. DNA-binding proteins were removed by treatment with proteinase K, and the DNA was then purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction (25:24:1; Sigma). To detect whether the 433-bp region of the CX3CR1 promoter coimmunoprecipitated with NFAT1 and NFAT2, DNA purified from immunoprecipitates was amplified by PCR using human CX3CR1 promoter-specific primers: 5′-ATGAGCTCTCCCAGCTTCCT and 5′-ATCTTTAGATGCTGCCACAGG. These primers amplify a 244-bp fragment containing the NFAT site of interest. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The appropriate number of cycles was determined empirically by monitoring the amplification efficiency of the input and immunoprecipitated DNA at 25, 27, 30, 35, and 40 cycles. The plateau stage for amplification of immunoprecipitated DNA was 40 cycles and for the input DNA was 35 cycles. As recommended by the manufac"
https://openalex.org/W2069472030,"The NPC1 protein is a multipass transmembrane protein whose deficiency causes the autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C1. NPC1 localizes predominantly to late endosomes and has a dileucine motif located within a small cytoplasmic tail thought to target the protein to this location. Our data have suggested previously that the protein can reach its correct location in the absence of its cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that other signals contribute to NPC1 targeting. By using various FLAG-tagged and CD32-NPC1 chimeric fusion constructs, we show that multiple signals are responsible for the trafficking of NPC1 to the endosomal compartment, including the dileucine motif and a previously unidentified signal residing within the putative sterol-sensing domain transmembrane domain 3. Neither region alone was capable of directing heterologous CD32 fusions to late endosomes exclusively via the trans-Golgi network to the late endosome route taken by wild-type NPC1; transmembrane domain 3 was unable to maintain CD32 in late endosomes, indicating that two or more signals work in concert to target and retain NPC1 in this compartment. In addition we confirm that the tail dileucine motif is not essential for NPC1 targeting to late endosomes, and we discuss the implications of this finding along with the previously unappreciated role for transmembrane domain 3 in NPC1 localization and function.

For transport of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes, the most common signals are tyrosine and dileucine-based motifs (4Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J.

The tyrosine-based signals are generally in the form of YXXΦ, where X and Φ are bulky and hydrophobic amino acids, respectively. Dileucine motifs are more flexible, because a substitution of one leucine by isoleucine, methionine, or valine does not result in a loss of signal efficiency (7Ogata S. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

The disease-causing gene, NPC1, encodes a multitransmembrane protein that resides primarily in late endosomes and transiently associates with lysosomes and the TGN (12Higgins M.E. Davies J.P.

A. 1999; 96: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A more recent study, however, has demonstrated that the NPC1 protein is capable of correcting the NPC1 phenotype even when devoid of the 27-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (14Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These conflicting reports raise questions about the mechanism underlying the targeting of NPC1 to its correct subcellular location.In this study, a series of FLAG-tagged NPC1 proteins with progressive truncations or specific mutations in their cytoplasmic tail were used to examine the role of the cytoplasmic tail in NPC1 trafficking to late endosomes. In addition, fusions of various NPC1 domains to a CD32 reporter were utilized to confirm their role in the targeting of the NPC1 protein. The data presented here demonstrate that multiple signals are involved in correctly directing NPC1 to late endosomes. We show that a C-terminal acidic sequence is required for efficient exit of NPC1 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and we investigate the possibility that the tail dileucine is a plasma membrane retrieval signal involved in recovering mislocalized NPC1 rather than a late endosome targeting signal. Our studies also reveal the presence of important targeting information within the NPC1 sterol-sensing domain, transmembrane domain 3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry on a 380B DNA Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Radioactive isotopes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Plasmid Construction—All molecular biological manipulations were performed according to standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Vector constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion, PCR, and dideoxynucleotide sequencing using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).NPC1-FLAG—An NPC1 cDNA construct was engineered to contain a FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) at the unique ClaI restriction endonuclease site of the NPC1 cDNA (14Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This pGEM-NPC1-ClaF construct was digested with BglII followed by partial digestion with MscI and then ligated with the mutated NPC1 tails. The NPC1-ClaF-tail cDNAs were removed from pGEM3zf(+) by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into the mammalian expression vector, pAsc9 (12Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Plasmids were confirmed by digestion, and the mutations were reconfirmed by sequencing.CD32-Lamp2—A chimeric cDNA, CD32-LAMP2, was generated by PCR using the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human IgG Fc γ receptor II (12Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), using sense and antisense primers (5′-GCGAATTCTTCTGGGATGGCTATGGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCCTAAAATTGCTCATATCCAGCATGATGGTGCTTGAGGTAGATCAAGGCCACTACAGCA-3′, respectively). The antisense primer contains the 12-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of Lamp2. The CD32-LAMP2 fusion cDNA was inserted into pAsc9 (12Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing.CD32-NPC1 Chimeras—A chimeric cDNA, CD32-NPC1-Wt, was generated by overlap PCR using PCR-generated fragments of the extracellular domain of CD32 and the NPC1 transmembrane domain 13 (TM13) and cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain of CD32 was PCR-amplified using sense and antisense primers (5′-GCGAATTCTTCTGGGATGGCTATGGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GTAGAATATCTGGAAAATTTGTGGTGAAGAGCTGCCCATGCT-3′, respectively). The NPC1 TM13 domain and cytoplasmic tail was amplified with sense and antisense primers 5′-CAAATTTTCCAGATATTCTAC-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCCCTGCGAGAGGGCTAGAAATT-3′, respectively. The fusion CD32-NPC1-Wt cDNA generated with the two products above was inserted into pAsc9 and confirmed by sequencing.The mutated and truncated NPC1 chimeric cDNAs (CD32-NPC1-AA, CD32-NPC1-C10A, CD32-NPC1-TR4, CD32-NPC1-TR8, and CD32-NPC1-Y16A) were created by using the CD32-NPC1-Wt cDNA as a template and sense (CD32.5′) and antisense primers (AA, 5′-GCGAATTCCTAGAAATTTGCTGCCCGT-3′; C10A, 5′-GCGAATTCCTAGAAATTTAGAAGCCGTTCGCGCTCTGTTCCTTTGTATCGCTCTTCAGTGGCGGCACTTTT-3′; TR4, 5′-GCGAATTCCTACCGTTCGCGCTCT-3′; TR8, 5′-GCGAATTCCTATGTTCCTTTGTATCGCTCT-3′; Y16A, 5′-GCGAATTCCTAGAAATTTAGAAGCCGTTCGCGCTCTGTTCCTTTGG CTCGCTCT-3′). The chimeric cDNA fragments were cloned into pAsc9, and the tail mutations were confirmed by sequencing.CD32-NPC1-TM3 was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-GCGGAATTCATTGAAGATGAACTAAATCGT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCGCTTTTGATGTGCCCCAAGGCTA-3′ to amplify the TM3 region of NPC1 using pGEM-NPC1-ClaF as template. The product was fused to the extracellular domain of CD32 and cloned into pAsc9 as above.To generate CD32-NPC1-TM13, CD32-NPC1-Wt cDNA was digested with EcoRI and SapI. Equimolar amounts of the TM13 primers, 5′-CCAATGTATTTGGCCATGGTCTTACTGGGAGCCACTCACGGATTAATATTTCTCCCTGTCTTACTCAGTTACATATAGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCTATATGTAACTGAGTAAGACAGGGAGAAATATTAATCCGT GAGTGGCTCCCAGTAAGACCATGGCCAAATACAT-3′, were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, mixed, and heated to 70 °C for 10 min before allowing to cool to room temperature. The double-stranded product was ligated with the EcoRI/SapI-digested CD32-NPC1-Wt fragment and cloned into pAsc9.CD32-NPC1-TM3/12/13 cDNA was created by amplification of transmembrane domains 12 and 13 from pGEM-NPC1-ClaF followed by ligation of this product into CD32-NPC1-TM3. Equimolar amounts of the sense and antisense primers, 5′-CGGGATCCCTCTGGTCTGCAGTCATC-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCCTATATGTAACTGAGTAAGACAGGGAG-3′, were used for PCR, and the product was cloned into CD32-NPC1-TM3 at the BamHI restriction site. The chimeric cDNA product was confirmed by sequencing.Immunofluorescence Analysis—COS7 cells and human fibroblasts (GM03123A) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ), respectively. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Plasmids (2 μg) were transfected into cells grown on glass coverslips using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (12Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Plasma Membrane Labeling Assay—COS7 cells were lipofected with the appropriate CD32 fusion construct and incubated overnight with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The following day cells were labeled for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μCi of [35S]Met/[35S]Cys in cell medium deficient in these amino acids. Following a 1-h chase period in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were removed from dishes using phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and split equally into 2 aliquots. Two μg of anti-CD32 monoclonal antibody was added to half the samples and incubated on a rotating mixer at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and all samples were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100) containing proteinase inhibitor mixture for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples incubated previously with anti-CD32 antibodies were transferred to tubes containing 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C while rotating overnight. The remaining samples were incubated at 4 °C while rotating for 1 h with 3 μg of anti-CD32 antibodies, after which they were transferred to tubes containing protein G-agarose and incubated at 4 °C while rotating overnight.Samples were washed four times in lysis buffer and once in NET1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Igepal, 0.25% gelatin, 0.02% sodium azide) and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel until adequate separation was achieved. Gels were fixed in a solution of 10% acetic acid, 20% methanol for 10 min and soaked in Amplify solution for 15 min before drying and exposing to film.CD32 Trafficking Assay—COS7 cells were transfected with the appropriate CD32 fusion construct using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were exchanged into serum-free medium containing 200 μm cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis and incubated for a further 30 min followed by addition of Rhodamine-X-labeled anti-CD32 monoclonal antibody. The antibody was removed after 15 min, and cells were washed extensively and chased with serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1) and stained using a FITC-labeled anti-CD32 monoclonal antibody as described previously (12Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).RESULTSNPC1 is a large polytopic glycoprotein that resides in late endosomes (12Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is composed of 13 transmembrane domains and a small cytoplasmic tail (14Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) that has been suggested to be essential for the transport of newly synthesized NPC1 to the late endosome (15Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Glick J.M. Patel S. Neufeld E.B. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Examination of this cytoplasmic tail (numbered 1–27 from Gly1252) reveals several potential late endosome targeting regions, such as a dileucine motif at positions 24 and 25, a tyrosine at position 16, a cysteine at position 10, and a putative ER maturation signal 20ERE22 (Fig. 1) (18Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The 24LL25 dileucine motif is of particular interest because its importance has been characterized in other transmembrane proteins targeted to the E/L system (19Tikkanen R. Obermuller S. Denzer K. Pungitore R. Geuze H.J. von Figura K. Honing S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Sandoval I.V. Arredondo J.J. Alcalde J. Gonzalez Noriega A. Vandekerckhove J.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sequence surrounding this motif includes a glutamine (Gln20) four residues away from the leucine pair (Fig. 1), which is consistent with observations that the targeting of dileucine motifs is often influenced by flanking upstream acidic residues (22Zhu Y. Doray B. Poussu A. Lehto V.P. Kornfeld S. Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Johnson A.O. Lampson M.A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The residues surrounding Tyr16 do not constitute a typical tyrosine motif, which is usually YXXΦ (where X is any residue, and Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid), and has been shown to target proteins from the TGN to lysosomes both by a direct TGN to endosome route and indirectly via the plasma membrane (for a review see Ref. 24Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Finally, the cysteine residue (Cys10) has the potential to be modified by lipidation and could alter the structure of the cytoplasmic tail, thus influencing trafficking as shown for the cation-dependant mannose 6-phosphate receptor (25Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The Function of the Cytoplasmic Tail in NPC1 Targeting—To determine whether these motifs have any role in the targeting of NPC1 to its appropriate compartment, a number of different FLAG-tagged NPC1 cDNAs were constructed that mutate or truncate these potentially important residues. These FLAG-tagged NPC1 constructs, wild-type (NPC1-Wt), 24LL25 mutated to AA (NPC1-AA), Cys10 mutated to Ala (NPC1-C10A), Tyr16 mutated to Ala (NPC1-Y16A), a 4-amino acid (NPC1-TR4) and an 8-amino acid truncation (NPC1-TR8) of the cytoplasmic tail, and deletion of the entire cytoplasmic tail (NPC1-TM13), are shown in Fig. 1. As demonstrated previously (14Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), addition of a FLAG tag in the unique ClaI site of the NPC1 cDNA does not interfere with NPC1 protein function or localization.The effect of each mutation on NPC1 localization and function was assessed in NPC1 fibroblasts transfected with the FLAG-tagged NPC1 constructs and analyzed for correction of the NPC1 phenotype (i.e. clearance of E/L-accumulated cholesterol by staining with filipin). Expression of a mutated dileucine construct, NPC1-AA, corrected the filipin-positive NPC phenotype (Fig. 2), suggesting that the dileucine motif is not critical for NPC1 localization or function. Similarly, the Y16A and C10A mutated proteins were able to mobilize cholesterol from the E/L system indicating that these residues are also not critical for NPC1 localization to late endosomes (Fig. 2). The cysteine residue (Cys10), located ∼10 amino acids from the lipid bilayer, is a potential site for acylation and could influence the conformation and interactions of the cytoplasmic tail by anchoring the juxtamembrane region to the bilayer. Labeling of the NPC1 protein with [3H]palmitate, however, indicated that Cys10 is not modified by palmitic acid (data not shown), providing further support to the notion that this residue is not required for NPC1 function or localization. Surprisingly, deletion of 16 amino acids (NPC1-TR16) or the complete NPC1 cytoplasmic tail (NPC1-TM13) did not hinder NPC1 localization and function. These mutants were able to correct the NPC1 phenotype (Fig. 2), implying that the cytoplasmic tail of the protein is not essential for its delivery to the endosomal system nor does it contribute to NPC1 function.Fig. 2Correction of cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 fibroblasts. NPC1 fibroblasts were grown in low density lipoprotein-depleted culture medium for 2 days followed by transfection of FLAG-tagged NPC1 mutant proteins. Cells were grown overnight in medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml low density lipoprotein and fixed and stained with anti-FLAG antibodies (Flag) to detect protein expression and filipin (Filipin) to detect free cholesterol. NPC1-Wt, NPC1-AA, NPC1-Y16A, NPC1-C10A, and NPC1-TR16 were all capable of clearing cholesterol from the E/L system (arrows). In contrast, NPC1-TR4 and NPC1-TR8 were unable to facilitate cholesterol egress from the E/L system (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast to the results obtained with the above NPC1 constructs, truncated constructs NPC1-TR4 and NPC1-TR8 were incapable of clearing the cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 fibroblasts (Fig. 2), in agreement with a previous report (15Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Glick J.M. Patel S. Neufeld E.B. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) where deletion of the C-terminal 4 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail ablated NPC1 location and function. Inspection of the sequence surrounding the dileucine motif revealed that the C-terminal 8 amino acids of the tail contains a di-acidic sequence (ERE) conforming to the DXE motif proposed to elicit efficient COPII-mediated ER export of certain transmembrane proteins (18Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 26Nishimura N. Bannykh S. Slabough S. Matteson J. Altschuler Y. Hahn K. Balch W.E. J. Biol.

Inappropriate exposure of this motif in NPC1-TR4 and deletion of this motif in NPC1-TR8 most likely hinder movement of the proteins through the secretory pathway to such an extent that they are prevented from reaching late endosomes and thus are incapable of restoring NPC1 function in NPC1-deficient cells (see “Discussion”). In support of this hypothesis, more extensive immunofluorescence microscopy of expressed NPC1-TR4 and NPC1-TR8 constructs revealed a predominantly ER localization (data not shown). These results are summarized in Fig. 1.Subcellular Localization of CD32-NPC1 Chimeras—The above results suggested that regions of NPC1 in addition to the tail must be involved in targeting the protein to the E/L system because deletion of the entire cytoplasmic tail did not ablate NPC1 targeting to late endosomes. To characterize further the elements involved in NPC1 targeting, portions of NPC1 were fused to the extracellular region of the plasma membrane protein CD32 (30Brooks D.G. Qiu W.Q. Luster A.D. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1369-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To confirm that CD32 could be redirected to the E/L system and thus serve as an appropriate marker for these studies, the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of CD32 were initially replaced with those of human Lamp2. NPC1 fibroblasts were then transfected with wild-type CD32 or the CD32-lamp2 chimera. Wild-type CD32 decorated the plasma membrane of transfection-positive cells as expected (Fig. 3). The chimeric CD32-lamp2 protein, however, displayed a vesicular pattern indicative of lysosomes (Fig. 3). Colocalization studies with the lysosomal marker α-galactosidase A confirmed that these organelles were lysosomes (data not shown).Fig. 3Redirection of the plasma membrane marker CD32 to lysosomes by the LAMP2 cytoplasmic tail. COS7 cells were transfected with wild-type CD32 or CD32 extracellular domain fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human LAMP2. Cells were cultured overnight and fixed and stained with anti-CD32 antibodies. Wt CD32 decorates the plasma membrane (A), whereas fusion to the LAMP2 tail redirects CD32 to vesicular structures (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Nine CD32-NPC1 chimeras were constructed as shown in Fig. 1. The CD32 extracellular domain was linked to transmembrane domain 13 and the cytoplasmic tail of NPC1 (CD32-Wt); to transmembrane domain 13 with mutated NPC1 tails as described above (Leu24 → Ala/Leu25 → Ala (CD32-AA), Cys10 → Ala (CD32-C10A); Tyr16 → Ala (CD32-Y16A)); to transmembrane domain 13 and the 4- and 8-amino acid truncated tails (CD32-TR4 and CD32-TR8); to transmembrane domain 13 alone (i.e. without the cytoplasmic tail) (CD32-TM13); to transmembrane domains 3, 12, and 13 (CD32-TM3/12/13); and to transmembrane domain 3 alone (CD32-TM3). Transmembrane domain 3 was selected based on previous results (14Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) suggesting the presence of a targeting motif within this region. The CD32-TM3/12/13 fusion was constructed to contain both TM3 and TM13, with TM12 included to maintain these domains in their correct topology (14Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).COS7 cells were transfected with each CD32 chimera and then immunostained for CD32 to determine the subcellular distribution of the expressed proteins. Similar to the results using the full-length FLAG-tagged NPC1 protein (NPC1-Wt), wild-type NPC1 transmembrane domain 13 and tail (CD32-Wt) directed CD32 to vesicular structures, most likely components of the E/L system (Fig. 4). Vesicular targeting appeared to be diminished but not completely abolished when the dileucine motif was mutated to alanines (CD32-AA) (Fig. 4), correlating with previous findings that NPC1-AA can correct the cholesterol accumulation in the E/L system of NPC1 fibroblasts. The CD32-Y16A and CD32-C10A mutations did not prevent CD32 from reaching vesicular structures, consistent with the capability of NPC1-Y16A and NPC1-C10A mutants to correct the NPC1 cellular phenotype. Truncation of 4 or 8 amino acids from the tail of chimeric constructs (CD32-TR4 and CD32-TR8) resulted in retention of the chimeric proteins in the ER (Fig. 4), reinforcing the assertion that this region of the tail contains a potential ER maturation or exit signal (see “Discussion”).Fig. 4Intracellular distribution of CD32-NPC1 fusion proteins. COS7 cells were transfected with each CD32-NPC1 chimera (see Fig. 1) and fixed and stained with anti-CD32 antibodies to determine the intracellular distribution of the fusion proteins.

The question of the exact number and position of residues phosphorylated in vivo, however, remains uncertain possibly due to the inherent difficulties of controlling dephosphorylation, different kinetics of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at individual residues, possible contribution of kinases other than GRK1, and other secondary factors. Either Ser-334 (5Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or Ser-343 (6Kennedy M.J.

The majority of studies provides strong evidence, however, that multiple phosphorylation is required for reproducible deactivation (5Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

In order to circumvent the current uncertainty about the exact sequence of phosphorylation events, we have used a model synthetic peptide phosphorylated at all seven positions, which mimics the major biological properties of phosphorylated rhodopsin. Conceptually, it is thought that arrestin directly competes for the binding site of transducin (9Pfister C. Chabre M. Plouet J. Tuyen V.V. De Kozak Y. Faure J.P. Kühn H. Science. 1985; 228: 891-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Kühn H. Wilden U. J. Recept. Res. 1987; 7: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V.

The mechanism of arrestin binding and signal shut-off at the molecular level, however, is not understood. The C-terminal region of rhodopsin is resolved poorly in available crystal structures. Phosphorylation of multiple residues can potentially have significant impact on the conformation of the C terminus and prearrange the Rh-(330–348) domain for effective interactions with arrestin. NMR studies using model peptides with various numbers of phosphates (12Dorey M. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. Arendt A. Vogt T. Bhawsar N. Albert A.D. Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1416: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and full protein (13Getmanova E. Patel A.B. Klein-Seetharaman J. Loewen M.C. Reeves P.J. Friedman N. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1126-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed little ordering of this region of rhodopsin upon phosphorylation. Whether the phospho-Rh-(330–348) assumes a defined conformation in the rhodopsin-arrestin complex remains unclear. We posed the question whether the phosphorylated C terminus of rhodopsin is simply passive bait for arrestin or if it is directly involved in shaping the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor into a conformation associated with termination of a signaling state. We used high resolution proton NMR to study the dynamics of the model synthetic peptide, representing the fully phosphorylated region of rhodopsin Rh-(330–348), 7PP, in solution and in an arrestin-bound state. Rigid body docking of rhodopsin, containing the C-terminal region in a conformation determined from this experimental study, to arrestin allowed us to propose a model of the rhodopsin-arrestin complex. Arrestin and Phosphorylated Peptide—Arrestin was prepared by the method of Buczylko and Palczewski with modifications as described earlier (14Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Peptide Rh-(330–348) from the sequence of bovine rhodopsin was synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystem model 431A peptide synthesizer. Multiply phosphorylated peptide 7-phospho-Rh-(330–348) (7PP) was synthesized on phenylacetamidomethyl polystyrene resin using t-butoxycarbonyl-O-(diphenylphosphono)-serine and -threonine as described (15Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 3: 361-368Google Scholar). The peptides were homogeneous by high pressure liquid chromatography and showed the expected mass when examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (15Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 3: 361-368Google Scholar). Rhodopsin Binding—Various amounts of the Gtβγ were reconstituted with 3 μg of Gtα and 30 μg of urea-washed ROS membranes in 100 μl of buffer ROS-ISO (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice in the absence or presence of 5 μg of bovine arrestin and 100 μm 7PP. The reaction was initiated by exposure to light. Urea-washed ROS membranes were centrifuged at 109,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min in a TLA-100.3 rotor on a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The pellet was washed twice with buffer ROS-ISO. Urea-washed ROS membranes with Gt bound was resuspended in buffer ROS-Hypo (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 250 μm GTPγS, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was analyzed for the presence of G-protein subunits by immunoblotting. NMR and Structure Calculations—NMR sample preparation and data processing were essentially as we described previously (16Kisselev O.G. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). NMR samples contained 0.16 mm purified arrestin, 1.77 mm 7PP, 7-phospho-Rh-(330–348), or unphosphorylated Rh-(330–348) in sodium phosphate buffer, 0.1 m, pH 6.5, and 10% D2O in a total volume of 0.6 ml. Two-dimensional high resolution proton Transferred Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectra were acquired at 4 °C on the Varian Unity-600 spectrophotometer as described earlier (17Kisselev O.G. Kao J. Ponder J.W. Fann Y.C. Gautam N. Marshall G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Data were processed off-line using VNMR 5.2. Total correlation spectroscopy (18Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Res. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar) (two-dimensional TOCSY, MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 120 ms, flanked by two 2-ms trim pulses, 0.5-s pre-acquisition delay, and 1.0-s presaturation) and two-dimensional NOESY (19Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) (Tmix = 250 ms, 2 × 280 × 2049 data matrix with 16 scans per t1, using WATERGATE water suppression protocol) were used for sequence-specific and stereo-specific assignments. NOEs were classified into weak, medium, and strong based on the peak volume and translated to corresponding interproton distances of 1.9–5.0, 1.9–3.5, and 1.9–2.7 Å, respectively. One hundred ninety eight constraints were used for structure calculations, which involved distance geometry (DISTGEOM of TINKER 3.9 (20Hodsdon M.E. Ponder J.W. Cistola D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)), 1000 K restrained molecular dynamics, simulated annealing (ANNEAL, 15 ps total time), and structure refinement (NEWTON, 0.001 root mean square gradient). Calculations utilized CHARMM force field. In order to identify biologically relevant conformations of 7PP in the arrestin-bound state, the structure calculations based on the NMR-derived constraints were performed on the full set of x-ray coordinates of rhodopsin (21Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) with unresolved parts of loop C3 and the C-terminal region rebuilt in Insight II. The starting conformation of a rebuilt C terminus was mostly extended. Only region Rh-(324–348) was allowed to move during calculations. For the final energy refinements, restrained molecular dynamics, simulated annealing, and energy minimization protocols were applied to Rh-(330–348) separate from rhodopsin coordinates. One hundred structures were generated independently. Fifteen models were chosen based on the lowest energy and best local geometry and superimposed using main chain atoms. Coordinates of the ensemble and the NMR constraints file were deposited as PDB code 1TQK. Phosphates were added to a representative model in Insight II. Molecular rigid body docking was done manually in Insight II by using surface complementation and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions as guidance. The final model was chosen based on the strongest charge-charge interactions that avoided steric clashes. Calculation of electrostatic potential, molecular surfaces, and graphics were in MOLMOL (22Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). 7-Phospho-Rh-(330–348) Peptide Mimics Phosphorylated C Terminus of Rhodopsin—On a functional level, the C terminus of bovine rhodopsin, the region spanning amino acids 330–348, which contains three serine and four threonine residues, acts as an independent domain with characteristics closely linked to the signal shut-off. Ablation of this region by genetic methods in mice leads to a phenotype in which photo-signal termination is dramatically compromised (23Chen J. Makino C.L. Peachey N.S. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Science. 1995; 267: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The soluble polypeptide Rh-(330–348) has been synthesized chemically in fully phosphorylated form (7PP (15Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 3: 361-368Google Scholar)) and shown to duplicate major functions of the native phosphorylated rhodopsin. The fully phosphorylated form was chosen because multiple phosphorylation was observed in vivo (6Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Mendez A. Burns M.E. Roca A. Lem J. Wu L.W. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and both serine and threonine residues have been shown to be required for activation of the action of arrestin (5Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Brannock M.T. Weng K. Robinson P.R.

Sci. 2001; 42: 1439-1443PubMed Google Scholar). 7PP inhibited phototransduction from photoactivated unphosphorylated rhodopsin in the presence of arrestin, based on the phosphodiesterase assay (27McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P. Arendt A. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It also induced conformational changes in arrestin typically seen upon interaction of arrestin with native phosphorylated rhodopsin (14Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As predicted from the previous data, we show here that in direct competition experiments, binding of transducin to light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin in membranes is inhibited by addition of arrestin and 7PP together but not arrestin or 7PP alone (Fig. 1). These experiments demonstrate close functional approximation between the effects of rhodopsin phosphorylation in vivo and the effects of the model phosphopeptide in the presence of unphosphorylated rhodopsin in vitro. They also indicate that major structural features of the phosphorylated C terminus of rhodopsin are preserved in 7PP and that it can be used to study the structural dynamics of the rhodopsin-arrestin interface and the mechanism of signal shut-off. NMR Structures of 7PP in the Arrestin-bound State—To identify the structural basis of an inhibitory effect of arrestin in the arrestin-rhodopsin complex, high resolution proton NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the solution structure of 7PP and the changes in 7PP conformation upon binding to arrestin. As we reported, no secondary structure elements can be recognized in 7PP in solution, indicating high flexibility and a disordered state of the molecule (16Kisselev O.G. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The result is not surprising, because of the mostly extended conformation of the C-terminal region in available x-ray structures of rhodopsin with the average B-factor values for the Rh-(330–348) region of 70.4 ± 8.8 (PDB code 1HZX) (21Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The disorder of 7PP in solution is also consistent with previous solution NMR experiments of model peptides (12Dorey M. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. Arendt A. Vogt T. Bhawsar N. Albert A.D. Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1416: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and a recent study (13Getmanova E. Patel A.B. Klein-Seetharaman J. Loewen M.C. Reeves P.J. Friedman N. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1126-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) combining solution and solid state NMR of native phosphorylated rhodopsin. Addition of arrestin under the same experimental conditions resulted in striking changes in 7PP conformation, as evident from the NOESY spectra before and after addition of arrestin (Fig. 2a) (16Kisselev O.G. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One hundred ninety eight constraints were identified and used in generation of a first subset of structures consistent with the NMR data by distance geometry and high temperature simulated annealing. The summary of the experimental constraints is shown in Fig. 2b. The analysis of a family of 7PP conformations in an arrestin-bound state showed a well ordered C-terminal helix for residues Glu-341 to Ala-346 and a fairly disordered loop for residues Asp-330 to Thr-340 (Fig. 2). Energy refinements lead to significant improvements of the local geometry and the overall quality of structures, compared with the initial set of models reported. The latest models have more than 83% of residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and about 17% of residues in additionally allowed regions (Fig. 3), compared with 71 and 29%, respectively, for the first generation of structures (16Kisselev O.G. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Ramachandran plot and structure statistics for the refined ensemble of arrestin-bound 7PP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Restricted mobility and tighter structural organization of the C-terminal region, evident from small root mean square deviation values for residues 340–348 (Fig. 3), point to a more prominent role of the C-terminal helix in arrestin binding. Because any structuring is absent in an unphosphorylated peptide or 7PP without arrestin, it appears the C-terminal helix containing phosphates at Thr-342 and Ser-343 is ultimately involved in binding and, thus, is more constrained by the geometry of the binding site on arrestin. This observation correlates well with the proposed sequence of phosphorylation events progressing from Ser-343 to Ser-334 (6Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The first phosphates added are known to have the most effect on the affinity of binding. We predict that the structural elements of the helix loop structure of 7PP would be detectable with only Ser-343 phosphorylated. In support of this prediction, Ser-343 was shown to be phosphorylated most rapidly in vivo to produce the dominant monophosphorylated form of rhodopsin within the first seconds after light activation (6Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A prominent feature of the arrestin-bound structure is the position of seven phosphates that are clustered on the loop connecting the disordered N-terminal region and helical C terminus. Remarkably, in the models calculated in the context of the whole rhodopsin, the phosphate groups are facing in one direction, away from rhodopsin, forming a unified negatively charged surface (Fig. 4). Carboxyl groups of Asp-330, Glu-332, and Glu-341 additionally contribute to this surface. Such orientation of phosphates is not observed for the peptide in the absence of arrestin and would be highly unlikely in the aqueous environment for the 7PP polypeptide alone, because of the strong negative charge repulsion. It appears possible because of the interactions of the phosphate groups with the complementary positively charged binding site of arrestin. A Model of Rhodopsin-Arrestin Interactions—Modeling of the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin based on the NMR-derived constraints shows that, in the arrestin-bound state, the C-terminal helix occupies a central position between three cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin. This crevice is thought to open up after rhodopsin photoactivation to form a site for transducin docking (28Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 29Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The arrestin-bound conformation also completely occludes the N terminus of helix eight, one of the major sites of transducin interaction (30Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Zvyaga T.A. Isele J. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1930-1936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Formation of a compact helical structure at the C terminus of rhodopsin upon arrestin binding may facilitate interactions between arrestin and additional sites of arrestin interactions on loops two and three. As mentioned above, the concerted position of phosphates in an arrestin-bound conformation of 7PP shows that the phosphates must be completely shielded from solvent in the arrestin-rhodopsin complex. This conclusion is consistent with data demonstrating that arrestin prevents de-phosphorylation of rhodopsin by phosphatase (31Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Jakes S. Ingebritsen T.S. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15770-15773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize the position of the phosphates and to estimate the overall geometric plausibility of the rhodopsin-arrestin complex, we performed molecular rigid body docking of available crystal structures of arrestin (PDB 1CF1) with phosphorylated rhodopsin models produced by this study. The model of the complex does not take into consideration global conformational changes in arrestin, which are expected based on the biochemical studies (32Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), but rather reflects initial stages of the contact between the two proteins. A prominent saddle on arrestin with the highest concentration of positively charged lysine and arginine residues was chosen as a complementary site for the phosphates on the rhodopsin C-terminal domain (Fig. 5). The polar core of this site contains Lys-14, Lys-15, and Arg-175, which are proposed to interact with phosphates on rhodopsin (33Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41049-41057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Previous data have shown that interaction of the phosphate groups with Arg-175 in the region 166–179 triggers the electrostatic switch in arrestin (33Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41049-41057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The sequence of molecular events that follows can be described most closely as the induced fit mechanism of interactions, with both the rhodopsin C terminus and arrestin changing conformations for the most precise fit. In fact, conformational changes and repositioning of the rhodopsin C terminus may help to direct arrestin for the most specific docking with rhodopsin (34Raman D. Osawa S. Gurevich V.V. Weiss E.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), making possible interactions with other regions of arrestin, such as the 109–130 stretch (35Smith W.C. McDowell J.H. Dugger D.R. Miller R. Arendt A. Popp M.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or other regions, that become available due to local and global rearrangements in arrestin. Analogies with the Ball-and-Chain Mechanism of Inactivation of Potassium Channels—Involvement of a built-in domain of a transmembrane signaling protein in the mechanism of inactivation struck us as remarkably similar in concept to the ball-and-chain mechanism of inactivation of voltage-gated potassium channels, described originally for the Drosophila Shaker B channel (36Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), and then for a variety of other channels (37Solaro C.R. Lingle C.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1694-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The inactivation domain, the ball, blocks the channel pore reversibly and is connected to the channel via a flexible linker, the chain. In both cases, inactivation occurs by a cytoplasmic terminal domain of a transmembrane protein, the N-terminal inactivation gate in the case of the channels, and the C-terminal domain in the case of GPCRs. In both instances, the inactivation properties of the domain can be regulated by phosphorylation (38Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the domains function fairly independently of the rest of the protein. Their removal proteolytically or by genetic methods leads to a complete loss of inactivation. The inactivation is restored when the domains are added as independently synthesized polypeptides (14Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). What makes the mechanism of GPCR inactivation distinct is the obligatory requirement for an auxiliary protein, arrestin, which induces the active “ball” conformation of the phosphorylated C terminus, as we show in this study. In fact, arrestin binding appears to enhance the original nucleation effect of the rhodopsin C terminus in a snowball manner, which completely excludes interactions with transducin. Inactivation gates of several potassium channels have been studied by NMR. Although fairly diverse in their three-dimensional structure, the ball-and-chain domains of the voltage-dependent potassium channel RCK4 (Kv1.4) (40Antz C. Geyer M. Fakler B. Schott M.K. Guy H.R. Frank R. Ruppersberg J.P. Kalbitzer H.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the β2-subunit of a large conductance Ca2+ and voltage-dependent potassium channel (41Bentrop D. Beyermann M. Wissmann R. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42116-42121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) show striking resemblance to the arrestin-bound structures of the rhodopsin C terminus. Despite little primary sequence similarities, and obvious structural variations, the helix-loop hairpin motif can be readily recognized (Fig. 6). There is no reason to suspect an evolutionary link between channels and GPCRs. More likely, the remarkable similarity between the two systems in concept and structural detail represents a fascinating example of evolutionary convergence of the molecular domains evolved to perform similar regulatory functions. Overall principles of rhodopsin inactivation, including multiple phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine and threonine residues by rhodopsin kinase and the binding of arrestin, are understood fairly well conceptually. Mechanistic details of rhodopsin-arrestin interactions at the atomic level, however, are lacking. Previous studies have focused on the mechanisms of arrestin activation and conformational changes in arrestin accompanying its binding to phosphorylated rhodopsin. We show in this study that binding of the fully phosphorylated polypeptide, representing the last 19 residues of bovine rhodopsin, to arrestin, leads to the peptide folding into a helix-loop structure. When modeled in the context of the whole rhodopsin, this compact structure occupies a central position between cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin. This unique orientation of the rhodopsin C terminus and the bound arrestin shields phosphates in the center of the complex, occludes major sites of transducin binding, and is associated with termination of a signaling state. Because both GPCRs and arrestins are families of proteins with conserved functions, we predict that diverse C-terminal regions of other GPCRs should exhibit structural properties similar to those identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2063149010,"The relationship between the DNA replication and spindle checkpoints of the cell cycle is unclear, given that in most eukaryotes, spindle formation occurs only after DNA replication is complete. Fission yeast rad3 mutant cells, which are deficient in DNA replication checkpoint function, enter, progress through, and exit mitosis even when DNA replication is blocked. In contrast, the entry of cds1 mutant cells into mitosis is delayed by several hours when DNA replication is inhibited. We show here that this delay in mitotic entry in cds1 cells is due in part to activation of the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2p. In the presence of the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), cds1 mad2 cells entered and progressed through mitosis earlier than did cds1 cells. Overexpression of Mad2p or inactivation of Slp1p, a regulator of the anaphase-promoting complex, also rescued the checkpoint defect of HU-treated rad3 cells. Rad3p was shown to be involved in the physical interaction between Mad2p and Slp1p in the presence of HU. These results suggested that Mad2p and Slp1p act downstream of Rad3p in the DNA replication checkpoint and that Mad2p is required for the DNA replication checkpoint when Cds1p is compromised. The relationship between the DNA replication and spindle checkpoints of the cell cycle is unclear, given that in most eukaryotes, spindle formation occurs only after DNA replication is complete. Fission yeast rad3 mutant cells, which are deficient in DNA replication checkpoint function, enter, progress through, and exit mitosis even when DNA replication is blocked. In contrast, the entry of cds1 mutant cells into mitosis is delayed by several hours when DNA replication is inhibited. We show here that this delay in mitotic entry in cds1 cells is due in part to activation of the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2p. In the presence of the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), cds1 mad2 cells entered and progressed through mitosis earlier than did cds1 cells.

Cell cycle checkpoints monitor cell cycle progression to ensure the integrity of the genome and the fidelity of sister chromatid separation (1Murakami H. Nurse P. Biochem.

The DNA replication checkpoint blocks entry into mitosis if DNA replication is incomplete, whereas the spindle checkpoint delays sister chromatid separation until each and every kinetochore has achieved a bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle apparatus. Cancer cells are checkpoint-defective and frequently have mutations in many of the components in the DNA replication and spindle checkpoints (4Wassmann K. Benezra R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus checkpoint failure contributes to cancer (5Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar).The relationship between the DNA replication checkpoint and the spindle checkpoint is largely unknown, given that spindle formation occurs only when cells are in M phase of the cell cycle in most eukaryotes (6Hagan I.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1603-1612PubMed Google Scholar). In fission yeast, like other eukaryotes, the spindle checkpoint therefore functions only after DNA replication is complete. In fission yeast two checkpoint kinases, Rad3p and Cds1p, are important for the DNA replication checkpoint (1Murakami H. Nurse P. Biochem.

Cell extracts (40 μg of protein) prepared as described previously (22Murakami H. Nurse P.

Immune complexes were detected with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (both 1:1000 dilution) and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—Extracts were prepared from frozen cells with glass beads in HB buffer (25 mm 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm ethyleneglycotetraacetic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mmp-nitro-phenylphosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin) (22Murakami H.

Monoclonal antibodies to GFP (3 μl of 1:100 dilution) were added to 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed and added to the soluble extract (1.5–2.0 mg of protein). After rotation for 2 h at 4 °C,the beads were washed, resuspended in 20 μl of HB buffer, and mixed with 5 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C and subjected to immunoblot analysis.4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Flow Cytometric Analysis—For detection of the cut phenotype, cells were stained with DAPI as described previously (22Murakami H.

Matsumoto.RESULTSRole of Mad2p in the DNA Replication Checkpoint—We first examined the cell length in the DNA replication checkpoint mutant cells after 6 h with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) treatment (Fig. 1, a and b). In fission yeast, premature entry into mitosis causes cells to divide in a reduced cell size, whereas activation of the DNA replication checkpoint prevents or delays entry into mitosis, resulting in elongated cells. HU at the concentrations used in this study has a limited half-life in fission yeast experiments because of the up-regulation of ribonucleotide reductase and the metabolism of HU itself. Therefore, we monitored the DNA contents using flow cytometric analysis. Exposure to HU inhibited the completion of DNA replication by at least 8 h as judged by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1c) and resulted in a marked increase of elongated cells in wild-type (wt), whereas with HU treatment the rad3 mutant (rad3) cells were smaller than wt cells (Fig. 1, a and b), as reported previously (2Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 3Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). HU treatment in cds1 mutant (cds1) cells resulted in an intermediate phenotype between rad3 and wt cells (Fig. 1, a and b) (12Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We next monitored the cells for the “cut” phenotype, which is characterized by the septum either cleaving the single nucleus or dividing the cell giving rise to one daughter anucleate and is a marker for aberrant mitotic cells. In rad3 cells more than 70% of the cells showed the cut phenotype at 4 h after HU addition, whereas the appearance of the cut phenotype was delayed in cds1 cells (Fig. 1, a–c) (12Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Because these DNA replication checkpoint mutant cells enter mitosis in the presence of unreplicated DNA, spindle formation would be defective in these cells. We next tested whether the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad1, Mad2, Mad3, and Bub1 are required for the DNA replication checkpoint (19Ikui A.E. Furuya K. Yanagida M. Matsumoto T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Millband D.N. Hardwick K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2728-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After exposure to HU, mad1 (mad1), mad2 (mad2), mad3 (mad3), and bub1 mutant (bub1) cells showed elongated phenotype like wt cells (Fig. 1, a and b). However, the cut phenotype was apparent in a small proportion of mad2 cells after exposure to HU for 8 h suggesting that Mad2p plays a role, albeit a minor one, in the DNA replication checkpoint (Fig. 1c). In contrast, a proportion of this phenotype in mad1, mad3, and bub1 is similar to wt cells. To determine whether the spindle checkpoint proteins are required for the arrest in cds1 cells under such conditions, we constructed cds1 mad1, cds1 mad2, cds1 mad3, and cds1 bub1 double-mutant cells. We examined the cell length and the cut phenotype in these cells when DNA replication was incomplete with HU treatment (Fig. 1, a–c). In the presence of HU, cds1 mad2 cells were smaller than cds1 cells (Fig. 1, a and b), indicating that entry into mitosis was advanced in the double mutant. In addition, cds1 mad2 double-mutant cells manifested the cut phenotype earlier than cds1 cells but later than rad3 cells (Fig. 1c). These results suggested that Cds1p acts synergistically with Mad2p in the DNA replication checkpoint. However, mad1, mad3, or bub1 cells did not show a synergistic effect with cds1 mutant cells in DNA replication checkpoint function. These results suggested that Mad2 is specifically involved in the DNA replication checkpoint. We next tested whether Mad2p has an additional role in the DNA replication checkpoint that Rad3p does not have (Fig. 1, a–c). The rad3 mad2 double-mutant cells showed the cut phenotype at the same timing as rad3 cells, suggesting that Mad2p functions in the same pathway as Rad3p.To confirm that the effect of the cds1 mad2 double mutant is because of the defect of cds1+ and mad2+ genes but not other genes, we introduced the cds1+ and mad2+ gene into the double mutant. As shown in Fig. 1e, the cut phenotype of the double mutant was complemented almost completely by cds1+ and partially by mad2+. Almost no cut phenotype at 8 h by cds1+ may be because of the effect of cds1+ overproduction or minimum medium in which the appearance of the cut phenotype is delayed.HU, Ultraviolet (UV), and Methylmethan Sulfonate (MMS) Sensitivity—If Cds1p and Mad2p signaling pathways contributed independently to cell cycle arrest after treatment of cells with HU, it would be expected that each pathway would also contribute independently to cell survival in the presence of HU. To test this prediction, we determined cell survival after plating serial dilutions of cells in the present of HU (Fig. 2a). The sensitivity of cds1 cells to HU was greater than that of wt or mad2 cells (12Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The HU sensitivity of cds1 mad2 cells was in turn greater than that expected from an additive effect of the two individual mutant genes. The sensitivity of rad3 cells was even greater than that of the cds1 mad2 double mutant cells, possibly because of the additional roles of Rad3p in the DNA replication checkpoint. This observation was consistent with the kinetics of development of the cut phenotype and suggests that Rad3p plays roles that are independent of Cds1p and Mad2p in HU resistance. Neither the cds1 or mad2 single mutants nor the cds1 mad2 double mutant showed an increased sensitivity to UV radiation (Fig. 2b). Similarly, neither the cds1 or mad2 single mutants nor the cds1 mad2 double mutant showed an increased sensitivity to 0.001% MMS, which induces DNA alkylation (Fig. 2c). At 0.005% MMS, however, the sensitivity of cds1 cells was greater than that of wt or mad2 cells (Fig. 2d). In addition, the MMS sensitivity of cds1mad2 cells was greater than that of the cds1 cells, which is similar to that found in HU. Higher concentrations of MMS can block DNA synthesis by stalling DNA replication forks (24Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These results indicated that Cds1p and Mad2p act synergistically to promote cell survival when DNA replication is inhibited but that these proteins seem not to contribute to a tolerance to the DNA damage that does not affect DNA synthesis significantly.Fig. 2HU, UV, and MMS sensitivity. a and b, cells of the indicated genotypes were plated in YES medium at serial dilutions and exposed either to 8 mm HU (a) or to UV radiation at a dose of 42 J/m2 (b). They were then cultured for 3 days at 30 °C and photographed. c and d, cells of the indicated genotypes were grown to mid-log phase. After the addition of MMS (0.001% for c and 0.005% for d) at time 0, cells were cultured for 4 h at 30 °C. After dilution, cells were plated in YES medium and cultured for 3 days at 30 °C. Viability was expressed as a percentage of the cells at time 0. Data are means ± S.E. of values from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cdc2p Tyr15 Phosphorylation and Cdc13p Level in HU—The DNA replication checkpoint maintains the phosphorylation of Cdc2p on Tyr15 (25Rhind N. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3782-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The spindle checkpoint inhibits the activity of the APC and thereby prevents cyclin degradation (10Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). We therefore monitored the phosphorylation of Cdc2p on Tyr15 and the abundance of the major B-type cyclin, Cdc13p, in the various mutant yeast cells after exposure to HU (Fig. 3). Both Cdc2p Tyr15 phosphorylation and the abundance of Cdc13p increased in wt and mad2 cells. In cds1 cells both Cdc2p Tyr15 phosphorylation and the abundance of Cdc13p were transiently increased and then decreased in HU. Both Cdc2p Tyr15 phosphorylation and the abundance of Cdc13p were not increased in rad3 or cds1 mad2 cells. These results suggested that either Cds1p or Mad2p is required for the maintenance of Cdc2p Tyr15 phosphorylation and Cdc13p abundance in HU-treated cells.Fig. 3Inability of cds1 mad2 cells to maintain both the phosphorylation of Cdc2p on Tyr15 and the abundance of Cdc13p after exposure to HU. a, cells were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C before the addition of 12 mm HU. Samples collected at the indicated times thereafter were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for Cdc2p phosphorylated on Tyr15, for Cdc13p, and for α-tubulin (loading control). b, a quantitative analysis of Cdc2p phosphorylated on Tyr15 (left panel) and Cdc13p (right panel) relative to Tubulin in a was performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mad2p Level and Its Interaction with Slp1p in HU—We next examined the effects of HU exposure of the abundance of Mad2p in the various mutant cells (Fig. 4, a and b). For these experiments, we used yeast strains in which Mad2p was tagged with GFP. Treatment of the exponential cultures of wt and rad3 mutant cells with HU resulted in a slight reduction of Mad2p. In contrast, the exposure to HU did not vary the amount of Mad2p in cds1 cells, implicating that Cds1p is involved in the maintenance of Mad2 in HU.Fig. 4Requirement of Rad3p for the interaction of Mad2p with Slp1p. a, cells (wt Mad2-GFP, cds1 Mad2-GFP, and rad3 Mad2-GFP) expressing Mad2p-GFP were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C before the addition of 12 mm HU. Samples were collected at the indicated times thereafter and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to GFP or to α-tubulin. b, quantitative analysis of Mad2p-GFP relative to Tubulin in a was performed. Data are means ± S.E. of values from three independent experiments. c, cells (wt Mad2-GFP, cds1 Mad2-GFP, and rad3 Mad2-GFP) were grown as in a, and samples were collected before or 4 h after HU addition for the preparation of cell extracts. The extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies to GFP, and the resulting precipitates (anti-GFP IP), cell extracts (Extract), and supernatants (Sup) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Slp1p or to GFP. As a control, Suc22-GFP cells were used. d, quantitative analysis of Slp1p relative to Mad2p-GFP in d was performed. Data are means ± S.E. of values from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The impairment of spindle formation results in the direct binding of Mad2p to the APC regulator Slp1p and consequent inhibition of APC activity (7Kim S.H. Lin D.P. Matsumoto S. Kitazono A. Matsumoto T. Science. 1998; 279: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To determine the precise role of Rad3p, we examined the physical interaction between Mad2p and Slp1p (Fig. 4, c and d). Because the Mad2p level in HU at 4 h is similar to that without HU, we monitored the Slp1p level associated with Mad2p. We immunoprecipitated Mad2p-GFP from cells before or 4 h after exposure to HU and then subjected the resulting precipitates to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Slp1p. The amount of Slp1p in the cell extracts and the supernatants was almost constant regardless of HU treatment in wt, cds1, and rad3 cells. Slp1p coprecipitated with Mad2p regardless of HU treatment in wt and cds1 cells. In contrast, in rad3 cells, the amount of Slp1p that coprecipitated with Mad2p in the absence of HU treatment was reduced, compared with the amount apparent for wt cells, and was decreased further after exposure to HU probably because of the accumulation of rad3 cells in mitosis. These data suggested that Rad3p is required for the interaction between Mad2p and Slp1p. To confirm that Slp1p specifically interacts with Mad2p, we immunoprecipitated Suc22p-GFP and treated it similarly to Mad2p-GFP (Fig. 4c). No significant interaction between Suc22p and Slp1p was observed, indicating that the anti-GFP antibody did not interact nonspecifically with Slp1p.Genetic Interactions among Rad3p, Mad2p, and Slp1p—To determine whether Slp1p acts downstream of Rad3p, we examined the effect of inactivation of Slp1p on the DNA replication checkpoint defect in rad3 cells (Fig. 5). We synchronized rad3 cells containing a temperature-sensitive slp1 mutation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by nitrogen deprivation and then released them into medium containing HU at the restrictive temperature for the slp1 mutation. All of the cells tested recovered from G1 arrest as judged by flow cytometric analysis. The development of the cut phenotype was markedly inhibited by the inactivation of Slp1p in rad3 cells (Fig. 5a). The inactivation of Slp1p slightly increased the survival of rad3 cells after exposure to HU (Fig. 5b). In addition, slp1ts rad3 mad2 cells showed a similar cut phenotype and viability to slp1ts rad3 cells, suggesting that Rad3p and Mad2p function in the same pathway. In contrast, the cut phenotype was not manifested in cds1 cells probably because of the complete block of DNA replication and the survival of cds1 cells was not suppressed by the Slp1p inactivation. These results thus suggested that Rad3p, but not Cds1p, acts upstream of Slp1p.Fig. 5Rescue of the DNA replication checkpoint defect in rad3 cells by inactivation of Slp1p. a, cells of the indicated genotypes were grown to late log phase, washed, and cultured in nitrogen-free medium for 14 h at 24 °C. They were then transferred to medium containing both nitrogen and 12 mm HU and incubated at 36 °C (restrictive temperature for slp1ts) for the indicated times, after which the proportion of cells with the cut phenotype was determined. b, after HU treatment as in a, cells were plated and incubated at 24 °C for the indicated times after which cell viability was determined. c, DNA content of the cells in a was determined by flow cytometric analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we examined the effect of overexpression of Mad2p on the development of the cut phenotype in HU-treated rad3 cells (Fig. 6). The ectopic expression of Mad2p in a wt background has previously been shown to result in metaphase arrest (26He X. Patterson T.E. Sazer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7965-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Overexpression of mad2+ in rad3 cells reduced the proportion of cells that developed the cut phenotype after exposure to HU, although mad2+ was not as effective in this regard as cds1+ was. These results suggested that Mad2p acts downstream of Rad3p in the DNA replication checkpoint.Fig. 6Rescue of the DNA replication checkpoint defect in rad3 cells by overexpression of Mad2p. After transformation with pREP3X-mad2+, pREP3X (empty vector), or pREP1-cds1+, rad3 cells were grown to mid-log phase in the presence of thiamine, washed to remove thiamine, and then grown at 30 °C for 15 h before the addition of 12 mm HU. Samples were collected at the indicated times after HU addition and examined for the cut phenotype.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONA failure to complete DNA replication in cds1 cells treated with HU results in a delay in the entry into mitosis (12Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition to Chk1p (13Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N.

These observations further suggest that Mad2p and Cds1p act in a synergistic manner in the DNA replication checkpoint. It is thus possible that HU treatment induces a spindle defect in cds1 cells and that this defect is detected by Mad2p. Nevertheless, other spindle checkpoint proteins Bub1p, Mad1p, and Mad3p did not show a synergistic effect with Cds1p in DNA replication checkpoint function. It is unlikely that Mad2p detects the spindle defect alone. Given that Mad2p forms a complex with Mad1p and Mad3p (19Ikui A.E. Furuya K. Yanagida M. Matsumoto T. J.

Several studies have established that a change in intracellular [Cl-] (Cl-i) represents a key signaling mechanism by which NKCC1-induced Cl- movement is autoregulated and by which Cl- entry and exit on opposite sides of polarized cells are coordinated. Although this signaling mechanism is coupled to a pathway that leads to post-translational modification of the carrier, no unifying model currently accounts for the ion dependence of NKCC1 regulation. In this paper, evidence is presented for the first time that hsp90 associates with the cytosolic C terminus of NKCC1, probably when the carrier is predominantly in its unfolded form during early biogenesis. Evidence is also presented that the Cl-i-dependent regulatory pathway can be activated by a thermal stress but that it is no longer operational if NKCC1-expressing cells are pretreated with geldanamycin, an antibiotic that inhibits hsp90, albeit nonspecifically. Taken together, our data indicate that binding of hsp90 to NKCC1 may be required for Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport to occur at the cell surface and that it could play an important role in ion-dependent signaling mechanisms, insofar as the maneuvers that were used to alter the expression or activity of the chaperone do not exert their main effect by inducing other cellular events such as the unfolded protein response.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); they are termed orphan CCCs because their ionic substrates have not been identified to date. The NKCC1 is considered a housekeeping carrier that is responsible for the bumetanide-sensitive component of Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport across cellular membranes (1Haas M. Forbush B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 2Isenring P. Forbush B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol.

Because of its basolateral localization in polarized cells, this carrier also promotes fluid and electrolyte secretion through a variety of epithelia by cooperating with apically disposed ion transport systems including Cl- channels (13Bachmann O. Wuchner K. Rossmann H. Leipziger J. Osikowska B. Colledge W.H. Ratcliff R. Evans M.J. Gregor M. Seidler U. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 525-536Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Evans R.L.

Several lines of evidence suggest that NKCC1 activity is increased by phosphorylation of its cytosolic termini (see Fig. 1) in response to Cl-i reduction or cell shrinkage. To this effect, recent studies have reported binding of proline-alanine-rich stress-related kinase (PASK) to NKCC1 and provided strong evidence that this interaction leads to phosphorylation-dependent activation of Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport (18Dowd B.F. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27347-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52848-52856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Along the same line, NKCC1 has been found to associate with mitogen-activated protein kinase/p38 and undergo c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-mediated phosphorylation in gel kinase assays (20Piechotta K. Garbarini N. England R. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52848-52856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Klein J.D. Lamitina S.T. O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C425-C431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, however, the mechanisms by which changes in cell volume (ΔVcell) or Cl-i (ΔCl-i) alter these phosphorylation-dependent events are unknown. Further studies have established that several of the key phosphoregulatory regions in NKCC1 are N-terminally located. For example, peptide mapping analyses have led to the detection of phosphoacceptor sites in the middle portion of this domain (22Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 23Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 277: C1184-C1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along the same line, the PASK-NKCC1 interaction was revealed through a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N terminus of a CCC as bait (19Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and in-gel c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase phosphorylation was demonstrated with a fusion protein that contains the first 277 residues of human (hu) NKCC1 (21Klein J.D. Lamitina S.T. O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C425-C431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the C terminus, preliminary data indicate that it too could potentially play an important phosphoregulatory role. Indeed, this domain has been shown to harbor additional phosphoacceptor sites (5Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz E. Forbush B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 25Lytle C. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Payne J.A. Xu J.C.

Lamitina S.T. O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C425-C431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Piechotta et al. (20Piechotta K. Garbarini N. England R. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52848-52856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have recently shown that PASK is able to activate NKCC1 mutants lacking the capacity to associate with the enzyme. Based on these findings, they hypothesized that this kinase is a scaffolding protein for other kinases, and thus that it may play its role by coordinating regulatory activities at phosphoacceptor sites. However, PASK does not fit the usual profile of a scaffolding protein, exhibiting intrinsic kinase activity and sharing no homology with chaperones, cochaperones, or adaptor molecules. In this regard, hsp90 or calnexin would represent alternative candidates considering, moreover, that they have been implicated in a variety of ion transport processes (27Ludt J. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 134: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y.X. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R.

In this study, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to uncover additional regulatory proteins that may interact with the C terminus of NKCC1. We have identified a sequence that belongs to hsp90α and showed that its inhibition by geldanamycin is accompanied by a loss of NKCC1 activation in response to low Cl-i. Provided that such an effect is not caused by other geldanamycin-related events such as the unfolded protein response (31Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and given the ability of hsp90 to associate with multiple cytosolic and integral membrane proteins, it is tempting to postulate that this chaperone plays a more generalized role in Cl-i and Vcell regulation by coordinating the activity or the bioprocessing of multiple ion transport systems during changes in the extracellular environment. Chemicals, Reagents, Kits, and Cell Strains—Unless mentioned otherwise, chemicals, reagents, or kits were from several suppliers. They included the following antibodies (Abs): 1) a mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal Ab (Calbiochem, number MM5–101R), 2) a goat anti-LexA Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, number SC-1726), 3) a mouse anti-hsp90α monoclonal Ab (BD Transduction Laboratories, number 610418), 4) the mouse anti-Squalus acanthias (sa) NKCC1 J3 monoclonal Ab (32Lytle C. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush B. J. Biol.

Vectors and cDNA constructs were propagated in XL1-blue cells (Stratagene). Some of these sequences were also introduced in EGY48 yeasts (Clontech) as described below. Vectors—Subcloning, expression of reporter genes, or DNA amplification was carried out with the following (empty or insert-bearing) vectors: 1) pGilda (Clontech), which contains 5′ to 3′, the vasopressin promoter, a sequence encoding the LexA DNA-binding domain, a multiple cloning site, a His transformation marker, and an ampicillin resistance gene (AMPR); 2) pB42AD (Clontech), which contains the PGAL1 promoter, a sequence encoding the activating domain of a transcription factor and the HA epitope, a multiple cloning site, a Trp transformation marker and an AMPR; 3) p8op-LacZ (Clontech), which contains LexA operators (ops) that can interact with the pB42AD-derived activating domain, two reporter genes (Leu and LacZ) that are under the control of LexA, a Ura transformation marker, and an AMPR; 5) pJB20, an expression vector that contains the strong cytomegalovirus promoter, a geneticin resistance gene and an AMPR; 6) vector pBluescript (Stratagene), which contains a multiple cloning site and an AMPR. NKCC1 Constructs—Two NKCC1 baits were used for the two-hybrid screen (Fig. 1). One consists of a 567-bp (base pair) fragment that encodes the proximal putative cytosolic C terminus of huNKCC1 from residue 9 after the 12th transmembrane domain to residue 197, and the other consists of a 252-bp fragment that encodes the distal C terminus of huNKCC1 from residue 1128–1212. These two fragments were first obtained from an available huNKCC1/vector pBluescript (33Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) through 30 cycles of PCR using the high fidelity PCR master kit (Roche Applied Science) with an XmaI- or EcoRI-capped forward primer and an NcoI- or BamHI-capped reverse primer (see Table II). The PCR fragments (called C1t and C3t) were cloned in pGilda generating C1t/pGilda and C3t/pGilda, which should encode LexA-C1t and LexA-C3t fusion proteins in yeasts.Table IIOligonucleotides used to generate the constructs The lengths of these segments and their positions relative to huNKCC1 and to various domains within huNKCC1 are also indicated.

They are all cloned in the vector pB42AD behind the LexA activating domain and the HA-encoding sequence. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—EGY48 yeasts (Y) were first transformed with the construct p8op-lacZ and seeded on -Ura plates generating the strain Yop. These cells were transformed once more with C1t/pGilda or C3t/pGilda and seeded on -Ura-His plates generating YopC1t or YopC3t. The latter strains were subsequently tested for expression of the hybrid protein by Western blotting (see below and Fig. 2), and they were also tested for autonomous reporter gene activation on -Leu plates containing 80 μg/ml X-galactosidase. A search for interactors was performed by transforming YopC1t and YopC3t cells with human libraries cloned in pB42AD and subjecting the transformants to two rounds of selection, first on -Ura-His-Trp plates and subsequently on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu plates; here, the libraries used were from heart (C1t) and brain (C3t). Resistant colonies were transferred on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu plates containing X-galactosidase and those expressing β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity were amplified in regular yeast medium. Prey plasmids were extracted according to well established procedures, and inserts were analyzed by automated sequencing. Two procedures were carried out to confirm the specificity of the identified interactions. First, Y cells were transformed with a single prey/pB42AD and tested for expression of a hybrid protein by Western blotting (see below and Fig. 2) after selection of colonies on -Trp plates. Second, Yop cells were cotransformed with pairs of plasmids (single prey + empty pGilda versus single prey + LAM/pGilda 2LAM, which stands for human lamin C, has been reported to interact with no other proteins (54Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar).) and tested for reporter gene activation on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu + X-galactosidase plates. Heterologous Expression of NKCC1—Stable cell lines generated in previous studies were used to study the hsp90α-NKCC1 interaction outside of the yeast two-hybrid system (12Caron L. Rousseau F. Gagnon E. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They consist of HEK-293 cells transfected with pJB20M and HEK-293 cells transfected with saNKCC1/pJB20M or huNKCC1/pJB20M. For all of the studies, cell lines were sub-cultured onto polylysine pre-coated plates and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Pretreatment of HEK-293 Cells—The cell lines were subjected to two treatments before protein analyses, influx assays, or immunofluorescence (IF) studies (1Haas M. Forbush B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A 20-min incubation to 37 °C or 42 °C temperatures followed by a 4- or 24-h recovery period in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% serum (2Isenring P. Forbush B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Physiol. 2001; 130: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A 30- or 60-min incubation in a tracer-free hypotonic low Cl- medium (161 mosm, 4 mm Cl-) or in a tracer-free regular medium (322 mosm, 144 mm Cl-); both solutions were supplemented with 10 μm ouabain (see Table I). In some of the studies, 1 μg/ml geldanamycin was added during the recovery period and in the preincubation media. Here, the hypotonic low Cl--medium is used to activate NKCC1 as it has been shown to reduce Cl-i more than an isotonic Cl- medium without leading to swelling- or shrinkage-induced changes in NKCC1 activity; indeed, cotransporters expressed in HEK-293 cells are only weakly sensitive to ΔVcell in the absence of ΔCl-i (1Haas M.

As shown in Table I, various flux media were used. They are all derived from a regular normoosmolar solution, pH 7.4. The ion concentration of this solution was modified by replacing cations with N-methyl-d-glucamine and anions with gluconate, and the osmolality was modified by adding H2O. Subsequent to the preincubation in a low Cl- medium or a regular medium, HEK-293 cells were reincubated for 2 min in a regular medium containing 1 to 2 μCi/ml 86RbCl + 10 μm ouabain ± 250 μm bumetanide. Influxes were terminated by the addition of a tracer-free high K+ medium containing 250 μm bumetanide and 10 μm ouabain followed by several rinses in the same solution. Cells were then solubilized in 2% SDS and 86Rb was detected by liquid β-scintillation counting using the TopCountNXT microplate counter (Packard Instrument Co.). For each condition tested, absolute counts (FA) among 4–8 wells were averaged and converted into flux rates (FR) by normalizing FA to the [85Rb] and [86Rb] used in the flux medium and to the protein content of individual wells (FR = FA × [85Rb]/[86Rb] × influx time in min × protein content in μg). FR among two to three experiments were then reaveraged and expressed as means ± standard error (S.E.). When appropriate, differences between normalized flux rates were analyzed by Student's two tail t tests, and the null hypothesis was rejected for p values < 0.05. Protein Analyses—Cytosolic and membrane proteins were extracted from various cell strains in lysis buffers containing protease inhibitors (see figure legends for composition of solutions). For some experiments, proteins were also immunoprecipitated from precleared cell lysates (∼20 μg/μl of proteins) with different Abs (anti-hsp90α or anti-saNKCC1) through 1-h incubations at 4 °C followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with 30 μl/ml of 10% Sepharose A (Amersham Biosciences). Bound antigens were microcentrifuged afterward at 4 °C (15, 000 × g), washed four times in a high salt solution (500 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween) and released from Sepharose pellets through 2-min incubations at 100 °C in protein sample buffer. Proteins solubilized or immunoprecipitated from membrane extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide Tricine gels (∼6 μg or 10% of an immunoprecipitation reaction/lane), transferred to Immobilon-P nylon blots (Millipore) and revealed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after sequential incubation of the blots with a primary and secondary Ab. Whole-cell extract proteins were quantified with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), whereas protein bands separated by gel electrophoresis were quantified numerically with the National Institutes of Health program Scion Image Beat 4.0.2. When appropriate, differences between band intensities were also analyzed by Student's two tail t tests. Cellular Distribution of NKCC1 and hsp90α—IF studies of pJB20M- or saNKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cells were conducted as described previously (12Caron L. Rousseau F. Gagnon E. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on poly-d-lysine precoated coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized at -20 °C with methanol/acetone, and incubated with Abs (J3 or anti-hsp90α followed by a fluorescent secondary anti-IgG). Coverslips were subsequently mounted on glass slides with Aqua-mount® (Lerner Laboratories), and micrographs were taken with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Sequence Analyses—The bp content of cloned inserts was determined by automated sequencing used plasmid-derived primers (Table II). Blast searches, sequence alignments and structure predictions were carried out with DNAStar (Lasergene), the PLOT program (Biff Forbush), and online programs available through NCBI, EMBL-EBI, and the BCM Search Launcher Web pages. Two-hybrid Screen—The cell strains used for this experiment are called YopC1t and YoptC3t. They consist of p8op-lacZ-transformed EGY48 yeasts retransformed with the plasmid C1t/pGilda, which encodes the proximal huNKCC1 cytosolic C terminus, or with C3t/pGilda, which encodes the distal region of this domain. Transformation of YopC1t with a human heart library/pB42AD and selection of these cells on -Ura-His-Trp plates led to the formation of over 1 million colonies. Of these, 41 grew on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu plates and 32 expressed above-background β-gal activity on -Ura-His- Trp-Leu + X-galactosidase plates. Transformation of YopC3t cells with a human brain library/pB42AD and selection of these cells as above led to the formation of 3.2 million colonies. Of these, 54 survived the quadruple selection step and 34 expressed above-background β-gal activity. Confirmation studies in the yeast system revealed that the identified interactions were specific (not shown). Interestingly, inserts found in the prey plasmids of β-gal positive -Leu-resistant colonies corresponded to the coding regions of 12 different proteins. Seventeen of the inserts (1 from YopC1t and 16 from YopC3t) had nucleotide sequences that encode part of hsp90α (residues 1–243 for the YopC1t-derived prey and 1–245 for the 16 YopC3t-derived preys). Despite the high number of hsp90α preys uncovered (∼25% of the interactors), we observed that a least six of them had a unique 5′-untranslated region. In Fig. 2, Western analyses of Yop cells transformed with C1t/pGilda, C3t/pGilda, and hsp90α1–245/pB42AD showed that the expected hybrid proteins probed with an anti-LexA or anti-HA Ab are produced. Indeed, bands at the adequate molecular size mark are visualized in all lanes. These results indicate that Yop cells transformed with hsp90α + C1t or hsp90α + C3t did not become β-gal positive and -Leu-resistant in the absence of bait or prey expression, confirming further that the hsp90α-NKCC1 interaction is specific in the yeast system. Biochemical Characterization of HEK-293 Cells Before and After a Thermal Stress under Anisotonic Conditions—These studies were carried out to determine the effect of a thermal stress on hsp90α and NKCC1 synthesis in a mammalian cell line and to confirm the hsp90α-NKCC1 interaction outside of the yeast system. The cell lines used included pJB20M-transfected HEK-293 cells, which are known to express huNKCC1, and saNKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cells, which express saNKCC1 in addition to huNKCC1. The latter were preferred over huNKCC1-transfected cells because of the availability of an anti-saNKCC1 monoclonal Ab (called J3) that is a highly sensitive and specific (32Lytle C. Xu J.C.
