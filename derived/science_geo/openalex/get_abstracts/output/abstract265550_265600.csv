https://openalex.org/W2046629365,The hydrocarbon compositions of 11 species of blue-green algae are simple and qualitatively similar. Three marine coccoids contain only monoenoic and dienoic C(19) hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons of the remaining eight species are C(15) to C(18). Hydrocarbons of higher molecular weight (C(20) or more) were not detected. Blue-green algae do not appear to be the source material for the longchain (greater than 20 carbons) hydrocarbons found in ancient sediments.
https://openalex.org/W1967193080,"A new method for equilibrating water containing alkane hydrocarbons with a gas phase and analyzing the gas for hydrocarbon content by gas chromatography extends analytical sensitivity to better than 0.1 part per billion. The solubilities at 25 degrees C of the normal C(9) (220 parts per billion) and C(10) (52 parts per billion) alkanes decrease with increasing carbon number. A discontinuity occurs at the normal C(11), alkane, probably because of a change from true solubility (molecular dispersion) to accommodation (aggregation)."

https://openalex.org/W1982329265,"Flower-visiting beetles of the genus Acmaeodera (Buprestidae) bear a striking resemblance to Hymenoptera in flight. Unlike most other beetles, they fly with their membranous hindwings only, and their forewings, which are inseparably coupled and permanently held over the abdomen, bear color markings commonly found on the abdomens of bees and wasps."
