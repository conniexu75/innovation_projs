An unusual family of enzymes, the superoxide dismutases, protect against the deleterious actions of this radical by catalyzing its dismutation to hydrogen peroxide plus oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1998162329,"Previous studies from our laboratories have demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the thymidine kinase (tk) gene from restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA to cultured mammalian cells. In this study, high molecular weight DNA from cells containing only one copy of the HSV gene coding for tk was successfully used to transform L+K-cells to the tk+ phenotype. The acquired phenotype was demonstrated to be donor-derived by analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of the tk activity, and the presence of HSV DNA sequences in the recipient cells was demonstrated. In companion experiments, we used high molecular weight DNA derived from tissues and cultured cells of a variety of species to transfer tk activity. The tk+ mouse cells transformed with human DNA were shown to express human type tk activity as determined by isoelectric focusing."

https://openalex.org/W1488907873,"Abstract Adenylate cyclase can be resolved into at least two proteins, a thermolabile, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive component and a second protein (or proteins) that is more stable to either of these treatments. Neither component by itself catalyzes the formation of cyclic AMP using MgATP as substrate. However, mixture of the two reconstitutes MgATP-dependent fluoride- and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p)-stimulatable adenylate cyclase activity. The more stable component can be resolved from the first in various tissues or cultured cells by treatment of membrnes or detergent extracts with heat or N-ethylmaleimide. The two proteins have also been resolved genetically in two clonal cell lines that are deficient in adenylate cyclase activity. An adenylate cyclase-deficient variant of the S49 lymphoma cell (AC-) contains only the thermolabile activity, while the activity of the more stable protein is found in a complementary hepatoma cell line (HC-1). In addition, AC-S49 cell plasma membranes contain MnATP-dependent adenylate cyclase activity. The protein that catalyzes this reaction appears to be the same as that which can combine with the thermostable component to reconstitute Mg2+-dependent enzyme activity because both activities co-fractionate by gel exclusion chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, both activities have identical denaturation kinetics at 30 degrees C, and both activities are stabilized at 30 degrees C and labilized at 0 degree C by various nucleotides and divalent cations with similar specificity. It is thus hypothesized that the thermolabile factor is the catalytic subunit of the physiological adenylate cyclase and that the Mn2+-dependent activity is a nonphysiological expression of the catalytic protein. The thermostable moiety of the enzyme, which is proposed to serve a regulatory function, appears to consist of two functional components, based upon differential thermal lability of its ability to reconstitute hormone-, NaF-, or Gpp(NH)p-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These components have not, however, been physically separated. The thermolabile and thermostable components can interact in detergent solution or in a suitable membrane. Mixing of the detergent-solubilized regulatory component with AC-membranes that contain only the catalytic protein and beta-adrenergic receptors reconstitutes catecholamine-stimulatable adenylate cyclase activity; however, addition of the catalytic protein to membranes that contain receptor and the regulatory component yields MgATP-dependent enzymatic activity that is unresponsive to hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1619707557,"Abstract GH4C1 cells are a clonal strain of rat pituitary tumor cells which synthesize and secrete prolactin and growth hormone. Somatostatin, a hypothalamic tetradecapeptide, inhibits the release of growth hormone and, under certain circumstances, also prolactin from normal pituitary cells. We have prepared [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin (approximately 2200 C1/mmol) and have shown that this ligand binds to a limited number of high affinity sites on GH4C1 cells. Half-maximal binding of somatostatin occurred at a concentration of 6 x 10(-10) M. A maximum of 0.11 pmol of [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin was bound per mg of cell protein, equivalent to 13,000 receptor sites per cell. The rate constant for binding (kon) was 8 x 10(7) M(-1) min(-1). The rate constant for dissociation (koff) was determined by direct measurement to be 0.02 min(-1) both in the presence and absence of excess nonradioactive somatostatin. Binding of [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin was not inhibited by 10(-7) M thyrotropin-releasing hormones. Substance P, neurotensin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, calcitonin, adrenocorticotropin, or insulin. Of seven nonpituitary cell lines tested, none had specific receptors for somatostatin. Somatostatin was shown to inhibit prolactin and growth hormone production by CH4C1 cells. The dose-response characteristics for binding and the biological actions of somatostatin were essentially coincident. Furthermore, among several clonal pituitary cell strains tested, only those which had receptors for somatostatin showed a biological response to the hormone. We conclude that the characterized somatostatin receptor is necessary for the biological actions of somatostatin on GH4C1 cells."

Affected visual cells are deficient in cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity and have elevated levels of cyclic GMP. The biochemical abnormalities observed in affected retinas of Irish Setters are similar to those in the retinas of mice with inherited retinal degeneration before visual cell degeneration begins. A defect in cyclic GMP metabolism may be characteristic of early-onset degenerative diseases of the retina, possibly including those that affect humans."

https://openalex.org/W2086335200,"The sizes and map positions of the major late lytic SV40 cytoplasmic mRNAs and the abundant nuclear RNA species have been determined by the technique of Berk and Sharp (1977, 1978). From these experiments, the coding sequences (bodies) of the 16S and 19S late cytoplasmic SV40 RNAs have been located at 0.935–0.17 and 0.765–0.17 map units, respectively. The cytoplasmic 16S RNA molecules contain a leader sequence of approximately 210 nucleotides, corresponding to SV40 map positions 0.72–0.76 units, spliced to the coding sequences. In a population of the late 19S RNA molecules, there are several different leader segments, each spliced to the same coding sequences. The size of these 19S leader RNA segments was estimated to be 50–70, 100–120 and 200–210 nucleotides in length. The 5′ ends of the 19S leader RNA segments were located at 0.72, 0.71, 0.695 and 0.69 map units. An analysis of the nuclear viral RNAs has provided insight into the biogenesis of the cytoplasmic messages. Poly (A)-containing nuclear RNA has a number of species in addition to those found in the cytoplasm. The 3′ ends of the poly (A)-containing RNAs map at 0.17 SV40 units. The 5′ ends of the more abundant nuclear molecules map approximately at 0.72, 0.70, 0.67, 0.64 and 0.59 units. Since these nuclear SV40 RNA molecules are both colinear with the viral DNA and larger than the cytoplasmic mRNAs, they may represent intermediates in a stepwise processing system. Alternatively, the variation in 5′ ends of nuclear SV40 transcripts may represent a number of separate initiation sites for transcription. The presence of the intervening RNA sequences (between the leader and the coding sequences of the mature mRNAs) in these nuclear RNA molecules suggests that the synthesis of “spliced” SV40 RNA involves the direct transcription of the DNA sequences and the subsequent splicing out of the intervening segment of RNA. Evaluation of the more abundant nonpolyadenylated nuclear RNA molecules showed that they have the same 5′ ends as the poly (A)-containing nuclear RNAs. The 3′ ends of the nonpolyadenylated RNA molecules map heterogeneously in a broad region extending beyond 0.28 map units. The presence of these long nuclear viral transcripts suggests that transcription of late SV40 RNA does not terminate at 0.17 map units. The location of poly (A) in mature cytoplasmic viral RNA at 0.17 map units suggests that poly (A) addition to RNA molecules may occur by a specific cleavage of the longer transcripts. Based on these analyses, we propose that the longer non-polyadenylated viral RNA molecules in the nuclei of SV40-infected cells may represent the primary transcripts. While their 5′ termini are being processed, the specific addition of poly (A) at 0.17 map units takes place. The polyadenylation of RNA is followed by splicing events to generate the cytoplasmic forms of SV40 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2040030902,"Injections of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the periaqueductal gray matter of drug-naive rats resulted in a dose-dependent opiate abstinence syndrome characterized by fearful hyperreactivity and explosive motor behavior. Injecting shorter chains of ACTH caused attenuated forms of this behavior. Injections of β-endorphin at this same site caused opposite behavior: sedative, analgesic, and catatonic. If the effects of morphine are mediated by two classes of receptor) and the other which is not stereospecific and naloxone-insensitive—the endogtor)—and the other which is not stereospecific and naloxone-insensitive the endogenous ligand of the second receptor may be ACTH. The neuropeptides ACTH and endorphin may be part of an integrated neuromodulatory system, and the opiate abstinence syndrome may be the result of an altered interaction between the two receptor systems."

https://openalex.org/W1579064220,"Glucose suppresses the synthesis of catalase and of peroxidase in Escherichia coli. Exhaustion of the glucose present in a complex medium, or abrupt transfer of cells from a glucose-containing to a glucose-free medium, resulted in a sharp increase in both catalase and peroxidase. The glucose effect was diminished by CAMP, added to the suspending medium, thus identifying it as a catabolite repression. Aerobic growth of E. coli compared to anaerobic growth caused a large increase in catalase and peroxidase. This was not dependent upon either 02 or HzOz, since a similar induction was caused by the addition of NOs-, under anaerobic conditions. Mutants defective in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone were also defective in the ability to induce the synthesis of catalase and peroxidase. p-Hydroxybenzoate, which imparts phenotypic normality to these respiratory mutants, restored normal induction of catalase and peroxidase. Catalase and peroxidase were thus co-induced with the components of the respiratory chain. In all cases of induction of peroxidase and catalase, the increase in the former preceded that of the latter. Furthermore, the increase in peroxidase was transitory, whereas catalase increased to a more stable plateau. E. coli can generate two electrophoretically distinct catalases. One of these is constitutive and was present even in anaerobically grown or in glucoserepressed cells, whereas the other appeared only when the synthesis of catalase was derepressed in the absence of glucose by oxygen or nitrate."

The oligomer d[pT-T-A-G-C-A-G-A-A--C-C-G-G] is complementary to a region near the N terminal coding region of the yeast cyc 1 gene. Of several yeast Eco RI fragments which hybridize to this probe, one is changed in size by a G leads to T mutation which eliminates an Eco RI site within the cyc 1 gene. Both the wild-type and the RI- mutant forms were cloned in lambda gt vectors. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing for 91 nucleotides into the coding region for iso-1-cytochrome c yielded a DNA sequence in perfect correspondence with the known protein sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2089301377,"Binding studies of thyroid hormone to submitochondrial fractions from rat liver suggest that the component responsible for high-affinity, low-capacity (saturable) binding of hormones arises from the inner mitochondrial membrane. The partially purified component, approximately 150,000 daltons, appears to be half protein and half lipid, largely phospholipids, tentatively identified as lecithin, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and cardiolipin. A similar hormone-binding macromolecule was found in mitochondria from rabbit kidney, from human liver and kidney, and from rat kidney, myocardium, skeletal muscle, intestinal mucosa, whole small intestine, adipose tissue, and lung. It was absent from mitochondria of adult rat brain, spleen, and testis, organs calorigenically unresponsive to thyroid hormones injected in vivo, but was present in mitochondria from brains of rats 12 days old and younger. The organ distribution of the hormone-binding protein and its presence in neonatal brain mitochondria supports the biological relevance of the mitochondrial component as a thyroid hormone receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2020479042,"Hr-t mutants of polyoma virus are restricted in their growth properties (host range) and defective in cell transformation and tumor induction. The present study indicates that these mutants have lost the ability to induce morphological transformation, but have retained a mitogenic function. Thus an early and dramatic difference between wild-type virus and hr-t mutant-infected cultures of rat fibroblasts is the morphological change in individual cells observed by light, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Viruses containing an intact hr-t function (wild-type virus and ts-a mutants) induce a transformed phenotype consisting of stellate cell shape, loss of defined cytoplasmic actin architecture, cellular “under-lapping,” and increased nuclear and nucleolar sizes. These prominent alterations constitute an abortive transformation, peaking 24–48 hr post-infection, and subsequently resolving in most or all of the cells. In contrast, cells infected with hr-t mutants do not develop the above structural changes, but rather retain their preinfection appearance. Both wild-type virus and hr-t mutants induce cellular DNA synthesis in confluent monolayers of rat cells beginning 12–14 hr post-infection. Flow microfluorometric (FMF) analysis confirms the viral mediated transit of cells from the G1 to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, as well as an increase in the proportion of cells with an 8N (octaploid) DNA content. Approximately 50% of the clones isolated from wild-type-infected cultures are polyploid. Stable transformants are found among these polyploid clones, but the majority of the latter resemble the parental cells in their morphology and growth properties. Polyploid clones are derived from hr-t mutant-infected cultures at a much lower frequency, similar to that of mock-infected cultures. Data obtained by sequential labeling of infected cultures with 3H-thymidine and 5-bromo-deoxyuridine, together with cell number quantitation, indicate that hr-t mutants promote only a single round of cell division, while the wild-type virus and ts-a mutants promote multiple rounds. Loss of the hr-t function in polyoma virus there fore reveals a residual viral mitogenic activity, but prevents the virus from effecting morphological transformation of cells with concomitant loss of defined actin cables, polyploidization and multiple cycles of cell division in confluent cultures."

https://openalex.org/W1978882069,"Chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed with the Ta and ts68 mutants of Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV) were enucleated and studied for their capacity to express reversibly the transformed phenotype in response to temperature changes. After shift to the permissive temperature (35 degrees C), the cytoplasts acquired a transformed morphology and displayed characteristic ruffles and microvilli at their surface. As detected by immunofluorescence, they also lost their actin filament cables and exhibited characteristic changes in the pattern of cell surface structures containing LETS protein. Expression of all these transformation parameters was reversible after shiftback to the nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees C). These results indicate that a whole set of changes characteristic for the transformed phenotype can be expressed independently of the cell nucleus. In contrast, ts mutant-infected cytoplasts were no longer able to respond to temperature shifts with changes in their hexose transport rate. Cytoplasts prepared from cells grown at 41 degrees C retained their low rate of hexose uptake after shift to 35 degrees C, whereas cytoplasts from cells grown at 35 degrees C exhibited a high rate of hexose transport even after 10 hr of shift to 41 degrees C. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the product of the src gene of RSV represents a multifunctional protein which acts independently on nuclear and extranuclear sites."
https://openalex.org/W2047750643,The Ca2+-dependent regulator protein of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase was labeled with 125I to the extent of 1 mol of monoiodotyrosine per mol. The iodinated protein showed a small decrease in affinity for phosphodiesterase but gave the same maximal level of activation of the enzyme as did the unmodified regulator protein. Iodinated regulator protein formed complexes with both highly purified cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and phosphodiesterase inhibitory protein in the presence but not in the absence of Ca2+ as demonstrated by ultracentrifugation in glycerol gradients. Cross-linking experiments indicate that the Ca2+-dependent regulator protein interacts with the large subunit of the inhibitory protein.
https://openalex.org/W2078628486,"We have isolated mutants of SV40-transformed BALB/3T3 cells adapted to grow in picolinic acid. A line of cells, derived from the mutant cells, that multiplies in the absence of serum has also been characterized. From ultrafiltrates of medium conditioned by contact with these cell lines, we have identified and partially purified a highly specific iron-binding ligand termed siderophore-like growth factor (SGF). Experiments have indicated that the factor is a peptide(s) of approximately 1600 daltons. In nanogram amounts, SGF solubilizes and binds Fe 3+ in vitro and stimulates the uptake of Fe 3+ in vivo. The Fe 3+ uptake preceded the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by the factor in the mutant cell lines. The factor could not be separated into Fe 3+ binding and DNA synthetic activity, suggesting that the early iron uptake is an integral component of the proliferative response. These data support the hypothesis that SGF is representative of a family of mammalian siderophores which may have an important role in cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1509106527,"Electrode measurements of the average number of H+ ejected and K+ taken up (in the presence of valinomycin) per pair of electrons passing the energy-conserving sites of the respiratory chain of rat liver and rat heart mitochondria have given identical values of the H+/site and 5+/site ratios very close to 4 in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of interfering respiration-coupled uptake of H+ + H2PO4-. The K+/site uptake ratio of 4 not only shows that inward movement of K+ provides quantitative charge-compensation for the 4 H+ ejected, but also confirms that 4 charges are separated per pair of electrons per site. When N-ethylmaleimide is omitted, the H+/site ejection ratio is depressed, because of the interfering secondary uptake of H/+ with H2PO4- on the phosphate carrier, but the K+/site uptake ratio remains at 4.0. Addition of phosphate or acetate, which can carry H+ into respiring mitochondria, further depresses the H+/site ratio, but does not affect the K+/site ratio, which remains at 4.0. These and other considerations thus confirm our earlier stoichiometric measurements that the average H+/site ratio is 4.0 and also show that the K+/site uptake ratio can be used as a measure of the intrinsic H+/site ratio, regardless of the presence of phosphate in the medium and without the necessity of adding N-ethylmaleimide or other inhibitors of H+ + H2PO4- transport."
https://openalex.org/W2085873624,"We have investigated the copy number, chromosomal subunit conformation and regulation of expression of integrated avian retrovirus genomes. Our results indicate that there are approximately two copies of the endogenous viral genomes (RAV-O) per haploid cell genome in uninfected chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and red blood cells (RBC). The copy number and subunit conformation (as measured by DNAase I sensitivity) of the RAV-O genomes are independent of the level of expression of these viral DNA sequences. In cells isolated from embryos of the V+, gs−chf− and gs+chf+ phenotypes, approximately one of the two viral genomes is in a DNAase I-sensitive conformation. Upon infection with an exogenous Rous sarcoma virus (PR-RSV-C), one new viral genome is integrated per haploid CEF genome. The newly integrated RSV genome is completely sensitive to DNAase I, and the subunit conformation of the endogenous viral genomes is not altered by the integration of additional exogenous proviruses. Both the endogenous and newly integrated exogenous viral genomes are present in “nu-body” structures, and the selective sensitivity of these proviral DNA sequences to DNAase I is maintained in isolated nucleosomes. Our experiments revealing the DNAase I sensitivity of one of the two RAV-O genomes in gs−chf− CEF led us to reexamine the level of viral specific RNA in CEF of various GS genotypes. We find that CEF contain approximately 100 copies of viral RNA per cell, CEF contain no detectable viral RNA, and the heterozygote CEF contain approximately 50 copies of viral specific RNA per cell. These results suggest that the GS gene controls production of RAV-O RNA sequences in CEF in a “cis” fashion. In RBCs, however, the expression of the RAV-O genome is independent of the GS gene, with both and RBCs containing roughly equivalent amounts of viral specific RNA. Our results suggest that the chromosomal structure of the endogenous viral genes is independent of the GS gene, and that the GS gene is cis-acting and tissue-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2057971376,"The dual host range virus HIX has been previously characterized as an envelope gene recombinant between Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) and an unidentified xenotropic murine leukemia virus. Using long reverse transcripts of Mo-MuLV, a region of nonhomology has been mapped by electron microscopic analysis of heteroduplexes formed with HIX 35S virion RNA. In this nonhomology region, the Mo-MuLV cDNA strand measured approximately 900 nucleotides, mapping between 1.6 and 2.5 kilobases from the 3' end. In a previous study, hybridization of Mo-MuLV 21S RNA with Mo-MuLV cDNA resulted in the formation of different heteroduplex structures diagnostic of a noncontiguously coded leader sequence at the 5' end of the 21S RNA. Following hybridization of poly(A)+ HIX 21S RAN with 8.2 kb Mo-MuLV cDNA, analogous heteroduplex structures were observed exhibiting the Mo-MuLV:HIX substitution loop in the DNA:RNA segment of the molecules. This analysis permitted more precise mapping of the nonhomology region with respect to the splice point in the 21S presumptive glycoprotein mRNA. The mapping of this nonhomology region in HIX virus provides an internal visual marker for the 3' end of the genome which may prove useful in future analyses of other deletion or substitution derivatives of Mo-MuLV."

https://openalex.org/W1604182675,"The nucleotide sequence of polyoma DNA, from near the Hpa II 3/5 unction to the Hpa II 4/ae III 18 junction has been determined by the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert (Maxam, A., and Gilbert, W. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 560–564). The sequence contains 878 base paris, including the origin of DNA replication and the region known to encode the hr-t function. The region corresponding to the origin of DNA replication contains several short-repeated sequences and palindromes. There is a 30-base-pair region with striking similarity to the corresponding region of SV40, and, as in SV40, a portion of that sequence is capable of forming a stable hairpin loop. In the region encoding the hr-t function, there is apparently a single open reading frame extending from position 188 to theHpa III 4/Hae III 18 junction. The potential translation product of this open frame begins with an initiation codon starting at position 188, and the first five amino acids of this product are Met-Asp-Arg-Val-Leu. This sequence is similar to the NH2-terminal five amino acids of SV40 small t-antigen known from nucleotide and amino acid sequencing to be Met-Asp-Lys-Val-Leu."

The microinjected cells were infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 (tsA209) which is defective in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis. Using in situ hybridization as an assay method, we found that PEG-microinjection of both partially and highly purified T antigen resulted in an increase in the amount of viral DNA sequences in the monolayer. Moreover, 3H-thymidine-labeled and unlabeled Hirt supernatant from microinjected, tsA209-injected cells contained significantly more SV40 DNA than comparable extracts from sham-injected, tsA209-infected or uninfected cells, which were tested in parallel. Thus the introduction of highly purified, ""large"" SV40 T antigen led to phenotypic complementation of the tsA defect in viral DNA synthesis."

Glucagon1-21 stimulates hepatic adenylate cyclase activity to the same extent as native glucagon but with 0.1% the potency. Glucagon1-21 also displayed 0.1% the binding affinity of native glucagon to the glucagon receptor in hepatic membranes. Glucagon22-29 alone or in combination with glucagon1-21 did not activate adenylate cyclase or displase 125I-glucagon from its receptor.

In the reverse reaction, only the A isomer of adenosine-5'-[2-thiotriphosphate] is synthesized from adenosine-5'-[2-thiodiphosphate] and carbamyl-P as determined by 31P NMR and a coupled enzymatic assay with Cd2+- hexokinase. It is therefore proposed that carbamyl phosphate synthetase uses the same diastereomer of MgATP at both ATP sites."
