It has been our experience that these methods not only require considerable skill, but also they are lengthy and sensitive to slight variation of the conditions. We have therefore attempted to develop a simple quantitative colorimetric procedure. Preliminary experiments showed that the anthrone3 and the α-naphthol sulphonate4 reagents give good results with pure sugar solutions, but the presence of only traces of solvents such as butanol, phenol and propionic acid used in the chromatographic separation of the sugars rendered them useless."

This claim was based on the following passages in a letter to Mulder, the Dutch chemist, dated July 10, 1838:"

This indicates that the ribonucleo-protein particles (microsomes) subsist in the cytoplasm only in the presence of the nucleus. However, this nuclear control is not immediate, for the ribonucleic acid content of non-nucleated fragments drops significantly only after the fourth day following enucleation."

The theory and use of buffered columns have been previously described3–5. In the separation of the penicillins, buffered filter paper has been used6, and the difficulty of obtaining absolute RF values for such separations has been noted7. The water-insoluble alkaloids of ergot have been separated on unbuffered paper8."

Practically the whole of the urinary iodine (545 mgm. per diem) was accounted for by the presence of a mixture of 3 : 5-diiodo-4-hydroxy- and, somewhat surprisingly, 3 : 5-diiodo-4-methoxy-benzoic acids in approximately equal proportions."

The damage was attributed to unfavourable soil conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2020954631,"FOURTH instar larvæ and pupæ referable to Culex (Culex) torrentium Martini were taken in some abundance from water-tanks on allotments at Isleworth, Middlesex, by Mr. Bowles, of the Health Department, on June 19 of this year. They were sent for identification, together with emergent adults, to the British Museum. The name torrentium, is applied provisionally since, as Natvig1 has pointed out, the synonymy of the group is somewhat obscure and requires further investigation. There can, however, be little doubt that this is the Scandinavian species described by Natvig as torrentium."

When this observation was made, all the available ewes but one had lambed. A small-scale test was made to determine whether antibodies to parasitic nematodes could be detected in the colostrum of nematode-infected ewes and whether their offspring acquired these antibodies as a result of suckling."

https://openalex.org/W2010565085,"PARALLEL measurements of the electrical conductivity and bacterial count in a solution containing glucose and peptone, in which a small amount of inoculum of Bact. subtilis has been introduced, show the typical lag, logarithmic and stationary phases, and have brought out the striking result that, even before the multiplication of bacteria takes place, there is an appreciable increase in conductivity. This result is to be attributed to the initial activity of bacteria through their multi-enzyme systems in splitting up the peptone in the medium into aminoacids, which are absorbed by the bacteria from the surrounding medium and provide the nutrient material for their growth. Chemical estimation of the amino-acids formed in the medium revealed a close parallelism between their concentration and the electrical conductivity of the suspension at various stages of bacterial growth. This investigation has thus clearly shown that amino-acid formation takes place through bacterial action in the medium before the bacteria begin to multiply."

Thus, for example, the body temperature of the hedgehog may decrease during hibernation to about 2° C. When the animal wakes from hibernation, its body temperature rises in some hours from 2°–5° C. to 30°–35° C. again, and the animal returns to homoiothermy."

Recent samples of phosphorus-32 have, however, been free from this impurity. This impurity is of serious consequence when measurements of the radioactivity of proteins labelled with phosphorus-32 are to be made, as the impurity is carried down on protein precipitates, where it remains in spite of repeated washing."
