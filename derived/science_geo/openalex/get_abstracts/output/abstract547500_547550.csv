https://openalex.org/W2188593832,"Host-microbiome co-evolution drives homeostasis and disease susceptibility, yet regulatory principles governing the integrated intestinal host-commensal microenvironment remain obscure. While inflammasome signaling participates in these interactions, its activators and microbiome-modulating mechanisms are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the microbiota-associated metabolites taurine, histamine, and spermine shape the host-microbiome interface by co-modulating NLRP6 inflammasome signaling, epithelial IL-18 secretion, and downstream anti-microbial peptide (AMP) profiles. Distortion of this balanced AMP landscape by inflammasome deficiency drives dysbiosis development. Upon fecal transfer, colitis-inducing microbiota hijacks this microenvironment-orchestrating machinery through metabolite-mediated inflammasome suppression, leading to distorted AMP balance favoring its preferential colonization. Restoration of the metabolite-inflammasome-AMP axis reinstates a normal microbiota and ameliorates colitis. Together, we identify microbial modulators of the NLRP6 inflammasome and highlight mechanisms by which microbiome-host interactions cooperatively drive microbial community stability through metabolite-mediated innate immune modulation. Therefore, targeted ""postbiotic"" metabolomic intervention may restore a normal microenvironment as treatment or prevention of dysbiosis-driven diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2181471414,"Microbial functions in the host physiology are a result of the microbiota-host co-evolution. We show that cold exposure leads to marked shift of the microbiota composition, referred to as cold microbiota. Transplantation of the cold microbiota to germ-free mice is sufficient to increase insulin sensitivity of the host and enable tolerance to cold partly by promoting the white fat browning, leading to increased energy expenditure and fat loss. During prolonged cold, however, the body weight loss is attenuated, caused by adaptive mechanisms maximizing caloric uptake and increasing intestinal, villi, and microvilli lengths. This increased absorptive surface is transferable with the cold microbiota, leading to altered intestinal gene expression promoting tissue remodeling and suppression of apoptosis-the effect diminished by co-transplanting the most cold-downregulated strain Akkermansia muciniphila during the cold microbiota transfer. Our results demonstrate the microbiota as a key factor orchestrating the overall energy homeostasis during increased demand."
https://openalex.org/W2188873428,"The centrosome is the primary microtubule organizing center of the cells and templates the formation of cilia, thereby operating at a nexus of critical cellular functions. Here, we use proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map the centrosome-cilium interface; with 58 bait proteins we generate a protein topology network comprising >7,000 interactions. Analysis of interaction profiles coupled with high resolution phenotypic profiling implicates a number of protein modules in centriole duplication, ciliogenesis, and centriolar satellite biogenesis and highlights extensive interplay between these processes. By monitoring dynamic changes in the centrosome-cilium protein interaction landscape during ciliogenesis, we also identify satellite proteins that support cilia formation. Systematic profiling of proximity interactions combined with functional analysis thus provides a rich resource for better understanding human centrosome and cilia biology. Similar strategies may be applied to other complex biological structures or pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2184709292,"The intestinal mucosal barrier controlling the resident microbiome is dependent on a protective mucus layer generated by goblet cells, impairment of which is a hallmark of the inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis. Here, we show that IL-18 is critical in driving the pathologic breakdown of barrier integrity in a model of colitis. Deletion of Il18 or its receptor Il18r1 in intestinal epithelial cells (Δ/EC) conferred protection from colitis and mucosal damage in mice. In contrast, deletion of the IL-18 negative regulator Il18bp resulted in severe colitis associated with loss of mature goblet cells. Colitis and goblet cell loss were rescued in Il18bp(-/-);Il18r(Δ/EC) mice, demonstrating that colitis severity is controlled at the level of IL-18 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. IL-18 inhibited goblet cell maturation by regulating the transcriptional program instructing goblet cell development. These results inform on the mechanism of goblet cell dysfunction that underlies the pathology of ulcerative colitis."

Understanding the complex interactions of these components is essential for many fields of biology and often requires high-dimensional information across many scales. Although it is desirable to obtain such information from the same tissue due to large individual variations, combined measurement of many molecular and anatomical traits remains an unmet goal in biology despite the remarkable success of current pioneering methods, such as array tomography (Micheva et al., 2010Micheva K.D.

Rapidly evolving tissue-clearing techniques may enable multiplexed labeling and imaging of intact samples using light microscopy (Chung et al., 2013Chung K. Wallace J. Kim S.-Y. Kalyanasundaram S.

For instance, the CLARITY technique has demonstrated three rounds of immunostaining of mouse brain tissue (Chung et al., 2013Chung K. Wallace J. Kim S.-Y. Kalyanasundaram S. Andalman A.S. Davidson T.J. Mirzabekov J.J. Zalocusky K.A. Mattis J. Denisin A.K. et al.Structural and molecular interrogation of intact biological systems.Nature. 2013; 497: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). However, we have noticed that the polyacrylamide-based framework loses structural integrity upon repeated exposure to the elution condition. Recent reports also suggest that preservation of antigenicity in the CLARITY method may not be optimal (Renier et al., 2014Renier N. Wu Z. Simon D.J. Yang J. Ariel P. Tessier-lavigne M. iDISCO: A Simple, Rapid Method to Immunolabel Large Tissue Samples for Volume Imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 896-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the necessary tissue-gel hybridization step requires delivery of charged thermal initiators with limited diffusivity and stability. This necessity imposes a limit on the tissue size that can be processed without the use of transcardial perfusion. We set our goal to develop a simple, scalable, and generalizable tissue-processing method for proteomic imaging of intact biological systems. To achieve this, we created SWITCH (system-wide control of interaction time and kinetics of chemicals), which tightly controls a broad range of chemical reactions in tissue processing via a set of buffers: a SWITCH-On buffer that facilitates chemical reactions between exogenous chemicals and endogenous biomolecules, and a SWITCH-Off buffer that suppresses the reactions. SWITCH-mediated fixation transforms tissue into a heat- and chemical-resistant hybrid while preserving tissue architecture, native molecules, and their antigenicity to a degree suitable for multiplexed proteomic imaging. The hybrids can be rapidly cleared at high temperature without damage. The method does not require perfusion and is thus applicable to both animal and large human samples. In molecular labeling of the processed samples, SWITCH controls probe-target binding kinetics to improve probe penetration depth and the uniformity of molecular labeling. This method is simple, passive, and does not require any special equipment or reagents. Using SWITCH, we demonstrated that a minimum of 22 rounds of molecular labeling of a banked postmortem human tissue with precise co-registration of multiple datasets at single-cell resolution is possible. We also demonstrated extraction of a wide range of system variables, such as various cell types and microvasculature from a single sample. In summary, we have developed simple tissue processing methods and a volumetric co-registration algorithm that can be readily adopted by most laboratories for scalable proteomic imaging of intact biological systems. First, we sought to develop a way to transform animal and human samples into a mechanically and chemically stable form for multiplexed imaging. We hypothesized that small, non-ionic, multifunctional crosslinkers might satisfy two key requirements for such a transformation: (1) rapid penetration without the use of perfusion and (2) a high degree of molecular crosslinking to improve sample durability (Hopwood, 1972Hopwood D. Theoretical and practical aspects of glutaraldehyde fixation.Histochem. J. 1972; 4: 267-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, Sung et al., 1996Sung H.W. Hsu H.L. Shih C.C. Lin D.S. Cross-linking characteristics of biological tissues fixed with monofunctional or multifunctional epoxy compounds.Biomaterials. 1996; 17: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Among many options, we chose to evaluate the following owing to their small size and high water solubility (Figure 1A): ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDGE), dipropylene glycol diglycidyl ether (GE23), 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (GE21), glycerol polyglycidyl ether (EX-313), and glutaraldehyde (GA). We found that all of these chemicals except GE23 formed a solid gel upon incubation with 15% bovine serum albumin (BSA), indicating the formation of a crosslinked network (Figure 1B). We examined the stability of the gels along with polyacrylamide (AA)-BSA gels by measuring the change in their volume after incubation in a 200 mM SDS solution heated to 80°C (elution condition). AA-BSA gels swelled and became fragile after exposure to the harsh condition (Figures 1B and 1C), whereas multi-functional fixative-BSA gels maintained their structural integrity. In particular, GA-BSA gels showed minimal volume change at a wide range of BSA and GA concentrations, whereas others only gelled at high protein concentrations (Figure 1C). This result indicates that multifunctional fixatives alone might be sufficient to form a stable matrix that can withstand the harsh elution condition. However, because the average protein content throughout mouse brain samples is around 10% and may be lower within certain regions, we decided that GA is the crosslinker most likely to form a uniform framework throughout all regions of a sample. Next, we asked whether GA can rapidly penetrate tissue to form a uniform tissue-gel without the use of perfusion, which is required for processing most human clinical samples. We incubated a non-fixed whole adult rat brain in PBS containing 1% GA for 2 days and characterized the GA penetration depth and gel formation. Although the small size of GA should make it highly mobile, only the outer layer of the brain was fixed (Figure 1F). When a coronal slice from the middle of the brain was exposed to the elution condition, the core of the tissue completely disintegrated, indicating that no gel matrix had formed in the center of the brain (Figure 1F). Limited GA penetration has significantly hampered its use in preserving large postmortem tissues (Hopwood, 1967Hopwood D. Some aspects of fixation with glutaraldehyde. A biochemical and histochemical comparison of the effects of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde fixation on various enzymes and glycogen, with a note on penetration of glutaraldehyde into liver.J. Anat. 1967; 101: 83-92PubMed Google Scholar). We suspect that rapid reaction of GA with native biomolecules within the outer layer of the brain may cause depletion of GA molecules before they can reach the core. To overcome this issue, we sought to control the reaction kinetics of GA and biomolecules throughout the system using the SWITCH approach to achieve uniform tissue preservation. We noted that the GA reaction rate is pH-dependent (Hopwood, 1970Hopwood D. The reactions between formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, and their fixation effects o bovine serum albumin and on tissue blocks.Histochemie. 1970; 24: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we titrated solutions of GA and BSA to pH 3, GA-BSA gel formation time increased by nearly 200-fold (Figure 1D). Using this pH dependence, we were able to disperse GA uniformly throughout a sample by switching off the crosslinking reaction with a low-pH buffer (Figure 1E, left). After 2 days of incubation at low pH, we switched on sample-wide GA-tissue crosslinking by shifting the pH of the sample to a neutral pH (Figure 1E, right). Using this passive buffer-switching approach, we were able to achieve complete GA penetration and uniform gel formation throughout the entire rat brain (Figure 1F). We next asked whether the GA-tissue-gel has mechanical and chemical properties desirable for multiplexing-based proteomic imaging. Proteomic imaging requires (1) high preservation of endogenous biomolecules and their antigenicity, (2) high structural integrity, and (3) minimal tissue damage during repeated cycles of destaining, labeling, and imaging processes. We first tested whether endogenous biomolecules are well preserved by measuring protein loss after clearing (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found that control tissues lost an average of 30%–40% protein and AA-tissue-gel lost 10%–20%, but GA-tissue-gel slices lost only 3%–5% of their protein content (Figure 1G). We next asked whether antigenicity of the retained biomolecules is well preserved. We tested 90 antibodies, targeting biomolecules of different sizes (single amino acid to proteins) and subcellular localizations (membrane bound, cytoplasm, nucleus, synapses). Surprisingly, 86 of 90 antibodies were compatible with GA-tissue-gel (Figures 1H, and 1I, and S1; Table S1). Note that even small molecules, such as dopamine, which are not typically compatible with PFA-fixation, were observable in GA-tissue-gel after the complete removal of lipid bilayers (Figure S1). These biomolecules were stable against heat and chemical treatment, and their antigenicity was well preserved after exposure to elution conditions. Good structural preservation is essential for resolving protein location with high precision and for studying molecular interrelationships. To characterize the macroscale structural preservation of the samples, we cleared 1-mm-thick tissue blocks using the elution condition and visualized their structural deformation (Figure 1J). The PFA-only tissue completely disintegrated. Even the AA-tissue-gel exhibited large deformations overall. GA-tissue-gel, however, showed no signs of structural damage throughout the entirety of the sample. We next examined structural preservation on a microscopic scale. We imaged GFP-expressing neurons in the cortex of a PFA-fixed 1-mm-thick thy1-EGFP M line block (Figure 1K). We then SWITCH-processed the tissue, cleared it using the harsh elution condition, stained it against GFP, and imaged the same neurons. As shown in Figure 1K, the microscopic morphology of the neurons was well preserved throughout the entire process. These results show GA-tissue-gel may be ideal for highly multiplexed structural and molecular phenotyping. Interrogating the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of molecules, cells, and the overall tissue organization requires precise co-registration of multiple volume images. We first asked if simple manual overlay of two datasets allows precise co-registration. As a stringent test, we used datasets from multi-round imaging of a SWITCH-processed 100-μm-thick human brain slice (100 μm × 3,200 μm × 3,200 μm) (Figure 2A). The high aspect ratio of such tissues makes it more prone to physical warping, which renders co-registration particularly challenging. We first stained the tissue using DAPI and anti-parvalbumin (PV) antibody. The slice was then enclosed in a space larger than the tissue to exaggerate possible tissue deformation in the mounting process (Figure 2B). After imaging, the sample was exposed to the elution condition overnight (O/N) to completely remove imaged probes. We then restained the tissue using the same probes and repeated the imaging process. Note that only GA-tissue-gels could maintain their integrity against the elution treatment. Both AA-tissue-gels and PFA-fixed samples deteriorated rapidly in the same condition. As predicted, a large degree of tissue warping in the mounting process (Figure 2C) made manual overlay insufficient for the task of interrogating a tissue across multiple staining rounds. To achieve precise co-registration of volume images in the presence of such high-degree warping, we custom-designed a robust computational software based on a feature-detection approach that was ideal for our experimental procedure (Figure 2D). Each staining round contained one fluorescence channel devoted to a lectin stain because the morphology of blood vessels creates distinctive keypoints that computer vision algorithms are well suited to identify. With the keypoints, the algorithm warps the tissue in a physically plausible manner into the correct position (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). As a stringent test of the algorithm, we used the same SWITCH-processed human sample with the high aspect ratio (Figure 2A). For each round, the sample was stained with DAPI, lectin, and one antibody to label a target protein. Although at least three antibodies can be used for each round in addition to lectin and DAPI (Figure S2), we chose to use one antibody for each round to eliminate any possible cross-talk between channels. After acquiring images, we destained the sample and began the next round of labeling. We repeated the above procedure 22 times using markers for various cell types (Figure 2H; Table 1). Staining was not successful in every round due to the use of non-validated antibodies, sub-optimal staining conditions, or human error, all of which often occur in general laboratory settings and can result in the loss of important samples. However, a SWITCH-processed sample is free from this issue as the tissue can be washed and reused repeatedly.Table 1Multiplexed Imaging RoundsRoundExcitation wavelength (nm)405488647aiba1, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; SOM, somatostatin; NMDAR1, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1; NC3βT, neuronal class III β-tubulin; GAD67, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67; Npas4, neuronal PAS domain protein 4; NAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.1DAPILectinIba12DAPILectinIba13DAPILectinGFAP4DAPILectinCalbindin5DAPILectinCalretinin6DAPILectinFluoromyelin7DAPILectinParvalbumin8DAPILectinNeuropeptide Y9DAPILectinNeuN10DAPILectinDiI D777711DAPILectinSOM12DAPILectinCholecystokinin13DAPILectinNMDAR114DAPILectinNC3βT15DAPILectinGAD6716DAPILectinNpas417DAPILectinNAChR18DAPILectinSMI-32P19DAPILectinParvalbumin20DAPILectinIba121DAPILectinGFAP22DAPILectinSMI-312a iba1, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; SOM, somatostatin; NMDAR1, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1; NC3βT, neuronal class III β-tubulin; GAD67, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67; Npas4, neuronal PAS domain protein 4; NAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Open table in a new tab We were able to successfully co-register all nine datasets with successful staining (Figures 2E and 2H; Movie S1). We asked whether changes in the sample might be occurring between staining rounds. To test this, we repeated staining with anti-PV antibodies in rounds 7 and 19 and co-registered the resulting datasets. Even when separated by 12 rounds of labeling, we were able to achieve single-cell accuracy of registration with 99% agreement between the two rounds (Figure 2G). We next performed joint statistical analysis of the integrated cross-talk-free dataset to extract diverse phenotypic information from human brain (Figure 3). We included lectin, GFAP, NeuN, SMI-32, and three calcium-binding protein channels—calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and PV—in the quantitative analysis. First, we used semi-automated algorithms to identify blood vessels and cells expressing the target antigens (Figures 3A and 3B) and extract their spatial (x, y, z coordinates) and morphological (e.g., cell soma size) information. Density and size profiles of NeuN-positive cells (Figures 3C and 3D) enabled us to define the cortical layers (Figure 3A) according to established criteria (de Sousa et al., 2010de Sousa A.A. Sherwood C.C. Schleicher A. Amunts K. MacLeod C.E. Hof P.R. Zilles K. Comparative cytoarchitectural analyses of striate and extrastriate areas in hominoids.Cereb. Cortex. 2010; 20: 966-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NeuN+ density was high in cortical layers II and IV, with characteristic small cells (NeuN in Figures 3A, 3C, 3D, and 3H). Large NeuN+ neurons were concentrated in layers III and V. A portion of these were large pyramidal neurons positive for SMI-32 (Figures 3A, 3E, and 3H). CB+, CR+, and PV+ cells also showed distinct distribution patterns along the cortical axis (Figures 3A and 3D), in agreement with previous studies (Defelipe et al., 1999Defelipe J. González-Albo M.C. Del Río M.R. Elston G.N. Distribution and patterns of connectivity of interneurons containing calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin in visual areas of the occipital and temporal lobes of the macaque monkey.J. Comp.

Neurol. 1998; 152: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We next performed unbiased combinatorial expression profiling with the six cell-type specific proteins (GFAP, NeuN, SMI-32, CB, CR, PV). Among 63 possible combinations, 16 were found (Table S2). We identified sub-populations of CB+/CR+ and CB+/PV+ cells, but no CR+/PV+ or CB+/CR+/PV+, cells (Figures 3F, 3H, and 3I), in agreement with a previous report regarding mouse visual cortex (Gonchar et al., 2007Gonchar Y. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Multiple distinct subtypes of GABAergic neurons in mouse visual cortex identified by triple immunostaining.Front. Neuroanat. 2007; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that a significant portion of the CB, CR, and PV-positive neurons do not express detectable levels of NeuN, a widely used pan-neuronal marker (Figures 3J and 3K) (Mullen et al., 1992Mullen R.J. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. NeuN, a neuronal specific nuclear protein in vertebrates.Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, a majority of CR+ cells showed very weak (Figure 3K, arrowhead) or no NeuN immunoreactivity (29.1%), whereas all SMI-32+ cells (Figures 3J and 3K) were NeuN positive. These results suggest that NeuN expression may be neuronal-type-specific in adult human visual association cortex. We also found a small number of CB+ cells and PV+ cells co-expressing SMI-32, a widely used pyramidal neuronal marker (Table S2) (Campbell and Morrison, 1989Campbell M.J. Morrison J.H. Monoclonal antibody to neurofilament protein (SMI-32) labels a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons in the human and monkey neocortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 282: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Five CB+/PV+ cells were identified as quadruple-positive (NeuN+/SMI-32+/CB+/PV+) cells (Figure 3G). All of the CB+ cells and PV+ cells co-expressing SMI-32 were localized in cortical layers III and IV. These results demonstrate the power of SWITCH as a tool for 3D proteomic profiling of intact biological samples at single cell resolution. Structural relationships between vasculature and brain cells have been a topic of interest in a broad range of basic and clinical research. Many previous studies obtained the cell-to-vessel distance from 2D images or small tissue volumes, which may hinder precise measurement of such 3D properties. Moreover, in many studies, separate measurements from different tissues needed to be compared without considering individual variabilities in local vasculature geometry. There has been no direct comparison of 3D cell-to-vessel distance among diverse cell types within the same intact tissue. Using the proteomic imaging capability of SWITCH, for the first time, we were able to directly measure cell-to-vessel distances for six different cell types within a single intact tissue (Figures 3L–3O). As expected (McCaslin et al., 2011McCaslin A.F.H. Chen B.R. Radosevich A.J. Cauli B. Hillman E.M.C. In vivo 3D morphology of astrocyte-vasculature interactions in the somatosensory cortex: implications for neurovascular coupling.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2011; 31: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), GFAP+ astrocytes had a shorter mean distance than NeuN+ neurons (Figure 3L). CB+ and PV+ cells were also more closely localized near blood vessels than NeuN+ cells, but the difference was relatively small. Figure 3M shows that vascular density is not uniform along the cortex. However, the extravascular pixel-to-vessel distance (Dp), which we defined as a reference parameter to reflect the effect of the 3D vascular geometry (Figure 3M, right), did not show an inverse relationship with vascular density. This result may suggest that 3D vessel geometry is an important parameter to be considered in understanding a given vascular environment. In fact, cell-to-vessel distance profiles of many cell types closely followed the Dp profile (GFAP+, DG, and NeuN+, DN, shown in Figure 3M). In particular, when Dp was subtracted from cell-to-vessel distances (DX) to cancel the influence of vascular geometric variation, DX − Dp turns out to be very consistent throughout cortical depth (Figure 3N). We further examined the distance distribution profiles for all cell types (Figure 3O). All profiles showed similar characteristic curves, which can be seen when objects are randomly located in a 3D space (Manzo et al., 2014Manzo C. van Zanten T.S. Saha S. Torreno-Pina J.A. Mayor S. Garcia-Parajo M.F. PSF decomposition of nanoscopy images via Bayesian analysis unravels distinct molecular organization of the cell membrane.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We could not observe any cell-type-specific distribution profile or bi- or multi-modal distribution pattern in this sample. Together, these data demonstrate that SWITCH can be used for high-dimensional quantitative phenotyping of human clinical samples. To extend the multiplexed imaging capability of the SWITCH method to large systems, we developed a simple and rapid clearing method. We hypothesized that key steps in detergent-mediated lipid removal, such as permeation of SDS through membranes, might be strongly enhanced by increasing temperature (Keller et al., 2006Keller S. Heerklotz H. Blume A. Monitoring lipid membrane translocation of sodium dodecyl sulfate by isothermal titration calorimetry.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and SWITCH-processed samples may endure prolonged incubation at elevated temperatures. Indeed, thermal energy drastically increased the passive clearing speed of SWITCH-processed samples without noticeable tissue damage (Figure 4A). We achieved passive clearing of a whole adult mouse brain within 4 days at 80°C (versus 4 weeks at 37°C) (Figure 4C). Upon prolonged exposure to high temperatures, however, samples developed a brownish hue (Friedman, 1996Friedman M. Food Browning and Its Prevention: An Overview.J. Agric.

We found that reducing agents, such as sodium sulfite and 1-thioglycerol, effectively mitigate tissue browning during thermal clearing (Figures 4B–4D). Using thermal clearing with the reducing agents, we successfully cleared intact adult rat brains (2 weeks) as well as human (1 week) and marmoset samples (1 week), demonstrating the versatility and scalability of the method (Figures 4D and 4E). Clearing of various rodent organs was also demonstrated with lung, kidney, heart, liver, and spinal cord (Figure 4F). The efficacy of sodium sulfite as an anti-browning agent was seen across all tissues. We also sought to apply SWITCH to characterizing myelinated fiber pathways in the brain. Visualizing and analyzing neural fibers with high-resolution light microscopy can provide valuable insights into many studies (Thomas et al., 2014Thomas C. Ye F.Q. Irfanoglu M.O. Modi P. Saleem K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2187086501,"Although associative learning has been localized to specific brain areas in many animals, identifying the underlying synaptic processes in vivo has been difficult. Here, we provide the first demonstration of long-term synaptic plasticity at the output site of the Drosophila mushroom body. Pairing an odor with activation of specific dopamine neurons induces both learning and odor-specific synaptic depression. The plasticity induction strictly depends on the temporal order of the two stimuli, replicating the logical requirement for associative learning. Furthermore, we reveal that dopamine action is confined to and distinct across different anatomical compartments of the mushroom body lobes. Finally, we find that overlap between sparse representations of different odors defines both stimulus specificity of the plasticity and generalizability of associative memories across odors. Thus, the plasticity we find here not only manifests important features of associative learning but also provides general insights into how a sparse sensory code is read out."

Here we report transgenic mice carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the full human C9orf72 gene with either a normal allele (15 repeats) or disease-associated expansion (∼100-1,000 repeats; C9-BACexp). C9-BACexp mice displayed pathologic features seen in C9orf72 expansion patients, including widespread RNA foci and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translated dipeptides, which were suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides targeting human C9orf72. Nucleolin distribution was altered, supporting that either C9orf72 transcripts or RAN dipeptides promote nucleolar dysfunction. Despite early and widespread production of RNA foci and RAN dipeptides in C9-BACexp mice, behavioral abnormalities and neurodegeneration were not observed even at advanced ages, supporting the hypothesis that RNA foci and RAN dipeptides occur presymptomatically and are not sufficient to drive neurodegeneration in mice at levels seen in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2183090108,"The killifish Nothobranchius furzeri is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be bred in the laboratory. Its rapid growth, early sexual maturation, fast aging, and arrested embryonic development (diapause) make it an attractive model organism in biomedical research. Here, we report a draft sequence of its genome that allowed us to uncover an intra-species Y chromosome polymorphism representing—in real time—different stages of sex chromosome formation that display features of early mammalian XY evolution “in action.” Our data suggest that gdf6Y, encoding a TGF-β family growth factor, is the master sex-determining gene in N. furzeri. Moreover, we observed genomic clustering of aging-related genes, identified genes under positive selection, and revealed significant similarities of gene expression profiles between diapause and aging, particularly for genes controlling cell cycle and translation. The annotated genome sequence is provided as an online resource (http://www.nothobranchius.info/NFINgb)."

The mice showed no overt behavioral phenotype but recapitulated distinctive histopathological features of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD, including sense and antisense intranuclear RNA foci and poly(glycine-proline) dipeptide repeat proteins. Finally, using an artificial microRNA that targets human C9ORF72 in cultures of primary cortical neurons from the C9BAC mice, we have attenuated expression of the C9BAC transgene and the poly(GP) dipeptides. The C9ORF72 BAC transgenic mice will be a valuable tool in the study of ALS/FTD pathobiology and therapy."

Here we de novo assemble a reference genome for the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish, providing a unique resource for comparative and experimental genomics. The identification of genes under positive selection in this fish reveals potential candidates to explain its compressed lifespan. Several aging genes are under positive selection in this short-lived fish and long-lived species, raising the intriguing possibility that the same gene could underlie evolution of both compressed and extended lifespans. Comparative genomics and linkage analysis identify candidate genes associated with lifespan differences between various turquoise killifish strains. Remarkably, these genes are clustered on the sex chromosome, suggesting that short lifespan might have co-evolved with sex determination. Our study provides insights into the evolutionary forces that shape lifespan in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2187138210,"Serum-to-2i interconversion of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is a valuable in vitro model for early embryonic development. To assess whether 3D chromatin organization changes during this transition, we established Capture Hi-C with target-sequence enrichment of DNase I hypersensitive sites. We detected extremely long-range intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions between a small subset of H3K27me3 marked bivalent promoters involving the Hox clusters in serum-grown cells. Notably, these promoter-mediated interactions are not present in 2i ground-state pluripotent mESCs but appear upon their further development into primed-like serum mESCs. Reverting serum mESCs to ground-state 2i mESCs removes these promoter-promoter interactions in a spatiotemporal manner. H3K27me3, which is largely absent at bivalent promoters in ground-state 2i mESCs, is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish these interactions, as confirmed by Capture Hi-C on Eed(-/-) serum mESCs. Our results implicate H3K27me3 and PRC2 as critical players in chromatin alteration during priming of ESCs for differentiation."

Here we report the first systematic deep sequencing study of 55 postmortem ASD brains for SNVs in 78 known ASD candidate genes. Remarkably, even without parental samples, we find more ASD brains with mutations that are protein-altering (26/55 cases versus 12/50 controls, p = 0.015), deleterious (16/55 versus 5/50, p = 0.016), or loss-of-function (6/55 versus 0/50, p = 0.028) compared to controls, with recurrent deleterious mutations in ARID1B, SCN1A, SCN2A, and SETD2, suggesting these mutations contribute to ASD risk. In several cases, the identified mutations and medical records suggest syndromic ASD diagnoses. Two ASD and one Fragile X premutation case showed deleterious somatic mutations, providing evidence that somatic mutations occur in ASD cases, and supporting a model in which a combination of germline and/or somatic mutations may contribute to ASD risk on a case-by-case basis."
https://openalex.org/W2192807450,"PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT and RAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway coactivation in the prostate epithelium promotes both epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which is currently incurable. To study the dynamic regulation of the EMT process, we developed novel genetically defined cellular and in vivo model systems from which epithelial, EMT and mesenchymal-like tumor cells with Pten deletion and Kras activation can be isolated. When cultured individually, each population has the capacity to regenerate all three tumor cell populations, indicative of epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity. Despite harboring the same genetic alterations, mesenchymal-like tumor cells are resistant to PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibitors, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the EMT process, as well as dictate the heterogeneous responses of cancer cells to therapy. Among differentially expressed epigenetic regulators, the chromatin remodeling protein HMGA2 is significantly upregulated in EMT and mesenchymal-like tumors cells, as well as in human mCRPC. Knockdown of HMGA2, or suppressing HMGA2 expression with the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589, inhibits epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity and stemness activities in vitro and markedly reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo through successful targeting of EMT and mesenchymal-like tumor cells. Importantly, LBH589 treatment in combination with castration prevents mCRPC development and significantly prolongs survival following castration by enhancing p53 and androgen receptor acetylation and in turn sensitizing castration-resistant mesenchymal-like tumor cells to androgen deprivation therapy. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that cellular plasticity is regulated epigenetically, and that mesenchymal-like tumor cell populations in mCRPC that are resistant to conventional and targeted therapies can be effectively treated with the epigenetic inhibitor LBH589."
https://openalex.org/W2185769549,"Memories are thought to be formed in response to transient experiences, in part through changes in local protein synthesis at synapses. In Drosophila, the amyloidogenic (prion-like) state of the RNA binding protein Orb2 has been implicated in long-term memory, but how conformational conversion of Orb2 promotes memory formation is unclear. Combining in vitro and in vivo studies, we find that the monomeric form of Orb2 represses translation and removes mRNA poly(A) tails, while the oligomeric form enhances translation and elongates the poly(A) tails and imparts its translational state to the monomer. The CG13928 protein, which binds only to monomeric Orb2, promotes deadenylation, whereas the putative poly(A) binding protein CG4612 promotes oligomeric Orb2-dependent translation. Our data support a model in which monomeric Orb2 keeps target mRNA in a translationally dormant state and experience-dependent conversion to the amyloidogenic state activates translation, resulting in persistent alteration of synaptic activity and stabilization of memory."

https://openalex.org/W2337073704,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that is largely incurable due to development of resistance to therapy-elicited cell death. Nutrients are intricately connected to maintenance of cellular viability in part by inhibition of apoptosis. We were interested to determine if examination of metabolic regulation of BCL-2 proteins may provide insight on alternative routes to engage apoptosis. MM cells are reliant on glucose and glutamine and withdrawal of either nutrient is associated with varying levels of apoptosis. We and others have demonstrated that glucose maintains levels of key resistance-promoting BCL-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemic factor 1 (MCL-1). Cells continuing to survive in the absence of glucose or glutamine were found to maintain expression of MCL-1 but importantly induce pro-apoptotic BIM expression. One potential mechanism for continued survival despite induction of BIM could be due to binding and sequestration of BIM to alternate pro-survival BCL-2 members. Our investigation revealed that cells surviving glutamine withdrawal in particular, enhance expression and binding of BIM to BCL-2, consequently sensitizing these cells to the BH3 mimetic venetoclax. Glutamine deprivation-driven sensitization to venetoclax can be reversed by metabolic supplementation with TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate. Inhibition of glucose metabolism with the GLUT4 inhibitor ritonavir elicits variable cytotoxicity in MM that is marginally enhanced with venetoclax treatment, however, targeting glutamine metabolism with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine uniformly sensitized MM cell lines and relapse/refractory patient samples to venetoclax. Our studies reveal a potent therapeutic strategy of metabolically driven synthetic lethality involving targeting glutamine metabolism for sensitization to venetoclax in MM."
https://openalex.org/W2183657577,"The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to resist intraphagosomal stresses, such as oxygen radicals and low pH, is critical for its persistence. Here, we show that a cytoplasmic redox sensor, WhiB3, and the major M. tuberculosis thiol, mycothiol (MSH), are required to resist acidic stress during infection. WhiB3 regulates the expression of genes involved in lipid anabolism, secretion, and redox metabolism, in response to acidic pH. Furthermore, inactivation of the MSH pathway subverted the expression of whiB3 along with other pH-specific genes in M. tuberculosis. Using a genetic biosensor of mycothiol redox potential (EMSH), we demonstrated that a modest decrease in phagosomal pH is sufficient to generate redox heterogeneity in EMSH of the M. tuberculosis population in a WhiB3-dependent manner. Data indicate that M. tuberculosis needs low pH as a signal to alter cytoplasmic EMSH, which activates WhiB3-mediated gene expression and acid resistance. Importantly, WhiB3 regulates intraphagosomal pH by down-regulating the expression of innate immune genes and blocking phagosomal maturation. We show that this block in phagosomal maturation is in part due to WhiB3-dependent production of polyketide lipids. Consistent with these observations, MtbΔwhiB3 displayed intramacrophage survival defect, which can be rescued bypharmacological inhibition of phagosomal acidification.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes a chronic persistent infection that affects one-third of the world's population (see the World Health Organization website). Macrophage is the major human host cell for growth, survival, and persistence of M. tuberculosis. Studies indicate that M. tuberculosis continuously senses the phagosomal environment and modulates genetic pathways to regulate intramacrophage growth for long term persistence (1Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. Mycobacterial survival strategies in the phagosome: defence against host stresses.Cell. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2Schnappinger D.

Linking the transcriptional profiles and the physiological states of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during an extended intracellular infection.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002769Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this regard, acidic pH has recently been appreciated as an important intraphagosomal signal sensed by M. tuberculosis to regulate gene expression and establish chronic infection (3Rohde K.H. Veiga D.F. Caldwell S. Balázsi G. Russell D.G. Linking the transcriptional profiles and the physiological states of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during an extended intracellular infection.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002769Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The importance of pH emerged from several studies showing that pathogenic mycobacteria successfully restrict fusion of phagosomes with acidic lysosomes and therefore multiply in a growth-permissive vacuolar compartment with a pH of ∼6.2 (4Armstrong J.A. Hart P.D. Response of cultured macrophages to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with observations on fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes.J. Exp.

McKinney J.D. Immune control of tuberculosis by IFN-γ-inducible LRG-47.Science. 2003; 302: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, upon activation of macrophages by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the pH of the M. tuberculosis phagosome drops to <5.0, resulting in M. tuberculosis growth restriction (6MacMicking J.D.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 897-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the inhibition of phagosomal maturation during early stages of infection and induction of acid resistance mechanisms later during immune-activation are considered major virulence strategies adopted by M. tuberculosis to establish chronic infection (9Vandal O.H. Nathan C.F. Ehrt S. Acid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4714-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Despite the recognized role of acidic pH in regulating M. tuberculosis pathogenesis, the mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis responds to fluctuations in phagosomal pH and calibrates its gene expression for intracellular growth and persistence remain poorly characterized. Recent studies indicate that M. tuberculosis maintains a neutral intrabacterial pH (∼7.2) after exposure to a range of acidic pH levels (from 6.2 to 4.5) in vitro, and inside the acidic phagosomal milieu of resting or activated macrophage (10Vandal O.H. Pierini L.M. Schnappinger D. Nathan C.F. Ehrt S. A membrane protein preserves intrabacterial pH in intraphagosomal Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This indicates that M. tuberculosis stably maintains intrabacterial pH homeostasis during infection and, therefore, that the intrabacterial pH per se is unlikely to be the signal that triggers alterations in M. tuberculosis gene expression in response to changes in phagosomal acidity. Therefore, novel insights are needed to discover which aspects of mycobacterial physiology are modulated by phagosomal acidity and what are the bacterial sensors of phagosomal pH. In this context, an Fe-S cluster containing putative transcription factor WhiB3 is induced in response to acidic pH in medium, inside macrophages, and in the lungs of infected animals (11Banaiee N. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Ernst J.D. Regulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis whiB3 in the mouse lung and macrophages.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 6449-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Rohde K.H.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion of macrophages: linking bacterial gene expression to environmental cues.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In fact, whiB3 was the only transcription factor whose expression was found to be pH-responsive inside macrophages. In vitro studies have shown that WhiB3 responds to dormancy signals, such as O2 and nitric oxide (NO), via its 4Fe-4S cluster (13Singh A. Guidry L. Narasimhulu K.V. Mai D. Trombley J. Redding K.E. Giles G.I. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Steyn A.J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis WhiB3 responds to O2 and nitric oxide via its [4Fe-4S] cluster and is essential for nutrient starvation survival.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11562-11567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, phenotypic experiments revealed no role of WhiB3 in controlling mycobacterial survival in response to NO or hypoxia (13Singh A. Guidry L. Narasimhulu K.V. Mai D. Trombley J. Redding K.E. Giles G.I. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Steyn A.J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis WhiB3 responds to O2 and nitric oxide via its [4Fe-4S] cluster and is essential for nutrient starvation survival.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Consistent induction of whiB3 in acidic environments in vitro and inside macrophages (12Rohde K.H. Abramovitch R.B. Russell D.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion of macrophages: linking bacterial gene expression to environmental cues.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) implicated WhiB3 in regulating adaptation of M. tuberculosis in response to phagosomal pH. A fundamentally important question remains yet unanswered. What is the mechanism by which WhiB3 mediates the acid response of M. tuberculosis during infection? In this study, we performed global microarray analysis to identify genes regulated by WhiB3 in response to acid stress. More importantly, we measured the dynamic changes in mycothiol redox potential (EMSH) 3The abbreviations used are: EMSH, mycothiol redox potential; MSH, mycothiol; BafA1, bafilomycin A1; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; ERG, ergothionine; V-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase; Mrx1, mycoredoxin; MOI, multiplicity of infection; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; roGFP, redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species. of WT M. tuberculosis and MtbΔwhiB3 in response to acidic pH in vitro and inside naive and activated macrophages. Confocal studies and host microarray studies were performed to examine the function of WhiB3 in regulating phagosomal maturation. Last, the physiological importance of whiB3-mediated effects on gene expression, redox homeostasis, and phagosomal maturation were investigated by performing survival studies in macrophages and guinea pigs. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates how M. tuberculosis recalibrates its redox physiology in response to vacuolar pH during infection and identifies a major role of WhiB3 in responding to acidic stress. Wild type M. tuberculosis H37Rv (WT M. tuberculosis), MtbΔwhiB3, and whiB3-comp strains were cultivated as described (13Singh A. Guidry L. Narasimhulu K.V. Mai D. Trombley J. Redding K.E. Giles G.I.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11562-11567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). E. coli cultures were grown in LB medium. When required, culture medium was supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg/ml) or hygromycin (50 μg/ml). For acid stress, the pH of 7H9 broth was adjusted using hydrochloric acid (HCl) and buffered using 100 mm MES. Approximately 1 × 107 cells/ml were exposed to various pH-adjusted media, and survival was monitored at day 0 and day 4 by serially diluting the culture and enumerating colony-forming units (cfu). For carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment, bacteria were treated with 500 μm CCCP for 4 h. For constructing MtbΔwhiB3, 1-kb left flanking and right flanking regions of whiB3 (Rv3416) were cloned upstream and downstream of the loxP-gfp-hygromycin-loxP cassette in a mycobacterial sacB-based suicide vector, pML523 (a kind gift from Michael Neiderwies, University of Alabama at Birmingham). The construct was digested with SpeI and NsiI to release left flanking and right flanking regions of whiB3 along with the loxP-gfp-hygromycin-loxP cassette, blunt-ended, and cloned into EcoRV/PstI-digested pRSF-duet vector (Clontech). The pRSF-whiB3 clone was pretreated with UV as described previously (14Singh A. Jain S. Gupta S. Das T.

The resulting MtbΔwhiB3 (HygRKanSGFP+) colonies were screened by antibiotic selection and verified by PCR. To unmark MtbΔwhiB3 strain, pCRE-ZEO-SacB (a gift from Dr. Amit Pandey, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Haryana, India) was electroporated into MtbΔwhiB3, and the loxP-gfp-hygromycin-loxP cassette was released from the genome. The resulting unmarked MtbΔwhiB3 strain was confirmed by the absence of antibiotic selection marker. Disruption of whiB3 was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). For constructing the whiB3-comp strain, the whiB3 gene along with its promoter region was amplified from the M. tuberculosis genome and inserted into an E. coli-mycobacterial shuttle vector, pSD5. The pSD-whiB3 clone was electroporated into unmarked MtbΔwhiB3 strain to generate the whiB3-comp strain. Expression of whiB3 in the whiB3-comp strain was confirmed by qRT-PCR. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 and mice RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultivated as described previously (15Bhaskar A. Chawla M. Mehta M. Parikh P. Chandra P. Bhave D. Kumar D. Carroll K.S.

RAW 264.7 macrophages were activated using 100 ng/ml IFN-γ and 20 ng/ml LPS. Antibodies for mammalian markers (CD63 and vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lysotracker® DND-red99 was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate (FITC) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Bafilomycin A1 was purchased from Invivogen, and stocks were made in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. For analyzing the influence of acid stress on gene expression, M. tuberculosis strains (M. tuberculosis, MtbΔwhiB3, and MtbΔmshA) were grown until an A600 nm of 0.3–0.4 and exposed to 7H9 medium adjusted to a range of acidic pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.2, and 7.0 and normal 7H9 (pH 6.6) for 2 h at 150 rpm at 37 °C. Total RNA from WT M. tuberculosis and MtbΔwhiB3 (pH 4.5 and 6.6) was processed and hybridized to the M. tuberculosis whole genome gene expression profiling microarray G2509F (AMADID: G2509F_034585, Agilent Technologies PLC). DNA microarrays were provided by the University of Delhi South Campus MicroArray Centre.

Data analysis was performed with CFX ManagerTM software (Bio-Rad). For comparison between WT M. tuberculosis, MtbΔwhiB3, and the whiB3-comp strains, the induction ratio for each gene was normalized to WT M. tuberculosis 16S rRNA expression.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in the studyTargetPrimer sequencewhiB3 RT F5′-AACGCAGACATCTGGAACTG-3′whiB3 RT R5′-TAGGGCTCACCGACCTCTAA-3′pks2 RT F5′-AAGTGTCTCCGAGGTGTATG-3′pks2 RT R5′-CGAGTGAAGTGCAGATTACG-3′pks3 RT F5′-GGCTGAGATTGACACTGAAC-3′pks3 RT R5′-TACCCGACATTCCATACGAG-3′papA1 RT F5′-ATCCGCTAAGTACGATGGTC-3′papA1 RT R5′-ACCGATCTAATTGCCCTCAG-3′Rv3616c RT F5′-GAGCAGAGCGTTCATCATCG-3′Rv3616c RTR5′-CGAACCTAACCAGCCATCAC-3′Rv2390c RT F5′-CCGGCGAGTTCAAAGATAAG-3′Rv2390c RT R5′-TGAACATCAGGACCACTACC-3′16S rRNA RT F5′-GCCGTAAACGGTGGGTACTA-3′16S rRNA RT R5′-TGCATGTCAAACCCAGGTAA-3′MtbΔwhiB3 clone check F15′-GTGGCATCGAGAGCCTCTTCAC-3′MtbΔwhiB3 clone check R15′-GACGCGTTGATCCTGCTGCAC-3′ Open table in a new tab For intramycobacterial EMSH determination, various strains expressing Mrx1-roGFP2 were cultured and exposed to pH stress as indicated above. At the indicated time points, cells were treated with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 5 min at room temperature and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After washing three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), bacilli were analyzed using a FACS Verse Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The biosensor response was measured by analyzing the ratio at a fixed emission (510 nm) after excitation at 405 and 488 nm. Data were analyzed using FACSuite software. Intramycobacterial EMSH was measured using the Nernst equation as described earlier (15Bhaskar A. Chawla M. Mehta M. Parikh P. Chandra P. Bhave D. Kumar D. Carroll K.S. Singh A. Reengineering redox sensitive GFP to measure mycothiol redox potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1003902Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For measuring intramycobacterial EMSH during infection, PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with WT M. tuberculosis, MtbΔwhiB3, and whiB3-comp strains expressing Mrx1-roGFP2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Infected macrophages were treated with N-ethylmaleimide/paraformaldehyde, washed with 1× PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (15Bhaskar A. Chawla M. Mehta M. Parikh P.

In the case of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) treatment, THP-1 cells were treated with 10 nm BafA1 (Invivogen) or DMSO (vehicle control) 1 h before infection and processed for infection and sample preparation as described above. PMA-differentiated THP-1 monocytes and IFNγ + LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages were infected with WT M. tuberculosis, MtbΔwhiB3, and whiB3-comp strains at an MOI of 2 for 4 h, followed by treatment with 200 μg/ml amikacin to remove extracellular bacteria. For BafA1 experiments, THP-1 cells were treated with 10 nm BafA1 or DMSO (vehicle control) 1 h prior to infection. Cells were maintained in BafA1 throughout the experiment. After infection, cells were washed thoroughly with warm RPMI medium and resuspended in 10% RPMI medium containing BafA1 or DMSO as per requirements. Samples were collected at the indicated time points, lysed using 0.06% SDS-7H9, serially diluted in 7H9, plated on OADC-7H11 agar medium, and incubated at 37 °C incubator. Colonies were counted 3 weeks after plating. 50 ml of WT M. tuberculosis was grown in a 37 °C shaker incubator until mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.5–0.8). Surface-exposed extractable total lipids were isolated as described previously (17Singh A. Crossman D.K. Mai D. Guidry L. Voskuil M.I. Renfrow M.B. Steyn A.J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis WhiB3 maintains redox homeostasis by regulating virulence lipid anabolism to modulate macrophage response.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000545Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For lipid complementation assays, 100 μg/ml lipids were coated on the coverslips, and THP-1 cells were seeded, PMA-differentiated, and infected with MtbΔwhiB3 as done above. Logarithmically grown M. tuberculosis strains were stained with FITC as described earlier (18Hostetter J.M. Steadham E.M. Haynes J.S. Bailey T.B. Cheville N.F. Cytokine effects on maturation of the phagosomes containing Mycobacteria avium subspecies paratuberculosis in J774 cells.FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 34: 127-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells (0.25 × 106) were seeded, and infection was done with WT M. tuberculosis, MtbΔwhiB3, whiB3-comp strains at an MOI of 10 as described elsewhere (19Karim A.F. Chandra P. Chopra A. Siddiqui Z. Bhaskar A. Singh A. Kumar D.

Staining for CD63 and V-ATPase was started with fixative treatment (4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS) for 15 min, followed by permeabilization (0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) and blocking (3% BSA and 0.5% Tween 80 in 1× PBS). Samples were stained with primary antibodies (anti-CD63 and anti-V-ATPase) followed by secondary antibodies, followed by mounting using ProLong® antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The stained cells were visualized under a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. z stacks were taken, collapsed into a two-dimensional image, and analyzed by LAS AF version 2.6.0, build 7266. All of the z stacks were taken at 63× oil immersion objective (with zoom). A minimum of five fields were captured, and at least 50 macrophages were analyzed for all of the phagosomal markers, accounting for an approximate analysis of ∼100–200 bacteria/well. For each experimental group, a minimum of three replicates were scored. The infection of THP-1 monocytic cells, followed by RNA isolation, sample processing, and hybridization (Illumina Human-Ht-12 BeadChip), was performed as described earlier (19Karim A.F. Chandra P.

Expression analysis was done using a volcano plot-based approach using -fold change >1.5 and p value >0.05 as cut-off. GO-Elite (version 1.2.5) was used for significant biological analysis of differentially expressed genes with z-score > 1.96 and p value < 0.05 set as cut-offs. The normalized data from the microarray gene expression experiment can be queried via Gene Expression Omnibus series accession number GSE65714. Outbred Hartley guinea pigs (∼300–400-g body weight) were given a low dose of logarithmic phase-grown cultures of WT M. tuberculosis, MtbΔwhiB3, and whiB3-comp, using a Madison chamber aerosol generation instrument calibrated to deliver 50–100 cfu/animal lung. Animals were sacrificed (n = 5) at 1, 30, and 60 days postinfection for determination of organ bacterial burden and histopathology analysis. Histopathology analysis was performed as described previously (14Singh A. Jain S. Gupta S. Das T. Tyagi A.K. mymA operon of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: its regulation and importance in the cell envelope.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 227: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A blinded examination of at least three serial sections from each guinea pig was carried out. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism software, and values were presented as mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of the differences between experimental groups was determined by two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. Differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered significant. Recent studies indicated that intraphagosomal pH might be one of the earliest cues to which M. tuberculosis responds and realigns its transcriptional programming (12Rohde K.H. Abramovitch R.B. Russell D.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion of macrophages: linking bacterial gene expression to environmental cues.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Microarray studies have revealed that the expression of whiB3 was induced early in macrophages in a pH-dependent manner (12Rohde K.H. Abramovitch R.B. Russell D.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion of macrophages: linking bacterial gene expression to environmental cues.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We also found an ∼2-, 4-, and 35-fold increased expression of whiB3 as compared with 16S rRNA at pH 6.2, 5.5, and 4.5, respectively. Given the sustained induction of whiB3 in response to acidic pH, we reasoned that WhiB3 might play an important role in tolerating acid stress. We generated an unmarked strain of M. tuberculosis lacking the entire open reading frame (ORF) of whiB3, and putative MtbΔwhiB3 clones were verified by PCR (Fig. 1, A–C). We monitored the survival of WT M. tuberculosis, MtbΔwhiB3, and whiB3-comp in 7H9-tyloxapol medium adjusted to pH 6.6 (normal 7H9), 5.5, and 4.5. At day 4 post-treatment, survival at various pH stress conditions was monitored by enumerating cfu. We observed that MtbΔwhiB3 survived to a level comparable with WT M. tuberculosis at pH 6.6 and 5.5 (Fig. 1D). However, it displayed an ∼55-fold reduction in its survival at pH 4.5 as compared with WT M. tuberculosis (p = 0.007; Fig. 1D). Stable expression of whiB3 in MtbΔwhiB3 resulted in a significant complementation of this survival defect (Fig. 1D). These observations confirmed that not only is whiB3 expression induced by acidic pH; it is also required for growth in acidic environments in vitro. Next, we sought to determine the role of WhiB3 in controlling pH-specific gene expression. We minimized any influence of pH-induced cell death on gene expression by performing microarrays at an early time point (2 h) after exposure to pH 4.5. Expression data revealed differential regulation of several genes involved in secretion, central metabolism/oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis/membrane transporters, and gene regulation at pH 4.5 as compared with pH 6.6 (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). Surprisingly, genes directly implicated in mitigating redox stress in M. tuberculosis were also influenced by acid stress. For example, expression of major antioxidant genes, including thioredoxins (trxB1, trxB2, and trxC), superoxide dismutase (sodA), MSH synthesis (mshB and mca), and rubredoxin (rubA and rubB), was elevated by acidic conditions (supplemental Table S1). Genes associated with biosynthesis of redox-active amino acids (cysteine and methionine), DNA repair (recR, dnaK, dnaJ, and ogt), and NAD+/NADH balance (ndh) were also up-regulated (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S1). Noticeably, the expression of whiB3 was induced to a higher degree than other transcriptional regulators (supplemental Table S1). To understand the physiological basis of our findings, we performed a comparative gene expression analysis at pH 4.5 in vitro with the transcriptional changes in WT M. tuberculosis in response to early phagosomal acidity (12Rohde K.H. Abramovitch R.B. Russell D.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion of macrophages: linking bacterial gene expression to environmental cues.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2183270497,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is involved in cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and transcriptional regulation. Although PRMT1 is extensively expressed in the CNS at embryonic and perinatal stages, the physiological role of PRMT1 has been poorly understood. Here, to investigate the primary function of PRMT1 in the CNS, we generated CNS-specific PRMT1 knock-out mice by the Cre-loxP system. These mice exhibited postnatal growth retardation with tremors, and most of them died within 2 weeks after birth. Brain histological analyses revealed prominent cell reduction in the white matter tracts of the mutant mice. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that myelin sheath was almost completely ablated in the CNS of these animals. In agreement with hypomyelination, we also observed that most major myelin proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) were dramatically decreased, although neuronal and astrocytic markers were preserved in the brain of CNS-specific PRMT1 knock-out mice. These animals had a reduced number of OLIG2+ oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the white matter. We found that expressions of transcription factors essential for oligodendrocyte specification and further maturation were significantly suppressed in the brain of the mutant mice. Our findings provide evidence that PRMT1 is required for CNS development, especially for oligodendrocyte maturation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2182721946,"The small GTPase Rab11 and its effectors control trafficking of recycling endosomes, receptor replenishment and the up-regulation of adhesion and adaptor molecules at the plasma membrane. Despite recent advances in the understanding of Rab11-regulated mechanisms, the final steps mediating docking and fusion of Rab11-positive vesicles at the plasma membrane are not fully understood. Munc13-4 is a docking factor proposed to regulate fusion through interactions with SNAREs. In hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils, Munc13-4 regulates exocytosis in a Rab27a-dependent manner, but its possible regulation of other GTPases has not been explored in detail. Here, we show that Munc13-4 binds to Rab11 and regulates the trafficking of Rab11-containing vesicles. Using a novel Time-resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) assay, we demonstrate that Munc13-4 binds to Rab11a but not to dominant negative Rab11a. Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the specificity of the interaction between Munc13-4 and Rab11, and super-resolution microscopy studies support the interaction of endogenous Munc13-4 with Rab11 at the single molecule level in neutrophils. Vesicular dynamic analysis shows the common spatio-temporal distribution of Munc13-4 and Rab11, while expression of a calcium binding-deficient mutant of Munc13-4 significantly affected Rab11 trafficking. Munc13-4-deficient neutrophils showed normal endocytosis, but the trafficking, up-regulation, and retention of Rab11-positive vesicles at the plasma membrane was significantly impaired. This correlated with deficient NADPH oxidase activation at the plasma membrane in response to Rab11 interference. Our data demonstrate that Munc13-4 is a Rab11-binding partner that regulates the final steps of Rab11-positive vesicle docking at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2194868072,"A limiting factor in the therapeutic outcome of children with high-risk neuroblastoma is the intrinsic and acquired resistance to common chemotherapeutic treatments. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the hemisynthetic cardiac glycoside UNBS1450 overcomes this limitation and induces differential cell death modalities in both neuroblastic and stromal neuroblastoma through stimulation of a cell-type-specific autophagic response eventually leading to apoptosis or necroptosis. In neuroblastic SH-SY5Y cells, we observed a time-dependent production of reactive oxygen species that affects lysosomal integrity inducing lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 degradation and cathepsin B and L activation. Subsequent mitochondrial membrane depolarization and accumulation of mitochondria in phagophores occurred after 8h of UNBS1450 treatment. Results were confirmed by mitochondrial mass analysis, electron microscopy and co-localization of mitochondria with GFP-LC3, suggesting the impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria. Thus, a stress-induced defective autophagic flux and the subsequent lack of clearance of damaged mitochondria sensitized SH-SY5Y cells to UNBS1450-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy with small inhibitory RNAs against ATG5, ATG7 and Beclin-1 protected SH-SY5Y cells against the cytotoxic effect of UNBS1450 by inhibiting apoptosis. In contrast, autophagy progression towards the catabolic state was observed in stromal SK-N-AS cells: here reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation remained undetectable preserving intact lysosomes and engulfing damaged mitochondria after UNBS1450 treatment. Moreover, autophagy inhibition determined sensitization of SK-N-AS to apoptosis. We identified efficient mitophagy as the key mechanism leading to failure of activation of the apoptotic pathway that increased resistance of SK-N-AS to UNBS1450, triggering rather necroptosis at higher doses. Altogether we characterize here the differential modulation of ROS and mitophagy as a main determinant of neuroblastoma resistance with potential relevance for personalized anticancer therapeutic approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2190400042,"Multiple sequential genetic and epigenetic alterations underlie cancer development and progression. Overcoming cellular senescence is an early step in cancer pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that a noncoding regulatory RNA, microRNA-16 (miR-16), has the potential to induce cellular senescence. First, we examined the expression of miR-16 in primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and other non-Hodgkin T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas and found that miR-16 was downregulated than that in the corresponding normal cells. Notably, miR-16 expression was reduced as the primary CTCL progressed from the early stage to the advanced stage. Next, we transduced CTCL cells with miR-16 to examine whether this miRNA exhibited tumor-suppressive effects in CTCL cells. In CTCL cells expressing wild-type p53, forced expression of miR-16 enhanced p21 expression via downregulation of the polycomb group protein Bmi1, thereby inducing cellular senescence. Alternatively, in CTCL cells lacking functional p53, miR-16 induced compensatory apoptosis. The miR-16 transfection significantly decreased senescent cells and increased apoptotic cells in p21-knockdown CTCL cells expressing wild-type p53, suggesting that the presence or absence of p21 may be the most important condition in the senescence–apoptosis switch in CTCL lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, we found that the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) restored the expression of miR-16 and its essential targets, induced senescence in CTCL cells expressing wild-type p53 and promoted apoptosis in cells with nonfunctional p53. Moreover, we found that other T/NK-cell lymphoma cell lines showed similar tumor-suppressive effects in response to miR-16 and SAHA and that these effects were dependent on p53 status. These results suggested that epigenetic silencing of miR-16 may be a key step during lymphoma development. Elucidation of the essential targets of miR-16 and SAHA provides a basis for the clinical application of SAHA in the treatment of CTCL and other non-Hodgkin T/NK-cell lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2190077392,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) has a pivotal role in breast carcinogenesis by associating with various cellular factors. Selective expression of additional sex comb-like 2 (ASXL2) in ERα-positive breast cancer cells prompted us to investigate its role in chromatin modification required for ERα activation and breast carcinogenesis. Here, we observed that ASXL2 interacts with ligand E2-bound ERα and mediates ERα activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis supports a positive role of ASXL2 at ERα target gene promoters. ASXL2 forms a complex with histone methylation modifiers including LSD1, UTX and MLL2, which all are recruited to the E2-responsive genes via ASXL2 and regulate methylations at histone H3 lysine 4, 9 and 27. The preferential binding of the PHD finger of ASXL2 to the dimethylated H3 lysine 4 may account for its requirement for ERα activation. On ASXL2 depletion, the proliferative potential of MCF7 cells and tumor size of xenograft mice decreased. Together with our finding on the higher ASXL2 expression in ERα-positive patients, we propose that ASXL2 could be a novel prognostic marker in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2189779125,"The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in ~50% of human cancers. P53 is activated by a range of stimuli and regulates several cellular processes, including apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest, senescence and DNA repair. P53 induces apoptosis via transcriptional induction of the BH3-only proteins PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and NOXA, and cell cycle arrest via p21. Induction of these processes was proposed to be critical for p53-mediated tumor suppression. It is therefore surprising that mice lacking PUMA, NOXA and p21, as well as mice bearing mutations in p53 that impair the transcriptional activation of these genes, are not tumor prone, unlike mice lacking p53 function, which spontaneously develop tumors with 100% incidence. These p53 target genes and the processes they regulate may, however, impact differently on tumor development depending on the oncogenic drivers. For example, loss of PUMA enhances c-MYC-driven lymphoma development in mice, but, interestingly, the acceleration was less impressive compared with that caused by the loss of even a single p53 allele. Different studies have reported that loss of p21 can accelerate, delay or have no impact on tumorigenesis. In an attempt to resolve this controversy, we examined whether loss of p21-mediated cell cycle arrest cooperates with PUMA deficiency in accelerating lymphoma development in Eμ-Myc mice (overexpressing c-MYC in B-lymphoid cells). We found that Eμ-Myc mice lacking both p21 and PUMA (Eμ-Myc;Puma−/−;p21−/−) developed lymphoma at a rate comparable to Eμ-Myc;Puma−/− animals, notably with considerably longer latency than Eμ-Myc;p53+/-mice. Loss of p21 had no impact on the numbers, cycling or survival of pre-leukemic Eμ-Myc B-lymphoid cells, even when PUMA was lost concomitantly. These results demonstrate that even in the context of deregulated c-MYC expression, p53 must suppress tumor development by activating processes apart from, or in addition to, PUMA-mediated apoptosis and p21-induced cell cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2193637243,"This study compared delusional dimensions and attribution biases along the continuum of psychosis. Participants completed questionnaires on delusion-like beliefs and attributions. Although patients with first-episode psychosis (N = 70) endorsed fewer delusion-like beliefs than non-clinical individuals with psychotic-like experiences (N = 12), they scored highest on delusional conviction, distress and preoccupation, followed by non-clinical individuals with psychotic-like experiences, and then healthy controls (N = 642). Self-serving bias was found in patients and non-clinical individuals with psychotic-like experiences, but not in healthy controls. Personalizing bias for negative events was not significantly different across the three groups. When compared with healthy controls, non-clinical individuals with psychotic-like experiences had an exaggerated self-serving bias, but were not more marked in personalizing bias. Self-serving bias and personalizing bias were both associated with delusional dimensions. However, the association between self-serving bias and number of delusion-like beliefs was stronger among patients than non-clinical participants. Future research could investigate the extent to which self-serving bias, in combination with an appraisal of delusional ideation as convincing, distress, and preoccupying, contributes to the development of clinical delusions."

Here, we present x-ray crystal structures and biochemical characterization of the glutathione-dependent β-etherases, LigE and LigF, from this pathway. The crystal structures show that both enzymes belong to the canonical two-domain fold and glutathione binding site architecture of the glutathione S-transferase family. Mutagenesis of the conserved active site serine in both LigE and LigF shows that, whereas the enzymatic activity is reduced, this amino acid side chain is not absolutely essential for catalysis. The results include descriptions of cofactor binding sites, substrate binding sites, and catalytic mechanisms.

However, the functional role of many CAZ proteins and their respective isoforms remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that presynaptic deletion of the two G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting proteins (GITs), GIT1 and GIT2, at the mouse calyx of Held leads to a large increase in AP-evoked release with no change in the readily releasable pool size. Selective presynaptic GIT1 ablation identified a GIT1-specific role in regulating release probability that was largely responsible for increased synaptic strength. Increased synaptic strength was not due to changes in voltage-gated calcium channel currents or activation kinetics. Quantitative electron microscopy revealed unaltered ultrastructural parameters. Thus, our data uncover distinct roles for GIT1 and GIT2 in regulating neurotransmitter release strength, with GIT1 as a specific regulator of presynaptic release probability."
https://openalex.org/W2189655283,"The transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs, which are absolutely conserved (100%) between the orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes. Previous studies have described that several T-UCRs show differential expressions in cancers and might be involved in cancer development. We investigated the transcriptional levels of representative 26 T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differently expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and gastric cancer (GC). A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W2195034278,"Hereditary heterozygous mutations in a variety of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair genes have been associated with increased breast cancer risk. In the Finnish population, PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2) represents a major susceptibility gene for female breast cancer, and so far, only one mutation has been described, c.1592delT, which leads to a sixfold increased disease risk. PALB2 is thought to participate in homologous recombination (HR). However, the effect of the Finnish founder mutation on DSB repair has not been investigated. In the current study, we used a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from seven heterozygous female PALB2 c.1592delT mutation carriers with variable health status and six wild-type matched controls. The results of our DSB repair analysis showed that the PALB2 mutation causes specific changes in pathway usage, namely increases in error-prone single-strand annealing (SSA) and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) compared with wild-type LCLs. These data indicated haploinsufficiency regarding the suppression of error-prone DSB repair in PALB2 mutation carriers. To the contrary, neither reduced HR activities, nor impaired RAD51 filament assembly, nor sensitization to PARP inhibition were consistently observed. Expression of truncated mutant versus wild-type PALB2 verified a causal role of PALB2 c.1592delT in the shift to error-prone repair. Discrimination between healthy and malignancy-presenting PALB2 mutation carriers revealed a pathway shift particularly in the breast cancer patients, suggesting interaction of PALB2 c.1592delT with additional genomic lesions. Interestingly, the studied PALB2 mutation was associated with 53BP1 accumulation in the healthy mutation carriers but not the patients, and 53BP1 was limiting for error-prone MMEJ in patients but not in healthy carriers. Our study identified a rise in error-prone DSB repair as a potential threat to genomic integrity in heterozygous PALB2 mutation carriers. The used phenotypic marker system has the capacity to capture dysfunction caused by polygenic mechanisms and therefore offers new strategies of cancer risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2191834728,"Recent studies have shown that immunotherapies and molecular targeted therapies are effective for advanced melanoma. Non-antigen-specific immunotherapies such as immunocheckpoint blockades have been shown to be effective in the treatment of advanced melanoma. However, the response rates remain low. To improve their efficacy, they should be combined with antigen-specific immunotherapy. Elevated expression of the transcription factor, Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), has been reported in various human cancers, and it has been shown to have potential as a target for immunotherapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the FOXM1 expression in human melanoma samples and cell lines, to evaluate the relationship between the FOXM1 expression and the clinical features of melanoma patients and to investigate the association between the FOXM1 and MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in melanoma cell lines. We conducted the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analyses of melanoma cell lines, and investigated melanoma and nevus tissue samples by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We performed MEK siRNA and PI3K/AKT inhibitor studies and FOXM1 siRNA studies in melanoma cell lines. We found that FOXM1 was expressed in all of the melanoma cell lines, and was expressed in 49% of primary melanomas, 67% of metastatic melanomas and 10% of nevi by performing immunohistochemical staining. Metastatic melanoma samples exhibited significantly higher mRNA levels of FOXM1 (p = 0.004). Primary melanomas thicker than 2 mm were also more likely to express FOXM1. Patients whose primary melanoma expressed FOXM1 had a significantly poorer overall survival compared to patients without FOXM1 expression (p = 0.024). Downregulation of FOXM1 by siRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells, and blockade of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways decreased the FOXM1 expression in melanoma cell lines. In conclusion, FOXM1 is considered to be a new therapeutic target for melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2337538391,"Human breast cancers that have HER2 amplification/overexpression frequently carry PIK3CA mutations, and are often associated with a worse prognosis. However, the role of PIK3CA mutations in the initiation and maintenance of these breast cancers remains elusive. In the present study, we generated a compound mouse model that genetically mimics HER2-positive breast cancer with coexisting PIK3CAH1047R. Induction of PIK3CAH1047R expression in mouse mammary glands with constitutive expression of activated Her2/Neu resulted in accelerated mammary tumorigenesis with enhanced metastatic potential. Interestingly, inducible expression of mutant PIK3CA resulted in a robust activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling but attenuation of Her2/Her3 signaling, and this can be reversed by deinduction of PIK3CAH1047R expression. Strikingly, although these Her2+ PIK3CAH1047R-initiated primary mammary tumors are refractory to HER2-targeted therapy, all tumors responded to inactivation of the oncogenic PIK3CAH1047R, a situation closely mimicking the use of a highly effective inhibitor specifically targeting the mutant PIK3CA/p110a. Notably, these tumors eventually resumed growth, and a fraction of them escaped PI3K dependence by compensatory ERK activation, which can be blocked by combined inhibition of Her2 and MEK. Together, these results suggest that PIK3CA-specific inhibition as a monotherapy followed by combination therapy targeting MAPK and HER2 in a timely manner may be an effective treatment approach against HER2-positive cancers with coexisting PIK3CA-activating mutations."

Our study proposes a dual DDT-receptor model and provides a structural background for rational development of new insecticides. Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane proteins that are critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons and other excitable cells. In response to membrane depolarization, sodium channels open (activate) and allow sodium ions to flow into the cell, causing depolarization of the membrane potential. Activation of sodium channels is responsible for the rapidly rising phase of action potential. A few milliseconds after channel opening, the channel pore is occluded by an inactivation particle in the process known as fast inactivation that plays an important role in the termination of action potentials. Because of their crucial role in regulating membrane excitability, sodium channels are the primary target site of a broad range of neurotoxins, including insecticides. The pore-forming α-subunit of the sodium channel consists of four homologous repeat domains (I–IV). Each domain has six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) that are connected by intracellular and extracellular loops (Fig. 1). The S1–S4 segments in each domain serve as the voltage-sensing modules, whereas the S5 and S6 segments from each of the four domains and the four extracellular membranes re-entering S5–S6 loops, known as P-regions, constitute the pore-forming module. In response to membrane depolarization, the S4 segments move in the extracellular direction, initiating conformational changes that lead to the pore opening. Short intracellular linkers L45, which connect segments S4 and S5 in each domain, are believed to transmit the movements of the voltage-sensing modules to the S6 segments during the channel gating. 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) 3The abbreviations used are: DDT, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane; AaNav1-1, mosquito sodium channel from A. aegypti; BgNav1-1a, cockroach sodium channel from B. germanica; L45, linker connecting S4 and S5 of sodium channels; MC, Monte Carlo; MCM, Monte Carlo minimization; PyR1, pyrethroid receptor site 1; PyR2, pyrethroid receptor site 2; kdr, knockdown resistance. is an early generation lipid-soluble organochlorine insecticide (Fig. 1A). Because of its environmental toxicity, usage of DDT for pest control is restricted or forbidden in many countries, but DDT is permitted for control of disease vectors when safe, effective, and affordable alternatives are not available (1van den Berg H. Global status of DDT and its alternatives for use in vector control to prevent disease.Environ. Health Perspect. 2009; 117: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). DDT is produced in large amounts (mainly in India), and it is widely used in Africa. DDT is an agonist of voltage-gated sodium channels (2Hille B. Pharmacological modifications of the sodium channels of frog nerve.J. Gen. Physiol. 1968; 51: 199-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and its mode of action of DDT is similar to that of pyrethroid insecticides, which are extensively used in the control of agricultural and urban arthropod pests and human disease vectors (3Soderlund D.M. Bloomquist J.R. Neurotoxic actions of pyrethroid insecticides.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1989; 34: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). DDT and pyrethroids, such as deltamethrin and esfenvalerate (Fig. 1A), stabilize the open conducting state of sodium channels by inhibiting their transition to non-conducting inactivated or deactivated states (4Vijverberg H.P. van den Bercken J.

Mutations in the sodium channel confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids and also provide valuable information for mapping the receptor sites of DDT and pyrethroids on sodium channels (6Davies T.G.

Superimposed three-dimensional structures of insecticide molecules, which target the sodium channel, suggest that the bulky trichloroethane moiety of DDT matches the dimethylcyclopropyl moiety of deltamethrin and the isopropyl moiety of fenvalerate (9O'Reilly A.O.

Six mutations in IIS5 that are critical for the action of pyrethroids are also confirmed to reduce the potency of DDT on insect sodium channels (Fig. 1B) (11Usherwood P.N. Davies T.G. Mellor I.R.

These pioneering studies led to a model in which the trichloroethane moiety of DDT binds in the domain II/III interface (fenestration), between helices IIS5, IIP, and IIIS6, with one p-chlorophenyl ring oriented toward lipids and the other p-chlorophenyl ring extending along the IIS5 helix toward the kink between IIL45 and IIS5. The classic kdr mutation L1014F (i.e. L2i16F) (Fig. 1B) in the housefly and in analogous positions in many other insects substantially decreases the action of pyrethroids and DDT (7Dong K. Du Y.

Modelling insecticide-binding sites in the voltage-gated sodium channel.Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have shown that Leu1014 is located within a second pyrethroid receptor, PyR2, in the interface between domains I and II (14Du Y. Nomura Y. Satar G. Hu Z. Nauen R. He S.Y. Zhorov B.S.

In our PyR2 model, the dimethylcyclopropyl group of deltamethrin binds between helices IL45, IS5, IS6, and IIS6 below the fenestration. Our more recent study suggests a rotational symmetry of the two pyrethroid receptors, PyR1 and PyR2, and proposes a model in which two deltamethrin molecules simultaneously bind to these receptors (15Du Y. Nomura Y. Dong K. Zhorov B.S. Rotational symmetry of two pyrethroid receptor sites in the mosquito sodium channel. Mol.Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 273-280Google Scholar). In the overlay of the two channel models (9O'Reilly A.O. Khambay B.P. Williamson M.S. Field L.M. Wallace B.A. Davies T.G. Modelling insecticide-binding sites in the voltage-gated sodium channel.Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Du Y. Nomura Y. Dong K. Zhorov B.S. Rotational symmetry of two pyrethroid receptor sites in the mosquito sodium channel. Mol.Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 273-280Google Scholar), the dimethylcyclopropyl groups of deltamethrin bound in the same domain interface are more than 12 Å away from each other. Because the trichloromethyl group of DDT and the dimethylcyclopropyl group of deltamethrin are believed to bind at the same loci, the two models imply essentially different positions of DDT. To resolve this problem, unbiased mapping of DDT binding sites is warranted. In this study, we first employed a reduced x-ray structure of the open potassium channel, Kv1.2, to search for folding-specific regions in subunit interfaces to which DDT has the maximal shape complementarity. We further used a full-fledged Kv1.2-based model of the mosquito sodium channel AaNav1-1 and Monte Carlo energy minimizations to dock DDT from many starting positions and orientations that were randomly generated around the maximum shape-complementarity position found in the reduced Kv1.2 structure. Calculations predicted 14 sodium channel residues within the PyR1 and PyR2 sites that formed direct contacts with two DDT molecules. We mutated these as well as some other nearby residues in the mosquito sodium channel (AaNav1-1) and cockroach sodium channel (BgNav1-1a) and conducted functional analysis of the mutant channels in Xenopus oocytes. We found that 10 mutations significantly affected the DDT-induced inhibition of sodium channel inactivation, thus confirming predictions of our model. Our study elaborates the dual DDT-receptor model, confirms that DDT molecules bind to the pyrethroid receptors, PyR1 and PyR2, and provides a structural background for rational development of new insecticides. The x-ray structures of an open potassium channel, Kv1.2 (16Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Crystal structure of a mammalian voltage-dependent Shaker family K+ channel.Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar), and a closed sodium channel, NavRh (17Zhang X. Ren W. DeCaen P. Yan C. Tao X. Tang L. Wang J. Hasegawa K. Kumasaka T. He J. Wang J. Clapham D.E. Yan N. Crystal structure of an orthologue of the NaChBac voltage-gated sodium channel.Nature. 2012; 486: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), were used as templates to build, respectively, the open and closed state models of the mosquito sodium channel AaNav1-1. The transmembrane topology of the sodium channel is shown in Fig. 1, and the sequence alignment of selected regions of different channels is shown in Fig. 2. A bacterial sodium channel NavMs is crystallized in a presumably open state (18McCusker E.C. Bagnéris C. Naylor C.E. Cole A.R. D'Avanzo N. Nichols C.G. Wallace B.A. Structure of a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel pore reveals mechanisms of opening and closing.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), but we did not use the respective x-ray structure because it lacks the L45 linkers whose analogues in eukaryotic sodium channels contribute to pyrethroid receptors. Homology modeling and ligand docking were performed with the ZMM program (19Garden D.P. Zhorov B.S. Docking flexible ligands in proteins with a solvent exposure- and distance-dependent dielectric function.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2010; 24: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the Monte Carlo minimization (MCM) protocol (20Li Z. Scheraga H.A. Monte Carlo-minimization approach to the multiple-minima problem in protein folding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) as described in our previous study (14Du Y. Nomura Y. Satar G. Hu Z. Nauen R. He S.Y. Zhorov B.S. Dong K. Molecular evidence for dual pyrethroid-receptor sites on a mosquito sodium channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 11785-11790Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Molecular images were created using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 0.99rc6 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York). Homology models of heterotetrameric asymmetric eukaryotic sodium channels are less precise than x-ray structures of homotetrameric symmetric ion channels. Therefore, an apparent global minimum found by hands-free docking of a ligand is unlikely to correspond to the real structure of the ligand-channel complex. In an attempt to resolve this problem, we have used a two-stage approach. At the first stage, we employed the x-ray structures of Kv1.2 and NavRh channels in which all side chains, except glycines, alanines, and prolines, were substituted by alanine (hereafter reduced x-ray structures), and we used these structures to search for folding-specific regions in the subunit interfaces with the maximal shape complementarity to DDT. In the reduced x-ray structures of both channels, these regions were found in interfaces between three helices of one subunit (L45, S5, and S6) and helix S6 of another subunit. At the second stage, we used Monte Carlo minimizations to dock DDT in the full-fledged Kv1.2-based model of the mosquito sodium channel AaNav1-1 pore module. A thousand starting positions and orientations of DDT were randomly generated around its maximum-complementarity position found in the reduced Kv1.2 structure. We additionally focused the search by applying distance constraints between DDT and four residues (one from each of the helices IL45, IS5, IS6, and IIS6) that contribute to the maximal complementarity region in the reduced x-ray structures. Because specific atom-atom interactions between DDT and individual residues are unknown, we used ligand-side chain constraints. Each constraint specified the ligand (DDT), a channel residue, and the upper limit of the ligand side chain distance that was set at 5 Å. For each constraint, the closest pair of atoms between DDT and the side chain was selected in the beginning of each round of energy minimization so that the closest pair of atoms between DDT and a side chain may have been switched during the MCM trajectory. To preclude large deviations of the model backbones from the x-ray templates and thus preserve the channel folding during docking of the flexible ligand to the flexible protein, another set of distance constraints, pins, was imposed between matching α-carbons in the template and the model. A pin constraint is a flat-bottom parabolic energy function that allows an atom (in this study, an α-carbon) to deviate, penalty-free, up to 1 Å from the template and imposes a penalty of 10 kcal mol−1 Å−1 for larger deviations. The pin constraints are necessary because the initial relaxation of an unconstrained homology model with a bulky ligand would cause large deviations of the model backbones from the template due to steric clashes between the ligand and the channel. The MC minimization protocol optimized the system energy that included the penalty energy. For the final analysis, we considered low energy binding modes within 7 kcal/mol from the apparent global minimum. In all these binding modes, the penalty energy was equal to zero, indicating that all the distance constraints, including pins, were satisfied. We used a mosquito sodium channel, AaNav1-1, from Aedes aegypti or BgNav1-1a from Blattella germanica to generate all mutants used in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). All mutagenesis results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of insect sodium channels in Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. Procedures for preparation of oocytes and cRNA and injection were identical to those described previously (21Tan J. Liu Z. Wang R. Huang Z.Y. Chen A.C. Gurevitz M. Dong K.

Methods and data analysis for two-electrode voltage clamp recording of sodium currents were identical to those previously described (21Tan J. Liu Z. Wang R. Huang Z.Y. Chen A.C. Gurevitz M. Dong K.

Narahashi T. Differential mechanism of action of the pyrethroid tetramethrin on tetrodotoxin-sensitive and tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels.J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 595-603PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Sodium currents were measured with an OC725C oocyte clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and a Digidata 1440A interface (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA); pCLAMP 10.2 software (Axon Instruments Inc.) was used for data acquisition and analysis. The inhibitory effect of DDT on channel inactivation was assayed by measuring the remaining current at the end of a 20-ms depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential of −120 mV and normalized to peak current. Oocytes expressing AaNav1-1 and BgNav1-1a were incubated in DDT solution for 3–4 h before the assay. DDT was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Hollingworth (Michigan State University) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 100 mm stock. The working concentrations were prepared in ND96 recording solution immediately prior to experiments. The concentration of DMSO in the final solution was <0.5%, which had no effect on the function of expressed sodium channels. Results are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by using one-way analysis of variance with Scheffe's post hoc analysis, and significant values were set at p < 0.05. DDT is a bulky semi-rigid molecule. MC minimization of DDT yielded 20 conformations within 7 kcal/mol from the apparent global energy minimum. All the conformations are rather similar with some variations of the torsional angles C-Ph and C-CCl3 and bond angles (Fig. 3, A and B). Despite the rather inflexible three-dimensional structure of DDT, the relevance of the DDT-sodium channel model to the real structure is questionable due to several causes. First, a homology model of a heterotetrameric sodium channel cannot be as precise as the x-ray structures of the respective homotetrameric template. Second, DDT binding may change the side-chain conformations versus those in ligand-free homology models of the channel. Third, a millisecond molecular dynamics trajectory analysis of the Kv1.2 potassium channel (23Jensen M.Ø. Jogini V. Borhani D.W. Leffler A.E. Dror R.O. Shaw D.E. Mechanism of voltage gating in potassium channels.Science. 2012; 336: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) showed that the three-dimensional structure of the channel undergoes significant changes (breathings) during gating, and similar changes are expected to occur in sodium channels. Even if the full-fledged homology model of AaNav1-1 were precise, the straightforward search for the lowest energy complex between DDT and the flexible channel would require sampling and MC minimizations from a very large number of starting points, which is a huge computational job without a guaranteed success. To address this problem we first searched for shape-complementarity complexes between DDT and a reduced Kv1.2 model (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this model, potential DDT binding sites are more accessible than in the full-fledged model. Therefore, the inter-subunit channel cavities and clefts, which are determined by the protein folding rather than conformations of specific side chains, provide potential ligand-binding sites where the ligand would experience minimal sterical repulsions from the channel and maximal van der Waals attractions to it. Following the strategy described elsewhere (19Garden D.P. Zhorov B.S. Docking flexible ligands in proteins with a solvent exposure- and distance-dependent dielectric function.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2010; 24: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we generated 10,000,000 starting points with random orientations of DDT and random positions of its mass center within a 30 × 30 × 30 Å cube. The latter was centered at the widest point of the fenestration between different Kv1.2 subunits, i.e. between two S6 helices and one P-helix. In each point, the energy was calculated but not minimized. In the vast majority of the starting points, DDT clashed with the channel, and these were filtered out. However, even the lowest energy starting point had a positive energy due to DDT-channel repulsions that are unavoidable without energy minimizations. Next, we MC-minimized 1000 lowest energy structures accumulated from the 10,000,000 starting points in 1000 independent MCM trajectories. The protein conformation was kept rigid, whereas DDT position, orientation, and conformation were allowed to vary. Each trajectory was terminated when 100 consecutive energy minimizations did not decrease the energy of the lowest energy structure found in the trajectory. The lowest energy complex found in the 1000 trajectories is shown in Fig. 3C. The bulky trichloroethane moiety of DDT fits snugly between helices L45, S5, and S6 in subunit I and helix S6 of neighboring subunit II. (Because of the 4-fold symmetry of Kv1.2, any subunit can be assigned number I, but number II would denote a neighboring subunit that at the extracellular view is clockwise to subunit I.) The two p-chlorophenyl rings bound in the interfaces between helices IS5 and IL45 and helix IIS6. Importantly, the angle between the p-chlorophenyl rings matched that between helices IL45 and IS5. The DDT-Kv1.2 energy in this structure is −13.4 kcal/mol. No alanine residue experienced repulsion from DDT, and the energetic favorability of the complex was due to the van der Waals attractions between the channel and DDT. In other words, the complex had a large number of contacts between DDT and the channel and the maximal shape complementarity between DDT and the reduced Kv1.2 structure. Because of the 4-fold symmetry of the channel, the same maximal complementarity complexes are expected in the four interfaces between Kv1.2 subunits. Fig. 3D shows some alanine residues (positions 1k11, 1o6, 1i22, 1i25, and 2i16) in the domain I/II interface of the reduced Kv1.2 model that contribute to the DDT binding site. These positions correspond to PyR2 residues, which interact with the dimethyl-cyclopropyl group of deltamethrin (14Du Y. Nomura Y. Satar G. Hu Z. Nauen R. He S.Y. Zhorov B.S. Dong K.

Dong K. Zhorov B.S. Rotational symmetry of two pyrethroid receptor sites in the mosquito sodium channel. Mol.Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 273-280Google Scholar). This result supports the notion that the binding sites for DDT and pyrethroids may overlap and are consistent with the fact that at the maximum overlap superposition of the ligands, the dimethyl-cyclopropyl group of deltamethrin (Fig. 1A) coincides with the trichloromethyl group of DDT (Fig. 3, E and F). Both DDT and pyrethroids inhibit deactivation and inactivation of sodium channels and stabilize the open state, causing prolonged channel opening. Type II pyrethroids, like deltamethrin, preferably bind to open sodium channels, whereas type I pyrethroids, like permethrin, can also modify resting or inactivated channels (24Silver K.S. Du Y. Nomura Y. Oliveira E.E. Salgado V.L. Zhorov B.S. Dong K. Cohen E. Advances in Insect Physiology. Academic Press, Oxford, UK2014: 389-434Google Scholar). In terms of the chemical structure, DDT is more similar to type I pyrethroids than to type II pyrethroids, and DDT is believed to bind to the closed channel and stabilize the open state upon channel opening (25Narahashi T. Neuroreceptors and ion channels as the basis for drug action: past, present, and future.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether or not DDT binds to the same region in the open and closed channel states. To address this question, we searched for the DDT binding site in the closed channel by using the reduced x-ray structure of a bacterial sodium channel NavRh (17Zhang X. Ren W. DeCaen P. Yan C. Tao X. Tang L. Wang J. Hasegawa K. Kumasaka T. He J. Wang J. Clapham D.E. Yan N. Crystal structure of an orthologue of the NaChBac voltage-gated sodium channel.Nature. 2012; 486: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), which, despite certain asymmetry of the channel tetramer, appears a better template for homology modeling of eukaryotic channels than the x-ray structure of another bacterial sodium channel, NavAb (26Payandeh J. Scheuer T. Zheng N. Catterall W.A. The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel.Nature. 2011; 475: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the aligned sequences of AaNav1-1 (domains I, II, and IV), NavRh, and Kv1.2, all the channels have a serine or threonine residue in position o2 at the N-end of theS5 helix (Fig. 2). It is well known that an H-bond between the serine/threonine side chain and the main-chain carbonyls in the preceding helical turn may cause a kink in the α-helix (27Levitt M. Conformational"

Metabolic simulation using a genome-scale metabolic model and flux balance analysis is a powerful method that can be used to design metabolic engineering strategies for the improvement of target molecule production. In this study, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of A. platensis NIES-39 including 746 metabolic reactions and 673 metabolites, and developed novel strategies to improve the production of valuable metabolites, such as glycogen and ethanol. The simulation results obtained using the metabolic model showed high consistency with experimental results for growth rates under several trophic conditions and growth capabilities on various organic substrates. The metabolic model was further applied to design a metabolic network to improve the autotrophic production of glycogen and ethanol. Decreased flux of reactions related to the TCA cycle and phosphoenolpyruvate reaction were found to improve glycogen production. Furthermore, in silico knockout simulation indicated that deletion of genes related to the respiratory chain, such as NAD(P)H dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase, could enhance ethanol production by using ammonium as a nitrogen source."
https://openalex.org/W2195229720,"Genetic signatures from the Paleolithic inhabitants of Eurasia can be traced from the early divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages still present in contemporary human populations. Previous studies already suggested a pre-Neolithic diffusion of mitochondrial haplogroup HV*(xH,V) lineages, a relatively rare class of mtDNA types that includes parallel branches mainly distributed across Europe and West Asia with a certain degree of structure. Up till now, variation within haplogroup HV was addressed mainly by analyzing sequence data from the mtDNA control region, except for specific sub-branches, such as HV4 or the widely distributed haplogroups H and V. In this study, we present a revised HV topology based on full mtDNA genome data, and we include a comprehensive dataset consisting of 316 complete mtDNA sequences including 60 new samples from the Italian peninsula, a previously underrepresented geographic area. We highlight points of instability in the particular topology of this haplogroup, reconstructed with BEAST-generated trees and networks. We also confirm a major lineage expansion that probably followed the Late Glacial Maximum and preceded Neolithic population movements. We finally observe that Italy harbors a reservoir of mtDNA diversity, with deep-rooting HV lineages often related to sequences present in the Caucasus and the Middle East. The resulting hypothesis of a glacial refugium in Southern Italy has implications for the understanding of late Paleolithic population movements and is discussed within the archaeological cultural shifts occurred over the entire continent."

However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that mouse transferrin receptor 1 (mTfR1) is responsible for PV attachment to the cell surface, allowing invasion into the CNS via the BBB. PV interacts with the apical domain of mTfR1 on mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (MBEC4) in a dose-dependent manner via its capsid protein (VP1). We found that F-G, G-H, and H-I loops in VP1 are important for this binding. However, C-D, D-E, and E-F loops in VP1-fused Venus proteins efficiently penetrate MBEC4 cells. These results imply that the VP1 functional domain responsible for cell attachment is different from that involved in viral permeation of the brain capillary endothelium. We observed that co-treatment of MBEC4 cells with excess PV particles but not dextran resulted in blockage of transferrin transport into cells. Using the Transwell in vitro BBB model, transferrin co-treatment inhibited permeation of PV into MBEC4 cells and delayed further viral permeation via mTfR1 knockdown. With mTfR1 as a positive mediator of PV-host cell attachment and PV permeation of MBEC4 cells, our results indicate a novel role of TfR1 as a cellular receptor for human PV receptor/CD155-independent PV invasion of the CNS.

https://openalex.org/W2193978938,"Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) has been extensively used in the past for monosynaptic mapping. For decades, it was thought to lack the ability of transneuronal tracing. In order to investigate whether biotin conjugates of CTB (b-CTB) would pass through transneurons in the rat spinal cord, it was injected into the crushed left sciatic nerve. For experimental control, the first order afferent neuronal projections were defined by retrograde transport of fluorogold (FG, a non-transneuronal labeling marker as an experimental control) injected into the crushed right sciatic nerve in the same rat. Neurons containing b-CTB or FG were observed in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at the L4-L6 levels ipsilateral to the tracer injection. In the spinal cord, b-CTB labeled neurons were distributed in all laminae ipsilaterally between C7 and S1 segments, but labeling of neurons at the cervical segment was abolished when the T10 segment was transected completely. The interneurons, distributed in the intermediate gray matter and identified as gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic), were labeled by b-CTB. In contrast, FG labeling was confined to the ventral horn neurons at L4-L6 spinal segments ipsilateral to the injection. b-CTB immunoreactivity remained to be restricted to the soma of neurons and often appeared as irregular patches detected by light and electron microscopy. Detection of monosialoganglioside (GM1) in b-CTB labeled neurons suggests that GM1 ganglioside may specifically enhance the uptake and transneuronal passage of b-CTB, thus supporting the notion that it may be used as a novel transneuronal tracer."
https://openalex.org/W2191123825,"Synovial sarcoma accounts for almost 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and its prognosis is poor with 5-year survival rates at 36%. Thus, new treatments and therapeutic targets for synovial sarcoma are required. Tumor-initiating cells have been defined by the ability for self-renewal and multipotent differentiation, and they exhibit higher tumorigenic capacity, chemoresistance and radiation resistance, expecting to be a new therapeutic target. In synovial sarcoma, the presence of such stemness remains largely unclear; thus, we analyzed whether synovial sarcoma possessed tumor-initiating cells and explored specific markers, and we discovered that synovial sarcoma cell lines possessed heterogeneity by way of containing a sphere-forming subpopulation highly expressing NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2. By expression microarray analysis, CXCR4 was identified to be highly expressed in the sphere subpopulation and correlated with stem-cell-associated markers. Inhibition of CXCR4 suppressed the cell proliferation of synovial sarcoma cell lines in vitro. The tumor-initiating ability of CXCR4-positive cells was demonstrated by xenograft propagation assay. CXCR4-positive cells showed higher tumorigenicity than negative ones and possessed both self-renewal and multipotent differentiation ability. Immunohistochemical analysis of 39 specimens of synovial sarcoma patients revealed that CXCR4 strongly correlated with poor prognosis of synovial sarcoma. Thus, we conclude that CXCR4 is the marker of synovial sarcoma-initiating cells, a new biomarker for prognosis and a new potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2291310687,"Insectivorous birds have been recognized as disproportionately sensitive to land-use intensification and habitat loss, with those species feeding primarily on the ground exhibiting some of the most dramatic declines. Altered litter inputs and availability of epigeic arthropods have been suggested to underlie reduced abundances and shrinking distributions but direct evidence is lacking. I used a patch-scale removal experiment in southern Australia to evaluate whether ground-feeding insectivores are especially vulnerable to altered litter-fall. Building on work demonstrating the importance of mistletoe litter to nutrient dynamics, litter was reduced by removing mistletoe (Loranthaceae) from one set of eucalypt woodlands, responses of birds three years after mistletoe removal compared with otherwise similar control woodlands containing mistletoe. Despite not feeding on mistletoes directly, insectivores exhibited the greatest response to mistletoe removal. Among woodland residents, ground-foraging insectivores showed the most dramatic response; treatment woodlands losing an average of 37.4% of their pre-treatment species richness. Once these 19 species of ground-foraging insectivores were excluded, remaining woodland species showed no significant effect of mistletoe removal. This response reflects greater initial losses in treatment woodlands during the study (which coincided with a severe drought) and double the number of species returning to control woodlands (where mistletoe numbers and litter were not manipulated) post-drought. These findings support the productivity-based explanation of declining insectivores, suggesting diminished litter-fall reduced habitat quality for these birds via decreased availability of their preferred prey. In addition to altered prey availability, interactions between litter-fall and epigeic arthropods exemplify the importance of below-ground / above-ground linkages driving ecosystem function."
https://openalex.org/W2195036484,"Paternally Expressed Gene 3 (Peg3) is an imprinted gene that controls milk letdown and maternal-caring behaviors. In this study, a conditional knockout allele has been developed in Mus musculus to further characterize these known functions of Peg3 in a tissue-specific manner. The mutant line was first crossed with a germline Cre. The progeny of this cross displayed growth retardation phenotypes. This is consistent with those seen in the previous mutant lines of Peg3, confirming the usefulness of the new mutant allele. The mutant line was subsequently crossed individually with MMTV- and Nkx2.1-Cre lines to test Peg3's roles in the mammary gland and hypothalamus, respectively. According to the results, the milk letdown process was impaired in the nursing females with the Peg3 mutation in the mammary gland, but not in the hypothalamus. This suggests that Peg3's roles in the milk letdown process are more critical in the mammary gland than in the hypothalamus. In contrast, one of the maternal-caring behaviors, nest-building, was interrupted in the females with the mutation in both MMTV- and Nkx2.1-driven lines. Overall, this is the first study to introduce a conditional knockout allele of Peg3 and to further dissect its contribution to mammalian reproduction in a tissue-specific manner."

The diagnostic accuracy of T-SPOT.TB and TST was assessed in 117 children with active tuberculosis and 413 children with respiratory tract infection. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the tests used individually and together. Concordance was also calculated. Sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB (82.9%) was higher than TST (78.6% using a 5mm cut-off), especially in children confirmed to have TB. T-SPOT.TB was more specific than TST using a 5mm cut-off (96.1% vs. 70.9%). Combining T-SPOT.TB and TST results improved the sensitivity to 96.6%. In conclusion, the results of the current study indicate that T-SPOT.TB has good sensitivity and specificity, supporting its use among patients of this age. A combination of IGRA and TST would be useful additions to assist in the diagnosis of childhood TB."
https://openalex.org/W2270558808,"Proteins containing the BTB (Bric-à-brac, tramtrack, and Broad Complex) domain typically share low sequence similarities and are involved in a wide range of cellular functions. We previously identified two putative and closely related BTB genes, BTB1 and BTB2, in the genome of the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis. In the current study, full-length BTB1 and BTB2 cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. BTB1 and BTB2 encode proteins of 380 and 401 amino acids, respectively. BTB1 and BTB2 proteins each contain an N-terminal BTB domain and no other identifiable domains. Thus, they belong to a large category of BTB-domain proteins that are widely distributed in eukaryotes, yet with largely unknown function(s). BTB1 and BTB2 gene knockdowns in M. occidentalis females using RNAi reduced their fecundity by approximately 40% and 73%, respectively, whereas knockdown had no impact on their survival or the development of their offspring. These findings suggest these two proteins may be involved in processes related to egg production in this predatory mite, expanding the list of functions attributed to these diverse proteins."

It is very important to know if the diseases-resistant genes exist and express in this wild rice under native conditions. However, limited genomic or transcriptomic data of O. meyeriana are currently available. In this study, we present the first comprehensive characterization of the O. meyeriana transcriptome using RNA-seq and obtained 185,323 contigs with an average length of 1,692 bp and an N50 of 2,391 bp. Through differential expression analysis, it was found that there were most tissue-specifically expressed genes in roots, and next to stems and leaves. By similarity search against protein databases, 146,450 had at least a significant alignment to existed gene models. Comparison with the Oryza sativa (japonica-type Nipponbare and indica-type 93–11) genomes revealed that 13% of the O. meyeriana contigs had not been detected in O. sativa. Many diseases-resistant genes, such as bacterial blight resistant, blast resistant, rust resistant, fusarium resistant, cyst nematode resistant and downy mildew gene, were mined from the transcriptomic database. There are two kinds of rice bacterial blight-resistant genes (Xa1 and Xa26) differentially or specifically expressed in O. meyeriana. The 4 Xa1 contigs were all only expressed in root, while three of Xa26 contigs have the highest expression level in leaves, two of Xa26 contigs have the highest expression profile in stems and one of Xa26 contigs was expressed dominantly in roots. The transcriptomic database of O. meyeriana has been constructed and many diseases-resistant genes were found to express under native condition, which provides a foundation for future discovery of a number of novel genes and provides a basis for studying the molecular mechanisms associated with disease resistance in O. meyeriana."
https://openalex.org/W2181806682,"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, but severe thrombotic microangiopathy. In roughly two thirds of the patients, mutations in complement genes lead to uncontrolled activation of the complement system against self cells. Recently, aHUS patients were described with deficiency of the fibrinolytic protein plasminogen. This zymogen and its protease form plasmin have both been shown to interact with complement proteins in the fluid phase. In this work we studied the potential of plasminogen to restrict complement propagation. In hemolytic assays, plasminogen inhibited complement activation, but only when it had been exogenously activated to plasmin and when it was used at disproportionately high concentrations compared to serum. Addition of only the zymogen plasminogen into serum did not hinder complement-mediated lysis of erythrocytes. Plasminogen could not restrict deposition of complement activation products on endothelial cells either, as was shown with flow cytometry. With platelets, a very weak inhibitory effect on deposition of C3 fragments was observed, but it was considered too weak to be significant for disease pathogenesis. Thus it was concluded that plasminogen is not an important regulator of complement on self cells. Instead, addition of plasminogen was shown to clearly hinder platelet aggregation in serum. This was attributed to plasmin causing disintegration of formed platelet aggregates. We propose that reduced proteolytic activity of plasmin on structures of growing thrombi, rather than on complement activation fragments, explains the association of plasminogen deficiency with aHUS. This adds to the emerging view that factors unrelated to the complement system can also be central to aHUS pathogenesis and suggests that future research on the mechanism of the disease should expand beyond complement dysregulation."

We investigated whether these factors can be overridden by beliefs about people’s trust. We manipulated the information players received about each other’s level of general trust, “high” or “low”. These levels were either measured (Experiment 1) or just arbitrarily assigned labels (Experiment 2). Players’ choices whether to cooperate or defect in a stag hunt (or an assurance game)—where it is mutually beneficial to cooperate, but costly if the partner should fail to do so—were strongly predicted by what they were told about the other player’s trust label, as well as by what they were told that the other player was told about their own label. Our findings demonstrate the importance for cooperation in a risky coordination game of both first- and second-order beliefs about how much people trust each other. This supports the idea that institutions can influence cooperation simply by influencing beliefs."

We aim to determine the effects of childhood TBI on visual integration in relation to general neurocognitive functioning. Methods We compared children aged 6–13 diagnosed with TBI (n = 103; M = 1.7 years post-injury) to children with traumatic control (TC) injury (n = 44). Three TBI severity groups were distinguished: mild TBI without risk factors for complicated TBI (mildRF- TBI, n = 22), mild TBI with ≥1 risk factor (mildRF+ TBI, n = 46) or moderate/severe TBI (n = 35). An experimental paradigm measured speed and accuracy of goal-directed behavior depending on: (1) visual identification; (2) visual localization; or (3) both, measuring visual integration. Group-differences on reaction time (RT) or accuracy were tracked down to task strategy, visual processing efficiency and extra-decisional processes (e.g. response execution) using diffusion model analysis. General neurocognitive functioning was measured by a Wechsler Intelligence Scale short form. Results The TBI group had poorer accuracy of visual identification and visual integration than the TC group (Ps ≤ .03; ds ≤ -0.40). Analyses differentiating TBI severity revealed that visual identification accuracy was impaired in the moderate/severe TBI group (P = .05, d = -0.50) and that visual integration accuracy was impaired in the mildRF+ TBI group and moderate/severe TBI group (Ps < .02, ds ≤ -0.56). Diffusion model analyses tracked impaired visual integration accuracy down to lower visual integration efficiency in the mildRF+ TBI group and moderate/severe TBI group (Ps < .001, ds ≤ -0.73). Importantly, intelligence impairments observed in the TBI group (P = .009, d = -0.48) were statistically explained by visual integration efficiency (P = .002). Conclusions Children with mildRF+ TBI or moderate/severe TBI have impaired visual integration efficiency, which may contribute to poorer general neurocognitive functioning."

It is not known whether ER/PR-negative human breast cancer arises from an ER/PR-negative cell or from an ER/PR-positive cell that later lost ER/PR. Using intraductal injection of a lentivirus to deliver both an oncogene (ErbB2) and a floxed green fluorescent protein (GFP) in PRCre/+mice, whose Cre gene is under the control of the PR promoter, we were able to trace the PR status of the infected cells as they progressed to cancer. We found that the resulting early lesions stained negative for PR in most of the cells and usually retained GFP. The resulting tumors lacked ER and PR, and 75% (15/20) of them retained the GFP signal in all tumor cells, suggesting PR was never expressed throughout the evolution of a majority of these tumors. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ErbB2-initiated ER/PR-negative mammary tumors primarily originate from the subset of the mammary epithelium that is negative for PR and probably ER as well. These findings also provide an explanation for why antihormonal therapy fails to prevent ER-negative breast cancers."
