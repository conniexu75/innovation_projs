The eggs were suspended and washed in filtered sea water. Fertilization was performed by stirring with a small amount of sperm on a glass rod at 20-22”. Fertilized eggs were allowed to develop at 18” in filtered sea water in a constant temperature room, where their containers were tilted rhythmically, or in beakers in a constant temperature bath, in which they were slowly stirred. These conditions allowed development at least to the late pluteus stage. All experiments were performed with suspensions of 5000 embryos per ml. Concentrations of embryos and their stages of development were ascertained at 100 x magnification in a counting chamber. In the experiments on synchronously dividing embryos, two simultaneous samples were taken for biochemical assay and for determining the stage of development. To the former sample was added 5% trichloroacetic acid, to the latter 1% formalin in sea water. The average number of cells per embryo are plotted in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 to show the stage of development. These curves refer to the times at which given numbers of cell divisions are completed, i.e. when the cleavage furrows are completed. Incorporation caused by bacterial contamination may be regarded as negligible, since even in very long incubations of un"

https://openalex.org/W2072015523,Incubation of cell suspensions of Tetrahymena pyriformis with chlorpromazine increased the permeability of the cell membrane. This permeability change could be measured either biochemically by the increased entrance of a chelator or physically by change in light scattering.

https://openalex.org/W1497025351,"IN the course of work on the oxidation products of vitamin E, we have oxidized a number of samples of d-α-tocopherol and synthetic dl-α-tocopherol with alkaline potassium ferricyanide. In studying the products from these oxidations, the interesting observation was made that the oxidation product from d-α-tocopherol had a high optical rotation, [α]25D = + 31.5°, whereas that of dl-α-tocopherol had no detectable rotation. This difference provides a convenien+ method for distinguishing between the d- and the dl-forms."
https://openalex.org/W2053113714,"IN a recent publication from this laboratory it was noted that vitamin C deficiency in guinea pigs prevented induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis as well as development of the tuberculin reaction1. Replacement of the scorbutic diet with a normal stock diet four weeks after deprivation began and three weeks after inoculation of the challenge vaccine containing brain and killed Mycobacterium butyricum in water-in-oil emulsion permitted subsequent development of tuberculin sensitivity although the guinea pigs failed to develop clinical or histological signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. It was important to determine the exact basis for the animals' failure to respond to tuberculin by development of a skin reaction because of the bearing this information might have on the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Did absence of vitamin C prevent the end organ response (development of a positive skin reaction to tuberculin or, in the case of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, the inflammatory lesions in the brain), or was the vitamin essential to the primary immunological response to the injected antigen(s)?"

https://openalex.org/W2091159040,"TRYPSIN inhibitors have been found in pancreas, serum, colostrum, egg-white, soya bean, and lima bean1. They have all been crystallized except from egg-white2. Thus, examination of the distribution of trypsin inhibitors in proteins of them appears to be out of the question. Recently, Nakamura et al.3 have demonstrated, by two-dimensional paper electrophoresis, that two trypsin inhibitors were contained in the extract of soya-bean. Hence the distribution of trypsin inhibitors in other biological fluids deserves to be re-investigated to see whether there are also two inhibitors in them or not."
https://openalex.org/W2021907809,"GLYCEROL has been used as a protective agent for frozen bacteria1,2, Leptospirœ3, trypanosomes4, Toxoplosma gondii5, Entamoeba histolytica6, animal tissues7, bull spermatozoa4, and yeasts8. Although much work has been done on a variety of micro-organisms, little or no information is available regarding the protective action of glycerol on frozen Shigella sonnei. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of glycerol on frozen S. sonnei and also the effect of glycerol on cells frozen and thawed repeatedly. Four strains were studied: strain CH, obtained from Dr. Horace M. Gezon, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Penna.; strains B–2501–3 and B–2506–3, obtained from the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Md.; and strain 13–3, obtained from Dr. Arthur Abrams, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D.C."

https://openalex.org/W2035531222,A study of the relation between the membrane potential and the amplitude of the slow component of the retinal action potential obtained from inside a single insect photoreceptor cell suggests that the slow component is equivalent to the change in the membrane potential caused by background illumination.

https://openalex.org/W1982824208,"EXPERIMENTS performed on the dog suggest that the kidney is a source of production of an erythropoietic factor. Erythropoiesis is suppressed by bilateral nephrectomy while this function is maintained after ureteral ligation1,2. Furthermore, erythropoietin plasma-level decreases after nephrectomy in an anaemic dog and is unaffected by ureteral ligation, despite the same accumulation of metabolic waste products3. The present investigation was designed to determine whether it is possible to stimulate erythropoiesis in dogs made anaemic by severe bleedings performed after nephrectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2010223879,"IN recent experiments in this laboratory, a substance has been demonstrated in human aortae which is capable of coagulating fibrinogen independently of thrombin1. This factor, vasculokinase, appears to have no esterase, amidase or gelatinase activity. Nevertheless, its capability of catalysing fibrinogen to fibrin suggests that it may be a proteolytic enzyme. In previous experiments by Lorand and Middlebrook2, it has been shown that the N-terminal amino-acids of the fibrin monomer catalysed by thrombin are tyrosine and glycine. It has been suggested that there is a specific peptide site in the fibrinogen molecule which must be split in order for the monomers to polymerize3–4."
https://openalex.org/W2021658147,"IF equal amounts of trinitrobenzene and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon are dissolved in chloroform and the solution is dried off on to filter paper, a colour often appears due to the formation of a charge-transfer complex. The new absorption bears no relation to that of either of the components separately, and may be almost anywhere in the spectrum depending on the hydrocarbon. It is generally believed that negative charge is transferred from the hydrocarbon, acting as donor, to the trinitrobenzene, acting as acceptor. Other kinds of donor and acceptor are known1, and a theory of such complexes, base on molecular orbitals, has been given by Mulliken2."

https://openalex.org/W2021965519,"BECAUSE of the importance of fluorometric microanalysis of catecholamines, the ethylenediamine condensation method1 should be examined in detail. The specificity of this method for noradrenaline might be important. In previous communications2,3, we indicated that the main condensation product of noradrenaline or of 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid is considered to be the same as that of catechol, and that the side-chain of noradrenaline or of 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid might be damaged severely during the condensation reaction. Weil-Malherbe4 reported that with catechol, noradrenaline and 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, two main products which appear to be identical for the three compounds are formed. According to Joly and Nadeau5, at least three of the fluorescent spots on a two-dimensional paper chromatogram of an ethylenediamine condensate of tagged adrenaline (β-14C-DL-adrenaline) were not radioactive, and these three fluorescent spots were found to be common to the three chromatograms obtained from adrenaline, noradrenaline and catechol."
