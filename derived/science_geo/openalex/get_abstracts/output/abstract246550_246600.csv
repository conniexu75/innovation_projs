https://openalex.org/W2152906859,"Molecular and antigenic analyses of three influenza viruses isolated from outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in racing greyhounds revealed that they are closely related to H3N8 equine influenza virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the canine influenza virus genomes form a monophyletic group, consistent with a single interspecies virus transfer. Molecular changes in the hemagglutinin suggested adaptive evolution in the new host. The etiologic role of this virus in respiratory disease was supported by the temporal association of rising antibody titers with disease and by experimental inoculation studies. The geographic expansion of the infection and its persistence for several years indicate efficient transmission of canine influenza virus among greyhounds. Evidence of infection in pet dogs suggests that this infection may also become enzootic in this population."

https://openalex.org/W1967724489,"Genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis is associated with genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), particularly HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 (ref. 1). Both locus and allelic heterogeneity have been reported in this genomic region2,3. To clarify whether HLA-DRB1 itself, nearby genes in the region encoding the MHC or combinations of these loci underlie susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, we genotyped 1,185 Canadian and Finnish families with multiple sclerosis (n = 4,203 individuals) with a high-density SNP panel spanning the genes encoding the MHC and flanking genomic regions. Strong associations in Canadian and Finnish samples were observed with blocks in the HLA class II genomic region (P < 4.9 × 10−13 and P < 2.0 × 10−16, respectively), but the strongest association was with HLA-DRB1 (P < 4.4 × 10−17). Conditioning on either HLA-DRB1 or the most significant HLA class II haplotype block found no additional block or SNP association independent of the HLA class II genomic region. This study therefore indicates that MHC-associated susceptibility to multiple sclerosis is determined by HLA class II alleles, their interactions and closely neighboring variants."

Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from wild type and TG mice were isolated and subjected to a series of in vitro incubation experiments. In α2i TG mice basal α2 activity was barely detectable, whereas basal α1 activity was only partially reduced. Known AMPK stimuli including 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR), rotenone (a Complex I inhibitor), dinitrophenol (a mitochondrial uncoupler), muscle contraction, and sorbitol (producing hyperosmolar shock) did not increase AMPK α2 activity in α2i TG mice, whereas α1 activation was attenuated by only 30–50%. Glucose transport was measured in vitro using isolated EDL muscles from α2i TG mice. AICAR- and rotenone-stimulated glucose transport was fully inhibited in α2i TG mice; however, the lack of AMPK α2 activity had no effect on contraction- or sorbitol-induced glucose transport. Similar to these observations in vitro, contraction-stimulated glucose transport, assessed in vivo by 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose incorporation into EDL, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles, was normal in α2i TG mice. Thus, AMPK α2 activation is essential for some, but not all, insulin-independent glucose transport. Muscle contraction- and hyperosmolarity-induced glucose transport may be regulated by a redundant mechanism in which AMPK α2 is one of multiple signaling pathways.

AMPK is activated in response to decreases in intracellular ATP and concomitant increases in AMP, increasing the AMP:ATP ratio (15Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). It has long been believed that there are two major signaling mechanisms leading to glucose transport stimulation in skeletal muscle. One mechanism is insulin-activated signaling through the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The other is insulin-independent signaling for stimuli such as exercise, hyperosmolarity, mitochondrial uncoupling, and hypoxia (23Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which recent reports suggest to be regulated by AMPK. Initial evidence in support of a role for AMPK in muscle glucose transport came from studies using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), a compound that is taken up into skeletal muscle and metabolized to ZMP, an analog of AMP. It was first shown that AICAR infusion enhances insulin-stimulated glucose transport in perfused rat hindlimb skeletal muscles (3Merrill G.F. Kurth E.J. Hardie D.G. Winder W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1107-E1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After this report, our group (4Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) and Bergeron et al. (5Bergeron R. Russell Spaceiiiqq R.R. Young L.H. Ren J.M. Marcucci M. Lee A. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E938-E944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that AICAR directly stimulates glucose transport in the absence of insulin in isolated rat muscle. Similar to contraction-induced glucose transport, AICAR-stimulated glucose transport was not affected by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 5Bergeron R. Russell Spaceiiiqq R.R. Young L.H. Ren J.M. Marcucci M. Lee A. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E938-E944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to studies of muscle contraction, AMPK activation closely correlates with increased glucose transport in isolated rat muscle in response to other insulin-independent stimuli such as hypoxia, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and hyperosmolarity (24Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Similar to contraction, these stimuli also reduce cellular ATP, phosphocreatine, and glycogen levels (4Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). A potential role for AMPK in glucose transport induced by hyperosmolarity (6Fryer L.G. Foufelle F. Barnes K. Baldwin S.A. Woods A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Fryer L.G. Hajduch E. Rencurel F. Salt I.P. Hundal H.S. Hardie D.G. Carling D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23554-23562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) has also been suggested based on findings in cultured muscle cells. Therefore, AMPK may be a key molecule that is responsible for insulin-independent glucose transport caused by cellular stress in skeletal muscle. Consistent with the hypothesis that AMPK regulates glucose transport in rat skeletal muscle, transgenic mice that express a muscle-specific inactive mutant of AMPKα that reportedly has a dominant inhibitory effect have full inhibition of AICAR- and hypoxia-stimulated glucose transport, whereas contraction-stimulated glucose transport was reduced by 30–40% (28Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). In contrast, Jorgensen et al. (29Jorgensen S.B. Viollet B. Andreelli F. Frosig C. Birk J.B. Schjerling P. Vaulont S. Richter E.A. Wojtaszewski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1070-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) showed that contraction-induced glucose transport in isolated muscles was not altered in either α1 or α2 whole body AMPK knock-out mice. These reports have led us to reconsider the role of the two catalytic subunits of AMPK in glucose transport regulation by muscle contraction and other non-insulin stimuli. For this purpose, we generated three types of muscle-specific transgenics; they are 1) mice expressing an inactive form of the α1 catalytic subunit isoform (α1i TG mice), 2) mice expressing an inactive form of α2 (α2i TG mice), and 3) a cross of α1i TG and α2i TG (α1/2i TG mice). We show that although AMPK activity is necessary for some insulin-independent glucose transport (AICAR and mitochondrial respiratory Complex I inhibition), glucose transport induced by contraction and hyperosmolarity does not require active α2 protein. Therefore, we conclude that at least three distinct or overlapping intracellular signaling pathways (i.e. an insulin-dependent, an AMPK-dependent, and an insulin/AMPK-independent pathway) are present in murine skeletal muscle for the regulation of glucose transport. Generation of Transgenic Mice—To render the catalytic subunit inactive, the aspartic acid at amino acid residue 157 of rat AMPK α2 subunit was substituted to alanine by a PCR-based site direct mutagenesis as described by Stein et al. (30Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Complementary primers spanning the residue to be mutated (30Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) were synthesized and used for the mutagenesis. Mice expressing the inactive α2 tagged at the amino terminus with a hemagglutinin epitope (α2i TG mice) were generated by injecting the recombinant DNA driven by a muscle creatine kinase promoter (a gift from Drs. Kohjiro Ueki and C. Ronald Kahn, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) into fertilized FVB mouse oocytes at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Transgenic Mouse Facility (Boston, MA). Three α2i TG lines were confirmed, and the founders were bred to FVB mice. A similar strategy was used with the goal of generating mice that express an inactive α1 in skeletal muscle (α1i TG mice). Rat AMPK α1 cDNA, in which the lysine at amino acid residue 45 was changed to arginine to render the catalytic subunit inactive (31Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez S.C. Kemps B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), was tagged at the amino terminus with the Myc epitope. Six α1i TG lines were confirmed, and the founders were bred to FVB mice. Transgenic mouse founders were identified by polymerase chain reaction-based methods, and transgene product expression was confirmed by immunoblots with an antibody for each tagged epitope. Mice expressing both transgenes were generated by breeding an α2i TG line to an α1i TG line (α1/2i TG mice). Ten-to-sixteen-week-old mice from F2 and F3 generations were used for experiments. Comparisons of the transgenic mice were made against littermate wild type mice. All procedures used were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center. Muscle Incubation and Contraction in Vitro—Mice were sacrificed, and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were rapidly removed and treated as previously described (4Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 24Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Both ends of each EDL muscle were tied with suture (silk 4–0) and mounted on an incubation apparatus. Muscles were preincubated in 6 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (117 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 24.6 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.5) containing 2 mm pyruvate for 20 min. The muscles were then incubated in KRB buffer in the absence or presence of 2 mm AICAR (20 min), 500 μm dinitrophenol (DNP; 20 min), 3 μm rotenone (40 min), or 120 mm sorbitol (30 min). We have previously reported that muscle treatment with DNP, rotenone, and sorbitol decreases ATP, phosphocreatine, and glycogen in skeletal muscle (24Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For the wortmannin studies muscles were preincubated in KRB buffer containing 2 mm pyruvate for 30 min in the presence or absence of wortmannin (100 nm). The maximal concentration of vehicle (Me2SO) was 0.1%, which did not affect any assay. The buffers were kept at 37 °C throughout the experiment and gassed continuously with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. For muscle contraction, muscles were transferred to a tissue support with stimulating electrodes (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and resting tension was set to 0.5 g. Muscles were stimulated for 10 min with the following parameters: train rate = 1/min; train duration = 10 s; pulse rate = 100 pulse/s; duration = 0.1 ms; volts = 100 V. Force production during contraction was monitored with an isometric force transducer (Kent Scientific, Litchfield, CT), and the converted digital signal was captured by a data acquisition system (iWorx114, CB Sciences, Dover, NH). Muscle force generation was determined with data analysis software (LabScribe, CB Sciences, Dover, NH) and represented by g × 10 s. In the second series of experiments muscles from wild type mice were stimulated 2–3 times before the 10-min contraction period to find an optimum voltage to match muscle force production with the α2i TG mice. Prior contractions were very short (train rate = 0.1/min; train duration = 180 ms), and we determined that these short contractions did not affect force generation during the subsequent 10 min of contraction. The standard 10-min contraction protocol was then carried out with the determined optimum voltage (8.4–21 V). Measurement of Glucose Transport in Vitro—Immediately after muscle incubation or contraction, the muscles were transferred to KRB buffer containing 1 mmol/liter 2-deoxy-d-glucose (1.5 μCi/ml) and 7 mmol/liter d-[14C]mannitol (0.3 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C and incubated for 10 min. The same concentration of AICAR, DNP, rotenone, sorbitol, or insulin was included in each buffer if present during the previous incubation period. Glucose transport was terminated by dipping muscles in KRB buffer containing 80 μmol/liter cytochalasin B at 4 °C, and muscles were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscles were weighed and digested by incubating in 250 μl of 1 m NaOH at 80 °C for 10 min. Digests were neutralized with 250 μl of 1 m HCl, and particulates were precipitated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Radioactivity in aliquots of the digested muscles was determined by liquid scintillation counting for dual labels, and the extracellular and intracellular spaces were calculated as previously described (4Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In Situ Muscle Contraction—Mice that had been fasted for 12 h were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg). The sciatic nerves were bilaterally isolated, and subminiature electrodes were placed around each nerve and interfaced with a Grass model S88 electrical stimulation unit as previously described (32Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Balon T.W. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E987-E995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ruderman N.B. Houghton C.R.S. Hems R. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Hindlimb muscles on one side were stimulated to induce contractions for 15 min (1 train/s, 500-ms train duration, 100 Hz, 0.1-ms duration, 1–5 V), whereas the contralateral side remained unstimulated and served as a sham-treated control. Measurement of Glucose Uptake in Vivo—Muscle glucose uptake in vivo was measured as described previously (34Ho R.C. Alcazar O. Fujii N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: R342-R349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, base-line blood samples were collected from the tails of mice, the jugular vein was catheterized, and an intravenous bolus of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (10 μCi/mouse) was administered. After injection of the tracer, mice were subjected to the 15 min in situ muscle contraction protocol described above. Blood samples were obtained at 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, and 45 min for the determination of blood glucose concentrations and 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose specific activities. After collection of the last blood sample, animals were sacrificed, and the EDL, the tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles were removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscles were digested by incubating in 400 μlof1 m NaOH at 80 °C for 10 min and neutralized with 400 μl of 1 m HCl. Aliquots of this neutralized solution were added to either perchloric acid or Ba(OH)2/ZnSO4 and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The radioactivity of an aliquot of each of these two supernatants was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Phosphorylated 2-deoxy-d-glucose in each tissue was then calculated as the difference between the radioactivity in the perchloric acid and Ba(OH)2/ZnSO4 supernatants and used to calculate rates of uptake (35Ferre P. Leturque A. Burnol A.-F. Penicaud L. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Measurement of Isoform-specific AMPK Activity—AMPK activity was measured as previously described (4Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscle lysates (150 μg protein) were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against the α1 or α2 catalytic subunits (36Fujii N. Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Smith J.T. Habinowski S.A. Kaijser L. Mu J. Ljungqvist O. Birnbaum M.J. Witters L.A. Thorell A. Goodyear L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and protein A beads. The kinase reaction was carried out in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm synthetic SAMS peptide, 0.2 mm AMP, 80 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were spotted on Whatman P81 filter paper, the papers were extensively washed in 1% phosphoric acid, and radioactivity was assessed with a scintillation counter. Kinase activity was assessed by incorporated ATP (pmol) per immunoprecipitated protein (mg) per min as previously described (37Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E299-E304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AICAR Tolerance Test—AICAR (0.25 g/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to wild type and α2i TG mice. Blood was collected from the tail before (0 min) and after AICAR injection (20, 40, and 60 min). Blood glucose was determined using a glucometer (ONE TOUCH Ultra, LifeScan, PA). Noninvasive Physiological and Behavioral Characterization—Fourteen-week-old wild type and α2i TG mice were subjected to noninvasive physiological and behavioral characterization using the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments, Columbus) at the Physiology Core Laboratory of the Joslin Diabetes Center. The mice were monitored for 24 h to assess oxygen consumption (ml/kg/h), carbon dioxide generation (ml/kg/h), heat generation calculated from the gas exchange data (kcal/h), food consumption (g/24 h), water consumption (ml/24 h), and locomotive activity, evaluated by three-dimensional fixed point observation (counts/h). Monitoring started at 10:00 h, and CLAMS assessment was made during both the light cycle (07:00 to 19:00 h) and dark cycle (19:00 to 7:00 h). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was done using standard procedures as previously described (38Fujii N. Boppart M.D. Dufresne S.D. Crowley P.F. Jozsi A.C. Sakamoto K. Yu H. Aschenbach W.G. Kim S. Miyazaki H. Rui L. White M.F. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C200-C208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the α1 and α2 catalytic subunit isoforms were generated by standard methods (36Fujii N. Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Smith J.T. Habinowski S.A. Kaijser L. Mu J. Ljungqvist O. Birnbaum M.J. Witters L.A. Thorell A. Goodyear L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Other antibodies were from commercial sources including hemagglutinin (Roche Diagnostics), IRS-1 and Akt (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and glucose transporter 1 and 4 (GLUT1, GLUT4) (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Statistics—Statistical evaluation was performed by two-way analysis of variance or Student's two-tailed t test. When analysis of variance revealed significant differences, the Bonferroni t test was used as a post hoc test for multiple comparisons. AMPK Activity and Subunit Expression in α2i TG Mice—Immunoblot analysis using an isoform-specific AMPK α2 antibody showed that the α2 protein in the α2i TG mice possessed a slower mobility (Fig. 1A, upper arrow) compared with wild type mice (lower arrow), likely due to the hemagglutinin tag. In α2i TG mice, endogenous α2 was only detected with very long exposure times, suggesting that almost all endogenous α2 protein was replaced by the mutated α2 in α2i TG mice. Band densities revealed that expression of the α2 mutant protein was 1.6-fold higher than the endogenous α2 expressed in wild type mice (Fig. 1A, left). To characterize the effects of α2 transgene expression on AMPK activity, EDL muscles were isolated from α2i TG mice and their wild type littermate controls. Muscles were incubated in vitro in the absence or presence of AICAR. Both basal and AICAR-stimulated α2 activities were severely reduced in α2i TG mice compared with wild type mice (Fig. 1B, left). On the other hand, basal levels of α1 activity were only slightly decreased in the muscle of the α2i TG mice (Fig. 1B, right). AICAR-stimulated α1 activity was reduced by 50% in α2i TG mice, but this still represented a significant 2-fold increase above basal. We also characterized AMPK activation in muscles of α2i TG mice using DNP, a chemical mitochondrial uncoupler which reduces cellular ATP levels and activates AMPK. Similar to AICAR, DNP-induced α2 activation was abolished, and α1 activation was partially inhibited in α2i TG mice (Fig. 1C). Forced expression of an inactive α subunit can act as a dominant-negative by preventing the native α subunit from binding to the regulatory subunits (39Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stei"
https://openalex.org/W1973568641,"The reaction rate between nitric oxide and intraerythrocytic hemoglobin plays a major role in nitric oxide bioavailability and modulates homeostatic vascular function. It has previously been demonstrated that the encapsulation of hemoglobin in red blood cells restricts its ability to scavenge nitric oxide. This effect has been attributed to either factors intrinsic to the red blood cell such as a physical membrane barrier or factors external to the red blood cell such as the formation of an unstirred layer around the cell. We have performed measurements of the uptake rate of nitric oxide by red blood cells under oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions at different hematocrit percentages. Our studies include stopped-flow measurements where both the unstirred layer and physical barrier potentially participate, as well as competition experiments where the potential contribution of the unstirred layer is limited. We find that deoxygenated erythrocytes scavenge nitric oxide faster than oxygenated cells and that the rate of nitric oxide scavenging for oxygenated red blood cells increases as the hematocrit is raised from 15% to 50%. Our results 1) confirm the critical biological phenomenon that hemoglobin compartmentalization within the erythrocyte reduces reaction rates with nitric oxide, 2) show that extra-erythocytic diffusional barriers mediate most of this effect, and 3) provide novel evidence that an oxygen-dependent intrinsic property of the red blood cell contributes to this barrier activity, albeit to a lesser extent. These observations may have important physiological implications within the microvasculature and for pathophysiological disruption of nitric oxide homeostasis in diseases.

To elicit its vasodilatory activity, NO must diffuse to the smooth muscle cells and activate soluble guanylate cyclase. In 1994, Lancaster suggested that the proximity of the endothelium to the millimolar concentrations of hemoglobin (Hb), an avid NO scavenger, would severely compromise the efficiency of the NO/soluble guanylate cyclase pathway (5Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). However, later studies have indicated that the physical compartmentalization of hemoglobin within the red blood cell (RBC) effectively reduces the apparent rate at which NO is consumed by Hb (6Coin J.T.

One contributory element to this effect is a RBC-free zone at the blood/endothelium interface that is present during laminar flow (7Butler A.R. Megson I.L. Wright P.G. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, the rate of NO consumption has been reported to occur up to 1000 times more slowly by red blood cells than by an equivalent concentration of cell-free hemoglobin. Two potential mechanisms for this effect involve either the presence of an unstirred layer surrounding the red blood cell that is formed as a result of NO diffusion (6Coin J.T. Olson J.S. J. Biol.

Acta. 2005; 1723: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rapid mixing of NO with RBCs directly measures the rate of NO uptake but both the unstirred layer and intrinsic membrane barrier could potentially be responsible for the slow NO uptake observed in these measurements. In 2000, Liao and coworkers (11Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) developed a technique to measure the rate of NO uptake by RBCs in which the potential contribution of the unstirred layer is minimized. This technique uses competition experiments that involve slow release of NO in the presence of excess cell-free and RBC-encapsulated Hb. The rate of NO uptake by the RBCs is calculated using the known rate that NO reacts with cell-free Hb and measuring the fraction of reacted Hb in the RBCs compared with that in solution (11Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Using this competition method, Liao and coworkers found that the rate that NO is taken up by oxygenated RBCs at 15% hematocrit (Hct) is 500–1000 times slower than the rate that cell-free Hb binds NO, implicating a major role for the intrinsic membrane boundary (11Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recent calculations have found that the apparent rate of NO scavenging by RBCs in competition experiments can be explained without incorporation of an intrinsic membrane boundary due to its dependence on the bimolecular rate of the reaction of free Hb with NO and on Hct (25Tsoukias N.M. Popel A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2265-H2277Google Scholar). We have examined these factors in this report. To better understand the contribution of extracellular diffusional barriers, the potential intrinsic barrier effect of the erythrocyte membrane, and the implications of these barriers on NO scavenging at differing physiological and pathophysiological hematocrits and oxygen tensions, we have studied NO scavenging rates of red cells using a number of independent methodologies. These studies confirm the important contributions of both the extracellular unstirred layer and, to a lesser extent, the intrinsic submembrane diffusional barrier. Interestingly, the latter effect increases with red cell oxygenation. Blood was drawn from volunteers into EDTA tubes, and hemoglobin was prepared as described previously (26Huang Z. Louderback J.G. Goyal M. Azizi F. King S.B. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1568: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Spermine NONOate (N-[4[1-(3-aminopropyl)-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino]butyl]-1,3-propanediamine) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. NO-saturated buffer was prepared as described previously (26Huang Z. Louderback J.G. Goyal M. Azizi F. King S.B. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1568: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the concentration of NO was determined using a Sievers nitric oxide analyzer NOA 280i (Boulder, CO). All experiments were performed either in phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) or Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (0.122 m NaCl, 0.030 m KH2PO4 plus Na2HPO4, 2 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4, 290 mosmol/kg). No difference was observed in any experiments using either buffer. Stopped-flow mixing experiments were performed on an OLIS RSM 1000 spectrometer (Bogart, GA) coupled to a Molecular Kinetics three-syringe mixer (Indianapolis, IN). For anaerobic experiments, blood was deoxygenated by repeated cycling of gentle vacuum and atmospheric exchange with an inert, wet gas (nitrogen or argon, bubbled through water), and diluted into deoxygenated buffer, and residual oxygen was scavenged by sodium dithionite (0.2 mm final concentration after having been prepared in deoxygenated buffer under strict anaerobic conditions). For experiments on oxygenated cells, the samples were prepared in buffer that had been equilibrated in air. The diluted blood was loaded into a syringe in the Molecular Kinetics mixer so that the final concentration of Hb after stopped-flow mixing was 0.05 mm. The concentration of NO buffer, loaded into another syringe, after mixing was 2–11 times in molar excess to Hb. The third syringe was filled with buffer which, for experiments with deoxygenated cells, contained 0.5 mm dithionite that was used to scavenge oxygen in the mixing chamber and observation cuvette (1.5-mm path length), and the entire system was flushed constantly with argon. In initial anaerobic experiments, all three syringes contained 40% glucose by weight to reduce gravitational effects on the suspended red cells. To ensure that the glucose itself had no significant effect due its potential for osmotic activity, experiments were also carried out using an isotonic iodixanol solution, OptiPrep density gradient medium (25–30% by volume from Sigma) to reduce gravitational effects, and no difference was seen using this system. All experiments on oxygenated cells were performed using OptiPrep. The lack of any effect on tonicity of any of the buffers used was confirmed by incubating packed red cells diluted 5-fold in excess buffer and measuring the hematocrit percentage. The hematocrit values after incubation were 19% ± 1%, 21% ± 1%, and 17 ± 2%, for the cells incubated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline alone, Dulbecco's plus OptiPrep, and Dulbecco's plus glucose, respectively. The viscosities of the solutions, measured using a glass capillary viscometer (Cannon Instruments, State College, PA), were 1.5 times that of water for those containing OptiPrep and 2.5 times that of water for those containing glucose. The observed rate of NO uptake by red cell-encapsulated Hb was determined by singular value decomposition (SVD) and global analysis (27Huang Z. Ucer K.B. Murphy T. Williams R.T. King S.B. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and divided by the final NO concentration to obtain an apparent bimolecular rate constant. The volumes and flow speeds were varied to examine potential artifacts on measured NO uptake rates, but the apparent bimolecular rates were found to be independent of these. Competition experiments were performed similarly to those by the Liao group (11Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Han T.H. Qamirani E. Nelson A.G. Hyduke D.R. Chaudhuri G. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

NO reacts with oxygenated Hb to form methemoglobin (MetHb). NO was slowly released in excess cell-free and RBC-encapsulated Hb, and the reaction products (MetHb or HbNO) were examined to determine the relative rates of NO uptake by the RBCs compared with the reaction rate for cell-free Hb. Generally, red blood cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at 15% or 50% Hct. Cell-free Hb was added to the RBCs suspension. The total amount of cell-free Hb reported is the sum of added Hb and that resulting from cell lysis during handling. The percentage of cell-free Hb to total Hb used varied between 0.4 and 3%. Previous work has shown that varying the amount of cell-free Hb while keeping the Hct constant does not significantly affect the results of competition experiments (11Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A fresh ampoule of spermine NONOate was thawed and prepared in 0.01 m NaOH prior to addition to an Hb/RBC mixture. The ratio of cell-free to RBC-encapsulated Hb was determined by comparing the absorbance of the supernatant of the mixture after centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 2 min in a microcentrifuge to the absorbance of the diluted mixture. In some later experiments, the absorbance of the initial mixture was not taken, because it was calculated adequately based on the hematocrit and known additions of cell-free Hb. Absorption spectra were collected in the visible range (380–700 nm) on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences lambda 9 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere to collect scattered light from the RBCs suspensions as described previously (26Huang Z. Louderback J.G. Goyal M. Azizi F. King S.B. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1568: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Some spectra that did not contain RBCs were taken on a Cary 50 Bio spectrometer (Varian Inc.). The RBC/Hb mixtures were incubated with 10–50 μm NONOate while on a magnetic stirrer at slow speed to keep the sample homogeneous. Deoxygenated samples were also kept under a gentle nitrogen gas flow to maintain an anaerobic environment. Periodically, samples were collected to determine the amount of MetHb for experiments conducted under normoxic conditions or HbNO for experiments conducted under anaerobic conditions. The amounts of MetHb and HbNO formed were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). One portion (0.5 ml) of the mixture containing the total HbNO or MetHb formed was collected into a tube, and another portion was centrifuged (at 3000 × g for 2 min). The supernatant containing only cell-free HbNO or MetHb was collected in another EPR tube, and a third EPR tube was filled with a sample containing the RBC pellet. HbNO was measured by EPR using a Bruker EMX 10/12 spectrometer operating at 9.4 GHz, 5-G modulation, 10.1-milliwatt power, 655.36-ms time constant, and 167.77-s scan or 327.68-ms time constant and 83.89-s scan over 600 G at 110 K. MetHb was measured by EPR (at low field using 15-G modulation, 10.1-milliwatt power, 81.92-ms time constant, and 41.94-s scan over 700 G) at 4 K using liquid helium. The concentrations of Hb species measured by EPR were determined by performing the double integral calculation and comparing to standard samples. The ratio of the bimolecular rate constant of NO reacting with cell-free Hb (kf) to the apparent bimolecular rate constant of NO uptake by RBC-encapsulated Hb (kr) was determined by the relative amount of HbNO or MetHb formed with, [HbNO]f[HbNO]r=kf[Hb]fkr[Hb]ror[MetHb]f[MetHb]r=kf[Hb]fkr[Hb]r(Eq. 1) where the subscripts “r” and “f” refer to the RBCs encapsulated and cell-free Hb, respectively. The concentrations (indicated by brackets) represent the moles of the species in the total volume. Thus (for example), [HbNO]f=(1−Hct)*[HbNO]s(Eq. 2) where [HbNO]s represents the concentration of HbNO in the supernatant. A similar equation is used to determine [Hb]f from the concentration of deoxy-Hb in the supernatant ([Hb]f = (1 - Hct)* [Hb]s, where the subscript “s” refers to the supernatant). The concentration of encapsulated Hb, [Hb]r was determined by subtracting the concentration of free Hb from the total Hb. Initially, we calculated [HbNO]r or [MetHb]r by subtracting [HbNO]f or [MetHb]f from the total [HbNO] or [MetHb] ([HbNO]t or [MetHb]t). However, because the term [HbNO]r or [MetHb]r can be quite small and they appear in the denominator of Equation 1, large errors may result. Generally, having a small term in the denominator of an equation that results from subtracting two large ones can be problematic. Therefore, we calculated kf/kr using three different methods: 1) [HbNO]r or [MetHb]r and [HbNO]f or [MetHb]f were plugged directly into Equation 1; 2) [HbNO]f or [MetHb]f was plugged directly into Equation 1, and [HbNO]r or [MetHb]r was calculated from the difference of [HbNO]t or [MetHb]t and [HbNO]f or [MetHb]f; and 3) [HbNO]r or [MetHb]r was plugged directly into Equation 1, and [HbNO]f or [MetHb]f were calculated from the difference of [HbNO]t or [MetHb]t and [HbNO]r or [MetHb]r. As long as the measured amounts of Hb that reacted with NO in the red cell and supernatant (cell-free) fractions added up to that measured in the un-fractionated portion, the three methods gave the same result. These three methods were therefore used as a self-consistency check for the amount of reacted Hb. Any data, where the percentage difference using one method of calculating kf/kr compared with the average of the three different methods was >30%, were thrown out. The equations we used to calculate kf/kr are similar to those derived previously (11Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). When necessary, a term accounting for the fact that [Hb]f is not constant in time due to conversion to HbNO or MetHb (11Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was included. In the experiments on oxygenated samples, problems could arise due to auto-oxidation of the Hb and activity of the RBCs MetHb reductase. To account for these processes, MetHb was measured on control samples that were not treated with the NO donor, and these were subtracted from the samples that were treated with the NO donor. Under the conditions of our experiments, MetHb reductase activity was not significant as evidenced by parallel experiments in which the amount of MetHb formed when NO donor was added to cell-free Hb alone was compared with the total MetHb formed when the NO was added to the mixture of cell-free Hb and RBCs. In these cases, the total amount of MetHb made in the samples without RBCs was always the same or less than that made in the ones with RBCs. The observed weak effect of the MetHb reductase system observed over the course of our experiments is consistent with the time course of MetHb decay following NO breathing (29Gladwin M.T. Schechter A.N. Shelhamer J.H. Pannell L.K. Conway D.A. Hrinczenko B.W. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Noguchi C.T. Rodgers G.P. Ognibene F.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For anaerobic experiments, samples were deoxygenated by gentle rocking and exposure to flow of wet argon or nitrogen gas overnight or by washing several times in deoxygenated buffer. For most experiments, sodium dithionite at a final concentration of 10 mm was used to scavenge residual oxygen. To test whether the dithionite itself had an effect, three separate experiments were conducted using a different oxygen scavenging system consisting of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase at a final concentration of 0.05 units/ml and its substrate, protocatechuic acid at a final concentration of 1.0 mm. These concentrations did not significantly affect the pH. In addition, two experiments were conducted where no oxygen scavenging system was used, but extra care was taken in the handling of the sample to keep the Hb mostly deoxygenated. The only affect of the dithionite that was observed was that the rate of NO release was accelerated. No effect was observed on measured ratios of kf/kr. Typical results from stopped-flow mixing of deoxygenated RBCs with excess NO are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A shows the absorption spectra collected as a function of time over 1.8 s when 50 μm hemoglobin (hematocrit of 0.25%) was mixed with 350 μm NO under anaerobic conditions. Analysis of these spectra using singular value decomposition/global analysis demonstrates that the spectral changes follow a single exponential and are indicative of the formation of HbNO (Fig. 1B). The initial spectrum is a mixture of deoxygenated Hb and HbNO. The formation of HbNO during the mixing time of the experiment is likely due to the presence of cell-free Hb as a result of limited hemolysis during mixing. As cell-free Hb binds NO governed by a rate constant of 3–6 × 107m-1s-1 (30Cassoly R. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 31Kim-Shapiro D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the binding of NO to free Hb in this system would be expected to occur with a lifetime (1/rate) of <0.1 ms, and so it would occur within the dead time of mixing. The effective second-order rate constant for the binding of NO to RBC-encapsulated Hb was found to be (1.4 ± 0.3) × 104m-1s-1 (n = 14 at 5 different NO:Hb ratios). In most experiments, glucose was used to prevent sedimentation of cells during the experiments. In one experiment, OptiPrep was used instead of glucose and the binding rate constant was measured to be (1.8 ± 0.1) × 104m-1s-1. These values for NO binding to RBC-encapsulated Hb at low Hct (0.25%) and excess NO to Hb are about 1000 times slower than the measured rate of NO binding to cell-free Hb and confirm previous measurements (32Carlsen E. Comroe J.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1958; 42: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Measurements on the reaction of excess NO to oxygenated RBCs are complicated by the fact that the NO will initially react with oxygenated Hb (which has absorption peaks at 576, 540, and 415 nm (33Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) to form MetHb (which has absorption peaks at 500 and 405 nm (33Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)), and subsequently the MetHb can bind excess NO to form a ferric-NO species, MetHb-NO (which has absorption peaks at 564, 534, and 418 nm (34Fernandez B.O. Ford P.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 10510-10511Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). We present results from experiments on rapid mixing of NO and oxygenated RBCs in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows species derived from SVD and global analysis of typical data collected with NO:Hb ratios of 2.4 (Fig. 2A) and 6.4 (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2 (C and D) shows the corresponding time courses. Because MetHb has a relatively weak affinity for NO, when NO is not in large excess, very little MetHb-NO forms so that the reaction can be approximated as HbO2 + NO → MetHb governed by a single pseudo first order rate constant. This is the case for data such as that present in Fig. 2A, where we obtained an average observed rate of 2.6 s-1. When NO is in greater excess to Hb, an additional reaction must be considered, MetHb + NO ↔ MetHb-NO. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 2B, and its time course in D, where MetHb (with a little NO bound) is an intermediate species and the final species is a mixture of MetHb-NO and MetHb. For the data shown we obtained observed rates of 19 s-1 for the formation of the first species and 3.1 s-1 for the formation of the second one. The average of the effective second order rate constant for the reaction of NO with oxygenated RBCs that we obtained when NO was not in large excess to Hb was (3.6 ± 1.2) × 104m-1s-1 (n = 3). In cases where formation of MetHb-NO was significant we obtained average second order rate constants of (5.3 ± 0.8) × 104m-1s-1 for formation of the first species and (1.2 ± 0.3) × 104m-1s-1 for formation of the second one (n = 4). We performed competition experiments under conditions where, unlike in stopped-flow experiments, Hb is in large excess to NO. For aerobic experiments, spermine NONOate was added to an oxygenated solution containing both RBCs and cell-free Hb, and the ratio of NO reacting with cell-free versus encapsulated Hb was measured by MetHb formation and used to calculate the relative rate constants (see “Materials and Methods”). For anaerobic experiments, the NO donor was added to deoxygenated RBCs, and cell-free Hb and HbNO was measured. Typical absorption and EPR spectra from these experiments are shown in Fig. 3.

https://openalex.org/W2092859042,"GAPDH is a redox-sensitive glycolytic enzyme that also promotes apoptosis when translocated to the nucleus and associates with aggregate-prone proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Recent evidence indicates that polymorphic variation within GAPDH genes is associated with an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously demonstrated that GAPDH readily undergoes disulfide bonding following oxidant exposure, although the consequence of disulfide bonding on GAPDH activity or function is unknown. Here we show that increased GAPDH disulfide bonding is observed in detergent-insoluble extracts from AD patient and transgenic AD mouse brain tissue compared with age-matched controls. Exposure of primary rat cortical neurons to the pro-oxidant amyloid beta peptide promotes nuclear accumulation of a disulfide-linked form of GAPDH, which becomes detergent-insoluble. Disulfide bonding leads to a reduction in GAPDH enzymatic activity and correlates with the appearance of punctate aggregate-like GAPDH staining within the cytoplasm of both oxidant-treated HT22 cells and amyloid beta-treated primary cortical neurons. Our findings suggest that disulfide bonding of GAPDH and subsequent protein aggregate formation may have relevance to the pathophysiology of AD."

The propensity for A2E to undergo photooxidation was initially revealed by a tendency for fluorescence quenching of intracellular A2E upon blue light illumination (13Sparrow J.R. Zhou J.

Subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry showed that 430 nm irradiation of A2E, either in an acellular or cellular environment, yielded products that, starting from the M+ m/z 592 peak attributable to A2E, presented as consecutive peaks differing in m/z by 16 (15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Several lines of investigation suggested that singlet oxygen is involved in the photooxidation, with A2E serving as a sensitizer for the generation of singlet oxygen from triplet oxygen (13Sparrow J.R.

For instance, the extent of photooxidation was found to increase in deuterium oxide (D2O), a solvent that prolongs the lifetime of singlet oxygen. Irradiation (430 nm) of A2E in chloroform also produces a luminescence at ∼1270 nm, which is typical of the phosphorescence of singlet oxygen. In addition, experiments demonstrated that singlet oxygen generated by an endoperoxide of 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene could substitute for blue light in mediating A2E oxidation. Singlet oxygen quenchers were also found to be inhibitory. Nonetheless, oxidation by other reactive forms of oxygen may also occur (17Pawlak A. Wrona M. Rozanowska M. Zareba M. Lamb L.E. Roberts J.E.

Given that A2E has nine double bonds besides the pyridinium ring, together with the observation that nine m/z peaks (592 + n(16)) culminating in the m/z 736 peak (592 + 9(16)) (Fig. 2) (15Ben-Shabat S.

Because of the likelihood that numerous stereoisomers of the nonaoxirane species were present, together with its instability and the small amount of compound that was available, structural studies were not performed. As part of our effort to elucidate mechanisms involved in A2E oxidation, we also oxidized A2E with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) (15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This approach led to the appearance of an m/z 624 peak (parent peak), to which was assigned a 7,8,7′,8′-bisoxido structure based on the nonaoxirane and mass spectrometry and 1H NMR data (15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that photooxidation products of A2E can include a mono-furanoid oxide, a bisfuranoid oxide (Fig. 3B), and a mono-furanoid oxide with a second oxygen attached to the cyclohexenyl ring (20Dillon J. Wang Z. Avalle L.B. Gaillard E.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 79: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion was based on the fragmentation patterns generated by collision-induced dissociation and tandem mass spectrometry, an approach that cannot discriminate between a 5,8-furanoid and a 7,8-epoxide. Nor can the use of 1H NMR spectra distinguish a furanoid from an epoxide moiety because the chemical shift of the 7,8-protons in 1H NMR does not reveal the resonance of the 7,8-carbon. Here we provide definitive evidence from HSQC-NMR spectroscopy that the complex mixture of oxidized species resulting from A2E photooxidation includes a 5,8-monofuran-A2E. Further investigation has also uncovered a bisoxygenated photoproduct that has been structurally characterized as 5,8-monoperoxy-A2E. More importantly, through an analysis of chromatographic properties and UV-visible spectra together with mass spectrometry to provide molecular weight information, we have also detected a monofuran-A2E and monoperoxy-A2E in aged human RPE and in the eyecups of mice with null mutations in Abca4/Abcr, the gene responsible for recessive Stargardt disease.FIGURE 3Candidates for the structure of the oxygen-containing moiety generated by MCPBA oxidation of A2E.

Subsequently, endoperoxide of 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene (48.0 mg, 10 eq of A2E) was added to a solution of A2E (15.0 mg) in CD3OD (1.0 ml), and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature in the dark.

HSQC (400 MHz, CD3OD): 82.9 (C-8), 83.6 (C-8′), 115.2 (C-7), 116.7 (C-7′). Cell Culture and Illumination—Human adult RPE cells (ARPE-19, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) lacking endogenous A2E (22Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar) were grown as described previously (22Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar). To generate A2E-laden RPE, nonconfluent cultures were allowed to accumulate A2E from a 20 μm concentration in medium. Cells were subsequently exposed to 430 nm illumination (0.36 milliwatt/mm2) as described previously (13Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar). Illuminated cells were harvested and added to a solution of chloroform and methanol at a 2:1 ratio. This mixture were homogenized in a glass tissue homogenizer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was dried under argon, redissolved in methanol, and subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) study. Human and Mouse Tissue—Human donor eyes were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia). Abca4/Abcr null mutant mice (Rpe65 450Leu, pigmented, 129/SV × C57BL/6J) were generated as described previously (23Kim S.R. Fishkin N. Kong J. Nakanishi K. Allikmets R. Sparrow J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11668-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The mice were raised under a 12-h on-off cycle lighting with an in-cage illuminance of ∼250 lux. Human RPE (from four eyes, ages 58–68) and murine posterior eye cups (six eye cups; age 17 months) were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline using a tissue grinder. An equal volume of a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1) was added, and the sample was extracted three times. To remove insoluble material, extracts were filtered through cotton and passed through a reversed phase cartridge (C18 Sep-Pak, Millipore) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol. After removing solvent by evaporation under argon gas, the extract was dissolved in methanol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, for LC-MS analysis. HPLC—A Waters™ 600 equipped with photodiode array detector (model 996) and operating with Empower® software was used for HPLC analysis. A Cosmosil 5C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was used for analytical scale HPLC. Mass Spectrometry—Fast atom bombardment ionization-MS was performed on a JEOL JMS-HX110A/110A tandem MS (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan), using 10-kV acceleration voltage and fitted with a Xenon beam FAB gun (6 kV) on the MS-1 ion source. 3-Nitrobenzyl alcohol was used as matrix. HPLC separation combined with mass spectrometry for analysis of A2E oxidation products in cultured cells and tissues was performed on an Esquire 3000 (Bruker Daltonic Inc., Billerica, MA) with electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Samples were introduced with flow injection mode. A reversed phase column (Atlantis® dC18, 3 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm; Waters) was used under the following mobile phase conditions: solvent A, CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; gradient mode (% of A/B, v/v), 0 min, 10:90; 75 min, 100:0; flow rate, 0.3 ml/min. To generate a partially oxidized A2E (oxo-A2E) species, we began by using MCPBA as the oxidizing agent. Reaction of A2E with MCPBA (2 eq) in the dark followed by HPLC analysis revealed a bisoxo product with 1H NMR and mass spectral profiles that were identical to those reported previously for MCPBA-oxidized A2E (15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We surmised that the oxygen-containing moiety could exhibit one of three possible structures: 5,6-epoxide, 5,8-furanoid, or 7,8-epoxide (Fig. 3). The 5,6-epoxide and 5,8-furanoid were considered to be candidates because MCPBA oxidation of β-carotene with the same ring moiety yields a 5,6-epoxide; moreover, the 5,6-epoxide readily rearranges to the 5,8-furanoid structure even under mild acidic conditions (20Dillon J. Wang Z. Avalle L.B. Gaillard E.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 79: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Baldas J. Porter Q.N. Cholnoky L. Szabolos J. Weedon B.C.L. Chem. Commun. 1966; 23: 852-854Google Scholar). However, the 5,6-epoxide was eliminated as a possibility because NMR revealed that the 7,8,7′,8′ proton signals at 5.15–5.26 ppm are shifted upfield (see the NMR data under “Experimental Procedures”) compared with those of A2E at 6.18 to 6.53 ppm (6Sakai N. Decatur J. Nakanishi K. Eldred G.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1559-1560Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because fragment ions generated using collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectral analysis for structural determination of oxo-A2E can form by rearrangement during ionization, we sought confirmatory evidence of a furanoid ring by NMR analysis. Accordingly, by using HSQC-NMR spectroscopy to reveal correlations between carbon atoms and directly attached protons (hydrogen), the structure was shown to be that of a 5,8-furanoid (Fig. 4). Specifically, HSQC analysis revealed that the two 87 ppm sp3 carbons are coupled to 5.15 (8-H)/5.19 (8′-H) ppm protons, whereas the two 117 ppm sp2 carbons are coupled to 5.22 (7-H)/5.26 (7′-H) ppm protons. In addition, because both of the two UV-visible absorbance maxima of A2E were blue-shifted (see below) in this bisoxo-A2E, it was established that the bisoxo-A2E is 5,8,5′,8′-bisfuran-A2E (Fig. 4). We were also able to identify the monooxo-A2E as 5,8-monofuran-A2E. Because A2E photooxidation is likely to occur, at least in part, via a singlet oxygen-mediated pathway (13Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ben-Shabat S. Itagaki Y. Jockusch S. Sparrow J.R. Turro N.J. Nakanishi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), A2E was also reacted with 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene endoperoxide, an aromatic compound that decomposes to singlet oxygen and 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene with a convenient half-life of 5 h at 25°C. Analysis of the product by LC-MS revealed the presence of a peak that exhibited a UV-visible absorption spectrum suggestive of a bisoxo-A2E but a molecular mass (m/z 656) that was consistent with the addition of 4 oxygens. NMR studies, including 1H and HSQC NMR, showed upfield-shifted protons at the 7, 8, and 7′, 8′ positions, which together with the existence of sp2 carbons evidenced by HSQC data (115.2 (C-7), 116.7 (C-7′)) confirmed this tetraoxo-A2E as 5,8,5′,8′-bisperoxy-A2E (Fig. 5). The presence of the 1,2-dioxin moieties in this oxo-A2E species was corroborated by comparison with a previous investigation that demonstrated the production of a cyclic 5, 8-peroxide upon photolysis of A1E, a nonbiological single side arm counterpart to A2E (25Jockusch S. Ren R.X. Jang Y.P. Itagaki Y. Vollmer-Snarr H.R. Sparrow J.R. Nakanishi K. Turro N.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4646-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We found that oxidation-associated changes in the UV-visible spectrum of A2E served as a means to determine the oxidation site (Fig. 6). This was possible because the absorption peaks of A2E at 337 nm (band S) and 439 nm (band L) could be assigned to the shorter and longer chains that extend from the pyridinium ring, respectively. Thus, whether the hypsochromic shift occurred in either band S or band L revealed the side arm on which the loss of conjugation had occurred. For instance, comparison of the UV-visible spectra of the mono-furanoid and mono-peroxide with that of A2E revealed that only band S was blue-shifted. In contrast, both bands were observed to undergo a hypsochromic shift in the bisfuranoid and bisperoxide. Both furanoid and peroxide formation resulted in the loss of two successive conjugation systems, hence the absorption maximum (either band S or L) of the affected side arm was shifted toward the blue region by ∼40 nm. HPLC analysis of products generated by photooxidation and chemical oxidation also revealed the presence of 335 and 400 nm absorbance peaks that corresponded to blue shifts in only the L band. This observation indicated oxidation exclusively on the longer arm. However, the minuscule amount of these compounds precluded further structural studies. Oxidation apparently occurs more readily on the shorter arm of A2E. Of the two polyenes extending ortho and para to the pyridinium nitrogen, electron delocalization is favored along the former ortho arm, which has one extra conjugation π bond; this leads to relatively lower density of electrons in each of the sp2 carbons, thus making it less nucleophilic and less susceptible to the MCPBA attack. In order to examine the formation of the oxidative products of A2E in a cellular environment, ARPE-19 cells were allowed to incorporate A2E, and the A2E-laden ARPE cells were irradiated at 430 nm. Chloroform/methanol extracts of the cells were analyzed by LC-MS. As shown in Fig. 7, two eluting components that were more polar than A2E and with m/z of 624 and 608 were resolved. The UV-visible spectra of these peaks had similar profiles; specifically, absorbance maxima occurred at 296 nm (band S) and ∼435 nm (band L). Because only band S exhibited a hypsochromic shift, relative to A2E, it was apparent that in both cases two successive conjugate systems on the shorter arm of A2E were lost by oxidation. On the basis of the presence of two peaks, which by LC-MS exhibited molecular sizes that corresponded to a mono-oxo (m/z 608) and bisoxo-A2E (m/z 624), together with our prior NMR analysis that established the structures of these products, it was evident that in this cellular system the mono-furanoid and mono-peroxide formed. We also detected oxo-A2E in chloroform/methanol extracts of RPE cells isolated from human donor eyes and in extracts of posterior eye cups of Abca4/Abcr–/– mice. The latter mice are considered to be a model of Stargardt macular degeneration. Again we used LC-MS for this analysis. It is our experience that the use of MS/MS fragmentation analysis with collision-induced dissociation is not a reliable approach to the assignment of oxo-A2E structure because the fragmentation patterns vary, probably because the oxygen-containing fragment ions can undergo complex intramolecular rearrangements. As shown in Fig. 8, examination of the human and mouse samples by LC-MS revealed the presence of reversed phase HPLC eluates with extracted ion signals indicative of m/z 592, 608, and 624. The corresponding compounds could be identified as A2E (m/z 592), monofuran-A2E (m/z 608), and monoperoxy-A2E (m/z 624) because they had the same retention time and UV-visible absorbance spectra as the species detected in A2E-laden ARPE-19 cells following 430 nm irradiation (Fig. 7). To determine whether these partially oxidized forms of A2E could serve as intermediates on a pathway to further oxidation of A2E, we incubated A2E with MCPBA and isolated the product 5,8-monofuran-A2E by HPLC. The monofuranoid in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Me2SO was subsequently submitted to blue light irradiation (430 nm), and unirradiated and irradiated samples were analyzed by MS. As shown in Fig. 9, the 5,8-monofuran-A2E (m/z 608) underwent further oxidation to generate higher molecular species representing the incorporation of additional oxygens (i.e. m/z 640, 672, and 720 peaks corresponding respectively to addition of 2, 4, and 7 oxygens). Most interestingly, however, if irradiation of 5,8-monofuran-A2E was carried out with methanol as solvent, no additional oxidation occurred. We also proceeded to revisit the issue of solvent effects on A2E photooxidation. To this end, we performed HPLC analysis of unirradiated samples of A2E and samples in which A2E was irradiated in an environment of Me2SO/H2O and samples irradiated in Me2SO/D2O (Fig. 10). Consistent with the ability of deuterium solvent to extend the lifetime of singlet oxygen (26Rodgers M.A.J. Snowden P.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5541-5543Crossref Scopus (450) Google Scholar), irradiation in D2O resulted in more pronounced photooxidation, the latter reflected in"

Previously, we found that an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) integrin binding domain in the P2Y2R enables this receptor to interact selectively with αvβ3 and αVβ5 integrins, an interaction that is prevented by mutation of the RGD sequence to arginine-glycine-glutamic acid (RGE) (Erb, L., Liu, J., Ockerhausen, J., Kong, Q., Garrad, R. C., Griffin, K., Neal, C., Krugh, B., Santiago-Perez, L. I., Gonzalez, F. A., Gresham, H. D., Turner, J. T., and Weisman, G. A. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 153, 491–501). This RGD domain also was found to be necessary for coupling the P2Y2R to Go- but not Gq-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization, leading us to investigate the role of P2Y2R interaction with integrins in nucleotide-induced chemotaxis. Here we show that mutation of the RGD sequence to RGE in the human P2Y2R expressed in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells completely prevented UTP-induced chemotaxis as well as activation of Go, Rac, and Vav2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac. UTP also increased expression of vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein that is a ligand for αvβ3/β5 integrins, in cells expressing the wild-type but not the RGE mutant P2Y2R. P2Y2R-mediated chemotaxis, Rac and Vav2 activation, and vitronectin up-regulation were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with anti-αvβ5 integrin antibodies, αv integrin antisense oligonucleotides, or the Gi/o inhibitor, pertussis toxin. Thus, the RGD-dependent interaction between the P2Y2R and αv integrins is necessary for the P2Y2R to activate Go and to initiate Go-mediated signaling events leading to chemotaxis.

Thus, the RGD-dependent interaction between the P2Y2R and αv integrins is necessary for the P2Y2R to activate Go and to initiate Go-mediated signaling events leading to chemotaxis. Chemotaxis is the movement of a cell in response to a chemical gradient and is required for many physiological events, including embryonic development, immune system function, and wound healing (2Sanchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3Cox E.A.

The process of chemotaxis is also important for understanding diseases that result from abnormal cell migration, such as chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. To migrate, cells must establish dynamic and highly regulated adhesive interactions with the extracellular matrix, which are mediated by integrin receptors (3Cox E.A. Huttenlocher A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, recent studies have shown that αv integrins play an important role in controlling cell adhesion, spreading, and motility in several cell types, including human vascular smooth muscle cells and pancreatic beta cells (5Stawowy P.

Upon activation, many types of integrin receptors cluster together and recruit a host of cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic proteins into specialized adhesive structures called focal adhesions. These focal adhesion complexes not only serve as a physical link between the extracellular and intracellular matrix but also are important sites of signal transduction for integrins and many other types of receptors that mediate cell migration (7Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Boerner S.A. Martin C.C. Parsons J.T. Science. 2002; 296: 1652-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis also requires a cell to assume a polarized morphology that is controlled by cell surface receptors that activate the Rho family of GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac, and Rho (8Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 9Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Upon activation of a chemoattractant receptor, Cdc42 and Rac localize at the leading edge of a cell and control directional movement and the formation of lamellipodia containing highly branched actin filaments, respectively (8Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Rho localizes at the rear and sides of a cell and controls the formation of contractile actin-myosin stress fibers (10Xu J. Wang F. Van Keymeulen A. Herzmark P. Straight A. Kelly K. Takuwa Y.

Together, these GTPases promote cell migration toward a chemoattractant by mediating extension of the actin cytoskeleton at the front edge of the cell and retraction of the cytoskeleton at the rear edge of the cell.

Furthermore, recent work from our group has demonstrated that arterial stress in rabbit carotid arteries induces up-regulation of the P2Y2R in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle and that in vivo activation of the P2Y2R by UTP leads to a 7-fold increase in intimal thickening and a 4-fold increase in leukocyte infiltration into the neointima (12Seye C.I.

Furthermore, we found that the RGD domain in the P2Y2R is required for Go- but not Gq-mediated calcium signaling (1Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrad R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), leading us to speculate that αv integrin interaction with the P2Y2R is important for nucleotide-induced chemotaxis. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of αv integrin interaction with the P2Y2R in nucleotide-induced chemotaxis and to identify upstream signaling events involved in P2Y2R-mediated chemotaxis. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding a hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type (WT) or RGE mutant P2Y2R using the pLXSN retroviral vector, as described previously (17Erb L. Garrad R. Wang Y. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cell surface expression of the hemagglutinin-tagged WT or RGE mutant P2Y2R was determined by flow cytometry, as described previously (18Garrad R.C. Otero M.A. Erb L. Theiss P.M. Clarke L.L. Gonzalez F.A. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29437-29444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Surface expression of endogenous αv integrin in 1321N1 cells expressing the WT or RGE mutant P2Y2R was quantitated by flow cytometry using a 1:100 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-human αv antibody (P2W7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody and a 1:100 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the secondary antibody. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and analyzed on an EPICS 753 flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Human 1321N1 cells expressing WT P2Y2R were transiently transfected with 5 μg of sense or antisense S oligonucleotides for αv integrins, dominant negative (DN) Rac1 cDNA (T17N, Upstate Biotechnology) in pUSEamp(+), or DN Vav2 (L342R/L343S, a double mutant with an inactive dbl domain) in pCMV5 (19Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DN Vav2 was generously provided by Dr. Paola A. Marignani (Dalhousie Medical Research Foundation). The transiently transfected cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, suspended by trypsinization, washed, resuspended in serum-free DMEM, and used in migration assays. Transiently transfected cells used for Vav2 or Rac activation assays were serum-starved for 24 h before UTP treatment. Migration Assay—Cell migration assays were performed with 3-μm pore size Transwells (Costar) as described (15Chaulet H. Desgranges C. Renault M.A. Dupuch F. Ezan G. Peiretti F. Loirand G. Pacaud P. Gadeau A.P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were suspended by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in 100 μl of serum-free DMEM (5 × 104 cells) and placed in the upper chamber of the Transwells. The lower chamber was filled with 500 μl of serum-free DMEM supplemented with varying concentrations of UTP (Amersham Biosciences), as indicated. The cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells migrating to the lower side of the polycarbonate membrane were fixed with cold methanol and stained with Accustain (Sigma). Cells were counted in 10 microscopic fields at 20× magnification. Analysis was performed on three Transwells for each condition, and each experiment was repeated three times. For antibody (Ab) inhibition studies, rabbit anti-human vitronectin (Vitronectin 65), mouse anti-human αv integrin (P2W7), mouse anti-human αvβ5 (PIF 76) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and control anti-IgG1 Abs (Sigma) were added to both chambers at the same time as the nucleotide. Chemokinetic assays were performed with the Cell Motility Hit kit (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell suspensions (500 cells) were added to each well of a collagen-coated 96-well microplate containing a lawn of microscopic blue fluorescent beads. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C with the indicated reagents, the cells were washed and fixed, and phagokinetic tracks were visualized under a phase contrast microscope at 10× magnification. The images were captured on a digital camera using Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was done as described previously (1Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrad R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Vitronectin expression and Akt phosphorylation were detected by immunoblotting with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-human vitronectin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-human phospho-Akt (Ser-473), respectively (Cell Signaling Technology), as the primary Abs and a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the secondary Ab. For signal normalization membranes were probed with 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-human actin Ab (Cytoskeleton Inc.). Rac and Vav2 Phosphorylation—Human 1321N1 cells transfected with the WT or RGE mutant P2Y2R were plated on uncoated 100-mm tissue culture dishes, serum-starved for 24 h, and stimulated with UTP for 5 min. Rac-GTP was precipitated from the cells with Rac/Cdc42 assay reagent (PAK-1 PBD-agarose) comprised of the P-21 binding domain of human PAK-1 bound to glutathione-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE was performed with the precipitated protein. Rac activity was detected by immunoblotting with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-human Rac (clone 23A8, Upstate Biotechnology) as the primary Ab and a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Vav2 phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of Vav2 with 2 μg of mouse anti-human phosphotyrosine Ab (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting of the precipitated protein with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-human Vav2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as the primary Ab and a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the secondary Ab. For normalization of the signal, aliquots of total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-human Rac or rabbit anti-human Vav2 as the primary Abs, which bind to Rac or Vav2, respectively, independent of their phosphorylation state. αv Antisense S Oligonucleotides—Sequences of phosphorothioate-derivatized oligonucleotides including the translation initiation site were as follows: αv sense, 5′-GCCTTTTCGGTAGCGGCTTTC-3′; αv antisense, 5′-CGGAAAAGCCATCGCCGAAAG-3′. The sequences were checked for uniqueness using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). WT P2Y2R-transfected 1321N1 cells were transiently transfected with αv sense and antisense S oligonucleotides as described above. Transfected cells were harvested after 24 h, and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis to evaluate the efficiency of αv suppression by antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Transfected cells used for detection of Vav2 and Rac phosphorylation or vitronectin expression were serum-starved for an additional 24 h and treated with UTP for 5 min or 8 h, respectively. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—Membranes (40 μg of protein) were isolated from 1321N1 cells transfected with the WT or RGE mutant P2Y2R, as described previously (20Tian W.N. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. Deth R.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 524-531PubMed Google Scholar), and incubated in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate) with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing the indicated concentration of UTP. Membranes were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and the binding assay was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The samples were centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 500μl of solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Extracts were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with mouse anti-human Gαo (Sigma) or rabbit anti-human Gαq/11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Ab in the presence of 50μl of a 50% protein G-agarose suspension (Upstate Biotechnology). The immune complexes were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge and washed 3 times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). [35S]GTPγS binding in the immunoprecipitates was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The presence of Gαo and Gαq/11 subunits in the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by immunoblotting with 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-human Gαo (Calbiochem) and rabbit anti-human Gαq/11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary Abs and a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary Ab. An RGD Integrin Binding Domain in the P2Y2R Is Required for UTP-induced Cell Migration—We previously reported that the interaction between the P2Y2R and αv integrins is prevented by mutation of the P2Y2R RGD sequence to RGE (1Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrad R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whether the RGD integrin binding domain in the P2Y2R is important for P2Y2R-mediated chemotaxis, a modified Boyden chamber assay was used. The results showed that UTP induced a concentration-dependent increase in the migration of cells transfected with the WT P2Y2R in contrast to cells transfected with the RGE mutant P2Y2R or vector alone (Fig. 1A). The initial migratory response to UTP in P2Y2R-transfected cells was observed 8 h after UTP treatment, whereas the maximal response was observed after 16 h. Also, we found that P2Y2R-transfected cells did not migrate significantly when UTP was placed in the upper chamber instead of the lower chamber or when equal concentrations of UTP were placed in both chambers (data not shown), indicating that UTP acts as a chemoattractant in cells expressing the WT P2Y2R. To demonstrate that the RGD integrin binding domain of the P2Y2R is essential for chemokinesis, 1321N1 cells transfected with the WT or RGE mutant P2Y2R were plated on a lawn of microscopic fluorescent beads in collagen-coated 96-well plates. UTP caused cells expressing the WT P2Y2R to migrate and phagocytose the beads leaving behind phagokinetic tracks, whereas UTP-induced migration of cells expressing the RGE mutant P2Y2R or the pLXSN vector was significantly restricted (Fig. 1B). The cell transfectants expressed similar surface levels of WT and RGE mutant P2Y2Rs and αv integrin, suggesting that variations in the magnitude of UTP-induced migration were not due to differences in cell-surface protein levels (Fig. 1C). Thus, the RGD integrin binding domain of the P2Y2R is apparently required for UTP-induced chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Role of Vitronectin in P2Y2R-mediated Cell Migration—Vitronectin is a glycoprotein that is found in plasma, platelets, and extracellular matrices. Several lines of evidence suggest that vitronectin plays an important role in vascular smooth muscle cell migration (21Brown S.L. Lundgren C.H. Nordt T. Fujii S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix proteins, such as vitronectin and osteopontin, are RGD-containing ligands for αvβ3/β5 integrins and act as chemoattractants for cells expressing these integrins (15Chaulet H. Desgranges C. Renault M.A. Dupuch F. Ezan G. Peiretti F. Loirand G. Pacaud P. Gadeau A.P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because UTP can induce expression of osteopontin via activation of the P2Y2R (12Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R.C. Krugh B. Wang M. Turner J.T. Sturek M. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2720-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we speculated that variations in the expression levels of extracellular matrix proteins may contribute to the different rates of UTP-induced cell migration for cells expressing the WT and RGE mutant P2Y2R. We found that UTP induced a dose-dependent increase in levels of vitronectin (Fig. 2A) and osteopontin (data not shown) expression in cells expressing the WT but not the RGE mutant P2Y2R. To determine whether vitronectin expression was involved in P2Y2R-mediated chemotaxis, cell migration assays were performed in the presence of UTP and anti-vitronectin Ab. The addition of anti-vitronectin Ab completely inhibited UTP-induced cell migration, whereas treatment with anti-IgG1 Ab did not (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the RGD integrin binding domain of the P2Y2R and P2Y2R-mediated vitronectin expression is required for UTP-induced cell migration. The P2Y2R RGD Domain Is Required for UTP-induced Activation of Vav2 and Rac—The Rac subfamily of small GTPases stimulates the formation of lamellipodia and is necessary for cell migration (23Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 24Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the efficiency of Rac signaling is dependent on RacGEFs, such as Vav2 (25Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), a ubiquitously expressed member of the Vav family of RhoGEFs that is necessary for lamellipodia formation and activation of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA (19Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Taking into consideration the importance of Rac and Vav2 in cell motility, we determined whether Rac and Vav2 are activated by UTP and the relationship of these activities to RGD-dependent P2Y2R interaction with αv integrins. We found that even at very high UTP concentrations (e.g. 1 mm), Vav2 and Rac were only activated in cells expressing the WT P2Y2R but not in cells expressing the RGE mutant P2Y2R (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the P2Y2R requires interaction with αv integrins to activate Rac and Vav2. Furthermore, transient transfection of 1321N1 cells expressing the WT P2Y2R with a dominant negative mutant of Vav2 (DN Vav2) abolished UTP-induced Rac1 activation (Fig. 3B), consistent with the role of Vav2-dependent Rac1 activation in lamellipodia formation and cell spreading in other cell lines (19Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). P2Y2R-mediated Cell Migration Is Dependent on Rac GTPase Activity— To verify that Rac GTPase activity is necessary for P2Y2R-mediated cell migration, 1321N1 cells expressing the WT P2Y2R were transiently transfected with a dominant negative mutant of Rac (Rac DN), and UTP-induced cell migration was assessed. Inhibition of Rac GTPase activity by Rac DN transfection inhibited UTP-induced cell migration by 50–60% (Fig. 3C). Thus, it appears that Rac GTPase can regulate P2Y2R-mediated cell migration. Expression and Functional Activity of αv Integrins Is Essential for UTP-induced Cell Migration, Vav2 and Rac Activation, and Vitronectin Up-regulation—To determine whether αv integrins are involved in P2Y2R-mediated chemotaxis, we used antisense S oligonucleotide to inhibit expression of αv. Transfection of 1321N1 cells expressing the WT P2Y2R with αv antisense oligonucleotide significantly suppressed αv expression (Fig. 4A) and completely inhibited UTP-induced cell migration (Fig. 4B). Similarly, transfection of 1321N1 cells expressing the WT P2Y2R with αv antisense oligonucleotide inhibited UTP-induced Vav2 and Rac activation by ∼50 and ∼60%, respectively, and vitronectin expression by ∼75% (Fig. 4C). The αv sense oligonucleotide did not significantly inhibit UTP-induced cell migration, Vav2 and Rac activation, or vitronectin up-regulation (Figs. 4, B and C). To further evaluate the role of αv integrins in P2Y2R-mediated cell migration, we tested the effect of anti-integrin Abs on UTP-induced migration and upstream signaling events in 1321N1 cells transfected with the WT P2Y2R. The increase in migration of P2Y2R-transfected cells in response to UTP was inhibited by anti-αv and anti-αvβ5 Abs in a dose-dependent manner, whereas negative control Ab (anti-IgG) did not inhibit UTP-induced cell migration (Fig. 5A). UTP-induced chemokinesis of P2Y2R-transfected cells was also inhibited by anti-αvβ5 Ab at a concentration of 50 μg/ml (Fig. 5B), indicating that αv integrins are required for UTP-induced cell migration. Likewise, Rac and Vav2 activation and vitronectin up-regulation in response to UTP were significantly inhibited by treatment with anti-αvβ5 Ab but not with Ab against another integrin subtype (α3) that is also expressed in 1321N1 cells (Fig. 6) (note: fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis indicated that αvβ5 and α3 integrins, but not αvβ3, are expressed in 1321N1 cells (data not shown)).FIGURE 6P2Y2R-mediated Vav2 and Rac activation and vitronectin up-regulation require αv integrin activity. Human 1321N1 cells expressing the WT P2Y2R were incubated overnight with 10 μg/ml anti-α3 or anti-αvβ5 Abs, then stimulated with 100 μm UTP for 5 min (to measure Vav2 phosphorylation (p-Vav2) and Rac GTPase activity) or 8 h (to measure vitronectin up-regulation). The data shown are representative of result"

https://openalex.org/W2006131891,"Although caspase-8 has an established role as an initiator of death receptor-mediated apoptosis, the function of its closest homolog, caspase-10, is almost completely unknown. To gain a closer insight into the physiological function of caspase-10, we compared the cleavage of known caspase-8 substrates by both initiator caspases. We demonstrate that caspase-10 and -8 have overlapping cleavage preferences for several substrates such as the kinases RIP and PAK2. Interestingly, in other substrates, such as the Bcl-2 protein Bid, we found additional and distinct cleavage sites for both caspases, which might have important consequences for mitochondrial targeting and propagation of the death signal. Caspase-8 and -10 also caused different interchain cleavage patterns of their enzyme precursors. Together, these results suggest that caspase-8 and -10, despite having overlapping functions, also have selective substrate cleavage specificities and might thereby exert nonredundant roles in apoptosis signaling."

This complex plays important roles in the early processing of DSBs via its DNA binding and nuclease activities, participates as a double strand break sensor, and recruits ATM to broken DNA molecules (9Carney J.P.

The MRN complex is also known to be involved in the maintenance of telomeres, which have DSB-like structures and defects here can cause telomeric fusion (20Ranganathan V. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N.

Cell. 2000; 6: 947-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the MRN complex forms nuclear foci after ionizing radiation (IR) (13Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). While such foci are also detectable in un-irradiated cells, the average number per cell and the frequency of cells with detectable foci increases in response to irradiation (18Wu G. Lee W.H. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30618-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neill T.B. Crick K.E.

Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The function of these irradiation-induced foci is unknown, but these foci may represent sites of ongoing repair or of unresolved breaks. In NBS cells, which express truncated nibrin, MRE11 and RAD50 still interact, but complexes containing these two proteins are confined to the cytoplasm and thus cannot form nuclear foci (9Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). This suggests that one of the major roles of NBS1 is to carry MRE11 and RAD50 into nucleus. The N-terminal portion of NBS1 contains two adjacent and potentially functional domains, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and a breast cancer C-terminal (BRCT) domain (Fig. 1A) (23Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21944-21951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), which have been observed previously in other proteins involved in DNA damage responses or in cell-cycle checkpoint control. The C-terminal region of NBS1 binds to the MRE11-RAD50 complex and the ATM. Moreover, NBS1 contains three potential NLSs (16Tauchi H. Kobayashi J. Morishima K. van Gent D.C. Shiraishi T. Verkaik N.S. vanHeems D. Ito E. Nakamura A. Sonoda E. Takata M. Takeda S. Matsuura S. Komatsu K. Nature. 2002; 420: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Tauchi H. Matsuura S. Kobayashi J. Sakamoto S. Komatsu K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8967-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Despite extensive study of NBS1, there is little evidence that it has any specific enzymatic activity, but rather serves mainly as a molecular chaperone, guiding MRE11-RAD50 complex and ATM to the sites of damage. Nucleocytoplasmic transport of large complex is mediated by soluble receptors that recognize structural features (NLS and nuclear export signal) in their cargoes. In general, the transport apparatus is versatile, with individual receptors binding a variety of cargoes and vice versa (25Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 26Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Most transport receptors belong to a large family of homologous proteins known as karyopherins or importins. They share limited sequence identity (15-25%) but adopt similar conformation. In human cells, at least twenty-two importin β and six importin α have been identified (25Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 26Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). All importin β family members contain an N-terminal Ran-GTP-binding motif, and selectively bind nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex (27Harel A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of target proteins through adaptor importin α usually requires importin β, which allows passage of the complex through the nuclear pore complex. In the nucleus, the binding of Ran-GTP to importin β induces its dissociation with importin α, thereby allowing the release of the cargo. Importin α subsequently recycles to the cytoplasm via interaction with export proteins. Importin α can also work independently by direct binding to cargoes without the help of importin β (28Kotera I. Sekimoto T. Miyamoto Y. Saiwaki T. Nagoshi E. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 942-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although some nuclear proteins are delivered into the nucleus with the aid of the adaptor function of importin α, most proteins that carry cargoes directly through nuclear pore complex are members of the importin β family (25Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 29Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several importin β can also act as adaptor to form heterodimeric importin β transporters (29Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here we have isolated an importin α, KPNA2, in a two-hybrid screen for the NBS1-interacting protein. We mapped the sites of interaction between the NBS1 and KPNA2 proteins in vitro using yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. We found that abilities of NBS1 in nuclear focus formation, DSB repair, and DSB-dependent checkpoint signaling were compromised in a KPNA2i background or in strains expressing NBS1 mutants that prevent their interaction with KPNA2. Our data fit the model that KPNA2 plays a role as an import receptor of an NBS1-containing cytoplasmic MRN complex. Chemicals and Antibodies—G418 was purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FLAG M2 from Sigma; anti-Myc from Dr. L.-H. Huang (National Taiwan University Hospital); anti-KPNA2, p53, and CHK2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-GAPDH H86504M from Biodesign; anti-pS15-p53 and pT68-CHK2 from Cell Signaling; anti-NBS1 (NB 100-143) from Novus; and anti-NBS1 (MS-NBS1-PX1) from GeneTex. The secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence staining were Rhodamine Red™-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes). DNA Constructs—The pGBDU-NBS1 plasmid was constructed by PCR-mediated generation of a 2.3-kb fragment of the full-length human NBS1 cDNA from the plasmid pBS-NBS1 obtained from Dr. P. Concannon (30Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The primers used to generate this fragment were: 5′-AAGCTTATGCGATGTGGAAACTGCTGCCC-3′ and 5′-TAGATCTTTATCTTCTCCTTTTTAAAT-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the pGEMTeasy (Promega) to form pGEMTeasy-NBS1. The 2.3-kb HindIII/Klenow and BglII-treated NBS1 fragment from pGEMTeasy-NBS1 was cloned into the plasmid encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain (bait), pGBDU-C3. The pCMV-FLAG-NBS1 was constructed by cloning the 2.3-kb HindIII-BamHI-treated NBS1 cDNA from pGEMTeasy-NBS1 into the HindIII-BamHI-digested pFLAG-CMV-2 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. A.-M. Lin, Yang-Ming University). The pKPNA2-Myc plasmid was constructed by PCR-mediated generation of a 1.6-kb fragment of the full-length human KPNA2 cDNA from total cDNA of HeLa cells. The primers used to generate this fragment are: 5′-GCTAGCATGTCCACCAACGAGAATGCTAA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCCTAAAAGTTAAAGGTCCCAGGAG-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the pGEMTeasy to form pGEMTeasy-KPNA2. The EcoRI- and Klenow-treated KPNA2 fragment containing the full-length of KPNA2 from pGEMTeasy-KPNA2 was cloned into the SmaI/SalI- and Klenow-treated pGBDU plasmid. The 1.6-kb BglII/Klenow- and EcoRI-treated KPNA2 fragment from pGBDU-KPNA2 was cloned into the EcoRV/EcoRI-treated pcDNA3.1-Myc-His (Invitrogen) to generate pKPNA2-Myc. pACT2-KPNA2, pACT2-Qip1, and pACT2-NPI-1 containing importin α1 (KPNA2), importin α3 (Qip1), and importin α5 (NPI-1) were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Yoneda (Osaka University) as well as Dr. J. Yodoi (Kyoto University). The pSUPER-KPNA2 expression vector was constructed by inserting oligonucleotides into the BglII/HindIII sites of pSUPER plasmid provided by Dr. R. Agami (31Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides inserted into pSUPER-KPNA2 were as follows: pSUPER-KPNA2 (forward) 5′-GATCCCCGGATGACCAGATGCTGAAGTTCAAGAGACTTCAGCATCTGGTCATCCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-AGCTTTCCAAAAAGGATGACCAGATGCTGAAGTCTCTTGAACTTCAGCATCTGGTCATCCGGG-3′. Two-hybrid Screening—The two-hybrid assay was done essentially as described (32James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using components generously provided by Dr. P. James and colleagues. The prey HeLa library (pGAD/X) was transformed into PJ69-4 strain containing the NBS1 bait plasmid. Positive clones were selected on SC-Ura, -Leu, and -Ade plates and confirmed for interaction on SC-Ura, -Leu, and -His plates. Mutagenic PCR—To conduct the reverse two-hybrid assay, the bait NBS1 plasmid was used for mutagenic PCR. NBS1 was amplified from the plasmid pGBDU-NBS1 using PCR amplification with primers that contained ∼20 nucleotides of the vector extending outwards from the cloning sites. The 5′ primer, pGBDU-5′, a 791-808 sequence, was 5′-TTCGATGATGAAGATACC-3′; the 3′ primer, pGBDU-3′, a 1022-1000 sequence, was 5′-GATCAGAGGTTACATGGCCAAGA-3′. Mutagenic PCR was carried out using mixed dATP and dITP with a ratio of 9:1. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min and then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Reverse Two-hybrid Screen—We used the two-hybrid system to screen for KPNA2 interaction-defective NBS1 proteins. To create the necessary strain, PJ69-4A cells were transformed with the pGAD-KPNA2 plasmid (prey). The PCR products of mutagenic NBS1 were gel-purified and co-transformed with PstI-KpnI linearized pGBDU-NBS1 plasmid (bait). Because the mutagenic PCR product contains sequences homology to the gapped vector, it serves as a substrate for homologous recombination via DNA repair pathways (gapped-repair transformation (33Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar)), creating a library of mutated NBS1 alleles. Transformants of the two-hybrid strain were grown at 30 °C and selected on SC-Ura, -Leu media, which selected for the GAL activating-KPNA2 fusion plasmid (-Leu), and the library of NBS1 mutations with the GAL DNA binding plasmid (-Ura). Transformants that could grow on this selective medium have repaired the gapped pGBDU-NBS1 plasmid with the PCR-mutagenized NBS1 gene. Positive clones were replicated and selected on SC-Ura, -Leu, and -Ade plates to screen for loss of interaction. NLS Prediction and Site-specific Mutagenesis—A program, PSORTII (psort.nibb.ac.jp), predicted that amino acid sequence 461PSTKKRE467 might be a potential NLS. Four point mutations, S397A, G583K, and KR465AA, were introduced into the NBS1 using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Sequences of primers for mutagenesis are available upon request. Cell Culture and Transfections—293T, HeLa, and NBS (provided by Dr. M. Z. Zdzienicka) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. NBS1i cells were generated as we previously described (Chiang et al. (48Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.J. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)). For pSUPER and pSUPER-KPNA2i transfections, cells were seeded at 70% confluence and transfected with each DNA using Effectene (Qiagen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were plated and selected in media containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The expression was confirmed by Western blotting with the anti-NBS1 as well as anti-KPNA2 Abs and by fluorescence microscopy. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors). Nuclear extracts were prepared with an NE nuclear extraction system (Pierce). Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a Hybond membrane (Amersham Bioscience). The filters were probed with NBS1, KPNA2, p53, p53-p, CHK2, and CHK2-p antibodies and a polyclonal anti-GAPDH antibody as a control for protein loading, and then visualized by chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Procedure—Immunoprecipitation procedure was performed by incubating 500 μg of whole cell extract prepared under cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) from each clone with the anti-NBS1, anti-KPNA2, anti-FLAG, or anti-Myc antibody for 3 h, and the immune complexes were incubated overnight with protein-G (blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin) (Pierce). The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with TNTG buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), mixed with 1× Laemmli dye, boiled for 10 min, and loaded to an 8% SDS gel. After transferred, the filter was blocked, probed with the primary and secondary antibodies sequentially, and developed. Data shown here are representative of two or more experiments from independent cell cultures. Immunofluorescence Staining—The detection of nuclear foci following exposure to ionizing radiation was performed as previously described (34Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips and were either mock-treated or irradiated with 15 Gy of ionizing radiation. After 8 h, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate-buffered saline) and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline-buffered 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose at room temperature for 10 min, followed by permeabilization in Triton X buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) at room temperature for 10 min. For dual immunostaining, cells were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 4 °C for overnight with either mouse anti-NBS1 (1:100) or rabbit anti-MRE11 (1:100) Abs. The primary antibodies were detected using Rhodamine Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:500). DNA was stained with Hoechst at room temperature for 1 h. Immunofluorescence was analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. At least 100 cells were counted for each sample. Plasmid End-joining Assay—Plasmid end-joining assay was done as previously described (35Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28641-28647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). pGL3 plasmid (Promega) was completely linearized by restriction endonucleases HindIII or NarI and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The linearized DNA was subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in sterilized water. DNA was then transfected into cells. The transfected cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity by Luciferase assay system (Promega) (36Zhong H. Murphy T.J. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 961-967PubMed Google Scholar). DSB-dependent Checkpoint Assay—DSB-dependent phosphorylation of CHK2 and p53 was determined as previously described (37Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Briefly, NBS fibroblasts were transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-KPNA2i. 48 h later, cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV, pFLAG-NBS1, or pFLAG-NBS1-465AA. Transfected cells were harvested before or 30 min after irradiated with 9 Gy of IR. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. Identification of KPNA2 (importin α1) as an NBS1-interacting Protein Using the Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To identify proteins that regulate NBS1 functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cDNA library. We constructed a plasmid vector (pGBDU-NBS1) that expressed a fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 protein and NBS1. Transformation of pGBDU-NBS1 alone (the “bait”) into the yeast strain PJ69-4 did not activate reporter transcription. Of ∼5 × 106 clones screened, eight positive clones were obtained and sequenced. Among eight positive clones, one clone encodes TRF1 and another clone encodes a functional unknown gene. TRF1 was previously demonstrated to be an NBS1-interacting protein at telomeres (18Wu G. Lee W.H. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30618-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The remaining six independent clones encoded a single protein KPNA2 (importin α1), which differed only in length. The six KPNA2 clones lacked different sections of the N terminus but were capable of encoding the truncated forms of KPNA2 in-frame. The KPNA2 protein contains an N-terminal hydrophilic importin β binding domain, a central hydrophobic cargo binding region composed of eight “armadillo” repeats, and a short hydrophilic C terminus (CAS binding domain). Fig. 1B indicates the schematic structures of KPNA2 and variant clones identified in our screening. These findings indicated that the armadillo repeats are maintained in all of the positive clones, suggesting the importance of this region for the interaction of NBS1. In an independent yeast two-hybrid screen using the KPNA2 as the bait and a different human two-hybrid library as the prey, a positive clone encoding NBS1 was also obtained (Fig. 1C). 4S.-F. Tseng, C.-Y. Chang, K.-J. Wu, and S.-C. Teng, unpublished results. These findings demonstrated that KPNA2 interacts with NBS1 in yeast. We next asked whether the role of KPNA2 in NBS1 interaction was unique when compared with other known importin α family members. In humans, there are at least six importin α molecules, and these can be divided into three subfamilies, α1 (KPNA2), α3-α4 (Qip1), and α5-α6-α7 (NPI-1) (29Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the binding specificity between NBS1 and the importin α family members using the yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, NBS1 interacted with KPNA2 but not with Qip1 or NPI-1, suggesting NBS1 specifically interacts with KPNA2. To search for functional NLSs and to study the effect of the lack of NBS1-KPNA2 protein interaction on DNA repair, we performed a reverse two-hybrid screen to identify point mutations in NBS1 that disrupted the NBS1-KPNA2 interaction. We used PCR to mutagenize the full-length NBS1 (33Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 38Spee J.H. de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mutagenized fragments were then assessed for their ability to interact with KPNA2 in the two-hybrid assay. Out of ∼2 × 104 colonies, three mutants gave reduced growth abilities on plates lacking adenine. DNA sequencing showed that those three clones had four, five, or six amino acid substitutions. One contained four amino acid substitutions N56S, A183T, S397A, and G583K (Fig. 1A). In light of the multiple mutations found in each of the mutated NBS1, we determined whether any particular mutations of NBS1 were responsible for the interaction. Desai-Mehta and coworkers (30Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that a region between amino acid residues 401 and 652 of NBS1 is sufficient to direct its nuclear localization. Because S397A and G583K are closer to the previously mapped sequences of NBS1 involved in directing its nuclear localization (30Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we generated single and double amino acid mutations in S397A and G583K and compared their interaction with KPNA2 by the two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, mutations in the single or double amino acids did not confer loss of interaction, whereas mutations in the all four residues of NBS1 (NBS1-4m) conferred loss of interaction ("

Many cases of RD are associated with mutations in phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PAHX), an Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the initial α-oxidation step in the degradation of phytenic acid in peroxisomes. We describe the x-ray crystallographic structure of PAHX to 2.5 Å resolution complexed with Fe(II) and 2OG and predict the molecular consequences of mutations causing RD. Like other 2OG oxygenases, PAHX possesses a double-stranded β-helix core, which supports three iron binding ligands (His175, Asp177, and His264); the 2-oxoacid group of 2OG binds to the Fe(II) in a bidentate manner. The manner in which PAHX binds to Fe(II) and 2OG together with the presence of a cysteine residue (Cys191) 6.7 Å from the Fe(II) and two further histidine residues (His155 and His281) at its active site distinguishes it from that of the other human 2OG oxygenase for which structures are available, factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor. Of the 15 PAHX residues observed to be mutated in RD patients, 11 cluster in two distinct groups around the Fe(II) (Pro173, His175, Gln176, Asp177, and His220) and 2OG binding sites (Trp193, Glu197, Ile199, Gly204, Asn269, and Arg275).

The manner in which PAHX binds to Fe(II) and 2OG together with the presence of a cysteine residue (Cys191) 6.7 Å from the Fe(II) and two further histidine residues (His155 and His281) at its active site distinguishes it from that of the other human 2OG oxygenase for which structures are available, factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor. Of the 15 PAHX residues observed to be mutated in RD patients, 11 cluster in two distinct groups around the Fe(II) (Pro173, His175, Gln176, Asp177, and His220) and 2OG binding sites (Trp193, Glu197, Ile199, Gly204, Asn269, and Arg275). PAHX may be the first of a new subfamily of coenzyme A-binding 2OG oxygenases. In humans, the plasma level of the diet-derived isoprenoid, phytanic acid, is normally low (<30 μm) (1Steinberg D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2351-2369Google Scholar). Significantly elevated levels of phytanic acid are found in patients with Refsum disease (RD) 3The abbreviations used are: RDRefsum diseaseDSBHdouble-stranded β-helix2OG2-oxoglutarateSADsingle wavelength anomalous dispersionSeMetselenomethionine.3The abbreviations used are: RDRefsum diseaseDSBHdouble-stranded β-helix2OG2-oxoglutarateSADsingle wavelength anomalous dispersionSeMetselenomethionine. (OMIM 266500) and to a lesser extent in patients with other peroxisomal disorders (2Wanders R.J.A. Jakobs C. Skjeldal O.H. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3303-3321Google Scholar). Approximately 45% of reported cases of RD in the United Kingdom have been associated with defects in the function of the peroxisomal enzyme phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PAHX) (3Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Schofield C.J. Feher M.D. Gibberd F.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 725-735Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which is initially produced as a proprotein with an N-terminal type-2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) (4Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Jansen G.A. Wanders R.J. Lloyd M.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The targeting sequence is cleaved in the peroxisome, between Thr30 and Ser31, to produce mature PAHX, used ubiquitously in this study and referred to hereafter as PAHX (the numbering scheme used follows that for the 338-residue pro-PAHX; gi:6093646) (5Jansen G.A.

Some observed cases of RD are associated with a second genetic locus recently identified as the PTS2 receptor protein, PEX7 (7van den Brink D.M. Brites P. Haasjes J. Wierzbicki A.S. Mitchell J.

Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J.A. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Symptoms of RD, for which the only current treatment is diet therapy, usually arise later in life and include retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, deafness, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and ichthyosis (9Gibberd F.B. Wierzbicki A.S. Handbook of Ataxia Disorders. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2000: 235-256Google Scholar). Symptoms of RD can be subtle in the early stages, making diagnosis difficult, and it has been proposed that the disease is more widespread than clinical data suggest. Most symptoms of RD are thought to develop from toxic accumulation of phytanic acid. Some symptoms, including skeletal abnormalities (10Plant G.R. Hansell D.M. Gibberd F.B. Sidey M.C. Br. J. Radiol. 1990; 63: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), occur during embryonic development, since they are present at birth. Phytanic acid levels would not normally be elevated at this stage, suggesting an additional role for PAHX during development. The murine form of PAHX is identical to the murine lupus nephritis-associated protein (LN1) (11Chambraud B. Radanyi C. Camonis J.H. Rajkowski K. Schumacher M. Baulieu E.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2104-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for PAHX in kidney disease that has also been observed in human RD patients (3Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Schofield C.J. Feher M.D. Gibberd F.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 725-735Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Various proteins have been identified as potential PAHX interaction partners, raising the possibility that phytanoyl-CoA may not be the only substrate and that PAHX may have unidentified functions. PAHX has been reported to interact with the blood coagulation factor VIII; it has been proposed that PAHX regulates the expression of this coagulation factor (12Chen C.Q. Fang X.D.W. Xu Q. Chi C.W. Gu J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46340-46346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), potentially in an oxygen-dependent manner. A further PAHX interaction partner, PAHX-associated protein 1 (PAHX-AP1), identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen (13Lee Z.H. Kim H. Ahn K.Y. Seo K.H. Kim J.K. Bae C.S. Kim K.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), interacts with the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (10Plant G.R. Hansell D.M. Gibberd F.B. Sidey M.C. Br. J. Radiol. 1990; 63: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Koh J.T. Lee Z.H. Ahn K.Y. Kim J.K. Bae C.S. Kim H.H. Kee H.J. Kim K.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 87: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism for some of the neurological symptoms of RD. The physiological significance of these PAHX interactions has not been determined, and how they occur given the apparent peroxisomal localization of PAHX is unclear.The presence of a 3-methyl group in phytol prevents its degradation by the normal β-oxidation pathway for saturated fatty acids. Instead, a preliminary α-oxidation pathway occurs, first in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently in peroxisomes, to shorten the chain length of 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA by one carbon, thereby enabling β-oxidation to proceed (Fig. 1). It has recently been shown that phytenic acid is first condensed to its coenzyme A ester prior to reduction to phytanoyl-CoA (15van den Brink D.M. Van Miert J.N. I. Decremont G. Rontani J.-F. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26838-26844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which is subsequently hydroxylated to 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA in the PAHX-catalyzed reaction (Fig. 2) (4Mukherji M.

The stereospecificity of PAHX is interesting, since it accepts both C-3 epimers as substrates but produces only the threo products (2S,3R or 2R,3S) (18Croes K. Casteels M. Dieuaide-Noubhani M.

Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Jansen G.A. Wanders R.J. Lloyd M.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have led to proposals for the Fe(II)-binding residues of PAHX and identified other residues likely to be involved in catalysis (27Searls T. Butler D. Chien W. Mukherji M. Lloyd M.D. Schofield C.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1660-1667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Mukherji M. Chien W. Kershaw N.J. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, 2OG oxygenases bind their Fe(II) via a conserved HX(D/E)...H triad of residues located on a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) or jelly roll motif (30Valegard K. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lloyd M.D. Hara T. Ramaswamy S. Perrakis A. Thompson A. Lee H.-J. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Haidu J. Andersson I. Nature. 1998; 394: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, significant differences exist in the way they bind their substrates and, to a lesser extent, 2OG. The only reported crystal structures for a mammalian 2OG-dependent oxygenase are for factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) (31Elkins J.M. Hewitson K.S. McNeil L.A. Seibel J.F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1802-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which, together with other 2OG-dependent oxygenases involved in the human hypoxic response, is a current target for therapeutic intervention.To address questions regarding the structural basis of clinically observed mutations giving rise to RD (8Jansen G.A. Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J.A. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we have solved the crystal structure of PAHX complexed with Fe(II) and 2OG. Although the Fe(II) binding sites are well conserved between PAHX and FIH, comparison of the structures reveals significant differences in the two active sites and that many of the clinically observed mutations to PAHX are clustered around either the Fe(II) or 2OG binding sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Purification of PAHX was carried out as reported (29Mukherji M. Chien W. Kershaw N.J. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were transformed by pET24a/mat-pahx and grown at 37 °C in 2TY medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Following reduction of the temperature to 25 °C, protein production was induced at an A600 of 0.7 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. In previous studies, we found that PAHX is unusually prone to site-specific Fe(II) and oxygen-mediated fragmentation. For this reason, dithiothreitol was omitted, and 1 mm EDTA was added to all buffers to prevent fragmentation during purification. PAHX was purified by carboxymethyl-Sepharose cation exchange, followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S75) to yield PAHX of >95% purity by SDS-PAGE analysis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed that the mass of the purified PAHX was consistent with loss of the N-terminal methionine from the predicted amino acid sequence (observed, 35,436 Da; calculated without N-terminal methionine, 35,435 Da). Amino acid sequence analysis by Edman degradation confirmed the identity of the protein and loss of the N-terminal methionine (observed, STGISS). The activity of purified PAHX was confirmed for 2OG turn-over using the reported assay monitoring release of 14CO2 (32Lee H.-J. Lloyd M.D. Harlos K. Schofield C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Selenomethionine-substituted Protein Expression—Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted PAHX was produced using a metabolic inhibition protocol and LeMaster medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter l-selenomethionine. Selenomethionine incorporation was >95% by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (observed, 35,858 Da; calculated, 35,859 Da).Crystallization—Crystallization conditions were initially sought using high throughput robotic screening methods at the Oxford Protein Production Facility (33Walter T.S. Diprose J. Brown J. Pickford M. Owens R.J. Stuart D.I. Harlos K. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 308-314Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Optimization of the initial crystallization condition was performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in VDX™ plates (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Hanging drops containing 2 μl of 5.2 mg/ml PAHX and 2 μl of well solution were suspended over 500 μl of well solution containing 21% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.3 m triammonium citrate, pH 7.1, at 18 °C. Crystallization with 1 mm iron(II) sulfate and 2 mm 2OG in an anaerobic environment (Bell Technologies glove box under an argon atmosphere) produced square, plate-shaped crystals over a period of 3 weeks to a maximum size of 200 μm × 100 μm × 50 μm. SeMet PAHX crystals were grown aerobically using the same conditions, except that iron(II) sulfate and 2OG were substituted with zinc(II) chloride and N-oxalylglycine.Crystallographic Data Collection and Structure Solution—A single crystal, anaerobically grown (200 × 100 × 50 μm) was transferred to cryoprotectant (1:7 glycerol/well solution) and immediately cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Native data were collected at 100 K using beamline 10.1 (34Cianci M. Antonyuk S. Bliss N. Bailey M.W. Buffey S.G. Cheung K.C. Clarke J.A. Derbyshire G.E. Ellis M.J. Enderby M.J. Grant A.F.

The native data were processed with MOSFLM and SCALA of the CCP4 suite version 5.0.2 (35Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) with an I222 lattice (TABLE ONE). Calculation of a Matthews coefficient of 2.1 Å3/dalton implied a single monomer in the asymmetric unit. Attempts at molecular replacement and isomorphous replacement were unsuccessful, so crystals were produced from SeMet-substituted protein. A single SeMet crystal (120 μm × 70 μm × 5 μm) was transferred to cryoprotectant (1:9 glycerol/well solution) before cryocooling in liquid nitrogen. Single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data were collected at 100 K and at the selenium peak wavelength at beamline X10A (Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland). Data were integrated with HKL2000 version 1.98.0 (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) and merged, and anomalous differences were analyzed with XPREP (38Bruker A. XPREP: Data Preparation and Reciprocal Space Exploration, Version 6.14/UNIX. Bruker Nonius, Madison, WI2003Google Scholar). The substructure was solved with SHELXD of the SHELX-97 suite (39Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) using anomalous differences to 3.5 Å in space group I222, and the sites and chirality were confirmed with SHELXE. The substructure (top seven selenium sites) was refined with SHARP version 2.0.4 (40delaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) against the SAD data, and two additional selenium sites were identified. Phases were calculated to 3 Å using SHARP, and the combined anaerobic native and SAD data sets result in a figure of merit of 0.33. Phases were improved by density modification using RESOLVE version 2.08 (41Terwilliger T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Before refinement commenced, 5% of the data were flagged for calculation of a free R-factor (Rfree). Initially, simulated annealing was performed in CNS version 1.1 using combined phases calculated from the model and phase probabilities from SHARP.

Iterative rounds of manual refitting and crystallographic refinement using the programs COOT and REFMAC5 continued until Rfree was no longer improved. Statistics are given in TABLE ONE.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe PAHX Structure—PAHX crystallizes as a monomer in space group I222 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The solvent content of the crystals is 40%, and the crystals contain large solvent channels that coincide with access to the active site. Three disordered loops that border the active site face this solvent channel and include residues 165-172, 223-233, and 303-318. Other disordered regions are near the N terminus and comprise residues 31-42 and 51 and 52. The most extensive contact between monomers in the lattice, 841 Å2 per monomer, is a ∼18-Å-long extended pair of antiparallel β-strands (β-3 and β-4) in which β-4 is antiparallel to β-4 of a symmetry-related molecule along a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Another significant lattice contact involves loop 240-244, which packs against Lys321 of the C-terminal helix, and residues 288-291 of one symmetry-related molecule and residue 94 of another.The PAHX fold is a mixed α-β structure composed of a major and a minor β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices and four 310 helices (Fig. 3).

However, in PAHX, only seven β-strands of the DSBH are apparent: β-6, β-8, β-9, β-10, β-11, β-12, and β-13, here defined as β-strands I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII, respectively. In PAHX, the residues that correspond to DSBH β-strand II (β-7) (residues 165-172) in other 2OG oxygenases are disordered and left out of the model. This strand is probably involved in substrate binding (see below). Four additional β-strands (β-1, β-2, β-5, and β-15) hydrogen-bond antiparallel to the core DSBH, resulting in the eight-stranded major β-sheet (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that both β-strands β-5 and β-15 are paired antiparallel to DSBH β-strand I (β-6), a unique feature among the 2OG oxygenase family.FIGURE 3Stereoview from the crystal structure of the PAHX-Fe(II)-2OG complex as a ribbon representation.

Only seven strands (β-6, β-13, β-8, and β-11 of the major sheet and β-9, β-10, and β-12 of the minor sheet) are observed in PAHX, since the residues making up the DSBH β-strand II are disordered.

https://openalex.org/W1987786553,"The K562 cell line serves as a model to study the molecular mechanisms associated with leukemia differentiation. We show here that cotreatment of K562 cells with PMA and low doses of SB202190 (SB), an inhibitor of the p38 MAPK pathway, induced a majority of cells to differentiate towards the megakaryocytic lineage. Electronic microscopy analysis showed that K562 cells treated with PMA+SB exhibited characteristic features of physiological megakaryocytic differentiation including the presence of vacuoles and demarcation membranes. Differentiation was also accompanied by a net increase in megakaryocytic markers and a reduction of erythroid markers, especially when both effectors were present. PMA effect was selectively mediated by new PKC isoforms. Differentiation of K562 cells by the combination of PMA and SB required Erk1/2 activation, a threshold of JNK activation and p38 MAPK inhibition. Interestingly, higher concentrations of SB, which drastically activated JNK, blocked megakaryocytic differentiation, and considerably increased cell death in the presence of PMA. c-DNA microarray membranes and PCR analysis allow us to identify a set of genes modulated during PMA-induced K562 cell differentiation. Several gene families identified in our screening, including ephrins receptors and some angiogenic factors, had never been reported so far to be regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2090171122,"Notch3 has been studied in the context of brain development, but whether it plays a role in the formation of brain tumors is unclear. We demonstrate that the introduction of constitutively active Notch3 into periventricular cells of embryonic day 9.5 mice causes the formation of choroid plexus tumors (CPTs). Tumors arose in the fourth ventricles in 83% of animals and were associated with hydrocephalus. They were microscopically highly similar to choroid plexus papillomas in humans, with an ongoing proliferation rate of 4–6%. Signs of Notch pathway activity were also present in human choroid plexus lesions, and receptor mRNA levels in papillomas were elevated over those in non-neoplastic choroid plexus. Notch2 was overexpressed approximately 500-fold in one case, suggesting that the role of this pathway in CPTs may not be specific to Notch3. Our findings indicate that activated Notch3 can function as an oncogene in the developing brain, and link the Notch pathway to human CPT pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2068113244,"A novel filarial serine protease inhibitor (SPI) from the human parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus, Ov-SPI-1, was identified through the analysis of a molting third-stage larvae expressed sequence tag dataset. Subsequent analysis of the expressed sequence tag datasets of O. volvulus and other filariae identified four other members of this family. These proteins are related to the low molecular weight SPIs originally isolated from Ascaris suum where they are believed to protect the parasite from host intestinal proteases. The two Ov-spi transcripts are up-regulated in the molting larvae and adult stages of the development of the parasite. Recombinant Ov-SPI-1 is an active inhibitor of serine proteases, specifically elastase, chymotrypsin, and cathepsin G. Immunolocalization of the Ov-SPI proteins demonstrates that the endogenous proteins are localized to the basal layer of the cuticle of third-stage, molting third-stage, and fourth-stage larvae, the body channels and multivesicular bodies of third-stage larvae and the processed material found between the two cuticles during molting. In O. volvulus adult worms the Ov-SPI proteins are localized to the sperm and to eggshells surrounding the developing embryos. RNA interference targeting the Ov-spi genes resulted in the specific knockdown of the transcript levels of both Ov-spi-1 and Ov-spi-2, a loss of native proteins, and a significant reduction in both molting and viability of third-stage larvae. We suggest the Ov-SPI proteins play a vital role in nematode molting by controlling the activity of an endogenous serine protease(s).

The cuticle is an extracellular hydroskeleton that overlays the hypo-dermis of all nematodes. Most nematodes molt their cuticles four times during pre-adult development. Although being fairly inert and structurally robust, the cuticle is also permeable to small compounds and expands during growth periods between molts (1Page A.P. Kennedy M.H. Harnett W.

Their endogenous roles have been less studied. It has been postulated that proteases involved in the molting process would be controlled by maturation (through removal of inhibitory pro-regions) or via endogenous protease inhibitors. In O. volvulus a cystatin-like cysteine protease inhibitor, onchocystatin or Ov-CPI-2, has been identified, which localized to the cuticle of molting nematodes and developing embryos (30Lustigman S.

It has been suggested that it might play a role in modulating the activity of cysteine proteases required for the L3 to fourth-stage larvae (L4) molt or eggshell morphogenesis in embryos. We now present data indicating that the SPI identified in the molting EST dataset belongs to a family of proteins that play vital roles in the O. volvulus L3 to L4 molt and are suggested to be involved in other processes such as embryogenesis and spermatogenesis.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (9754) Google Scholar) within Quanta 2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) running on a Silicon Graphics Octane with a dual R12000 processor (sgi, Mountain View, CA). The “Refine 3′” option in Modeler, which uses a conjugated gradient together with molecular dynamics by a simulated annealing technique, was used to optimize the models. Five models for each run were developed, and the model with the lowest Objective Function was selected. The resulting models were evaluated for their stereochemical properties by Procheck software (42Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) at 2.0 Å and by Quanta Protein Health programs within Quanta2000. After initial modeling, each modeled inhibitor was superimposed on the x-ray crystal structure of the AsC/E-1 inhibitor, the latter was then removed, and the structure of the modeled inhibitor and elastase were merged. These steps were performed to investigate the interactions of the critical residues in the inhibitors with the elastase. The Quanta Protein Health Check revealed few close contacts of the modeled inhibitors with elastase, and high energy. Polar hydrogens were added to the model and optimized by 200 steps of the Steepest Descent method to remove the close contacts. The protein backbone was kept fixed during optimization. The structures of modeled inhibitors bound to elastase showed no further close contacts and low Charmm energies. These optimized structures were used for further analysis. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Ov-SPI-1 (rOv-SPI-1)—The mature serine protease inhibitor domain of Ov-SPI-1 (aa 15-118) was cloned in-frame into both the pProEX HTb (BamH1/HindIII sites) and the pRSET A (BamH1/EcoR1sites) expression vectors (Invitrogen) and expressed as a fusion with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Overexpression of the rOv-SPI-1 fusion protein was as previously described with modifications (12Lizotte-Waniewski M. Tawe W. Guiliano D.B. Lu W. Liu J. Williams S.A. Lustigman S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression was induced from an overnight culture of BL21 (DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli cells (Sigma) with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm for 3 h at 37°C. Recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel column (Probond resin, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline. Enzyme Inhibitory Activity of rOv-SPI-1—The inhibitory activity of rOv-SPI-1 was tested against a panel of serine proteases. The enzymes (Sigma) and their 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) fluorogenic substrates used were bovine pancreatic trypsin and benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC (Bachem, Torrance, CA, Z-GPR-AMC); bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC (Calbiochem); porcine pancreatic elastase and Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-AMC (Bachem); human leukocyte cathepsin G and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC (Calbiochem). Chemical protease inhibitors (Sigma) were used as positive controls of enzyme inhibition (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm), l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (100 μm), 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (100 μm), EDTA (10 mm), and α1-antitrypsin (5 μg/ml)). Phosphate-buffered saline diluted in enzyme assay buffer was used as a negative control. The reaction buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl, at pH 8.0 for elastase, pH 8.0, and containing 100 mm CaCl2 for chymotrypsin, and pH 7.5, and containing 1.6 mm NaCl for trypsin and cathepsin G. The assay conditions used were as follows: 0.5 μg of each serine protease in 50 μl was incubated with 100 μl of rOv-SPI-1 (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μg/ml; 0.1-1 μg of final amount/well) for 30 min at room temperature in 96-well black clear-bottom plates (Fisher Scientific) in appropriate buffer. After the preincubation of the enzyme and inhibitor, 50 μl of an appropriate AMC substrate solution (10 μm final concentration) was added, and the residual enzyme activity was measured by reading the fluorescence (excitation 360/40, emission 460/40) over time using the Bio-Tek FL500 fluorometer or the BMG Fluorostar plus Optima. Expression Profile of Ov-spi-1 and Ov-spi-2 throughout the O. volvulus Life Cycle—Primers specific for Ov-spi-1 (OvSPI1F; 5′-ACGTACGTGGATGCGGATC-3′ and OvSPI1R2; 5′-TGTTCCGATAAGTTACCG-3′) and Ov-spi-2 (OvSPI1F; and OvSPI2R; 5′-GGAAACAAAATCTCAGCATC-3′) were used to amplify fragments from O. volvulus cDNA libraries. The specificity of the primers for Ov-spi-1 and Ov-spi-2 was confirmed by PCR using plasmid DNA encoding the full-length cDNA sequences of Ov-spi-1 or Ov-spi-2. Each set of primers did not amplify the non-target spi transcript (data not shown). These include second-stage larvae (L2, SAW98MLW-OvL2), infective third-stage larvae (L3, SAW94WL-OvL3), molting third-stage larvae (mL3, SL96-MLW-OvmL3), adult male (AM, SAW98MLW-OvAM), adult female (AF, SAW98MLW-OvAF), and microfilariae (Mf, SAW98MLW-OvMf). The cDNA libraries were constructed by the Filarial Genome Project. PCR with primers specific to O. volvulus β-tubulin cDNA (TubF1; 5′-AATATGTGCCACGAGCAGTC-3′ and TubR1; 5′-CGGATACTCCTCACGAATTT-3′) was used as a constitutively expressed transcript qualitative control. The PCR conditions used were 95 °C for 3 min 1× cycle; 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min 40× cycles; 72 °C for 10 min. Polyclonal Sera Production and Immunolocalization of the Ov-SPI Proteins—Polyclonal sera raised against rOv-SPI-1 was produced in mice using the immunization protocol previously described (43Abraham D. Leon O. Leon S. Lustigman S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6- to 8-week-old male BALB/cByJ mice were injected subcutaneously with 25 μg of rOv-SPI-1 in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 ml of (Sigma). Mice were boosted 14 days later with 25 μg of rOv-SPI-1 in Freund's complete adjuvant. Antibody specificity was screened by Western blot analysis against the rOv-SPI-1 and other recombinant proteins. It was specific to rOv-SPI-1 only (data not shown). Stage-specific O. volvulus worms (L3, mL3, adult female, and adult male) were isolated as described previously (30Lustigman S. Brotman B. Huima T.

Worms were fixed for 30 min in 0.25% glutaraldehyde, 1% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and then processed for immunoelectron microscopy as previously described (30Lustigman S. Brotman B.

For the immunolocalization of the native parasite proteins corresponding to Ov-SPI, thin sections (70 nm) of embedded worms were incubated with antibodies raised against rOv-SPI-1 (mouse anti-Ov-SPI-1), followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and then incubation in a suspension of 15-nm gold particles coated with protein A (Amersham Biosciences). Pre-immune serum was used as the control. Double-stranded RNA Preparation and RNA Interference—RNAi treatment of O. volvulus L3 was carried out using dsRNA as described by Lustigman et al. (46Lustigman S. Zhang J. Lui J. Oksov Y. Hashmi S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mature Ov-SPI-1 in pProEX HTb expression vector was used to amplify the cDNA corresponding to the region encoding mature Ov-SPI-1 (position 67-362), which also corresponds to bp 67-349 of the cDNA encoding Ov-SPI-2, using primers specific for Ov-spi-1 (OvSPI1F; as above and OvSPI1R; 5′-CGAAATTTCATAGAGTCTTCCG-3′), and the PCR fragment was then subcloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to use as the template for RNA synthesis. The cDNA was amplified with M13 forward and M13 reverse primers (Invitrogen) and then used with either T3 and T7 RNA polymerase for the single-stranded sense or antisense RNA synthesis using the MEGAscript high yield transcription kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Large quantities of dsRNA were prepared as previously described (47Hashmi S. Zhang J. Oksov Y. Lustigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6035-6045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Soaking with dsRNA was performed on O. volvulus L3 as described (46Lustigman S. Zhang J. Lui J. Oksov Y. Hashmi S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, cryopreserved L3 were thawed and washed 5× with culture medium (1:1 NCTC 135 and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's media, plus 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine) before their transfer to 96-well plates (5-15 larvae per well in 50 μl). Sterile dsRNA in culture medium was added in 50 μlata final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the larvae were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After 20 h, 50 μl of culture medium was removed and 1.5 × 105 normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 100 μl of complete medium (culture medium plus heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, final 10%) were added to the culture as previously described (10Lustigman S.

Uptake of dsRNA into the parasite was examined using fluorescent-labeled Cy™ 3-dsRNA as previously described (46Lustigman S. Zhang J. Lui J. Oksov Y. Hashmi S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The molting phenotype and morphology was observed under dissecting microscope every 24 h until the seventh day when the experiment was terminated. On day 7 larval viability was assessed visually after the uptake of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma) and its reduction into the blue formazan derivative (48Comley J.C. Townson S. Rees M.J. Dobinson A. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1989; 40: 311-316PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (49Lustigman S. Brotman B. Huima T. Castelhano A.L. Singh R.N. Mehta K.

This response involves sustained up-regulation of Chop mRNA indicative of a terminal UPR. Whereas sustained Chop expression correlates with the ultimate fate of the BCR-triggered B cell and not its developmental stage, Chop–/– B cells undergo apoptosis, indicating that CHOP is not required for this process.

A multifaceted response controlled by the ER transmembrane molecules ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6), IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), and protein kinase-like ER kinase accomplishes this goal primarily through transcriptional activation of a large number of UPR target genes encoding proteins involved in nearly all aspects of protein folding, modification, trafficking, and degradation. unfolded protein response endoplasmic reticulum B cell antigen receptor lipopolysaccharide interleukin reverse transcription electron microscopy. The UPR has primarily been examined in situations of pharmacologically induced or pathophysiologic stress. However, in mammals, this pathway is also activated during the normal physiologic development and differentiation of professional secretory cells, such as β islet cells of the pancreas and plasma cells (5Gass J.N.

Plasma cells are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes (B cells) whose function is to secrete Ig, a critical element of the humoral immune response. During plasma cell differentiation, the enormous increase in Ig production was initially believed to flood the ER with protein and induce a UPR via this classical mechanism (7Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 310-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that unlike the situation in pharmacologically induced UPRs, initial activation of UPR pathways during B cell differentiation is selective and may occur through a mechanism independent of ER stress, since it precedes increased Ig production (5Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L. Rajewsky K.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Consequently, a model has been proposed in which ER expansion during the differentiation of professional secretory cells is a two-phase process. According to this model, the initial phase of the UPR during differentiation is protein load-independent and preparative, whereas the second phase is driven by the classical mechanism of protein accumulation within the ER. Although the relationship between the UPR and LPS-induced plasma cell differentiation has been the subject of intensive study, the association of the UPR with antigen-specific adaptive immune responses has not been explored. Antigen-specific immune responses require multiple activation and differentiation signals, beginning with the specific interaction of a naive B cell with its cognate antigen through the clonotypic B cell receptor for antigen (BCR) (14O'Connor B.P. Gleeson M.W. Noelle R.J. Erickson L.D. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Calame K.L. Nat.

Since the LPS-driven plasma cell differentiation process is associated with activation of adaptive UPR pathways prior to significant Ig accumulation and thus has been speculated to protect cells via anticipatory UPR induction, we became interested in whether a similar process occurs in BCR-dependent activation. Moreover, although the BCR signal is a critical first step for the generation of antigen-specific plasma cells, BCR signals alone do not lead to plasma cell differentiation, except in isolated, highly specialized cell populations (17Calame K.L. Lin K.I. Tunyaplin C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 205-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies allow for evaluation of the association of the UPR with cellular responses independent of secretory cell differentiation. Subsequent to BCR stimulation, activated B cells may receive cytokine differentiation signals, which have been associated with UPR induction (5Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L. Rajewsky K. Glimcher L.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that anticipation of upcoming ER stress might begin from the earliest BCR-mediated stimulatory signal, despite the dissociation between BCR signals and plasma cell differentiation. Here we identify BCR signaling as a novel physiologic UPR trigger. We demonstrate that primary mature B cells stimulated through the BCR initiate an adaptive UPR similar to the UPR induced by LPS during the initial 24 h of the differentiation process, as ascertained by examination of the transcriptional responses associated with activation of the UPR. This response is characterized by up-regulation of prototypical UPR targets encoding ER chaperones, transient Chop (C(EBP) homologous protein) up-regulation, and minimal XBP-1 (X-box-binding protein 1) activation. Although the outcome of UPR induction is often adaptation to ER protein load, in cases of overwhelming ER stress, UPR induction leads to apoptosis. This process, the terminal UPR, is not fully understood but is associated with activation of dedicated apoptotic molecules, including CHOP (18Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M.

Engagement of the BCR on transitional immature B cells, precursors of mature B cells, leads to a rapid apoptotic fate (26Hartley S.B. Crosbie J. Brink R. Kantor A.B. Basten A. Goodnow C.C.

Our studies demonstrate activation of UPR signaling pathways in BCR-stimulated primary transitional immature B cells. In these cells, prolonged Chop up-regulation and relatively poor activation of chaperone genes characterize the BCR-induced UPR. This pattern is consistent with activation of a terminal, or proapoptotic, UPR. Co-stimulation of transitional immature B cells with physiologic survival signals rescued these cells from BCR-induced apoptosis and transformed the observed UPR, reducing Chop expression and increasing expression of chaperone-encoding genes. B Lymphocyte Isolation—Wild-type BALB/c mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) or NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Splenic B cells were isolated from 8–12-week-old female mice as previously described (31Yellen A.J. Glenn W. Sukhatme V.P. Cao X.M. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1446-1454PubMed Google Scholar). These populations are typically 95–98% B220pos, IgMpos B cells consisting of 85–90% mature CD23posAA4.1neg B cells. The remaining small subset represent maturing IgMpos transitional immature B cells (typically 10–15%). Transitional immature cells were isolated from the spleens of autoreconstituting mice that received 500 rads of whole body irradiation 14 days prior to animal sacrifice, as previously described (30Sandel P.C. Monroe J.G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 289-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Cancro M.P. J.

Transitional immature B cells isolated in this manner were IgMhigh, IgDint, and AA4.1pos. For some experiments directly comparing the responses of transitional immature B cells with mature B cells, mature B cells were isolated from irradiated mice allowed to autoreconstitute for 27–36 days. For electron microscopy of transitional versus mature cells, T1 (B220high, CD23neg, AA4.1pos) and mature (B220high, CD23pos, AA4.1neg) cells were sorted by flow cytometry and were determined to be greater than 98% pure. B Lymphocyte Functional Assays—Purified B cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), nonessential amino acids, OPI (oxaloacetic acid/pyruvate/insulin) and l-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All reagents were obtained from Invitrogen except as indicated. Cells were stimulated with 25 μg/ml goat F(ab′)2 fragments (μHC- and LC-directed) purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) to cross-link the BCR or with Salmonella typhosa LPS at 10 μg/ml (Sigma). T cell help signals were provided, using 10% X-4 supernatant containing IL-4, as previously described (34Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J.

Differentiation and activation markers were examined by flow cytometry of cell surface markers using Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) antibodies. Antibody secretion was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) as detailed by the manufacturer. Total Ig was examined using rabbit anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Plates were read and photographed using Image-Pro Plus (Hitech Instruments, Edgemont, PA), and counts were confirmed manually. Apoptosis was assessed by propidium iodide staining for DNA content as directed by the manufacturer (Calbiochem). Subdiploid percentages were determined by flow cytometry in triplicate. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed at the University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Imaging Core Facility. Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate overnight at 4 °C. The next day, pellets were rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer and then postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Epon. 70-nm thin sections were examined with a JEOL JEM 1010 electron microscope after uranyl acetate and bismuth subnitrite staining. Using a Hamamatsu CCD camera and AMT 12-HR software, the images were captured at various magnifications. All supplies were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was reverse transcribed from 1.0 μg of total RNA with random hexamer primers using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as recommended by the supplier. Quantitative PCR was carried out on equal volumes of cDNA RT product using both SYBR green and TaqMan chemistries, as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), on the ABI 7000 system. -Fold change was calculated using the ΔΔCT method with 18 S ribosomal RNA and β-actin as endogenous controls for normalization purposes. For SYBR green analysis, oligonucleotide sequences used were as follows: β-actin, 5′-TCGTGCGTGACATCAAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-CCAAGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAAA-3′; BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein), 5′-ACATGGACCTGTTCCGCTCTA-3′ and 5′-TGGCTCCTTGCCATTGAAGA-3′; CHOP, 5′-CCACCACACCTGAAAGCAGAA-3′ and 5′-GGTGCCCCCAATTTCATCT-3′; XBP-1, 5′-TGCGGAGGAAACTGAAAAACAG-3′ and 3′-GCCGTGAGTTTTCTCCCGTAA-3′; calreticulin, 5′-AGCAGTTCTTGGACGGAGATG-3′ and 5′-TTCTCCAGGTCCCCGTAAAAT-3′; Edem-1, 5′-ATCCGAGTTCCAGAAGGCAGT-3′ and 5′-GCTTCCCAGAACCCTTATCGT-3′. All primers were designed to span exon-exon boundaries and were confirmed to produce a single product by melting curve. Primer efficiencies were validated against endogenous control according to the manufacturer's guidelines. These mRNAs as well as Grp94 (glucose-regulated protein 94) and Xbp-1(s) were also examined using TaqMan chemistry. Primer and probe sets used are available from Applied Biosystems as Assays on Demand, except in the case of Xbp-1. Oligonucleotide sequences used for Xbp-1(total) amplification were 5′-AGCGCAGACTGCTCGAGATAG-3′ and 5′-TCTTCTTCCAAATCCACCACTTG-3′ with the probe 5′-F-AM-AAGAAAGCCCGGATGAGCGAGCTG-TAMRA-3′. Spliced Xbp-1 was amplified using the primers 5′-GGCCGGGTCTGCTGAGT-3′ and 5′-CTGAAGAGGCAACAGTGTCAGAGT-3′ with the probe 5′-FAM-CGCAGCAGGTGCAGGCCCA-TAMRA-3′. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as described above. Spliced and unspliced Xbp-1 were amplified as previously described (11Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H.

Western Blotting—B cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and run on 11% SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchronic acid assay (Sigma), and equal amounts of protein were loaded (50 μg). Anti-mouse XBP-1 (M-186) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Pierce. Protein detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Chop-deficient Mice—Chop–/– mice bearing the CHOP.KO2 allele have been previously described (35Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). For these studies, the CHOP.KO3 allele was used. The identical region of the Chop gene is deleted in the two alleles, namely the entire coding region (except the C-terminal last 34 amino acids) located between the genomic PmlI and NheI sites. It is replaced by a LacZ reporter gene in the CHOP.KO3 allele. The PGK.Neo cassette used to select the targeted allele was removed by loxP recombination. The mutant allele directs no expression of CHOP protein. All experiments were conducted with sex-matched littermate controls in a sixth generation backcross of the mutant allele into a C57BL/6 genetic background. BCR Stimulation Leads to Morphologic Changes in the Absence of Plasma Cell Differentiation—Unlike LPS stimulation, which drives polyclonal proliferation and differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells, engagement of the BCR by antigen initiates an adaptive immune response, directed against the specific antigen (14O'Connor B.P. Gleeson M.W. Noelle R.J. Erickson L.D. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Shapiro-Shelef M. Calame K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although BCR signals alone do not lead to plasma cell differentiation (36Parker D.C. Wadsworth D.C. Schneider G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Sell S. Rowe D.S. Gell P.G. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 122: 823-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Sidman C.L. Unanue E.R.

Nature. 1975; 258: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the BCR-antigen interaction is a critical initiator of the humoral immune response. It is only after BCR engagement that B cells interact with, activate, and receive differentiation signals from T cells. We were interested in whether BCR signals could play a role in preparing cells for eventual plasma cell differentiation, possibly by initiating preparative ER remodeling via UPR activation. To investigate this hypothesis, we directly examined changes in the amount and organization of ER-Golgi networks induced by BCR signals in primary splenic B cells using electron microscopy (EM). We found that although stimulation through the BCR with anti-BCR does not lead to plasma cell differentiation, changes in cell morphology do accompany the BCR activation signal. For these experiments, primary splenic B cells were treated with either anti-BCR to cross-link the BCR, thereby acting as a surrogate antigen, or with LPS. Stimulated populations were then examined for evidence of plasma cell differentiation. Plasma cells can be identified both by expression of specific cell surface markers, including Syndecan-1, and by particular morphologic characteristics (10Wiest D.L. Burkhardt J.K. Hester S.

Chem. 2003; 384: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Differentiation of resting naive B cells into plasma cells in response to anti-BCR and LPS was examined using flow cytometric analysis and EM. LPS stimulation led to the emergence of B220posSyndecan-1pos plasma cells after 72 h of culture; however, B cells cultured with anti-BCR for 96 h remained Syndecan-1neg (data not shown). Similarly, a direct examination of the morphology of BCR- and LPS-stimulated splenic B cells revealed that, as expected, the morphologic changes indicative of plasma cell differentiation, a highly polarized appearance, and well ordered ER-Golgi network, were observed in LPS-stimulated B cells but were not apparent in BCR-stimulated B cells (Fig. 1A). However, subtle morphologic changes do occur in response to BCR signals. Resting B cells have a small, poorly developed cytoplasm (Fig. 1B, left). BCR-stimulated B cells increased in both overall size and cytoplasm/nucleus ratio by 72 h poststimulation (Fig. 1B, middle). In addition, the amount of cytoplasmic membranes visibly increased, suggesting an increase in the size of the ER-Golgi network (Fig. 1B, middle, arrowheads). As compared with LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B, right), the increase in cytoplasmic membranes was modest, and membranes appeared poorly organized. For these experiments, a representative cell is shown, and 82–99% of live cells demonstrated the depicted morphology. Plasma cells participate in the immune response by secreting large amounts of Ig. To verify that BCR signals did not lead to secretion of antibody in the absence of typical features of plasma cell differentiation, antibody secretion was tested directly. Enzyme-linked immunospot assays for total Ig, IgM, and IgG1 failed to detect Ig-secreting cells in BCR-stimulated primary splenic B cell cultures, whereas numerous secretory cell spots, indicating the presence of Ig-secreting cells, were observed in wells containing cells cultured in the presence of LPS for 72 h (Fig. 1C) (data not shown). The absence of BCR-induced plasma cell differentiation events was important to assess and document in our system for the studies that follow. Prototypical UPR Chaperone-encoding Genes are Up-regulated in Response to BCR Signals in Populations Consisting of Predominantly Mature B Cells—Physiologic expansion of the cytoplasm and ER is a characteristic outcome of the adaptive UPR. Recently, several groups have reported evidence that a unique, anticipatory UPR occurs during early phases of LPS-triggered plasma cell differentiation, preceding the increased expression of Ig (5Gass J.N.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To investigate whether a similar response could be initiated by the BCR-induced activation signal, we treated primary splenic B cells with anti-BCR and examined whether UPR pathways were activated. The most highly conserved indicator of UPR activation is the transcriptional up-regulation of genes encoding ER chaperones. This outcome is observed in pharmacologically induced UPRs as well in all reported examples of physiologic UPRs during B cell differentiation. As indicators of activation of the UPR, we measured the transcriptional up-regulation of the prototypical UPR target genes BiP, Grp94, and calreticulin in response to BCR signals in primary B cells. Splenic B cells were cultured with either anti-BCR or LPS for up to 72 h, and mRNA levels of each gene were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. BiP/Grp78 is a prototypical UPR target gene encoding a critical ER chaperone (42Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Like the known UPR inducer LPS, BCR stimulation with anti-BCR led to transcriptional up-regulation of BiP mRNA in primary B cells (Fig. 2, left). BCR-triggered BiP up-regulation occurred early in the response, with 2–3-fold increases in BiP transcripts at 24 h poststimulation. BiP up-regulation by LPS was somewhat less than that induced by BCR signals at 24 h, but B cells cultured with LPS increased expression of BiP mRNA to a maximum of ∼3-fold by 72 h poststimulation. In contrast, BCR-induced transcriptional up-regulation of BiP was transient, returning rapidly to unstimulated levels by 48 h post-stimulation. Up-regulation of Grp94 and calreticulin transcription, other well characterized UPR target genes encoding ER luminal chaperones, was also evident in BCR-stimulated cells (Fig. 2, middle and right). Similar to BiP mRNA, Grp94 and calreticulin mRNA levels increased to ∼3-fold higher at 24 h than initially observed at 0 h. LPS stimulation also up-regulated these targets, with maximal levels achieved late in the response. Again, the response in BCR-stimulated cells was relatively short lived, and levels of Grp94 and calreticulin mRNA were reduced by 72 h, whereas LPS-stimulated cells continued to increase expression of these chaperone genes over time. To exclude the possibility that this response reflected simply a general activation process associated with induction of cell cycle, we examined cell line models for BCR-triggered UPR target gene activation. As in primary B cells, BCR stimulation with anti-Ig induced rapid up-regulation of BiP, Grp94, and calreticulin in Bal-17 cells (data not shown). These data indicate that the induction of UPR target genes in BCR-stimulated cells is not due solely to the activation of quiescent cells. BCR Signals Up-regulate Xbp-1 Transcription and Lead to Detectable mRNA Splicing and Protein Expression but Do Not Induce Significant XBP-1 Activity—The transcription factor XBP-1 is an important amplification loop for the UPR and is critical for plasma cell differentiation (9Calfon M.

To reveal the molecular basis of poly(C) sequence recognition, we have determined the crystal structure, at 1.7-Å resolution, of PCBP2 KH1 in complex with a 7-nucleotide DNA sequence (5′-AACCCTA-3′) corresponding to one repeat of the human C-rich strand telomeric DNA. The protein-DNA interaction is mediated by the combination of several stabilizing forces including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals contacts, and shape complementarities. Specific recognition of the three cytosine residues is realized by a dense network of hydrogen bonds involving the side chains of two conserved lysines and one glutamic acid. The co-crystal structure also reveals a protein-protein dimerization interface of PCBP2 KH1 located on the opposite side of the protein from the DNA binding groove. Numerous stabilizing protein-protein interactions, including hydrophobic contacts, stacking of aromatic side chains, and a large number of hydrogen bonds, indicate that the protein-protein interaction interface is most likely genuine. Interaction of PCBP2 KH1 with the C-rich strand of human telomeric DNA suggests that PCBPs may participate in mechanisms involved in the regulation of telomere/telomerase functions.

So far, a large number of KH domain-containing proteins have been identified in a wide variety of species ranging from bacteria to human. These KH domain proteins assume a wide spectrum of biological functions, including transcriptional and translational controls, mRNA stabilization, and mRNA splicing, among others. Different KH domains possess quite different nucleic acid binding specificities. Unveiling how different KH domains interact specifically with their nucleic acid targets and how these interactions contribute to the complex regulatory processes is of central importance to a better understanding of how KH domain proteins function. One of the most distinctive nucleic acid binding specificities achieved by the KH domains is manifested by a subfamily of KH domain-containing proteins known as poly(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs). As implied by the family name, PCBPs recognize poly(C) RNA or DNA sequences with high affinity and specificity (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. RNA. 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar and 2.Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To date, five evolutionarily related PCBPs have been identified in mammalian cells: PCBP1-4 (also known as αCP1-4; PCBP1 and -2 are also known as hnRNP E1 and E2) and hnRNP K. Each PCBP contains three KH domains: two consecutive KH domains at the N terminus and a third KH domain at the C terminus with an intervening sequence of variable length between the second and third KH domains (Fig. 1A). In general, corresponding KH domains share a higher degree of homology than KH domains within each protein (Fig. 1B). No other discernable nucleic acid binding motif is present in PCBPs; the KH domains are responsible for the ability of the PCBPs to interact with poly(C) sequences. The established examples of functional roles carried out by PCBPs indicate that these proteins are key mediators in a number of important cellular processes (1.Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. RNA. 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Binding of PCBP1 or PCBP2 to target RNA sequences harboring tandem poly(C) stretches within the 3′-UTRs of a number of cellular mRNAs confers unusual stability to these mRNAs, including α-globin (3.Weiss I.

Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mRNAs. In the case of α-globin mRNA, it was established that the stoichiometry of the RNA-protein complex is 1:1; and a minimum RNA sequence of 20 nt (5′-CCCAACGGGCCCUCCUCCCC-3′) was able to form the complex (9.Waggoner S.A.

Interaction of two PCBPs, hnRNP K and PCBP1 or -2, with a C-rich sequence within the 3′-UTR of some mRNAs can also result in translational silencing, as seen in 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) mRNA (10.Ostareck-Lederer A.

A recent study identified 160 mRNA species that associate in vivo with PCBP2 from a human hematopoietic cell line (13.Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7055-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that the contribution of PCBPs in post-transcriptional regulation of cellular genes may be far more profound than currently known. Besides cellular RNAs, PCBPs also participate in regulating critical viral RNA functions. Binding of PCBP1 or -2 to two cis-acting C-rich sequence containing RNA elements within the 5′-UTR of Poliovirus mRNA (which is also the genomic RNA) is critical for regulation of cap-independent translation and replication of the viral RNA (14.Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA. 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2293-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16.Parsley T.B. Towner J.S. Blyn L.B.

Biological functions of PCBPs are further diversified by their ability to interact specifically with not only RNA but also DNA sequences. Specific binding of hnRNP K to the single-stranded C-rich sequence in the promoter of the human c-myc gene activates transcription (19.Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It was also shown that hnRNP K and PCBP1 could recognize the C-rich strand of human telomeric DNA with high affinity in vitro (20.Lacroix L. Lienard H. Labourier E. Djavaheri-Mergny M. Lacoste J. Leffers H. Tazi J. Helene C. Mergny J.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1564-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21.Bandiera A. Tell G. Marsich E. Scaloni A. Pocsfalvi G. Akindahunsi A.A. Cesaratto L. Manzini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); whether such an interaction is functionally significant is a subject for further biochemical/biological investigations. It should be noted that although PCBP functions are diverse, they are nearly all dependent on the ability of the KH domains to recognize single-stranded C-rich RNA or DNA sequences with high specificity and affinity. To reveal the molecular basis of KH domain-poly(C) DNA/RNA interaction, we have previously used NMR to determine the solution structure of the first KH domain (KH1) from human PCBP2, and characterize its interaction with various DNA/RNA molecules (22.Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the 1.7-Å resolution crystal structure of the PCBP2 KH1 domain in complex with a seven-nucleotide single-stranded DNA sequence (5′-AACCCTA-3′) corresponding to one repeat of the C-rich strand of human telomeric DNA (htDNA). The structure shows that PCBP2 KH1 makes substantial contacts with four nucleotides (5′-ACCC-3′, the core recognition sequence). Interestingly, each of the three cystosines is specifically recognized by a network of strong hydrogen bonds to the Watson-Crick positions involving the side chain functional group of a particular amino acid. Another outstanding feature of the PCBP KH1 domain is the presence of a protein-protein dimerization interface located on the other side of KH1 domain from the DNA binding interface. A large number of protein-protein interactions, including hydrophobic contacts, stacking of aromatic side chains, and numerous hydrogen bonds, stabilize the dimerization interface, a feature not observed in any other KH domain structure previously characterized. Insights into mechanisms of PCBP functions, in the context of comparison with other available KH domain-nucleic acids complex structures, are discussed. Sample Preparation and Crystallization—N-terminal His-tagged PCBP2 KH1 was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene). For Se-Met-labeled protein, the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium until they reached an A600 of 0.6-0.8, whereupon leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine were added to the culture to inhibit methionine biosynthesis. After 15 min, l-seleno-methionine (50 mg/liter) was added, followed by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to induce expression of the Se-Met-labeled protein. After purification by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), the His tag was removed by the TAG-zyme system from Qiagen. Crystals of the PCBP2 KH1-DNA (5′-AACCCTA-3′) complex were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion against 25% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.1, at 22 °C. The protein concentration was about 250 μm with a 1:1.2 protein:DNA ratio. Orthorhombic crystals grew to useful size within 1 day with diffraction to 1.7 Å. The crystals are in space group P21212 (a = 65.60 Å, b = 115.18 Å, c = 45.53 Å), with four protein-DNA complexes in one asymmetric unit. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—A single SAD data set was collected at the peak wavelength of the selenium K absorption edge from a single frozen selenomethionine-containing crystal using Beamline 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Berkeley National Laboratory. Diffraction intensities were integrated and reduced by using the program DENZO and were scaled by using SCALEPACK (23.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

All twelve selenium atoms from the four protein molecules in an asymmetric unit were located by CNS (24.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.843. Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). An interpretable electron density map was obtained after solvent flattening. The model was built by MOLOC (25.Gerber P.R.A.M. K. J. Comput. Aided Mol.

The final model includes all of the protein residues 11-82 (the PCBP2 numbering is used), four DNA molecules (two molecules have all of the seven nucleotides built; the other two molecules have five nucleotides built), and 222 water molecules. Analysis of the geometry shows that all parameters are well within expected values at this resolution (TABLE ONE). Structure figures were generated using PyMol. 3W. L.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of the PCBP2 KH1-htDNA Complex—There are four PCBP2 KH1-htDNA complexes in one asymmetric unit, labeled as complex A, B, C, and D in Fig. 2; the two complexes A and B form a dimer; the two complexes C and D form another dimer. Electron density is clearly present for every protein residue in all four complexes. All seven DNA residues were built in complexes A and C; five DNA residues were built for complexes B and D, but the two terminal residues were not built because of a lack of electron density. Structures of the four complexes are otherwise very similar (non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was not applied; average pair-wise RMSD is ∼0.22 Å), including details in molecular recognition. The overall structure of the complex (using complex A as a representative) is depicted in Fig. 3, A and B. The DNA-bound form of PCBP2 KH1 is very similar to the NMR structure of the free protein we previously determined (22.Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The structure consists of three α-helices and three β-strands arranged in the order β1-α1-α2-β2-β3-α3. The evolutionarily conserved invariable Gly30-Lys31-Lys32-Gly33 loop is located between α1 and α2; the variable loop (Ser50-Pro55) is between β2 and β3. The three β-strands form an antiparallel β-sheet, with a spatial order of β1-β3-β2; the three α-helices are packed against one side of the β-sheet. Hydrophobic interactions seem to play an important role in the packing of the structural elements to form a compact global fold; the residues in the core are exclusively hydrophobic. The C-rich strand of human telomeric DNA binds to PCBP2 KH1 in a groove defined by the juxtaposition of two α-helices (α1 and α2), two β-strands (β2 and β3; only one residue from β3, Arg57, participates in direct contact with the DNA), and two connecting loops (the GKKG loop and the variable loop). This binding groove is consistent with what we previously determined by NMR chemical shift perturbations (22.Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); note that chemical shifts are reported in the Supplementary Materials in Ref. 22.Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. The limited length of the groove only allows the accommodation of four DNA residues (Ade-2 to Cyt-5) as the core recognition motif. Other flanking DNA residues are not involved in direct contact with the protein (Fig. 3A). Specific Recognition of the Core Sequence—Recognition of the core motif, Ade-2 to Cyt-5, is achieved by the combination of several forces including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals contacts, and shape complementarities. The human telomeric DNA binds in a groove running from the C-terminal region to the N-terminal region of PCBP2 KH1 domain (Fig. 3A). The overall orientation of the DNA backbone is similar to that previously observed in other DNA/RNA-KH domain complexes (26.Braddock D.T. Baber J.L. Levens D. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3476-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27.Braddock D.T. Louis J.M. Baber J.L. Levens D. Clore G.M.

Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with the 5′- and 3′-ends interacting with the C- and N-terminal regions of the KH domain, respectively. Two phosphate groups of the DNA participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4A). O1P of Cyt-3 accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of Lys32 within the conserved GKKG loop. This hydrogen bond formation explains the large NMR chemical shift of the Lys32 amide proton (downfield, 0.86 ppm) we previously observed (22.Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A water molecule forms a bridge between the phosphate group of Thy-6 and the backbone carbonyl of Ile47. The DNA backbone roughly runs along the left ridge of the binding groove, where four positively charged residues (Lys31 and Lys32 from the invariable GKKG loop, Lys37 and Arg40 from helix α2) make close contacts with the phosphate groups of Cyt-3, Cyt-4, Cyt-5, and Thy-6 (Fig. 4A). Conservation of these positively charged residues suggests that electrostatic interactions may play a role in interaction with the DNA backbone. The ribose and base moieties of the core recognition sequence fit nicely inside the binding groove (Fig. 4A). For Ade-2, no specific interactions are observed, but van der Waals contacts are mainly provided by Gly26, Ser27, and Lys31. Base-stacking with Ade-1 is observed. Binding at this position does not seem to be sequence-specific. For the three cytosines, most of their Watson-Crick functional groups of the bases point to the right, forming specific hydrogen bonds with protein residues from the β-strands (β2 and β3) and variable loop. The size of the groove may dictate the preference for pyrimidine bases at these positions. There are extensive hydrophobic contacts between the riboses/hydrophobic faces of the cytosine bases and the aliphatic side chains that dominate the floor of the binding groove (Fig. 4A). For Cyt-3, van der Waals contacts are provided by Val25, Gly26, and Ile29; for Cyt-4, the hydrophobic environment is created by Ile29, Val36, and Ile49. For Cyt-5, Ile47 is involved. These conserved hydrophobic residues are presumably important for the function of the KH domain. A single mutation of an isoleucine to an asparagine in the second KH domain of FMR1 (corresponding to Val36 in PCBP2 KH1) is known to cause a particularly severe presentation of the mental retardation syndrome (31.De Boulle K. Verkerk A.J. Reyniers E. Vits L. Hendrickx J. Van Roy B. Van Den Bos F. De Graaff E. Oostra B.A. Willems P.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In our hand, mutation of Val36 to an asparagine caused PCBP2 KH1 domain to aggregate in the inclusion body; we were not able to refold the protein despite substantial efforts. It seems as though the conserved hydrophobic residues are somehow important for proper folding and/or solubility of PCBP2 KH1 domain. Specific recognition of the poly(C) sequence is achieved by an extensive network of hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 4, B and C). For Cyt-3, the side chain of Arg57 provides two hydrogen bond donors to the O2 and N3 acceptors of Cyt-3. The side chain conformation of Arg57 is rather extended in order to reach Cyt-3 from strand β3; this extended conformation is further stabilized by two hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ser50. Hydrogen bonds involving the N4 amino group of Cyt-3 entail an intrastrand hydrogen bond to the O1P phosphate group of Ade-2 and a water bridge to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly22 and Cys54. This network of hydrogen bonds provides a molecular mimicry of a guanine to form Watson-Crick-like interactions with Cyt-3, therefore defining the specificity for a cytosine at this position of the DNA sequence. For Cyt-4, the N4 amino group of Cyt-4 forms two hydrogen bonds: one with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ile49, the other with a water which bridges to the amide group of Gly52. The N3 group of Cyt-4 forms a hydrogen bond with another water, which bridges to the amide of Ile49 and the O2 group of Cyt-5. Involvement of the amide group of Ile49 in a hydrogen bond explains the big downfield NMR chemical shift change (1.31 ppm) we previously observed for Ile49 amide proton upon complex formation with the htDNA (22.Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The O2 group of Cyt-4 forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg40 from helix α2. The extended conformation of the Arg40 side chain is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Ile47 from strand β2. Intrastrand base stacking with Cyt-5 also contributes to defining the binding environment for Cyt-4. For Cyt-5, the side chain of Glu51 from the variable loop forms two hydrogen bonds to the N4 and N3 groups. The conformation of the Glu51 side chain is further stabilized by a water bridge to the side chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn48. The base of Cyt-5 engages in stacking interactions with the base of Cyt-4 on one face and the base of an adenosine from a symmetry-related DNA strand (labeled as sym_Ade-7 in Fig. 4C) from an adjacent complex in the crystal lattice on the other face. Dimerization of the PCBP2-KH1 Domain—Numerous interactions stabilize the formation of the PCBP2 KH1 homodimer (Fig. 5, A, B, and C). The two protein domains in the dimer are arranged in a head-to-toe manner, with the dimerization interface located on the opposite side of the protein from the DNA binding groove. The dimerization interface is defined by the anti-parallel positioning of the longest α-helix (α3) and β-strand (β1) in the protein domain. The molecular interactions mediating the dimerization of the KH domains are truly remarkable in that they are the kinds of interactions normally encountered in the folding of a compact, integral protein motif. There is a hydrophobic interior core defined by the hydrophobic side chains of Leu14, Ile16, Leu18 from the two β-strands (β1s), and Ile68, Phe72, Ile76, Leu79 from the α-helices (α3s). Stacking of the two Phe72 aromatic rings is also observed. Dimerization orients the two three-stranded antiparallel β-sheets of the monomers in such a way that a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet is formed. Four generic (backbones only) hydrogen bonds stabilize the antiparallel arrangement of the two β1-strands. These include: two from Leu19 amide to Arg17 carbonyl oxygen, and two water bridges from Arg17 amide to Leu19 carbonyl oxygen. There are also quite a number of non-generic (involving side chain functional groups) intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed at the dimerization interface, including two from the side chain of Arg17 in molecule A to the side chain of Glu56 in molecule B, one from the side chain of Arg17 in molecule B to the side chain of Glu56 in molecule A, one from Val12 backbone in molecule A to the side chain of Glu80 in molecule B, one from the side chain hydroxyl of Thr65 in molecule B to Glu80 side chain in molecule A, and one water bridge from the amide of Thr65 in molecule A to the side chain of Glu80 in molecule B. Formation of the dimer buries 1188 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area in each monomer. The molecular surface forming the dimerization interface is rather hydrophobic in nature (Fig. 5B). Such a big area of hydrophobic surface should provide a significant driving force for formation of the protein-protein interface. Whether the dimerization of the PCBP2 KH1 domain depicted in Fig. 5, A and C is biologically significant is not clear at the present time. However, the details about the driving forces for dimer formation as revealed by our crystal structure strongly suggest that the dimer should be very stable. KH domain dimers were also observed in the crystal structures of free and RNA-bound forms of NOVA2 KH3 (32.Lewis H.A. Chen H. Edo C. Buckanovich R.J. Yang Y.Y. Musunuru K. Zhong R. Darnell R.B. Burley S.K. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and DNA-bound form of hnRNP K KH3 (32.Lewis H.A. Chen H. Edo C. Buckanovich R.J. Yang Y.Y. Musunuru K. Zhong R. Darnell R.B. Burley S.K. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Only the dimerization interface of free NOVA2 KH3 is similar to that of PCBP2 KH1 in terms of the involvement of both strand β1 and helix α3 in an antiparallel arrangement. Other interfaces do not possess such a full set of “native-like” stabilizing interactions as we observe in the PCBP2 KH1 interface. The same PCBP2 KH1 dimer is also present in the crystal structures of PCBP2 KH1 in complex with a 12-nt DNA and RNA with different crystal packings. 4Z. Du, J. K. Lee, R. Tjhen, L. Shang, R. M. Stroud, and T. L. James, unpublished results. Given the remarkable features and reoccurrence of the PCBP2 KH1 dimer, it is tempting to speculate that some KH domains may have a natural propensity to dimerize (self-association, forming heterodimers with other KH domains, or interacting with other proteins) through the β1/α3 interface; depending on the properties of the residues present at the interface. For such KH domains, they cannot only play a role in interaction with nucleic acids, but also in protein-protein interactions. Moreover, because there is no overlap between the nucleic acids and protein interaction, binding to nucleic acids and protein partners can happen simultaneously, which may be functionally important in certain scenarios. The DNA-bound form crystal structure of the PCBP2 KH1 is very similar to the unliganded structure we previously determined by NMR (22.Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The most noticeable structural change upon DNA binding is seen in the variable loop re"
https://openalex.org/W2054813812,"ATR, a critical regulator of DNA replication and damage checkpoint responses, possesses a binding partner called ATRIP. We have studied the functional properties of Xenopus ATR and ATRIP in incubations with purified components and in frog egg extracts. In purified systems, ATRIP associates with DNA in both RPA-dependent and RPA-independent manners, depending on the composition of the template. However, in egg extracts, only the RPA-dependent mode of binding to DNA can be detected. ATRIP adopts an oligomeric state in egg extracts that depends upon binding to ATR. In addition, ATR and ATRIP are mutually dependent on one another for stable binding to DNA in egg extracts. The ATR-dependent oligomerization of ATRIP does not require an intact coiled-coil domain in ATRIP and does not change in the presence of checkpoint-inducing DNA templates. Egg extracts containing a mutant of ATRIP that cannot bind to ATR are defective in the phosphorylation of Chk1. However, extracts containing mutants of ATRIP lacking stable DNA-binding and coiled-coil domains show no reduction in the phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to defined DNA templates. Furthermore, activation of Chk1 does not depend upon RPA under these conditions. These results suggest that ATRIP must associate with ATR in order for ATR to carry out the phosphorylation of Chk1 effectively. However, this function of ATRIP does not involve its ability to mediate the stable binding of ATR to defined checkpoint-inducing DNA templates in egg extracts, does not require an intact coiled-coil domain, and does not depend on RPA.

In eukaryotic cells, various checkpoint control mechanisms help to safeguard the integrity of the genomic DNA. These signaling cascades participate in the detection of abnormal DNA replication intermediates and DNA damage. Thereupon, these regulatory systems trigger a cell cycle delay until the defects are rectified (1.Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 2.Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Key components in these pathways are members of the phosphoinositide kinase-related family of protein kinases, including ATM 2The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; RPA, replication protein A. and ATR (4.Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 5.Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 209-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). There are many similarities between ATM and ATR, including sequence homology and common substrates. However, activation of these kinases depends upon different types of genomic signals. ATM responds primarily to double-stranded DNA breaks induced by ionizing radiation and other agents. Conversely, ATR responds to problems that arise during the course of DNA replication (6.Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7.Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In turn, ATR promotes the activation of Chk1, a downstream kinase that inhibits cell cycle progression. Importantly, several members of the phosphoinositide kinase-related family of protein kinases function in cooperation with partner proteins that help recruit these kinases to DNA (10.Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The partner for human ATR, which is called ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein), is functionally conserved in eukaryotic cells (11.Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). For example, Mec1 and Rad3, the budding and fission yeast homologs of ATR, form stable complexes with Ddc2 and Rad26, respectively (12.Rouse J. Jackson S.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have all shown that absence of ATRIP functionally resembles the lack of ATR. Despite these insights, important aspects regarding the function of ATRIP remain unresolved. For example, recruitment of ATRIP to single-stranded DNA can clearly occur in an RPA-dependent manner (19.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). However, there appear to be RPA-independent means for association of ATRIP with DNA as well (20.Bomgarden R.D. Yean D.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that recruitment of ATRIP to RPA-containing, DNA damage-induced foci in mammalian cells is not essential for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 (22.Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Another important issue involves the native quaternary structure of the ATR-ATRIP complex in cells, about which there is not a clear consensus, and its potential regulation during checkpoint responses (20.Bomgarden R.D.

In view of the fact that activation of ATM involves a change in its oligomerization (25.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar), this issue is highly pertinent. Finally, it is not known whether the binding of ATRIP to ATR is directly necessary for ATR to phosphorylate its targets appropriately. Extracts from Xenopus egg have proven to be a valuable tool for functional analysis of checkpoint regulatory pathways (6.Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously identified and characterized a Xenopus homolog of ATRIP called Xatrip (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Xatrip forms a tight complex with Xenopus ATR (Xatr). Immunodepletion of Xatrip from egg extracts strongly compromises the checkpoint-dependent activation of Xenopus Chk1 (Xchk1). In this study, we have performed a systematic analysis to identify the various functional domains of Xatrip involved in association with DNA, interaction with Xenopus ATR (Xatr), and potential oligomerization of the Xatr-Xatrip complex. In parallel, we have examined how these domains contribute to the ability of Xatr-Xatrip to phosphorylate Xchk1 in response to checkpoint-inducing DNA templates. The results indicate that binding of Xatrip to Xatr is required for Xatr-Xatrip to associate with DNA in egg extracts, to adopt an oligomeric state, and to phosphorylate Xchk1. However, using model DNA templates that induce a checkpoint response, we have been able to show directly that mutants of Xatrip that have lost the ability to recruit Xatr stably to these templates are fully competent in supporting the Xatr-dependent phosphorylation of Xchk1, consistent with recent studies of human ATRIP (22.Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that proper physical interaction of Xatrip with Xatr is directly and inextricably linked with the ability of Xatr to phosphorylate its targets effectively. Egg Extracts and Oligonucleotides—Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The use of single-stranded (dA)70 and annealed, double-stranded (dA)70-(dT)70 to study checkpoint responses in egg extracts was reported previously (30.Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The random sequence single-stranded and double-stranded 70-mer oligonucleotides used in this study were described previously (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Proteins—For small scale protein production in Sf9 insect cells, sequences from wild-type and mutant Xatrip proteins were cloned into a pIEx-1 vector (Novagen) with a FLAG epitope that was engineered into the 3′-end of the coding region by standard procedures. The constructs were transfected into Sf9 insect cells with the Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For larger scale expression, Xatrip sequences were cloned into pFastBacHTa vectors with a His6 tag at the N-terminal end and either a FLAG or HA tag at the C-terminal or N-terminal ends, respectively. Purification with nickel-agarose beads was performed as described (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recombinant human RPA was purified from Escherichia coli CodonPlus RIL cells as described (31.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies against Xatrip, Xatr, and Xenopus RPA70 were described previously (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G.

Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Anti-human RPA70 and anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from U.S. Biological and Sigma, respectively. Immunodepletion from Egg Extracts—For immunodepletion of Xatr and Xatrip, antibodies coated on protein A-magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.) were incubated with extracts on ice for 45 min. The beads were removed with a magnet, and the procedure was repeated to ensure complete removal of the proteins. Binding of Recombinant Xatrip to Oligonucleotides—Either cell lysates containing recombinant proteins or purified proteins were incubated with various biotinylated oligonucleotides coated on streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal) in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The beads were isolated with a magnet and processed for immunoblotting as described previously (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In order to test binding activity in egg extracts, either insect cell lysates or purified recombinant proteins were incubated with extracts at room temperature for 15 min. Next, the oligonucleotide-coated beads were added to the extracts, and the incubation was continued for 90 min. The beads were treated as described above after being collected by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. In Vitro RPA Binding Assay—Anti-FLAG antibodies were coupled to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with Sf9 cell lysates containing various Xatrip recombinant proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with buffer A containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol and mixed with RPA (50–100 nm) in buffer A in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml (dA)70. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the beads were washed four times with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel sample buffer and processed for immunoblotting. Gel Filtration Chromatography—A Superdex-200 10/300 GL column was equilibrated at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 80 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Egg extract (50 μl) was loaded onto the column, and the column was developed with the same buffer. Aliquots of fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and elution profiles of the proteins of interest were determined by immunoblotting analysis. The standard proteins used for size estimation were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa). Phosphorylation of 35S-Xchk1 in Egg Extracts—35S-Labeled Xchk1 proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysates as described (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Egg extracts were incubated with 35S-Xchk1 (one-tenth volume of a reaction), 50 μg/ml of (dA)70-(dT)70,3 μm tautomycin, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 90 min at room temperature. Aliquots of the reactions were removed for SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Xatrip Can Associate with DNA in Vitro through both RPA-dependent and RPA-independent Mechanisms—To characterize the interaction of Xatrip with DNA, we immobilized various biotinylated oligonucleotide templates on streptavidin-coated beads and incubated the beads with recombinant His6-Xatrip-FLAG in the presence or absence of RPA. The beads were recovered, washed extensively, and analyzed for the binding of Xatrip by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1A). In the presence of RPA, Xatrip showed a high affinity for all tested oligonucleotides, including a random sequence single-stranded 70-mer, a random sequence double-stranded 70-mer, single-stranded (dA)70, and double-stranded (dA)70-(dT)70. Interestingly, however, all of the templates except for (dA)70 did show detectable, albeit considerably lower, binding in the absence of RPA. To pursue this issue, we compared the binding of Xatrip to the homopolymers (dA)70, (dT)70, (dG)70, and (dC)70 in the presence and absence of RPA. As shown in Fig. 1B, Xatrip displayed a strict dependence on RPA for binding to (dA)70. By contrast, Xatrip bound quite well to (dT)70, (dG)70, and (dC)70 in both the presence and absence of RPA. These results suggest that Xatrip has an intrinsic single-stranded DNA binding activity with a preference for stretches of dT, dG, and dC. These observations could help to explain apparently discordant findings in the literature on the RPA dependence of human ATRIP for binding to DNA (19.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar, 20.Bomgarden R.D. Yean D. Yee M.C. Cimprich K.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). The N-terminal Region of Xatrip Is Required for in Vitro Binding to DNA—To determine which part of Xatrip is involved in association with DNA, we first constructed fragments encompassing the N-terminal half (residues 1–405), C-terminal half (residues 406–801), and a central region (residues 244–598) of the protein and tested binding to (dA)70, (dT)70, and (dA)70-(dT)70. Consistent with the previous observations (22.Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33.Itakura E. Takai K.K. Umeda K. Kimura M. Ohsumi M. Tamai K. Matsuura A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the N-terminal 1–405 fragment bound to all three DNA templates as efficiently as wild-type Xatrip, but there was no binding of either the 244–598 or 406–801 fragments (Fig. 2, A–D). The 1–405 fragment displayed both RPA-dependent binding to (dA)70 and RPA-independent binding to (dT)70 (Fig. 2, C and D). We proceeded to map which regions of Xatrip were important for these two different modes of binding. For these experiments, we made serial deletions from the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the 1–405 fragment. We tested binding of these fragments to (dA)70 in the presence of RPA and to (dT)70 in the absence of RPA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2C, the N-terminal 80 amino acids of Xatrip were necessary for RPA-dependent binding to (dA)70. However, this region is not sufficient for RPA-dependent binding, because fragments smaller than N-terminal residues 1–185 could not bind to RPA-coated (dA)70. On the other hand, more extensive N-terminal deletion mutants (e.g. 121–405 and 140–405) displayed good binding to (dT)70 in the absence of RPA (Fig. 2D). Only RPA-dependent Binding of Xatrip to DNA Can Be Detected in Egg Extracts—We asked whether the two distinct in vitro DNA-binding modes of Xatrip (e.g. RPA-dependent and RPA-independent) could also be observed in Xenopus egg extracts. To address this question, we removed RPA from egg extracts by immunodepletion with anti-RPA antibodies (32.Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In parallel, we prepared mock-depleted extracts using control antibodies. Next, we incubated these extracts with streptavidin beads containing either (dA)70 or (dT)70 and subsequently reisolated the beads to examine binding of Xatrip by immunoblotting. In mock-depleted extracts, Xatrip bound to both (dA)70 and (dT)70 in comparable amounts, and the binding of RPA to these two templates was similar (Fig. 3A). By contrast, in RPA-depleted extracts, there was no detectable binding to either (dA)70 or (dT)70. One possible explanation for the difference between the in vitro DNA binding assays and binding to DNA in egg extracts is that competition from other DNA-binding proteins in egg extracts obscures RPA-independent binding of Xatrip to DNA (see “Discussion”). To pursue these observations further, we examined what regions of Xatrip are required for association with DNA in egg extracts. We observed that neither the ΔN80 nor the ΔN120 mutants could bind to any single-stranded or double-stranded template that we tested in egg extracts (Fig. 3B). In order to localize the DNA binding region more precisely, we introduced smaller deletions lacking 31 (ΔN31) and 53 (ΔN53) amino acids from the N-terminal end of Xatrip. As shown in Fig. 3C, both the ΔN31 and ΔN53 mutants showed significant binding to DNA, which suggests that the region between amino acids 54 and 80 is crucial for RPA-dependent binding of Xatrip to DNA in egg extracts. Interaction of Xatrip with RPA—Next, we asked if Xatrip could interact directly with RPA. To address this issue, we first performed immunoprecipitation experiments in egg extracts. As shown in Fig. 4A, we observed small amounts of Xatrip in anti-RPA immunoprecipitates, but we could not detect RPA in anti-Xatrip immunoprecipitates. Similarly, ATR-ATRIP is present in anti-RPA immunoprecipitates from human cells (21.Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Inclusion of (dA)70-(dT)70 in the egg extracts did not have an effect on coimmunoprecipitation of RPA and Xatrip. These experiments suggested that Xatrip might have a low affinity for RPA. Therefore, we incubated purified Xatrip and RPA together in order to increase the local concentration of the two components relative to one another. In these experiments, purified RPA bound very well to FLAG-agarose beads containing Xatrip but not to control beads lacking Xatrip (Fig. 4B). Binding was not affected by the addition of (dA)70. Using this assay, we examined what part of Xatrip is involved in binding to RPA. We observed that the ΔN31 and ΔN53 mutants, but not the ΔN80 mutant, could interact well with RPA (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the same region of Xatrip that is essential for RPA-dependent binding to DNA in egg extracts is also necessary for direct binding of RPA. We proceeded further by examining which part of RPA is involved in this interaction. For this purpose, we examined different mutant constructs including a trimeric form of RPA in which the RPA70 subunit lacks 168 N-terminal residues and two truncation mutants of the isolated RPA70 subunit (residues 1–441 and 169–447) (34.Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As expected, all three mutants bound well to DNA (Fig. 4, D and E). However, only the 1–441 construct could support the association of Xatrip with DNA. These results imply that the first 168 amino acids of RPA70 are required for interaction with Xatrip. It is well established that this domain of RPA70 is involved in protein-protein interactions (e.g. with DNA polymerase α-primase and SV40 T antigen) (35.Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). These data are also consistent with studies on a mutant of budding yeast RPA70 that is compromised in checkpoint control and unable to mediate the RPA-dependent binding of Ddc2, the budding yeast homologue of ATRIP, to DNA (19.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar, 36.Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D.

This mutation (rpa-t11) maps to Lys45 in the N-terminal domain of the protein. The C-terminal End of Xatrip Is Necessary but Not Sufficient for Binding to Xatr—In order to determine which region of Xatrip binds to Xatr, we examined a series of N-terminal and C-terminal truncation mutants. For assaying these mutants, we took advantage of the fact that there is an excess of Xatr over Xatrip in Xenopus egg extracts so that about one-third of Xatr is free of Xatrip (18.Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, if we incubated full-length Xatrip-FLAG in egg extracts, we could readily coimmunoprecipitate endogenous Xatr with anti-FLAG antibodies. Using this assay, we found that N-terminal deletion mutants of Xatrip lacking up to 244 amino acids (ΔN244) could still associate with Xatr well (Fig. 5A). By contrast, a more severe deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal half of the protein (ΔN405) could not bind to Xatr anymore (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, for the C-terminal end of Xatrip, even mutants with deletions as small as 21 amino acids (ΔC780) were incapable of binding to Xatr (Fig. 5, A and C). These results are consistent with the recent report that there are small conserved C-terminal motifs within the human ATRIP, Nbs1, and Ku80 proteins that interact with ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK, respectively (10.Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Nearly this entire motif, which is located at amino acids 779–786 in Xatrip, is missing from the ΔC780 Xatrip mutant (Fig. 5A). However, this motif appears not to be sufficient for high affinity binding to Xatr, because even the whole C-terminal half of Xatrip (the ΔN405 mutant) cannot associate stably with Xatr. Therefore, there may be additional sequences in Xatrip that are involved in binding to Xatr. In the case of human ATRIP, an N-terminal deletion mutant containing residues 108–790 but not one containing residues 218–790 can bind to ATR (11.Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In addition, a splice variant of human ATRIP lacking residues 658–684 (equivalent to residues 666–694 of Xatrip) is defective for interaction with ATR (22.Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interaction of Xatr with Xatrip Is Required for Binding to DNA in Egg Extracts—Next, we assessed the relationship between interaction of Xatrip with Xatr and binding of these proteins to DNA. For this purpose, we assayed the ability of the ΔC718 Xatrip mutant (which cannot interact with Xatr) to bind to DNA in both a purified system and in Xenopus egg extracts. First, we incubated either full-length or ΔC718 Xatrip in a defined system with streptavidin beads containing (dA)70 in the absence and presence of RPA (Fig. 6, A and B). We observed that the ΔC718 protein bound as well as full-length Xatrip to DNA, with both proteins showing the expected dependence on RPA. We proceeded to incubate both Xatrip proteins in egg extracts containing beads coated with (dA)70. In this experiment, wild-type Xatrip, but not the ΔC718 mutant, is able to associate with the free pool of endogenous Xatr in the extracts. In contrast to the results with the purified system, there was no binding of the ΔC718 mutant to DNA in egg extracts, although wild-type Xatrip bound well under the same conditions (Fig. 6C). To characterize these observations further, we examined the ability of wild-type Xatrip to bind to DNA in extr"
https://openalex.org/W1990713277,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are expected to be effective for refractory cancer because their mechanism of action differs from that of conventional antineoplastic agents. In this study, we examined the effect of the HDAC inhibitor FK228 on malignant melanoma, as well as its molecular mechanisms. FK228 was highly effective against melanoma compared with other commonly used drugs. By comparing the gene expression profiles of melanoma cells and normal melanocytes, we defined a subset of genes specifically upregulated in melanoma cells by FK228, which included Rap1, a small GTP-binding protein of the Ras family. The expression of Rap1 mRNA and protein increased in FK228-treated melanoma cells in both a dose- and a time-dependent manner. A decrease in the phosphorylation of c-Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 was accompanied by an increase in Rap1 expression in both FK228-treated and Rap1-overexpressing cells. Inhibition of Rap1 upregulation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the induction of apoptosis and suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in FK228-treated melanoma cells. These results indicate that the cytotoxic effects of FK228 are mediated via the upregulation of Rap1. Furthermore, we found that Rap1 was overexpressed and formed a complex with B-Raf in melanoma cell lines with a V599E mutation of B-Raf. The siRNA-mediated abrogation of Rap1 overexpression increased the viability of these cells, suggesting that Rap1 is also an endogenous regulator of Ras–MAP kinase signaling in melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2038943650,"We reported previously that the core oligosaccharide region of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is essential for optimal adhesion of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, an important swine pathogen, to respiratory tract cells. Rough LPS and core LPS mutants of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 were generated by using a mini-Tn10 transposon mutagenesis system. Here we performed a structural analysis of the oligosaccharide region of three core LPS mutants that still produce the same O-antigen by using methylation analyses and mass spectrometry. We also performed a kinetic study of proinflammatory cytokines production such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL1-β, MCP-1, and IL8 by LPS-stimulated porcine alveolar macrophages, which showed that purified LPS of the parent strain, the rough LPS and core LPS mutants, had the same ability to stimulate the production of cytokines. Most interestingly, an in vitro susceptibility test of these LPS mutants to antimicrobial peptides showed that the three core LPS mutants were more susceptible to cationic peptides than both the rough LPS mutant and the wild type parent strain. Furthermore, experimental pig infections with these mutants revealed that the galactose (Gal I) and d,d-heptose (Hep IV) residues present in the outer core of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 LPS are important for adhesion and overall virulence in the natural host, whereas deletion of the terminal GalNAc-Gal II disaccharide had no effect.

This highly contagious disease is responsible for substantial economic losses in the swine industry (1Taylor D.J. Straw B.E. D'Allaire S. Megeling W.L. Taylor D.J. Diseases of Swine. 8th Ed.

However, it has been reported that pigs may be subclinically infected without presenting clinical signs (2Moller K. Andersen L.V. Christensen G. Kilian M. Vet.

The structure of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 O-antigen has been described as branched tetrasaccharide repeating units composed of two α-l-rhamnopyranosyl, one α-d-glycopyranosyl, and one 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucose residues (11Altman E. Brisson J.R. Perry M.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). More recently, the structures of the core oligosaccharide of LPS from A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1, 2, 5a, and 5b were elucidated using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (12Michael F.S. Brisson J.R. Larocque S. Monteiro M. Li J. Jacques M. Perry M.B. Cox A.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which revealed a conserved inner core structure consisting of a trisaccharide of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose residues linked to a Kdo residue and substituted at different positions as shown previously (12Michael F.S.

Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 27-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the rough LPS mutants allowed us to identify a cluster of 13 genes involved in O-polysaccharide biosynthesis in A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 (15Labrie J. Rioux S. Wade M.M. Champlin F.R. Holman S.C. Wilson W.W. Savoye C. Kobisch M. Sirois M. Galarneau C. Jacques M. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 27-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes affected in the core LPS mutants were galU in mutant 5.1 (13Rioux S. Galarneau C. Harel J. Frey J. Nicolet J. Kobisch M. Dubreuil J.D. Jacques M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which encodes a UTP-α-d-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, a gene involved in outer core elongation with galactose in mutant CG1 (14Galarneau C. Rioux S. Jacques M. Pathogenesis. 2000; 1: 253-264Google Scholar) and a gene coding for a d-glycero-d-manno-heptosyltransferase in mutants CG3 and CG5 (14Galarneau C. Rioux S. Jacques M. Pathogenesis. 2000; 1: 253-264Google Scholar). All these core LPS mutants still express an O-chain, although their core oligosaccharide is apparently truncated, based on gel mobility (14Galarneau C. Rioux S. Jacques M. Pathogenesis. 2000; 1: 253-264Google Scholar). Characterization of the surface properties of these LPS mutants demonstrated that O-antigen deletions in rough mutants have no effect on the adhesion of the bacteria to frozen tracheal sections of pigs, whereas an intact core oligosaccharide region seems to be required for optimal adherence (7Jacques M. Can. J. Vet. Res. 2004; 68: 81-85PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rioux S. Galarneau C. Harel J. Frey J. Nicolet J. Kobisch M. Dubreuil J.D. Jacques M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, in vivo experiments in pigs showed that the core LPS mutant 5.1 that still produces an O-antigen was less virulent, whereas no difference was observed between the rough mutant 27.1 lacking O-antigen and the parent strain (13Rioux S. Galarneau C. Harel J. Frey J. Nicolet J. Kobisch M. Dubreuil J.D. Jacques M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Galarneau C. Rioux S. Jacques M.

Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 27-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the LPS core oligosaccharide could play a major role in colonization and pathogenesis of A. pleuropneumoniae in pigs. Another important feature of LPS molecules is their interaction with the host immune system. The innate immunity is the first barrier for invading organisms, and inflammation is known to be of special importance in this first line of defense (16Uthaisangsook S. Day N.K. Bahna S.L. Good R.A. Haraguchi S. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2002; 88 (318): 253-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine pleuropneumonia is characterized by an intensive inflammation with infiltration of phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, which are the main cells found in affected lungs (17Baarsch M.J. Foss D.L. Murtaugh M.P. Am. J. Vet. Res. 2000; 61: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previous in vivo studies have shown that A. pleuropneumoniae infection is associated with the production of a large amount of inflammatory mediators (18Cho W.S. Chae C. Vet. Pathol. 2002; 39: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Cho W.S. Chae C. Vet. Pathol. 2004; 41: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1, TNF-α, IL8, and IL6 (20Baarsch M.J. Scamurra R.W. Burger K. Foss D.L. Maheswaran S.K. Murtaugh M.P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Choi C. Kwon D. Min K. Chae C. J. Comp. Pathol. 1999; 121: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that could be responsible, at least in part, for the lung injuries and tissue destruction observed in porcine pleuropneumonia (20Baarsch M.J. Scamurra R.W. Burger K. Foss D.L. Maheswaran S.K. Murtaugh M.P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stephens K.E. Ishizaka A. Larrick J.W. Raffin T.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 137: 1364-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). LPS are known as mediators of inflammation (16Uthaisangsook S. Day N.K. Bahna S.L. Good R.A. Haraguchi S. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2002; 88 (318): 253-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as they interact with immune cells and activate the production of inflammatory cytokines (23Lin G. Pearson A.E. Scamurra R.W. Zhou Y. Baarsch M.J. Weiss D.J. Murtaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 77-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Baarsch M.J. Wannemuehler M.J. Molitor T.W. Murtaugh M.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 140: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by these cells. Thus, by interacting with the immune system and promoting inflammation, LPS could be an important factor in the development of lesions observed in porcine pleuropneumonia. We sought to examine if a defined mutation within the LPS could result in a decrease in LPS-induced cytokine production and consequently cause an attenuation of the virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae. One other important component of the innate immune system is antimicrobial peptides, which can either be released by epithelial cells or by phagocytic cells (25Ganz T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Most of these peptides are small cationic peptides that have been isolated from various biological sources (26Zasloff M. Kaufman S.H.E. Medzhitov R. Gordon S. The Innate Immune Response to Infection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2004: 315-343Google Scholar); they act mainly by forming pores in bacterial membranes (27Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). They are classified into the following three major classes on the basis of their amino acid compositions and their three-dimensional structures: linear α-helical peptides without cysteines (cecropin from pigs and magainin from frogs); peptides with a predominantly β-sheet structure with cysteines linked by disulfide bridges (defensin and protegrin from pigs); and peptides with high contents of particular amino acids (PR-39 from pigs) (28Bals R. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As a result of their positive charges, these peptides have a high affinity for negatively charged LPS that form the external leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, a modification within these LPS molecules could result in an increase of susceptibility to these peptides. Considering the potential role played by the LPS core oligosaccharide in A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenesis, the purpose of the present study was to determine the core oligosaccharide structure of three different core LPS mutants of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 (5.1, CG1, and CG3), by using capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI/MS) in combination with methylation analysis, and to compare those structures to that of the wild type parent strain. To consider the effect of these mutations on the interaction of A. pleuropneumoniae with immune system components, a kinetic study of proinflammatory cytokines production was performed on porcine alveolar macrophages stimulated with either the LPS mutants or the wild type parent strain. The susceptibility of the core LPS mutants to antimicrobial peptides was also evaluated by using an in vitro assay to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of various cationic peptides. Finally, experimental pig infections were performed with these core LPS mutants. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains used in this study are shown in TABLE ONE.

Deacylation of LPS— 0.2 mg of LPS of each mutant was O-deacylated as described previously (12Michael F.S. Brisson J.R. Larocque S. Monteiro M. Li J. Jacques M. Perry M.B. Cox A.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and examined by CE-MS. Isolation of the Core Oligosaccharide—The sugar-containing fractions of each mutant LPS following column chromatography were pooled and treated with 3.5 ml of 2% acetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h, giving core oligosaccharide (19.3 mg for mutant 5.1, 15.6 mg for mutant CG1, and 21.3 mg for mutant CG3). The samples were purified on a Bio-Gel P-2 column as described previously (12Michael F.S. Brisson J.R. Larocque S. Monteiro M. Li J. Jacques M. Perry M.B. Cox A.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Core fractions (fractions 19–24) eluting off the column slightly after the O-chain (fractions 15–17) were combined and lyophilized. Microanalysis of Cells— 0.2 mg of cells of each mutant was suspended in 200 μl of water, and 2 μl of 1 mg/ml proteinase K was added. The samples were left at 37 °C for 5 h and then heated to 75 °C for 10 min (to destroy the enzyme) and lyophilized. The samples were resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5), and 1 μl of DNase and 2 μl of RNase (both 10 mg/ml) was added and left at 37 °C for 6 h and lyophilized. The samples were then deacylated as described above for purified LPS and sent for CE-MS. Analytical Methods and Mass Spectrometry—The structural analysis was performed as described previously (12Michael F.S. Brisson J.R. Larocque S. Monteiro M. Li J. Jacques M. Perry M.B. Cox A.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Isolation of Porcine Alveolar Macrophages (PAMs)—PAMs were obtained from two healthy pigs that originated from herds known to be serologically free for all serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae, by means of lung lavage as described previously (29Chiou M.T. Jeng C.R. Chueh L.L. Cheng C.H. Pang V.F. Vet. Microbiol. 2000; 71: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pigs were pre-anesthetized through an intramuscular injection of 22 mg/kg ketamine and 4 mg/kg stresnil and euthanized intravenously with 60 mg/kg pentobarbital. Three bronchoalveolar lavages were performed for each pig with a total of 300 ml of sterile pyrogen-free phosphate-buffered saline per lavage. The fluid lavage was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellets were washed and resuspended in DMEM (12430-054; Invitrogen) supplemented with 40% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences), and nonadherent cells were removed by washing the plates three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell concentration was then adjusted to 2 × 107/ml in a medium containing 80% DMEM and 20% Me2SO and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until used. Stimulation of Cytokine Production—Before the experiment, PAMs were quickly thawed in a water bath at 37 °C, washed, and resuspended in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.1 mm minimum Eagle's medium, nonessential amino acids (all purchased from Invitrogen) and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Cell count was re-evaluated on the basis of trypan blue dye exclusion, and the cell concentration was adjusted to 1 × 106/ml. PAMs were then dispensed in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For the kinetic study the PAMs were classified into the following three groups: unstimulated cells as a negative control, cells stimulated with 1 μg/ml purified LPS, or 109 CFU/ml of heat-killed bacteria and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Purification of LPS was performed according to the Darveau-Hancock procedure (30Darveau R.P. Hancock R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 831-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Maudsley J.R. Kadis S. Mayberry W.R. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 501-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the products were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (13Rioux S. Galarneau C. Harel J. Frey J. Nicolet J. Kobisch M. Dubreuil J.D. Jacques M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Purified LPS of the wild type parent strain and all the LPS mutants (TABLE ONE) were used in this study. As a positive control of the stimulation, purified LPS of E. coli 0127:B8 (Sigma) was also used. Heat-killed bacteria from all the A. pleuropneumoniae strains shown in TABLE ONE were also used in this study and prepared as described previously (32Segura M. Stankova J. Gottschalk M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating the organisms at 60 °C for 45 min. Stimulated or unstimulated (control) samples were collected at different time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h). At each sampling, cell-free supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and stored at -20 °C for ELISA cytokine quantification. Cells were then treated for total RNA extraction for RT-PCR analysis of cytokine gene expression. As a control of the LPS-stimulated cytokines production, a 24-h incubation time of PAMs with purified LPS was carried out as described above in the presence of 10 μg/ml polymyxin B (Sigma), an LPS inhibitor. A cytotoxicity test based on lactate dehydrogenase dosage in the supernatants showed that neither the purified LPS nor the heat-killed bacteria have a cytotoxic effect on the PAMs during the incubation times (data not shown). This test was performed using a CytoTox 96 LDH kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) for Cytokines—IL1-β was quantified using the immunoassay kit swine IL1-β (BIOSOURCE), as specified by the manufacturer. TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured by sandwich ELISA, using the following pair-matched monoclonal antibodies from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's recommendations: TNF-α, monoclonal anti-porcine TNF-α and biotinylated anti-porcine TNF-α; IL-6, polyclonal anti-porcine IL-6 and biotinylated anti-porcine IL-6; and IL-8, monoclonal anti-human IL-8 and biotinylated anti-porcine IL-8. 2-Fold dilutions of recombinant porcine TNF-α, IL-6 (78–5000 pg/ml; R & D Systems), and porcine IL-8 (18–600 pg/ml; R & D Systems) were included as standard curves in each ELISA plate (Nunc, VWR, Ville Mont Royal, Quebec, Canada). Sample dilutions giving optical density readings in the linear portion of the appropriate standard curve were used to quantify the levels of each cytokine in the samples. Standard and sample dilutions were added in duplicate wells to each ELISA plate, and all analyses were performed at least four times for each individual stimulation assay. Plates were read in a Power Wave X 340 (Biotek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) microplate reader. Total RNA Extraction—Macrophages were resuspended and lysed by repeated pipetting in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted as specified by the manufacturer. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and RNA concentration and purity were measured using an Ultrospec 2100 pro-UV-visible spectrophotometer (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK). A PCR using primers for a constitutive gene, β2-microglobulin (TABLE TWO), was performed with the RNA samples, as described below, to detect any DNA contamination.

https://openalex.org/W2047575886,"The cytoplasm to vacuole (Cvt) trafficking pathway in S. cerevisiae is a constitutive biosynthetic pathway required for the transport of two vacuolar enzymes, aminopeptidase I (Ape1p) and α-mannosidase (Ams1p), to the vacuole. Ape1p and Ams1p bind to their receptor, Atg19p, in the cytosol to form a Cvt complex, which then associates with a membrane structure that envelops the complex before fusing with the vacuolar membrane. Ubiquitin-like modifications are required for both Cvt and macroautophagy, but no role for ubiquitin itself has been described. Here, we show that the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3p interacts with Atg19p. Moreover, Atg19p is ubiquitinated in vivo, and Atg19p-ubiquitin conjugates accumulate in cells lacking either Ubp3p or its cofactor, Bre5p. Deletion of UBP3 also leads to decreased targeting of Ape1p to the vacuole. Atg19p is ubiquitinated on two lysine residues, Lys213 and Lys216, which, when mutated, reduce the interaction of Atg19p with Ape1p. These results suggest that both ubiquitination and deubiquitination of Atg19p are required for its full function.

A unique pathway exists for the two vacuolar enzymes aminopeptidase I (Ape1p) 2The abbreviations used are:Ape1paminopeptidase IAms1pα-mannosidaseCvtcytoplasm to vacuole traffickingE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin ligaseDubdeubiquitinating enzymeHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography 2The abbreviations used are:Ape1paminopeptidase IAms1pα-mannosidaseCvtcytoplasm to vacuole traffickingE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin ligaseDubdeubiquitinating enzymeHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography and α-mannosidase (Ams1p) (reviewed in Ref. 2Stromhaug P.E.

These proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, assembled into a large oligomeric structure called the cytoplasm to vacuole trafficking (Cvt) complex, and enwrapped by a newly formed double membrane to form a Cvt vesicle. The outer Cvt membrane docks and fuses with the vacuole membrane to release the inner membrane vesicle into the vacuole lumen. The inner membrane is then degraded, and the contents are released (3Hutchins M.U. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Most of the molecular machinery required for Cvt is shared by macroautophagy, a starvation-induced process that delivers bulk cytosol and organelles to the vacuole for degradation and recycling (9Harding T.M.

Atg19p binds specifically to both cargo proteins Ape1p and Ams1p, is part of the Cvt complex, and mediates the interaction of this complex with components required for formation of the double membrane that will enclose the Cvt vesicle. Atg19p is enclosed in the Cvt vesicle along with the cargo proteins, and when the vesicle fuses with the vacuolar membrane and the inner membrane is degraded, Atg19p is released into the lumen and destroyed (4Shintani T.

In contrast to the bulk degradation of cytoplasm by macroautophagy, ubiquitin modification selectively targets protein substrates for destruction by the proteasome. Ubiquitin is activated by an ATP-dependent activating enzyme (E1) and transferred to a protein substrate by a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), usually with the assistance of a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The conjugating enzyme attaches the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the substrate, forming an isopeptide bond with the free amino group of the lysine. Ubiquitin can also be conjugated to itself in this manner, forming polyubiquitin chains on substrate molecules. These chains typically serve as a degradation tag, targeting the substrate for destruction by the proteasome, a large multienzyme complex (15Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar, 16Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 17Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).The ubiquitination of proteins does not always lead to their degradation by the proteasome (19Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 20Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination of membrane proteins can trigger their endocytosis and nonautophagic degradation in the vacuole (21Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). A single lysine residue of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in yeast can be modified by a ubiquitin monomer, a polyubiquitin chain, or the ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO. None of these modifications triggers the degradation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Instead, monoubiquitination stimulates error-prone DNA repair, polyubiquitination triggers an error-free repair pathway, and SUMOylation recruits the helicase protein Srs2p and suppresses homologous recombination during S phase (23Haracska L. Torres-Ramos C.A. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Sacher M. Hoege C. Jentsch S.

In human cells, Fanconi's anemia protein FANCD2 is activated and targeted to DNA damage foci by monoubiquitination (28Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). This ubiquitin monomer can be removed by the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp1p, which is itself cell cycle-regulated and may serve to prevent FANCD2 hyperactivity (29Nijman S.M. Huang T.T. Dirac A.M. Brummelkamp T.R. Kerkhoven R.M. D'Andrea A.D. Bernards R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).The cellular roles of deubiquitinating enzymes (Dubs) such as Usp1p are poorly understood. More than 80 Dubs are encoded in the human genome (30Wong B.R. Parlati F. Qu K. Demo S. Pray T. Huang J. Payan D.G. Bennett M.K. Drug Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and 17 in the yeast genome, most bearing little homology to the others beyond the residues that comprise their active sites. Physiological roles for Dubs exist at several points in the ubiquitin pathway. These roles include the generation of free ubiquitin, which is always synthesized as a protein fusion to itself or to ribosomal proteins; the removal of ubiquitin from substrate fragments after substrate degradation by the proteasome; the processing of polyubiquitin chains, either for remodeling their branched structure or for regeneration of free ubiquitin; and, as in the case of Usp1p, the reversal of ubiquitinations that serve to modify substrate activity rather than target substrates for degradation (17Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 18Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).No direct connection between the ubiquitin system and the Cvt pathway has yet been established. Ubiquitin-like modifications are essential events in the Cvt and macroautophagic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 31Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-like proteins Atg8p and Atg12p are both activated in an ATP-dependent manner, transferred to E2-like conjugation enzymes, and attached to their respective targets via C-terminal glycine residues. In the case of Atg8p, which is attached to phophatidylethanolamine, there is even a Dub-like enzyme, Atg4p. Atg4p activates Atg8p after synthesis by removing a C-terminal peptide and can also remove Atg8p from its phosphatidylethanolamine substrate. However, these modifications involve neither ubiquitin itself nor components of the ubiquitin system.In this study, we show that ubiquitination of the Cvt cargo receptor Atg19p occurs in vivo and that the Ubp3p-Bre5p Dub complex is most likely responsible for removing this ubiquitin. Intriguingly, our data suggest that both attachment and removal of ubiquitin are required for full activity of Atg19p. These findings implicate ubiquitin as a functional component of the Cvt pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strain Construction and Growth Media—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE. To create strains BB510 (wild type) and BB511 (ubp3-Δ), S288C-derived MATα strain BY4742-ubp3-Δ::kanMX4 (EuroScarf) was crossed with S288C-derived MATa strain PSY1838 (32Damelin M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 133-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to create a diploid heterozygous for trp1 and ubp3-Δ. This diploid was sporulated to give haploids BB510 and BB511. Strain BB520 (bre5-Δ) was similarly derived from a cross between BY4742-bre5-Δ::kanMX4 (EuroScarf) and PSY1838. Strains BB532 and BB529 carry URA3-marked insertions of ATG19 (with or without an N-terminal protein A tag, respectively) at the ATG19 locus. These strains were created by amplifying the ATG19 and URA3 coding regions of plasmid pTS477 (a generous gift from Dan Klionsky (4Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)) by PCR using primers whose 5′-ends would direct integration to the ATG19 locus and whose 3′-ends annealed to the URA3 promoter (for the downstream primer) and either the beginning of the ATG19 open reading frame (for BB529) or the beginning of the protein A tag (for BB532). The resulting linear DNA fragment was used for integrative transformation of BB510, resulting in strains in which the inserted ATG19 (without or with a protein A tag) is under control of its own 5′-untranslated region, and its 3′-untranslated region has been replaced by pTS477 vector sequence including the URA3 marker gene. Uracil prototrophs were selected, and integration at the ATG19 locus was confirmed by PCR. Strains BB530, BB531, BB533, and BB534 were constructed in the same manner, using pTS477-derived plasmid templates carrying point mutations in ATG19 that replace Lys codons with Arg codons (see “Site-directed Mutagenesis”). For all six strains, the entire ATG19 open reading frame was amplified and sequenced after integration to confirm the absence of any unintended nonsilent mutations.TABLE ONEYeast strains used in this studyStrainDescriptionGenotypeSourcePJ69–4aTwo-hybrid host strainMATa trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZRef. 35James P.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 34Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Yeast were routinely grown at 30 °C, and Escherichia coli were grown at 37 °C.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The ATG19 2×mut and ATG19 11×mut alleles were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene). For the 2× mutant, one primer pair was used to change ATG19 codon 216 from AAA (Lys) to AGA (Arg) in plasmid pTS477 (4Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This mutation was confirmed by sequencing, and then a second pair of primers was used to change codon 213, also from AAA to AGA. The entire ATG19 open reading frame was then sequenced to confirm the absence of any unintended mutations. For the 11× mutant, codons 165, 169, 176, 182, 186, 238, 247, 248, and 251 of the 2× mutant were all changed from Lys to Arg by successive rounds of site-directed mutagenesis. Again, the entire open reading frame was sequenced, and the absence of any unintended mutations was confirmed.Plasmid Constructions—UBP3-containing two-hybrid bait plasmids were constructed by amplifying UBP3 by PCR and ligating the PCR products into pGBD-C1 (a generous gift of Phil James (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) using PCR-introduced EcoRI and PstI sites. The resulting constructs encode the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to amino acids 1-459 (Nterm), 449-912 (Cterm), or 1-912 (full length) of Ubp3. The “Cys box” and “His box” regions of the active site of Ubp3 (36Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are thus included in the Cterm and full length, but not the Nterm bait plasmid. GST fusion plasmid pGEX-UBP3-N was constructed by amplifying the UBP3 portion of pGBD-UBP3-Nterm by PCR and ligating the PCR product into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using PCR-introduced EcoRI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid encodes a fusion of GST to amino acids 1-459 of Ubp3 under control of the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible ptac promoter. Plasmid pET29-ATG19, encoding full-length Atg19 with an N-terminal S epitope tag, was created by amplifying the ATG19 coding region by PCR and ligating the PCR product into pET29a (Novagen), using PCR-introduced BamHI and XhoI sites.To create a centromeric plasmid encoding C-terminally tagged Atg19 under its own promoter, the triple HA epitope was PCR-amplified from plasmid GTEPI (a generous gift of Rita Miller (37Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1773-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar)) using primers designed to add an XbaI site to the N-terminal end of the epitope and a stop codon followed by a SacII site to the C-terminal end. This product was ligated to XbaI/SacII-digested pRS316 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create p316-Cfus-HA. ATG19 sequence, including 1192 bp of upstream flank and the entire open reading frame without the stop codon, was PCR-amplified from strains BB529, BB530, and BB531 (for WT, 2× mutant, and 11× mutant sequence; see “Yeast Strain Construction”) with primers designed to introduce an XhoI site at position -1192 and an XbaI site at the end of the open reading frame. These products were ligated to XhoI/XbaI-digested p316-Cfus-HA to create p316-ATG19-WT-HA, p316-ATG19-2×-HA, and p316-ATG19-11×-HA. The absence of nonsilent mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing.HIS3-marked plasmids encoding ubiquitin driven by the CUP1 promoter (with or without a Myc epitope tag) were created by subcloning the CUP1 promoter, ubiquitin open reading frame, and CYC1 terminator from YEp105 or YEp96 (generous gifts of Mark Hochstrasser (39Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) as a BamHI/ClaI fragment into pRS413 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The new plasmids are p413-Ub and p413-MycUb.Two-hybrid Screen—Two-hybrid strain PJ69-4a (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with each of the three UBP3 bait plasmids and then with yeast two-hybrid libraries Y2HL-C1, Y2HL-C2, and Y2HL-C3, provided by Phil James (35James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformations were performed using standard methods (40Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). More than 1 × 106 transformants/library were obtained with the C-terminal and full-length bait plasmids, and more than 3 × 106 transformants/library were obtained for the N-terminal bait plasmid, giving >95 and >99.9% confidence of full genomic coverage, respectively. Transformation mixtures were spread on SC plates lacking Trp, Leu, and His and allowed to incubate for 18-21 days before being replica-plated to SC plates lacking Trp, Leu, and Ade and incubated approximately 1 more week. Colonies were then picked from these plates and streaked to fresh SC plates lacking Trp, Leu, and Ade. Candidates able to form colonies in these fresh streaks were scored as Ade+. These candidates were then tested for dependence of adenine and histidine prototrophy on retention of the bait plasmid. Library plasmids were rescued from candidates showing bait-dependent adenine and histidine prototrophy, retransformed into fresh bait-carrying PJ69-4a as a final confirmation, and sequenced.GST Pull-down Assay—For induction of GST-Ubp3 or GST, a single colony of BL21 cells carrying pGEX-UBP3-N or pGEX-6P-1 was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB + 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.85. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were grown for another 2 h before being harvested and frozen at -80 °C. S-tagged Atg19 was induced similarly from BL21 (DE3) cells carrying pET29a-ATG19, except that cells were grown in LB + 100 μg/ml G418 to an A600 of ∼0.4 before induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Lysis was performed at room temperature for 15-20 min in BugBuster reagent with rLysozyme and Benzonase (Novagen) with the addition of 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Complete, EDTA-free). Lysates were clarified in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. For each binding assay, 400 μl of GST Bind Resin suspension (Novagen) was washed with bind/wash buffer (Novagen) and added to an aliquot of GST or GST-Ubp3 lysate representing 0.25 or 6.0 A600 units of induced cell culture, respectively. Less of the GST lysate than the GST-Ubp3 lysate was used in each binding assay, because GST was expressed at least 50 times more efficiently than GST-Ubp3, as assessed by Coomassie staining of the extracts (not shown). An aliquot of uninduced BL21 lysate representing ∼5.75 A600 units of cells was added to the GST binding assays to normalize total protein added. Beads and lysates were incubated together at room temperature for 30 min before the beads were spun and the supernatant was removed. An aliquot of S-tagged Atg19 lysate representing ∼0.25 A600 units of cells was then added together with an aliquot of uninduced BL21 lysate representing ∼2.25 A600 units of cells as a nonspecific competitor. Beads and lysates were again incubated together at room temperature for 30 min before the beads were spun, washed three times with 1 ml of bind/wash buffer (Novagen), and eluted with 50 μl of elution buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Eluates were separated in 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the S tag was detected using S-protein horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen) at a 1:5000 dilution.IgG Affinity Purifications/Anti-HA Immunoprecipitations—For the experiment in Fig. 2B, overnight cultures were diluted to an A600 of ∼0.1 and allowed to grow to an A600 of ∼0.3 before a 3-h induction with 100 μm CuSO4. Cells were then harvested and lysed by vortexing with glass beads in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA) with 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. Normal rabbit IgG-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) or Sigma) was added to the clarified lysates, and samples were incubated overnight, rotating, at 4 °C. The agarose beads were then pelleted and washed three times with IP wash buffer (Triton lysis buffer plus 0.1% SDS) before resuspension in one part IP wash buffer plus one part 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Resuspended samples were boiled for 5 min, chilled on ice, and loaded on a 10% acrylamide gel, with the equivalent of 2.5 A600 units of cells/lane. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and detected using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The experiment in Fig. 2C was conducted similarly, except that no CuSO4 was added to the cultures, and the equivalent of 50 A600 units of cells was loaded per lane.For the experiment in Fig. 4C, wild-type BB510 cells were transformed with pTS477 (CUP1-ProtA-ATG19 (4Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)) and YEp96, YEp105 (encoding wild-type ubiquitin without or with a Myc epitope tag, respectively), or YEp110 or YEp111 (encoding K48R mutant ubiquitin without or with a Myc tag; generous gifts of Mark Hochstrasser) (41Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to early log phase in selective medium, induced with 100 μm CuSO4 for 3.5 h, and harvested in midlog phase. Cells were lysed, and protein A-Atg19 was isolated as described above. Because expression of K48R mutant ubiquitin was consistently less than that of wild-type ubiquitin under these conditions, loadings were normalized to total Myc-ubiquitin staining of cell lysates. For the final gel shown, 3.75 A600 units of cells were loaded per lane for wild-type ubiquitin samples, and 15 A600 units were loaded for the K48R samples.FIGURE 4Lys213 and Lys216 are the ubiquitin acceptor sites on Atg19p. Low energy collision-induced dissociation spectra of tryptic peptides SELVNFFTELK213(GG)TVK (A) and TVK216(GG)QLEDVFQR (B). The y3 and y4 fragment ions observed in A and b2 and b3 fragment ions observed in B unambiguously identify the ubiquitination sites by the presence of the diglycine residue that remains attached to Lys213 (A) or Lys216 (B). C, polyubiquitin chains on Atg19p are linked by Lys48 of ubiquitin. Wild-type cells expressed protein A-tagged Atg19p and either wild-type ubiquitin (WT) or ubiquitin with a Lys to Arg mutation at position 48 (K48R), with (+) or without (-) a Myc epitope tag on ubiquitin. Cells were grown in selective medium to early log phase, and plasmid-borne ubiquitin and Atg19p expression were induced with 100 μm CuSO4 for an additional 3.5 h before harvesting in midlog phase. Protein A-Atg19p was isolated by affinity for IgG-agarose, and Myc-ubiquitin conjugates were detected by anti-Myc immunoblot. Expression of the K48R mutant ubiquitin was lower than its parallel WT construct, so loadings were normalized for total Myc-ubiquitin staining (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the experiments shown in Fig. 5, A and D, cells were grown in selective medium with induction by 100 μm CuSO4 (Fig. 5, A (left) and D) or without it (Fig. 5A (right)). Cells were lysed, and protein A-Atg19 was isolated as described above. Two A600 units of cells were used per lane in Fig. 5A (left), 30 A600 units were used in Fig. 5A (right), and 5-7.5 A600 units were used in Fig. 5D. For Fig. 5D, loadings were first normalized to protein A-Atg19 staining, and the blot was probed with Ape1p antibody to detect cargo interaction.FIGURE 5Mutation of lysine residues of Atg19p does not prevent Atg19p ubiquitination but does inhibit cargo interaction and maturation of Ape1p.A, 2× and 11× mutants of Atg19p are still ubiquitinated. Wild-type cells expressed protein A-tagged Atg19p with wild-type (WT), 2× mutant (2× mut), or 11× mutant (11× mut) sequence from one plasmid and ubiquitin either with (+) or without (-) a Myc epitope tag from a second plasmid. Both Atg19p and ubiquitin were under control of the CUP1 promoter. Cells were grown in selective medium to midlog phase in the presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of 100 μm CuSO4. Protein A-Atg19p was isolated by affinity for IgG-agarose beads, and Myc-ubiquitin was detected by anti-Myc immunoblot. B, ubiquitination is not an artifact of overexpression or of the protein A tag. atg19-Δ cells expressed ubiquitin with or without a Myc epitope tag, as in A, together with Atg19p (with WT, 2× mut, or 11× mut sequence) tagged at its C terminus with a triple HA epitope and expressed from its own promoter on a centromeric plasmid. Atg19p-HA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies conjugated to agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Ubiquitination of Atg19p is shown both by the increase in size of conjugates caused by the Myc epitope tag (left, lane 2 versus lane 1) and by the reactivity of conjugates in an anti-Myc immunoblot (right). A nonspecific background band (*) in the anti-Myc immunoblot is indicated. C, Ape1p maturation is delayed in the 2× and 11× mutants. Lysates of the cell culture"
https://openalex.org/W2079930439,"Although Erk kinase has been recently reported to function in the DNA damage response, the mechanism governing this process is unknown. We report here that hydroxyurea (HU) activates Erk via MEK1, a process that is sensitized by a constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1Q56P) and attenuated by a dominant-negative MEK1 (MEK1K97M). While ectopic MEK1Q56P sensitized HU-induced S-phase arrest, inhibition of Erk activation via U0126, PD98059, and MEK1K97M attenuated the arrest, and thereby enhanced cells to HU-induced toxicity. Taken together, we demonstrate an important contribution of Erk to the activation of the S-phase DNA damage checkpoint. This can be attributed to Erk's regulatory role in modulating ATR function. Inhibition of Erk activation with U0126/PD98059 and MEK1K97M substantially reduced HU-induced ATR nuclear foci, leading to a dramatic reduction of gammaH2AX and its nuclear foci. Reduction of MEK1 function by a small interference RNA (siRNA) MEK1 and ectopic MEK1K97M significantly decreased HU-induced gammaH2AX. Conversely, ectopic MEK1Q56P enhanced gammaH2AX foci. Furthermore, immunofluorescent and cell fractioning experiments revealed cytosolic and nuclear localization of ATR. HU treatment caused the redistribution of ATR from the cytosol to the nucleus, a process that is inhibited by U0126. Collectively, we show that Erk kinase modulates HU-initiated DNA damage response by regulating ATR function."

The predominant mechanism of regulation is the acceleration of product dissociation by a factor of ∼200 by thin filaments in the fully activated conformation (bound calcium and rigor S1) relative to the inhibited conformation (no bound calcium or rigor S1). In contrast, only 2–3-fold regulation is due to a change in actin affinity such as would be expected by “steric blocking” of the myosin binding site of the thin filament by tropomyosin. The binding of one ligand (either calcium or rigor-S1) produces partial activation of the rate of product dissociation, but the binding of both is required to maximally accelerate product dissociation to a rate similar to that obtained with F-actin in the absence of regulatory proteins. The data support an allosteric regulation model in which the binding of either calcium or rigor S1 alone to the thin filament shifts the equilibrium in favor of the active conformation, but full activation requires binding of both ligands. The regulation by calcium and rigor-bound myosin-S1 of the rate of acceleration of 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ADP (mdADP) release from myosin-mdADP-Pi by skeletal muscle thin filaments (reconstituted from actin-tropomyosin-troponin) was measured using double mixing stopped-flow fluorescence with the nucleotide substrate 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl).

The data support an allosteric regulation model in which the binding of either calcium or rigor S1 alone to the thin filament shifts the equilibrium in favor of the active conformation, but full activation requires binding of both ligands. The striated muscle thin filament, a complex of five proteins (actin, tropomyosin, and troponins I, C, and T), contains an adaptable network of interactions that responds to the association with ligands (calcium and myosin) that regulate thin filament activation of myosin ATP hydrolysis. Atomic resolution structures containing the core domains of the troponin complex in the calcium-activated state and the calcium-free state have recently been reported (1Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 2Vinogradova M.V. Stone D.B. Malanina G.G. Karatzaferi C. Cooke R. Mendelson R.A. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5038-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), but there is no high resolution structural information on ligand-induced changes that occur within a complete thin filament. Various schemes have been formulated to account for regulation. Steric blocking in its original form (3Huxley H.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 361-376Crossref Google Scholar) evoked a strict competition in which tropomyosin-troponin prevented myosin binding to actin in the absence of calcium. However, steric blocking was inconsistent with subsequent observations that the effect of calcium upon the affinity of myosin for actin during steady state ATP hydrolysis is small (4Chalovich J.M. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2432-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This problem was addressed by the three-state model (5McKillop D.F.A Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), in which the thin filament can populate three conformational states with regard to myosin binding, and the modified Hill model (6Chen Y. Yan B. Chalovich J.M. Brenner B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2338-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), in which the thin filament primarily exists in two states. The three-state model includes a blocked state in which the myosin binding site of the thin filament is completely occluded. In the closed state the thin filament can form an initial weakly bound actomyosin complex, but the binding cannot proceed to a tightly bound rigor myosin complex. In the open state the thin filament can bind myosin tightly. An integral feature of this model is that the binding of rigor myosin locks the thin filament in the open state, which fully activates product dissociation whether or not calcium is bound to the thin filament. By analogy it was proposed that myosin-ADP-Pi bound similarly to open and closed states, but acceleration of product dissociation only occurred if the thin filament was in the open conformation. Both the modified Hill and Geeves models (5McKillop D.F.A Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar,6Chen Y. Yan B. Chalovich J.M. Brenner B.

However, these myosin-ligand complexes promote an open switch II conformation of myosin (compared with the closed switch II conformation of M-ADP-Pi) (7Xu S. Offer G. Gu J. White H.D. Yu L.C.

Supporting this view are single molecule mechanical measurements which show that fast skeletal myosin complexed with ligands that produce an open switch II conformation do not produce a power stroke upon binding to actin (10Steffen W. Sleep J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12904-12909Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that the regulation of the binding of myosin to thin filaments in the open conformation may not give an accurate description of the mechanism of the regulation of thin filament accelerated product dissociation from M-ADP-Pi. adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate myosin subfragment 1 the 21-kDa alkali light chain of myosin-S1 myosin ADP-inorganic phosphate 2′,3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ATP 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ADP 3-[N-morpholino]propane-sulfonic acid tropomyosin troponin actomyosin. The approach we are taking to the problem of thin filament-based regulation is a kinetic one. To fully understand the mechanism of thin filament regulation, it is necessary to determine the effect of ligand on each step of the actomyosin MgATP hydrolysis pathway. Previously, we employed an inorganic phosphate (Pi)-sensitive fluorophore (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) in conjunction with a double-mixing stopped-flow apparatus to measure the dependence of the rate of acceleration of Pi release by reconstituted skeletal thin filaments containing none, one (either calcium or rigor myosin), or both bound ligands (12Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the first mix produces a mixture of myosin-ATP and myosin-ADP-Pi in a delay line that is followed by combination with thin filaments in the second mix (12Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The findings of this study were consistent with a mechanism in which phosphate dissociation (or a structural rearrangement that limits phosphate dissociation) is the principal step regulated by calcium and rigor myosin binding to skeletal thin filaments but a model for the regulation of the filament was not proposed. Here we have measured the regulation of the acceleration of the dissociation of the fluorescent ADP analogue, mdADP, from myosin-S1-mdADP-Pi by calcium and rigor myosin binding to the thin filament and propose a model for regulation in which both calcium and rigor myosin-S1 are required to fully activate thin filament acceleration of product dissociation. There are several aspects of an experimental procedure that use mdATP to measure the kinetics of product dissociation that are technically easier than measuring phosphate dissociation using fluorescent phosphate binding protein. In an ideal double-mixing experiment all of the ATP is rapidly bound to myosin at the end of the first mix before any of the products have dissociated. This is a good approximation in experiments where [myosin-S1] is greater than [ATP], and ATP binding is approximately pseudo-first order, but significant concentrations of unbound ATP are present in experiments where [myosin-S1] equals [ATP], and ATP binding is second order. Therefore, experiments done with [myosin-S1] equals [ATP] were not completely satisfactory because the kinetics of product dissociation could be complicated by unbound ATP and nucleotide-free S1. Specific concerns are that nucleotide-free myosin-S1 remaining after the first mix can bind to and activate the thin filament, and any unbound ATP will slowly bind to acto-S1 and be hydrolyzed to produce an additional slow phosphate signal. To measure the effect of calcium binding in the absence of rigor S1, it was, therefore, desirable to devise experimental conditions that would reduce the amount of nucleotide-free myosin and myosin-ADP at the end of the first mix. In the experiments described in this paper we have used [mdATP] greater than [myosin-S1], which will reduce the amount of free myosin at the end of the first mix. Any mdATP remaining unbound after the first mix was prevented from binding to actomyosin (and producing a fluorescent signal) after the second mix by a 1000-fold excess of MgATP (1 mm) included with the thin filaments, ensuring a single turnover measurement of product dissociation; any rigor myosin heads that were produced by product dissociation would be rapidly dissociated by the MgATP. It is thought that product dissociation from actomyosin-ADP-Pi is ordered as shown in Scheme 1, and therefore, the slower phosphate dissociation will limit the rate of ADP (or mdADP) dissociation. The fluorescence of 2′,3′-mant and 2′-deoxy-3′-mant nucleotides is increased more than 2-fold when bound to the active site of fast skeletal myosin and is the same for M-mdATP, M-mdADP-Pi, and M-mdADP (13Cremo C.R. Neuron J.M. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Woodward S.K.A Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The rate of phosphate dissociation from actomyosin-ADP-Pi has little dependence upon substituents to the 3′-OH of the ribose of the nucleotide triphosphate substrate, and therefore it was expected that the fluorescence change provided by the dissociation of mdADP from actomyosin-mdADP-Pi would provide a signal to measure the kinetics of the acceleration of product dissociation by thin filaments (15White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have chosen to use mdATP as a substrate because it supports actomyosin motility and force production in muscle at levels equal to or slightly greater than the native substrate ATP (20Regnier M. Lee D.M. Homsher E. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 3044-3058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, mdATP is a single isomer, and complex kinetics cannot be attributed to the two isomers 2′ and 3′ present in mant-ATP. In this paper we present data which show that the binding of both calcium and rigor myosin-S1 to the thin filament are required to obtain maximal activation of product release from myosin-ADP-Pi. An allosteric model is proposed that describes the activation of skeletal thin filaments by calcium and rigor myosin and correctly predicts the effect of rigor myosin-S1 upon the thin filament affinity for calcium and the effect of calcium upon the thin filament affinity for rigor myosin-S1. Materials—ATP, 2′-deoxy-ATP, buffers, and salts were purchased from Sigma. mdATP was prepared from 2′-deoxy-ATP and purified according to the procedure of Hiratsuka (16Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) for mant-ATP. Actin, myosin, troponin, and tropomyosin were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle. Tropomyosin was used as a mixture of isoforms (17Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Myosin-S1 was prepared from myosin with α-chymotrypsin by the method of Weeds and Taylor (18Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) except that 2 mg of lima bean trypsin inhibitor/mg of chymotrypsin rather than phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used to inhibit chymotrypsin. The protein was column-purified on DEAE-52 cellulose, and fractions were pooled to obtain myosin-S1 containing only the A1 light chain component. Reconstituted thin filaments were prepared from purified actin, troponin, and tropomyosin as described previously (12Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Kinetic Measurements—Steady state ATP hydrolysis was measured by colorimetric assay (19White H. D Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Reconstituted thin filaments displayed at least a 15-fold calcium sensitivity of the rates of steady state ATP hydrolysis (mole ratio of S1/actin = 1/70 to 1/120) under identical temperature and buffer conditions used for pre-steady state assays except that the ATP concentration was 1 mm. Chemical quench measurements were done using a computer-controlled stepper motor-driven quench-flow apparatus as previously described (15White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched by mixing the sample with half the volume of 1.8 m ammonium phosphate, pH 4.0. The fraction of mdATP hydrolyzed was determined by quantitative high performance liquid chromatography. A 0.1-ml sample containing 100 pmol of deoxymant nucleotide was loaded onto a Whatman Partisil column and eluted isocratically with 0.6 m ammonium phosphate, pH 4.0, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fluorescence emission was observed with a McPherson, FL-750B, fluorescence detector equipped with a 200 watt mercury-xenon lamp. Excitation was at 365 nm, and emission at >420 nm, obtained with a sharp cutoff filter, was recorded every 1 s using a Pico ADC-16 converter. The fraction of hydrolysis was determined by integration of the area of the mdATP and mdADP peaks in the elution profiles. Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed using a KinTek SF-2001 double mixing stopped-flow fluorimeter. The excitation light from a 75-watt xenon lamp was selected using a 0.125-m mono-chrometer (PTI Corp.). Kinetic measurements of mdADP dissociation were observed using an excitation at 360 nm and emission >420 nm using a sharp cutoff filter. Three to four data traces of 500 points were averaged, and the observed rate constants were obtained by fitting the data to one or two exponential terms using the software package included with the Kintek stopped-flow. In most cases two different time bases of 250 data points each were selected that were appropriate for the rate constants being observed. The Kintek stopped-flow was fitted with 2-ml syringes in positions A and B and a 5-ml syringe in position C so that both mixes were approximately equal volumes and to reduce the dilution of thin filaments in the final reaction mixture. Experiments were performed by first mixing S1A1 (dialyzed in 5 mm MOPS, pH 7) with mdATP (5 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7). The resulting steady state mixture was held in a delay line and, in a second mix, combined with thin filaments in 5 mm MOPS, 4.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (high calcium) or 0.5 mm EGTA (low calcium). The dilution of the syringe contents was 2/9 for S1 and mdATP and 5/9 for thin filaments. A Single Turnover Rapid Chemical Quench Measurement of the Hydrolysis of mdATP by Rabbit Skeletal Myosin-S1—200 μm myosin-S1 was mixed with 40 μm mdATP and quenched at the indicated time, and the fraction of mdATP hydrolyzed is shown in Fig. 1A. The rapid phase of the reaction measures the rate of substrate binding and hydrolysis, and the second slow phase measures the steady state rate (product release). The ratio of the amplitudes of the fast and slow phases provides a measure of the equilibrium constant of hydrolysis of mdATP, KH, while bound to myosin. Fig. 1B shows a plot of the dependence of the fast component upon the concentration of myosin-S1. The extrapolated value of 34 s-1 is equal to k-H + kH and can be used with the value of KH, determined from the ratio of the slow and fast phases, 4.2, to determine the values of kH to be ∼28 s-1 and k-H to be ∼6 s-1. Although the equilibrium constant is more favorable for mdATP than ATP (KH = 2.5), the rate constant of the hydrolysis step in the absence of actin, 28 s-1, is ∼2-fold slower than for ATP (70 s-1) under similar conditions. Effect of Calcium Binding to the Thin Filament on the Rate of Dissociation of mdADP from Actomyosin-mdADP-Pi with No Rigor Myosin Bound—Fig. 2A shows a record of the fluorescence decrease that is associated with mdADP dissociation in a double-mixing stopped-flow experiment in which the thin filaments had neither calcium (pCa > 7) nor rigor myosin-S1 bound. Equal volumes of 2 μm S1 and 3 μm mdATP are combined in the first mix and allowed to incubate for 1 s for the mdATP to be bound and hydrolyzed by the S1. In the second mix the S1-nucleotide complex is combined with thin filaments containing 0.5 mm EGTA to deplete the filaments of associated calcium and 1 mm MgATP to prevent binding of any mdATP not bound to myosin-S1 in the first mix and to dissociate any rigor bound myosin-S1 from the actin. The fluorescence decrease is fit well by a single exponential process in which kobs = 0.37 s-1 (Fig. 2A). With certain batches of thin filaments, a more rapid component comprising up to 20% of the total amplitude was observed, which may reflect a small population of thin filaments with defective regulation (data not shown) that were not used in this work. The dependence of the observed rate upon thin filament concentration is shown by the closed circles in Fig. 2C. The dependence of kobs upon thin filament concentration is fit by a hyperbola with a maximum of 0.68 s-1. This represents an ∼5-fold increase from the steady state ATP hydrolysis rate in the absence of actin. The extrapolated intercept at zero thin filament concentration, 0.14 s-1, is similar to the steady state rate measured by quench-flow in Fig. 1A, 0.13 s-1. We had been concerned in our previous work measuring phosphate dissociation (12Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that the observed activation of product release at low calcium and with no rigor myosin-S1 bound to the thin filament could be due to an unintended partial activation of the thin filament by a small amount of rigor S1 that either remained after the first mix or was generated by product release from M-ADP-Pi bound to the thin filaments. This possibility is essentially eliminated in these experiments because ATP contained with the thin filaments in the second mix ensures that any rigor myosin heads formed will be dissociated at a rate greater than 1000 s-1. Under conditions in which calcium is bound to the thin filament (0.3 mm CaCl2 in the flow cell), the fluorescence change from the mdADP dissociation is biphasic (Fig. 2B). The initial rapid decrease (kobs = 11.8 s-1) is followed by a slower decrease (kobs = 2.3 s-1). The dependence of the observed rates of the slow and fast components upon thin filament concentration is shown in Fig. 2C. A fit of the fast and slow components to a hyperbolic equation gives maximum rates of 18.1 s-1 (Fig. 2C, filled squares) and 2.8 s-1 (Fig. 2C, open squares) at saturating actin. These data show that the maximum rate of product dissociation at saturating thin filaments is increased ∼26-fold by calcium binding to the thin filament. The fraction of the amplitude corresponding to the fast component is that expected from the composition of the myosin nucleotide 0.81 (M-mdATP) and 0.19 (M-mdADP-Pi) before mixing to actin, which indicates that there is relatively little re-equilibration (M-mdATP ↔ M-mdADP-Pi) after mixing with the thin filaments. The acceleration of mdADP dissociation in the presence of calcium (26-fold) can be compared with previous measurements with etheno-ATP as a substrate (5–10-fold) (21Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and measurements of Pi dissociation with fluorescent phosphate-binding protein (25-fold) (12Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Effect of Rigor Myosin Head Binding to the Thin Filament upon the Rate of mdADP Dissociation from Actomyosin-mdADP-Pi—It has been known from both steady state kinetic measurements and binding studies (22Bremel R.D. Murray J.M. Weber A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 267-275Crossref Google Scholar, 23Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that thin filaments containing no bound calcium can be activated by myosin heads bound in rigor. To determine the effect of rigor heads on the rate of mdADP dissociation, excess myosin-S1 (i.e. [myosin-S1] > [mdATP]) is used in the first mix. Nucleotide-free myosin is then available for binding to thin filaments (containing either EGTA or CaCl2) in the second mix. A biphasic fluorescence decrease is observed after incubating 2 μm mdATP with 20 μm myosin-S1 in the first mix and after 1 s of mixing with thin filaments to obtain a final concentration of 22 μm thin filaments (0.3 mm EGTA) with 3.2 μm bound rigor myosin-S1 (Fig. 3A). The dependence of the observed rates upon thin filament concentration is shown in Fig. 3C. In this series of experiments, the S1 concentration was varied so as to always maintain a constant ratio of 1 rigor S1 to each 7 actin subunits after the second mix. The maximum extrapolated rates of the slow and fast components are 4.2 and 30 s-1. High calcium produces an additional enhancement of both the slow and fast phases of the phosphate dissociation from thin filaments containing bound rigor myosin (Fig. 3B). The dependence of kobs of the fast and slow phases upon thin filament concentration at a ratio of 1 rigor bound S1 per 7 thin filament actin subunits is shown, respectively, by the filled and open squares in Fig. 3C. The extrapolated rates at saturating thin filament concentrations are 8.3 and 96 s-1. The amplitude of the fast component is 78% of the total amplitude, which is within experimental error of the 81% M-ADP-Pi measured by quench-flow. This indicates that the fast component is a measurement of mdADP dissociation from M-mdADP-Pi binding to thin filaments and that the slower component is derived from M-mdATP. With unregulated actin, a maximum rate of 125 s-1 is obtained for the fast component (Fig. 4, filled squares). Thus, the rate of mdADP dissociation from M-mdADP-Pi bound to regulated actin (with both rigor S1 and calcium bound) and from unregulated actin is faster than the corresponding values obtained for phosphate dissociation, 75 s-1 (12Heeley D.H.

This is consistent with the more rapid rates of dissociation of mdADP than ADP from actomyosin-S1 (20Regnier M. Lee D.M. Homsher E. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 3044-3058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fraction of thin filament actin sites with rigor myosin-S1 bound that is required to obtain maximal activation of the thin filament was investigated by varying the ratio of myosin-S1 to actin. The dependence of the observed rates of slow and fast phases of phosphate dissociation upon the ratio of rigor myosin-S1 to thin filaments is shown in Fig. 5. These data are fit by a curve in which half-maximal activation is obtained with <1 rigor S1 bound per ∼28 actin subunits or a stoichiometry of 1 S1 per <14 actin subunits to obtain maximal activation. This compares with a measurement of 1 S1 per 10–12 actin subunits required to fully activate the thin filament at high calcium measured previously (12Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the functional regulatory unit is either longer than a single tropomyosin molecule or is composed of both sides of the thin filament. The saturation of the rate of product release upon rigor myosin-S1 concentration also indicates that the rate of rigor myosin-S1 binding to the thin filaments does not limit the rate of thin filament activation at high or low calcium concentrations. We have used double mixing stopped-flow fluorescence to investigate the regulation of thin filament activation of mdADP dissociation from actomyosin-mdADP-Pi by rigor myosin-S1 and calcium. A steady state mixture of substrate and products bound to the active site (M-mdATP and M-mdADP-Pi) was mixed with thin filaments at various stages of activation by calcium and/or rigor bound myosin heads. A summary of the maximum rates of mdADP dissociation and the actin subunit concentration required to obtain half maximal increase from the data in Figs. 2 and 3 is shown in Table 1 in bold. Data previously stained with phosphate-binding protein to measure Pi are included for comparison (12Heeley D.H. Belknap B. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The good agreement between the measured rate constants of phosphate and ADP dissociation is consistent with either a mechanism in which phosphate dissociates more slowly than ADP and the dissociation of phosphate precedes ADP dissociation or a mechanism in which a rate-limiting conformational change that occurs after M-ADP-Pi binds to actin limits the rate of dissociation of both products. However, there are some differences between the maximum rates of phosphate and mdADP dissociation. The 30% higher maximum rate of mdADP dissociation by fully activated thin filaments (with bound calcium and rigor heads) is consistent with the slightly higher rate of dissociation of mdADP from actomyosin-mdADP-Pi which is also observed in the absence of regulatory proteins in Fig. 4. Higher rates of product dissociation had been previously observed in other studies utilizing 2′-deoxy nucleotide substrates (20Regnier M. Lee D.M. Homsher E. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 3044-3058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Summary of product dissociation kinetics (Pi and mdADP) by reconstituted thin filaments and F-actin kobs(mdADP) for the maximal rate of mdADP dissociation for the slow and fast components at saturating thin filament or actin concentrations in Figs. 3 and 4 are in boldface. kobs(Pi) is for the maximal rate of Pi dissociation for the slow and fast components at saturating thin filament or actin concentrations measured with ATP as the substrate and using phosphate-binding protein to measure Pi release (12Heeley D.H.

https://openalex.org/W2008400971,"Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is a cell surface adhesion glycoprotein that plays an important role in the development and stability of nervous tissue. The homophilic binding mechanism of NCAM is still a subject of debate on account of findings that appear to support different mechanisms. This paper describes single molecule force measurements with both full-length NCAM and NCAM mutants that lack different immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. By systematically applying an external, time-dependent force to the bond, we obtained parameters that describe the energy landscape of NCAM-NCAM bonds. Histograms of the rupture forces between the full-length NCAM extracellular domains revealed two binding events, one rupturing at higher forces than the other. These bond rupture data show that the two bonds have the same dissociation rates. Despite the energetic and kinetic similarities, the bond strengths differ significantly, and are mechanically distinct. Measurements with NCAM domain deletion mutants mapped the weaker bond to the Ig1-2 segment, and the stronger bond to the Ig3 domain. Finally, the quantitative agreement between the fragment adhesion and the strengths of both NCAM bonds shows that the domain deletions considered in this study do not alter the intrinsic strengths of either of the two bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1994166319,"Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (sPNET) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) of the CNS represent a biological and clinical enigma, despite advances in both molecular techniques and clinical management for these two rare embryonal brain tumors of childhood. Epigenetic changes hold great potential as possible disease mechanisms and may be manipulated therapeutically. We thus studied aberrant methylation of the genes RASSF1A and CASP8 and its consequence on expression in cell lines and primary tumors using a combination of semiquantitative methylation specific PCR (MSP), bisulfite sequencing and RT–PCR. In all, 17 samples of autopsy-derived normal appearing brain served as controls. Opposed to control tissues 19/24 sPNET and 4/6 AT/RT demonstrated aberrant methylation for the RASSF1A promoter region. Treatment of cell lines using 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5AZA) alone or in combination with trichostatin A (TSA) succeeded in re-establishing expression of RASSF1A in cell lines derived from a renal rhabdoid, an AT/RT and a medulloblastoma. A 5′ CpG-rich region of CASP8 was methylated in normal tissues and in tumors. However, CASP8 showed inconsistent expression patterns in normal and tumor tissues. Our results indicate that aberrant methylation of the RASSF1A promoter region may be of importance in the origin and progression of sPNET and AT/RT while the analysed 5′-CpG rich region of the CASP8 gene does not seem to play an important role in these tumors. Further studies of epigenetic changes in these rare tumors are warranted as their biology remains obscure and treatment efforts have been rather unsuccessfull."

We discuss the probable relationship between E3 activity and the conserved Trp. The RING finger motif, found in many functionally distinct proteins, was first identified as the protein product of the human gene RING1 (Really Interesting New Gene 1) (1Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). The RING finger motif is defined by the consensus sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X9-39-Cys-X1-3-His-X2-3-(Cys/His)-X2-Cys-X4-48-Cys-X2-Cys, where X is any amino acid and the number of X residues varies in different fingers. Two types of RING finger motifs are distinguished by a cysteine (RING-HC) or histidine (RING-H2) as the fifth metal-chelating residue. A RING finger typically binds two zinc atoms, with its Cys and/or His side chains in a unique “cross-brace” arrangement. The nearly invariant spacing between the second and third pairs of Cys/His residues probably conserves the distance between the two metal-chelating sites (2Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). RING fingers are commonly found in proteins that are involved in cell growth and differentiation (3Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemond P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Some RING fingers may be required for protein association, e.g. homo- or heterodimerization, whereas others are needed for ubiquitination (4Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 5Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-R87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G.

The ubiquitination product is an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl of ubiquitin (Gly76) and a substrate lysine ϵ-amino group. Ubiquitination requires three sequential enzymatic reactions: (i) a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 2The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseMBPmaltose-binding proteinOsO. sativaTrxthioredoxinHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlation.2The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseMBPmaltose-binding proteinOsO. sativaTrxthioredoxinHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlation. forms a thiol ester between one of its cysteines and the ubiquitin Gly76 carboxyl; (ii) then a conjugating enzyme (ubiquitin carrier protein (E2)) transiently carries the ubiquitin (as a thiol ester); and (iii) a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) helps to transfer the activated ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate Lys. Generally, eukaryotic cells contain a single type of E1, multiple types of E2, and many different E3 enzymes. Efficient and targeted ubiquitination depends on E3. All known E3 enzymes have one of two E2-binding domains: the RING finger domain or the HECT domain (7Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar).

These structures all have a groove formed by the first zinc-binding loop (N-loop; Cys134-Cys137 of the E3 EL5), the second zinc-binding loop (C-loop; Cys172-Cys175 of EL5), and the central α-helix (Cys161-Leu166 of EL5) that is the site for E2/E3 binding.EL5 is a rice RING-H2 finger protein of 325 amino acids, is structurally related to the Arabidopsis ATL family of RING-H2 finger proteins, and is rapidly induced when rice cells are exposed to N-acetylchito-oligosaccharides (17Takai R. Hasegawa K. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Minami E. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ATL family RING-H2 finger proteins each have a transmembrane domain, a basic domain, a conserved domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain that is upstream of a non-conserved C-terminal region (18Martinez-Garcia M. Garciduenas-Pina C. Guzman P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 587-596PubMed Google Scholar). Although some ATL family members resemble EL5 as they are also induced during the early stages of a defense response (19Salinas-Mondragon R.E. Garciduenas-Pina C.G. Guzman P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), their biological functions are not well characterized. We have shown that maltose-binding protein (MBP)-EL5 RING-H2 finger fusion constructs are polyubiquitinated in vitro when ubiquitin, recombinant mouse E1, and human UbcH4/5A (E2) or rice Oryza sativa (Os) UBC5a/b (E2) are incubated together (20Takai R. Matsuda N. Nakano A. Hasegawa K. Akimoto C. Shibuya N. Minami E. Plant J. 2002; 30: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the EL5 RING-H2 finger domain (residues 129-181) is sufficient for E3-type activity when OsUBC5b is present. Furthermore, an EL5 RING-H2 finger/OsUBC5b NMR titration experiment detected altered environments for certain RING-H2 finger amide groups (8Katoh S. Hong C. Tsunoda Y. Murata K. Takai R. Minami E. Yamazaki T. Katoh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15341-15348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The chemical shift changes indicate direct contact between the RING finger and OsUBC5b as well as conformational changes for certain RING-H2 finger residues.To identify unambiguously the specific residues involved in OsUBC5b recognition, we prepared recombinant mutant EL5 RING-H2 fingers each containing a single amino acid substitution and tested them for ubiquitination activity in vitro. All of these residues are near or in a shallow groove that binds OsUBC5b. We also classified rice RING finger proteins according to type, i.e. RING-H2 and RING-HC, and according to the presence or absence of a Trp homologous to Trp165 of EL5. We then assayed certain members of each category for ubiquitination activity in the presence of OsUBC5b, a UBC4/5-type E2, and, based on our results, concluded that a Trp homologous to EL5 Trp165 is one of the most important recognition features necessary for the activity of a RING-H2 finger·OsUBC5b complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Mutagenesis of Recombinant MBP-EL5 Fusion Proteins—The nucleotide sequence for residues 96-181 of EL5 was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CGAATTCGGAGGAGGGGTCGACCCG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAATCCGGACATGCGC-3′. The full-length PCR product was purified by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and isolated using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). The purified PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and then inserted at the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). As a negative control, pMAL-c2X was digested with EcoRI and treated with Klenow fragment (TaKaRa) to produce blunt ends and then self-ligated. The genes for the mutants of the wild-type fusion protein (MBP-EL5-(96-181)) were created by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using pMAL-c2X-EL5-(96-181) as the template. Mutagenic primers contained the following codon changes: V136A, GTG → GCG; L138A, CTC → GCG; R148A, AGG → GCG; C153A, TGC → GCG; E160A, GAG → GCG; V162A, GTC → GCG; V162W, GTC → TGG; D163A, GAC → GCG; M164A, ATG → GCG; W165A, TGG → GCG; W165I, TGG → ATC; L166A, CTC → GCG; T171A, ACC → GCG; L174A, CTC → GCG; R176A, CGC → GCG; R176D, CGC → GAC; and V162W/W165A, GTCGACATGTGG → TGGGACATGGCG. The sequences of all PCR constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Purification of Recombinant MBP-EL5 Fusion Proteins—Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells that were first grown to OD600 nm < 0.5, then induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration), and finally cultured for an additional 3 h all at 37 °C in 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Centrifuged bacterial pellets were suspended in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.2 m NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (column buffer) and then sonicated. The lysates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were applied to an amylose resin affinity column (New England Biolabs). After unbound proteins were eluted in column buffer, MBP fusion proteins were eluted in column buffer containing 10 mm maltose.Cloning and Purification of Recombinant OsUBC5b—The recombinant OsUBC5b gene, prepared for this study, is a fusion construct with an upstream thioredoxin (Trx)-His6 sequence. The OsUBC5b nucleotide sequence was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-TTCCATGGCGTCCAGCGGATCCTCAAG-3′ and 5′-AACTCGAGCTAGCCCATAGCATATTTCTGGGT-3′. The purified PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and then inserted into pET-32a (Novagen). BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with this expression vector. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). After 3 h, the bacterial cultures were centrifuged, and the pellets were frozen.To purify the OsUBC5b fusion construct, a frozen pellet was first thawed on ice, resuspended in 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) and 0.5 m NaCl, and sonicated. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) to which nickel was bound (nickel-chelating column). After washing the column with 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) and 0.5 m NaCl, protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m imidazole in 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) and 0.5 m NaCl. Protein fractions were pooled, concentrated, and then applied to HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) and 0.1 m NaCl. The Trx-His6 tag was removed from the Superdex-purified protein by thrombin (Novagen) proteolysis (28 units of thrombin/∼13 mg of protein) at 37 °C for 12 h, after which the solution was applied to a nickel-chelating column. To ensure that no residual tag remained, the protein in the flow-through fraction was further digested with enterokinase (130 units/5 mg of protein; Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 16 h. The solution was then applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column. Purified OsUBC5b was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated using a Centricon spin dialysis tube (10-kDa cutoff; Millipore Corp.).Cloning and Purification of Recombinant 15N-Labled EL5-(129-181) Mutants C153A and W165A—The EL5-(129-181) mutants C153A and W165A were cloned as upstream Trx-His6-tagged nucleotide sequences into pET-32a. EL5-(129-181) mutant DNA fragments were amplified as described previously (8Katoh S. Hong C. Tsunoda Y. Murata K. Takai R. Minami E. Yamazaki T. Katoh E. J. Biol.

The purified PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into pET-32a, and the vector was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium plus 15N-labeled NH4Cl and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration), and 100 μm ZnSO4 (final concentration) was added at the same time. After 3 h, the cultures were centrifuged, and the pellets were frozen.The Trx-His6-EL5-(129-181) mutants were purified using procedures similar to those used for 15N-labeled EL5-(129-181) (8Katoh S.

Frozen pellets were thawed on ice; suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol; and sonicated. The solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-chelating column. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 15 mm imidazole, and bound protein was eluted in the same buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. Pooled protein fractions were concentrated and applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. To remove the Trx-His6 tag, proteins were incubated with enterokinase (75 units/31.5 mg of protein) at 37 °C for 16 h. Each solution was applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column. The recovered protein solutions were diluted 5-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 μm ZnSO4, and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Recovered proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (which was the buffer used for NMR experiments) and concentrated using a Centricon spin dialysis tube (3-kDa cutoff).Construction and Purification of Recombinant MBP Fusion Proteins Containing Various RING Finger Domains—cDNA fragments coding for a variety of RING finger domains were PCR-amplified with appropriate primers. PCR fragments were digested at EcoRI and BamHI sites and ligated to EcoRI/BamHI-digested pMAL-c2X vectors, which allowed for expression of upstream MBP fusion constructs. PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and after culture, the recombinant proteins were purified by amylose resin affinity column chromatography as described above for the MBP-EL5-(96-181) mutants.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Ubiquitination reactions were performed in 75-μl solutions containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 300 ng/μl bovine ubiquitin (Sigma), 50 ng of recombinant mouse E1, 100 ng of OsUBC5b, and 400 ng of one of the MBP-RING fingers. Reactions proceeded for 1 h at 30 °C and were stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling the samples for 5 min, proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs).NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were recorded at 35 °C using a Bruker DMX750 or AV500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm inverse triple-resonance probe head with three-axis gradient coils. All spectra were processed using NMRPipe software (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11386) Google Scholar). The 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts were referenced to HDO (4.68 ppm at 35 °C), indirectly to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionate (13C) (23Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn.

Previously, we found that the amide NMR signals of seven EL5-(121-181) residues (Val136, Cys137, Ala147, Arg148, Glu160, Thr171, and Leu174) were significantly perturbed when EL5 bound OsUBC5b. The amide signals of five other residues (Leu138, Val162, Asp163, Met164, and Trp165) were so broadened that they were not detectable. This phenomenon probably reflects an intermediary exchange rate for the free and protein-bound amide protons of those residues compared with the chemical shift time scale. The residues with chemical shift perturbations >0.15 ppm (with perturbation defined as |Δδ| = |Δδ1HN| + 0.1|Δδ15N|) and those for which the resonances disappeared entirely (8Katoh S. Hong C.

These residues are all located on the side of the molecule, which embodies the E2-binding surface. The location of this binding site parallels that of the c-Cbl RING finger-binding site (15Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Although the amide signal of EL5 Arg176 does not change position or broaden upon complex formation (8Katoh S. Hong C. Tsunoda Y. Murata K. Takai R. Minami E. Yamazaki T. Katoh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15341-15348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we also prepared R176A and R176D mutants for the ubiquitination assay because a basic residue is often found in other E3 RING finger domains at the homologous position (Fig. 1A), and based on conformity with the crystal complex of c-Cbl·UbcH7 (15Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), Arg176 may interact with OsUBC5b. Thirteen mutants (V136A, L138A, R148A, E160A, V162A, D163A, M164A, W165A, L166A, T171A, L174A, R176A, and R176D) were prepared for the ubiquitination assay. The C153A mutant served as a negative control because it was not expected to chelate zinc, which should consequently disrupt the protein fold. The side chains of the mutated residues are displayed on an EL5 RING-H2 finger ribbon diagram (Fig. 1C).The effects of the mutations were monitored by a ubiquitination assay using the recombinant MBP-EL5-(96-181) mutants, OsUBC5b, and mouse E1 (Fig. 2, A-C). We observed three distinguishable results. (i) Mutations V136A, W165A, L166A, R176A, R176D, and C153A completely abolished ubiquitination (Fig. 2A); (ii) Mutations L138A, R148A, V162A, D163A, and L174A significantly decreased ubiquitination (Fig. 2B); and (iii) mutations E160A, M164A, and T171A did not affect ubiquitination (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2EL5 RING-H2 finger domain catalyzes auto-ubiquitination in vitro. The ubiquitination assay for MBP, MBP-EL5-(129-181), and its mutants is described under “Materials and Methods.” Protein bands with molecular masses greater than those of the fusion protein substrates are ubiquitinated.

C153A, which cannot chelate zinc, lost ubiquitination activity because it cannot fold properly, as will be discussed below. Three of the five aforementioned residues (Val136, Trp165, and Leu166) form the hydrophobic and shallow groove in EL5 (8Katoh S. Hong C. Tsunoda Y. Murata K. Takai R. Minami E. Yamazaki T. Katoh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15341-15348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), as was also found for c-Cbl (15Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Of special note is Trp165, which is at the center of the hydrophobic groove that defines the OsUBC5b-binding site. For c-Cbl, the homologous Trp is required for E3 activity (25Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H.-K. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.-C Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Additionally, because the R176A and R176D mutants are inactive, an electrostatic interaction must also be important for ubiquitination. Val136, Leu138, Val162, Asp163, and Leu174 are spatially near the residues that are essential for E3 activity. Val136 and Leu138 are located at and next to the N-loop, respectively; Val162, Asp163, Trp165, and Leu166 are part of the central α-helix; and Leu174 and Arg176 are located in the C-loop. Therefore, these residues directly contact OsUBC5b.Although the amide resonances of Glu160, Met164, and Thr171 shift significantly when the EL5 RING-H2 finger interacts with OsUBC5b (8Katoh S. Hong C. Tsunoda Y. Murata K. Takai R. Minami E. Yamazaki T. Katoh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15341-15348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), mutation of these residues did not affect ubiquitination. Therefore, the NMR titration experiment detected not only those residues in direct contact with OsUBC5b, but also nearby neighboring residues whose spatial orientations might have been altered upon binding.Ubiquitination is therefore abolished by mutation of residues that contact OsUBC5b directly or when proper folding of the RING finger is prevented, as we demonstrated previously when zinc was removed from the EL5 RING-H2 finger (8Katoh S.

To establish whether the EL5 RING-H2 finger mutants C153A and W165A were inactive because they were not folded correctly, we recorded their 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectra and compared the spectra with that of the wildtype RING finger. The 1H-15N HSQC NMR signals of the wild-type RING finger spectrum are well dispersed, which is a hallmark of a well defined molecular structure (Fig. 3A); but the 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum of C153A does not have the characteristic chemical shift dispersion of a folded protein (Fig. 3B), which correlates with the loss of activity (Fig. 2A). Conversely, the 1H-15N HSQC NMR signals of the W165A mutant are as dispersed as those of the wild-type RING finger (Fig. 3C). This mutant has a native fold, but is incapable of ubiquitination (Fig. 2A), which suggests that Trp165 interacts functionally with OsUBC5b.FIGURE 31H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of EL5-(129-181) and its mutants.

Notably, Trp165 (located at the center of the hydrophobic groove) is well conserved in other E3 RING fingers, including those of c-Cbl, Rma1 (26Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Hrd1 (27Kikkert M. Doolmen R. Dai M. Avner R. Hassink G. van Voorden S. Thanedar S. Roitelman J. Chau V. Wiertz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3525-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that CNOT4, a C4C4 RING finger protein, is an E3 (28Albert T.K. Hanzawa H. Legtenberg Y.I. de Ruwe M.J. van den Heuvel F.A. Collart M.A. Boelens R. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The shallow hydrophobic groove of CNOT4, which interacts with UbcH5B, is reminiscent of the EL5 and c-Cbl grooves. However, although the Trp residues in the EL5 and c-Cbl grooves are at identical positions, for the CNOT4 RING finger, an Ile is found at the position homologous to EL5 Trp165, and a tryptophan is found at the position homologous to EL5 Val162 (Fig. 4A). The EL5 Trp165 and Val162 side chains are displayed on a ribbon structure of the EL5 RING-H2 finger in Fig. 4B. Note that the side chains of both residues point in the same direction. To investigate the importance of Trp165 and its positional effect on ubiquitination, we prepared the EL5 RING-H2 finger mutants V162A, V162W, W165A, W165I, and V162W/W165A. Mutants W165A (Fig. 4C, lanes 9 and 10) and W165I (lanes 11 and 12), which lack a Trp, are inactive. Conversely, the mutants with a Trp in the central α-helix, such as V162A (Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 6), V162W (lanes 7 and 8), and V162W/W165A (lanes 13 and 14), are active, although the V162W mutant is nearly inactive, perhaps because of a steric clash between the two Trp residues. Notably, V162W/W165A is active even though the Trp is displaced one turn along the central α-helix. The 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum of the V162W/W165A RING-H2 finger indicates that the mutant folds correctly (data not shown). Therefore, it is probable that a Trp in the interior of the hydrophobic groove is necessary for ubiquitination activity.FIGURE 4A, amino acid sequence alignment of the EL5 RING-H2 and CNOT4 RING fingers.

AHSP has been proposed as a candidate gene in some Heinz body hemolytic anemias and as a modifier gene in the β-thalassemia syndromes. To gain additional insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the erythroid-specific expression of the AHSP gene and provide the necessary tools for further genetic studies of these disorders, we have initiated identification and characterization of the regulatory elements controlling the human AHSP gene. We mapped the 5′-end of the AHSP erythroid cDNA and cloned the 5′-flanking genomic DNA containing the putative AHSP gene promoter. In vitro studies using transfection of promoter/reporter plasmids in human tissue culture cell lines, DNase I footprinting analyses and gel mobility shift assays, identified an AHSP gene erythroid promoter with functionally important binding sites for GATA-1- and Oct-1-related proteins. In transgenic mice, a reporter gene directed by a minimal human AHSP promoter was expressed in bone marrow, spleen, and reticulocytes, but not in nonerythroid tissues. In vivo studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated hyperacetylation of the promoter region and occupancy by GATA-1.

Interaction with AHSP inhibits reactive oxygen species production from α-hemoglobin and prevents the precipitation of highly unstable, cytotoxic free α-globin chains, which aggregate in erythroid precursors, damaging the membrane and triggering cell death (5Kong Y.

Decreased or defective AHSP would be expected to worsen the phenotype of β-thalassemia because of the cytotoxic effects of excessive free α-hemoglobin. In a murine model, AHSP deficiency leads to well-compensated hemolysis with Heinz body formation, reticulocytosis, and increased apoptosis of erythroid precursors (5Kong Y. Zhou S. Kihm A.J.

When AHSP-deficient mice were bred to β-thalassemia mice, loss of AHSP increased the severity of the thalassemia (5Kong Y. Zhou S. Kihm A.J. Katein A.M. Yu X. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Adachi K.

These studies also suggested that AHSP might play a role in unexplained Heinz body hemolytic anemia in humans. Identification and characterization of the regulatory elements that control AHSP gene expression have important implications for normal erythropoiesis and the pathogenesis of hemolytic disorders. AHSP may have therapeutic potential for β-thalassemia patients by decreasing α-globin precipitation and ameliorating clinical severity. Because AHSP is synthesized abundantly in erythroid cells, identification of the regulatory elements directing this high level, tissue-specific expression may provide important tools in directing other erythroid-specific genes in gene transfer applications. AHSP is a highly expressed and erythroid-specific protein (1Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J.

In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of the human AHSP gene promoter. Our results demonstrate that the AHSP gene promoter requires GATA-1- and Oct-1-binding proteins to direct high level expression in erythroid cells in vitro. The minimal promoter, -170 to +269, includes the 5′-flanking DNA and intron 1. In transgenic mice, a reporter gene directed by the AHSP minimal promoter directed expression exclusively in erythroid cells. The results demonstrate that the region from -170 to +269 contains the sequences necessary for expression in erythroid cells and that this expression is dependent on GATA-1.

Ribonuclease Protection Analysis of Transgene Expression—Expression of the human promoter/Aγ-globin reporter transgene was analyzed using an RNase protection assay (RPA). Probe synthesis, hybridization, electrophoresis, autoradiography, and analyses were performed as described (12Gallagher P.G. Sabatino D.E. Romana M. Cline A.P. Garrett L.J. Bodine D.M. Forget B.G. J.

Expression of Human γ-Globin Protein in the Erythrocytes of Transgenic Mice—Detection and measurement of γ-globin protein in red blood cells was performed as described (15Gallagher P.G. Sabatino D.E.

Cloning of Chromosomal Gene Isolation and Analysis of Recombinant Clones—The PCR-based screening of the human genomic BAC library yielded one PCR-positive clone ∼130 kb in length. DNA fragments that amplified with the screening primer pair were purified and subcloned into plasmid vectors. Restriction enzyme analysis, Southern blotting, and limited nucleotide sequencing identified the DNA fragments as AHSP gene-specific. Comparison of cDNA and genomic DNA sequences allowed determination of the genomic structure of the AHSP gene, a three exon gene spread over ∼1 kb of DNA. The entire first exon and the 3′-end of the third exon contain untranslated sequence. The ag:gt rule is not violated at any splice junction. Mapping the Human AHSP Erythroid mRNA Transcription Initiation Site and Identification of 5′-cDNA Sequences—To identify the 5′-end of the human AHSP cDNA, primer extension was performed using total RNA from K562 and HeLa cells. These experiments identified a single transcription initiation site in erythroid cells (Fig. 1B) and predicted the presence of an additional 32 bp in the mRNA upstream of the 5′-end of the previously reported sequence obtained from cDNA cloning. These additional 32 bp of upstream 5′-untranslated sequence were obtained by 5′-RACE. Sequences obtained by 5′-RACE were verified by comparison to corresponding genomic DNA sequences (Fig. 1C). The sequences around the transcription start site, ACA+1CTTG closely match transcription initiation recognition sequences, YYA+1NWYY (17Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The first ATG is in exon 2; no ATGs are present in the 5′-untranslated sequences. Taken together, these data suggest that this sequence is at or very near the 5′-end of the human AHSP erythroid cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking genomic DNA upstream of the human AHSP cDNA transcription start site is shown in Fig. 3. Consensus TATA or CCAAT sequences are absent. Characteristic of an erythroid gene promoter, multiple consensus binding sequences for GATA-1 and a single Sp1/CACCC site are present. An AHSP Gene Promoter Fragment Is Active in Erythroid Cells—Plasmids containing 5′-flanking putative AHSP promoter sequences linked to a luciferase reporter gene were transiently transfected into K562 cells. Relative luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection and compared with the activity obtained with pGL2B, a negative control, the promoterless plasmid, and pGL2P, a positive control, the luciferase reporter gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. Three AHSP promoter fragments, -904/+32, -479/+32, and -170/+32, directed modest levels of luciferase activity over background compared with the control SV40 promoter plasmid (Fig. 2A). Similar to the human α-spectrin gene, GATA-1, and the erythropoietin receptor, where the addition of intron 1 sequences markedly increase promoter strength (14Boulanger L. Sabatino D.E. Wong E.Y. Cline A.P. Garrett L.J. Garbarz M. Dhermy D. Bodine D.M. Gallagher P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41563-41570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the addition of intron 1 would increase AHSP promoter expression. 234 bp of contiguous sequence encoding the 5′-untranslated region and intron 1 were added to each promoter fragment upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Fragments -904/+269, 479/+269, and -170/+269 all directed higher levels of luciferase activity in transfected K562 cells (Fig. 2A). When transiently transfected into HeLa cells, none of the AHSP promoter reporter plasmids directed significant levels of luciferase expression (Fig. 2A). The AHSP Erythroid Promoter Contains Binding Sites for GATA-1 and Oct-1 Proteins—To identify binding sites for transcription factors within the core AHSP promoter, DNase I footprinting analysis of the -170/+269 region with nuclear extracts from K562 cells was performed (Fig. 3A). Protected regions at -98 to -104 (5′-flanking) and +238 to +250 (intron 1) were identified, corresponding to consensus binding sequences for GATA-1 and Oct-1 proteins, respectively. To determine if nuclear proteins could bind the footprinted GATA-1 site at -98 to -104 in the AHSP gene promoter in vitro, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing the corresponding AHSP promoter or control GATA-1 sequences (TABLE ONE) (18Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were prepared and used EMSA with K562 (erythroid) extracts. The AHSP GATA-1 probe yielded a single complex that migrated identically to a complex formed with a control GATA-1 probe. These complexes were effectively competed both by an excess of unlabeled AHSP GATA-1 oligonucleotide, an excess of unlabeled control GATA-1 oligonucleotide, and a monoclonal antibody against GATA-1 protein (Fig. 3B). When a double-stranded oligonucleotide with mutation of the AHSP GATA-1 consensus sequence (GATA to GTTA) (19Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The AHSP Oct-1 probe yielded a large complex on EMSA (Fig. 4) that migrated at the same location as a complex obtained with a control Oct-1 probe. Both AHSP and control Oct-1 complexes were effectively competed by an excess of unlabeled AHSP Oct-1 oligonucleotide, unlabeled control Oct-1 oligonucleotide, and Oct-1 antiserum (Fig. 4).

These data indicate that Oct-1-binding proteins bind in vitro to the AHSP gene promoter. GATA-1 and Oct-1 Are Major Activators of the Human Erythroid AHSP Gene Promoter—To assess the relative importance of the -98 to -104 GATA-1 and +238 to +250 Oct-1 transcription factor binding sites in promoter function, mutations were introduced into these sites individually and in combination in the minimal -170/+269 AHSP promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid. Wild-type and mutant plasmids were transiently transfected into K562 cells and luciferase activity assayed after 24 h (Fig. 2B). Mutation of the GATA-1 consensus sequence (site 1, GATA to GTTA) (19Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10638-10641Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) decreased luciferase activity by 33% compared with wild type. Mutation of the Oct-1 site in intron 1 (ATGTAAAT to CTGCAACC) (20Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 2-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reduced promoter activity by 60%. Mutation of both the GATA-1 site and the Oct-1 site reduced promoter activity to background. Transactivation of the AHSP Gene Promoter by GATA-1 in Heterologous Cells—The -170/+269 human AHSP gene minimal promoter luciferase plasmid was transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Luciferase activity was identical to background (Fig. 5). Cotransfection of 1 μg of this AHSP gene promoter plasmid with increasing amounts of a GATA-1 cDNA expression plasmid (22Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) resulted in increasing luciferase activity with increasing amounts of GATA-1 plasmid (Fig. 5). However, cotransfection of 1 μg of the -170/+269 AHSP gene promoter plasmid with increasing amounts of an Oct-1 cDNA expression plasmid (IMAGE 4622256 in pcDNA3) did not result in any change in luciferase activity with increasing amounts of Oct-1 plasmid (Fig. 5). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis of the Minimal Promoter Region—Histone modifications within the minimal promoter region of the AHSP gene were examined using a ChIP assay with anti-diacetyl histone H3 and anti-tetraacetyl histone H4 antibodies (23Wong E.Y. Lin J. Forget B.G. Bodine D.M. Gallagher P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55024-55033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Johnson K.D. Bresnick E.H.

The core histones H3 and H4 were hyperacetylated in this region in chromatin from K562 cells (Fig. 6A) relative to the necdin gene. Because the AHSP gene 5′-flanking region was hyperacetylated in erythroid cells and it contains a functional GATA-1 binding site, we performed ChIP using anti-GATA-1 and the same PCR primers as above (Fig. 6B). These studies demonstrated that GATA-1 occupied the 5′-flanking region of the AHSP in chromatin from erythroid (K562) cells in vivo. Transgenic Mice Express the AHSP/Aγ-Globin Transgene in Erythroid Cells—We created five lines of transgenic mice containing 1–11 copies of the minimal -170/+269 AHSP promoter fused to the human Aγ-globin gene (Fig. 7A). Using our previously described dual riboprobe that detects exon 2 of the human γ-globin gene and exon 2 of the murine α-globin gene (Fig. 7A), we directly compared the level of human Aγ-globin and murine α-globin mRNA levels in tissues from transgenic animals by RNase protection. All five AHSP/Aγ-globin transgenic lines expressed γ-globin mRNA in adult reticulocytes (TABLE TWO and Fig. 7B). The mean level of Aγ-globin compared with the level of murine α-globin mRNA was ∼0.046 ± 0.5. There was no correlation between transgene copy number and mRNA level, indicating the level of transgene mRNA was influenced by position effects.TABLE TWOExpression of Aγ-globin in transgenic miceTransgenic lineTransgene copy numberγ-Globin mRNA/murine α-globin mRNAγ-Globin mRNA/murine α-globin mRNA per copyUniform or variegated γ-globin protein expression in erythrocytesA110.487 ± 0.0160.043VariegatedB30.066 ± 0.0030.022UniformC90.049 ± 0.0030.005N/AaExpression too low to detectD60.124 ± 0.0020.021VariegatedE10.14 ± 0.0090.14UniformAverage0.0462 ± 0.005br2 = 0.32, p = not significanta Expression too low to detectb r2 = 0.32, p = not significant Open table in a new tab To determine the distribution of human γ-globin protein in the red cells of transgenic animals, an anti-human γ-globin monoclonal antibody was used in fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. The pattern of γ-globin expression in erythrocytes of two transgenic lines was uniform, i.e. present in 100% of cells (TABLE THREE, Fig. 7C) In two other transgenic lines, human γ-globin expression was variegated. In the fifth line, expression was too low for accurate analyses.TABLE THREEPattern of γ-globin mRNA expression in tissues of AHSP/Aγ-globin transgenic miceTransgenic line (copy no.)Tissueγ-Globin mRNA/murine α-globin mRNAγ-Globin mRNA/murine α-globin mRNA per copyLine B (3)Marrow0.082 ± 0.0030.027Spleen0.064 ± 0.0070.022BrainNo expressionHeartNo expressionKidneyNo expressionSkeletal muscleNo expressionLiverNo expressionLungNo expressionThymusNo expressionLine E (1)Marrow0.13 ± 0.0050.13Spleen0.19 + 0.0100.19BrainNo expressionHeartNo expressionKidneyNo expressionSkeletal muscleNo expressionLiverNo expressionLungNo expressionThymusNo expression Open table in a new tab The level of transgene expression was examined in tissues of mice from two transgenic lines perfused with saline immediately prior to sacrificing. RNase protection detected γ-globin mRNA only in reticulocytes, adult bone marrow, and spleen but not in nonerythroid tissues (TABLE THREE). There are numerous consensus GATA-1 binding sites in the AHSP gene, including 5 in the minimal -170/+269 promoter region, 3 in the 5′-flanking region and 2 in intron 1. In the AHSP minimal promoter, the functionally important GATA-1 site at -98 to -104 and a second site at -47 to -52 are conserved between mouse and man. The -47 to -52 GATA-1 site was not protected in in vitro footprinting (Fig. 3) and did not bind GATA-1 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (not shown). Transactivation of the AHSP promoter by GATA-1 in nonerythroid cells is consistent with the observation that AHSP is induced by GATA-1. The second region protected in DNase I footprinting corresponded to an Oct-1 consensus site in the AT-rich region of AHSP intron 1. EMSA and transfection assays demonstrated the functional importance of Oct-1 in vitro. Oct-1 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the POU domain family of transcription factors known to regulate numerous tissue-specific and ubiquitous genes as transcriptional activators or repressors (20Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 2-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recent gene ablation studies have demonstrated a critical role for Oct-1 in embryonic development and erythropoiesis (26Wang V.E. Schmidt T. Chen J. Sharp P.A. Tantin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). E12.5 fetal livers from Oct-1-deficient embryos demonstrated decreased numbers of TER-119-positive cells and decreased amounts of β-globin mRNA in erythroid cells. The minimal AHSP promoter utilized in the transgenic mouse studies demonstrated that it contains the sequences necessary for erythroid-specific expression of AHSP. However, the lack of correlation between transgene mRNA levels and transgene copy number and the variegated expression seen in some lines suggesting that additional elements are necessary for authentic expression of the AHSP gene. AHSP deficiency worsened the phenotype in β-thalassemic mice, leading to the suggestion that AHSP could be a modifier gene influencing the phenotype of human β-thalassemia syndromes (1Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 6Luzzatto L. Notaro R. Nature. 2002; 417: 703-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which are marked by clinical heterogeneity (27Thein S.L. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 124: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In a study of 120 thalassemia patients with hemoglobin E-thalassemia of varying clinical severity from Thailand, no mutations were identified in the exons of the AHSP gene or in the 5′-flanking DNA (28Viprakasit V. Tanphaichitr V.S. Chinchang W. Sangkla P. Weiss M.J. Higgs D.R. Blood. 2004; 103: 3296-329944Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar results were found in a population of β-thalassemic patients from Italy (29Cappellini M.D. Refaldi C. Bignamini D. Zanaboni L. Fiorelli G. Blood. 2004; 104: 24bCrossref Google Scholar). However, in separate preliminary reports (30Galanello R. Perseu L. Giagu N. Sole G. Perra C. Blood. 2004; 104 (suppl.): 516aCrossref Google Scholar, 4Lai M.I. Menzel S. Jiang J. Weiss M.J. Thein S.L. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2005; 34: 99Google Scholar), thalassemic patients with discordant phenotypes were found to have decreased AHSP mRNA expression in reticulocytes and cultured erythroid precursors as determined by real-time, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In one discordant thalassemic patient with decreased reticulocyte AHSP mRNA, reduced amounts of AHSP protein were observed in reticulocytes and cultured erythroid cells (4Lai M.I. Menzel S. Jiang J. Weiss M.J. Thein S.L. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2005; 34: 99Google Scholar). Similar to the β-globin gene mutations causing thalassemia, it is possible that there are genetic differences at the AHSP locus, or in genetic or epigenetic regulators, that influence AHSP gene expression. We suggest that the -170/+269 region be examined in thalassemia patients with varying severity, especially those with decreased AHSP."
https://openalex.org/W2142646850,"The goal of this study was to further explore potential mechanisms through which diabetogenic dietary conditions that result in promotion of insulin resistance (IR), a feature of non-insulin dependant diabetes mellitus (type-2 diabetes), may influence Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using genome-wide array technology, we found that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a gene product described previously for its involvement in diabetic fibrosis, is elevated in brain tissue in an established mouse model of diet-induced IR. With this evidence we continued to explore the regulation of CTGF in postmortem AD brain tissue and found that CTGF expression correlated with the progression of AD clinical dementia and amyloid neuritic plaque (NP) neuropathology, but not neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) deposition. Consistent with this evidence, we also found that exposure of Tg2576 mice (a model AD-type amyloid neuropathology) to a diabetogenic diet that promotes IR results in a ~2-fold elevation in CTGF steady-state levels in the brain, coincident with a commensurate promotion of AD-type amyloid plaque burden. Finally, using in vitro cellular models of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-processing and Abeta generation/clearance, we confirmed that human recombinant (hr)CTGF may increase Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptide steady-state levels, possibly through a mechanism that involves gamma-secretase activation and decreased insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) steady-state levels in a MAP kinase (MAPK)/ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/protein kinase-B (AKT)1-dependent manner. The findings in this study tentatively suggest that increased CTGF expression in the brain might be a novel biological predicative factor of AD clinical progression and neuropathology in response to dietary regimens promoting IR conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2071026993,"The v-rel oncogene is the most efficient transforming member of the Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. v-Rel induces avian and mammalian lymphoid cell tumors and transforms chicken embryo fibroblasts in culture by the aberrant regulation of genes under the control of Rel/NF-kappaB proteins. Here we report that the expression of SH3BGRL, a member of the SH3BGR (SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich) family of proteins, is downregulated in v-Rel-expressing fibroblasts, lymphoid cells, and splenic tumor cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that v-Rel binds to the sh3bgrl promoter in transformed cells. Coexpression of SH3BGRL with v-Rel in primary splenic lymphocytes reduced the number of colonies formed by 76%. Mutations in the predicted SH3-binding domain of SH3BGRL abolished the suppressive effect on v-Rel transformation and resulted in colony numbers comparable to those formed by v-Rel alone. However, mutations in the predicted EVH1-binding domain of SH3BGRL only had a modest effect on suppression of v-Rel transformation. This study provides the first example of a gene that is downregulated in v-Rel-expressing cells that also plays a role in v-Rel transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2012932423,"Although the transcription factor USF2 has been implicated in the regulation of cellular growth and proliferation, it is unknown whether alterations in USF2 contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor development. We examined the role of USF2 in prostate tumorigenesis. Western blot analysis revealed markedly decreased USF2 levels in three androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, DU145, and M12, as compared to nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells or the androgen-dependent cell line, LNCaP. Ectopic expression of USF2 in PC-3 cells did not affect the cell proliferation rate of PC-3 cells on plastic surfaces. However, it dramatically decreased anchorage-independent growth of PC-3 cells in soft agar (90–98% inhibition) and the invasion capability (80% inhibition) of PC-3 cells in matrix gel assay. Importantly, expression of USF2 in PC-3 cells inhibited the tumorigenicity of PC-3 cells in an in vivo nude mice xenograft model (80–90% inhibition). These results suggest that USF2 has tumor-suppression function. Consistent with its function in tumor suppression, we found that the USF2 protein is present in normal prostate epithelial cells but absent in 18 of 42 (43%) human prostate cancer tissues (P=0.015). To further examine the functional role of USF2 in vivo, we generated mice with genetic deletion of USF2 gene. We found that USF2-null mice displayed marked prostate hyperplasia at a young age, suggesting that USF2 is involved in the normal growth and differentiation of prostate. Together, these studies demonstrate that USF2 has tumor-suppressor function and plays a role in prostate carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042075630,"Protective antigen (PA) is a central virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis and a key component in anthrax vaccines. PA binds to target cell receptors, is cleaved by the furin protease, self-aggregates to heptamers, and finally internalizes as a complex with either lethal or edema factors. Under mild room temperature storage conditions, PA cytotoxicity decreased (t½ ≈ 7 days) concomitant with the generation of new acidic isoforms, probably through deamidation of Asn residues. Ranking all 68 Asn residues in PA based on their predicted deamidation rates revealed five residues with half-lives of <60 days, and these residues were further analyzed: Asn10 in the 20-kDa region, Asn162 at P6 vicinal to the furin cleavage site, Asn306 in the pro-pore translocation loop, and both Asn713 and Asn719 in the receptor-binding domain. We found that PA underwent spontaneous deamidation at Asn162 upon storage concomitant with decreased susceptibility to furin. A panel of model synthetic furin substrates was used to demonstrate that Asn162 deamidation led to a 20-fold decrease in the bimolecular rate constant (kcat/Km) of proteolysis due to the new negatively charged residue at P6 in the furin recognition sequence. Furthermore, reduced PA cytotoxicity correlated with a decrease in PA cell binding and also with deamidation of Asn713 and Asn719. On the other hand, neither deamidation of Asn10 or Asn306 nor impairment of heptamerization could be observed upon prolonged PA storage. We suggest that PA inactivation during storage is associated with susceptible deamidation sites, which are intimately involved in both mechanisms of PA cleavage by furin and PA-receptor binding.

Immun. 1999; 67: 964-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the PA polypeptide is folded into four distinct domains with well defined functions. Domain I (residues 1–258) prevents premature PA polymerization and harbors the furin cleavage site, which is located in an unstructured flexible loop; domain II (residues 259–487) is involved in heptamerization and is in the membrane insertion loop; domain III (residues 488–595) is also involved in heptamerization (18Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2111-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); and domain IV (residues 596–735) is the C-terminal receptor-binding domain, with a small and a large subdomain loop. Mutagenesis studies implied the involvement of the small loop (residues 679–693), but not the large one (residues 704–722), in PA-receptor binding (21Varughese M. Teixeira A.V. Liu S. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown the involvement of the large loop in binding (20Brossier F. Sirard J.C. Guidi-Rontani C. Duflot E. Mock M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 964-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent x-ray crystallography studies of the PA-receptor complex revealed two contact regions of PA with the receptor, residues 681–688 and 714–716, suggesting the contribution of both the small and large loops, respectively, in PA binding (22Lacy D.B.

The currently approved human vaccines against anthrax are prepared from crude bacterial supernatant enriched with PA in addition to other B. anthracis-related proteins such as LF and EF (23Belton F.C.

Previous studies have shown that protective immunity to anthrax disease correlates with induction of neutralizing anti-PA antibodies (25Ivins B.E. Fellows P.F. Nelson G.O.

PA has been reported previously to be a thermally unstable protein, losing its in vitro cytotoxic activity upon storage at 37 °C within 48 h (32Singh S. Ahuja N. Chauhan V. Rajasekaran E. Waheed S.M. Bhat R. Bhatnagar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or within few minutes above 40 °C as a result of aggregation (33Singh S. Singh A. Aziz M.A. Waheed S.M. Bhat R. Bhatnagar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Protein loss of function under mild storage conditions is generally attributed to a variety of nonenzymatic modifications such as deamidation, isomerization, oxidation, and alternative disulfide pairings (34Wang W. Int. J. Pharm. 1999; 185: 129-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 35Chirino A.J. Mire-Sluis A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Spontaneous deamidation, which occurs mainly at Asn side chains and at a much slower rate at Gln residues (36Robinson N.E. Robinson Z.W. Robinson B.R. Robinson A.L. Robinson J.A. Robinson M.L. Robinson A.B. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), is a major and well documented degradation pathway in proteins. Deamidation rates depend on pH, temperature, primary sequence (“nearest neighbor” effect), and protein conformation (37Scotchler J.W. Robinson A.B. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 38Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12409-12413Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 39Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Deamidation proceeds by nucleophilic attack on the side chain carbonyl carbon of Asn by the nitrogen of the adjacent peptide bond, resulting in the formation of an unstable five-member succinimide ring, which is hydrolyzed to produce mainly l-Asp and l-isoaspartic acid at a ratio of ∼1:2 (41Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, deamidation can induce structural and functional perturbations in proteins through the introduction of a new negatively charged amino acid (Asp) and the insertion of an additional methyl residue in the polypeptide backbone (isoaspartic acid). As a result, generation of new acidic isoforms is considered a hallmark of deamidation (42Solstad T. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6302-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 43Deverman B.E. Cook B.L. Manson S.R. Niederhoff R.A. Langer E.M. Rosova I. Kulans L.A. Fu X. Weinberg J.S. Heinecke J.W. Roth K.A. Weintraub S.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that in vivo deamidation functions as an internal clock, regulating the half-life of proteins (39Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4367-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 44Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Mech.

Furthermore, the deamidation process is of major concern in the production of pharmaceutical proteins mainly during their purification and under long-term storage, as reported for recombinant human growth hormone (51Hepner, F., Cszasar, E., Roitinger, E., and Lubec, G. (2005) Proteome Science http://www.proteomesci.com/content/3/1/1Google Scholar), growth hormone-releasing factor (52Friedman A.R. Ichhpurani A.K. Brown D.M. Hillman R.M. Krabill L.F. Martin R.A.

Anal. 2003; 30: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and even in monoclonal antibody preparations following in vivo administration (55Huang L. Lu J. Wroblewski V.J. Beals J.M. Riggin R.M. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated recently that deamidation of tetanus vaccine under long-term storage results in the impairment of antigen processing and presentation (56Moss C.X. Matthews S.P. Lamont D.J. Watts C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanism(s) by which PA undergoes loss of function. We present evidence supporting the notion that inactivation of PA upon storage is caused by spontaneous deamidation of at least three vulnerable Asn sites, perturbing crucial steps in its mechanism of action. Materials—Fmoc-derivatives were purchased from Novabiochem. Fmoc amide resin (Applied Biosystems) was used as a solid phase. Human furin (EC 3.4.21.75) was purchased from Sigma, trypsin (porcine; EC 3.4.21.4) from Promega, and endoproteinase Asp-N (EC 3.4.24.33) from Calbiochem. All other reagents were analytical grade. Production and Purification of PA and LF—PA and LF were purified from B. anthracis strain V770-NP1-R (ATCC 14185) cultivated as described previously (31Cohen S. Mendelson I. Altboum Z. Kobiler D. Elhanany E. Bino T. Leitner M. Inbar I. Rosenberg H. Gozes Y. Barak R. Fisher M. Kronman C. Velan B. Shafferman A. Infect.

Microbiol. 1998; 64: 982-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at –20 °C until used. PA Cytotoxicity Assay—Purified stocks of PA and LF were kept at –20 °C until used. Cytotoxicity was determined in J774A.1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) as described previously (19Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3941-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27Reuveny S. White M.D. Adar Y.Y. Kafri Y. Altboum Z. Gozes Y. Kobiler D. Shafferman A. Velan B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (6 × 105/ml) were plated in 96-well cell culture plates. The cytotoxicity assay was initiated by the addition of PA (in serial dilutions) and LF, followed by incubation for 5 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cell viability was monitored by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (58Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46871) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity was determined by linear regression of each tested sample from a PA standard curve and is expressed as percent activity at time 0. PA Storage Conditions and Peptide Deamidation—PA was stored at 25 °C in 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) for up to 30 days in sealed tubes in a humid and sterilized (0.2-μm filtration) environment. Storage conditions were selected on the basis of the PA purification methodology (31Cohen S. Mendelson I. Altboum Z. Kobiler D. Elhanany E. Bino T. Leitner M. Inbar I. Rosenberg H. Gozes Y. Barak R.

Commun. 2004; 322: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Peptides were incubated for a few days in sealed tubes at 37 °C essentially as described above in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0). pH and sample volumes were stable throughout the incubation period. Isoelectric Focusing and SDS-Polyacrylamide Gels—Isoelectric focusing was carried out at a pH range of 3–9, and SDS-pretreated samples were analyzed using precast gels (PhastSystem, Amersham Biosciences) and Bio-Rad mini-gels. Gel Scanning—Gel scanning and densitometry were carried out using a GS-800 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) with Quantity One® software. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Simultaneous Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis was performed manually in “T-bags” (59Houghten R.A. Bray M.K. Degraw S.T. Kirby C.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 27: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified on a semipreparative reversed-phase HPLC column (Supelcosil LC-18-DB 300A, 5-μm pore size, 250 × 10 mm) using a Waters system equipped with 600E delivery pumps, a 996 photodiode array detector, and a 717 autosampler and controlled by Millenium software. About 2 mg of each peptide were purified (>95%), dried (Savant SpeedVac), and stored at –20 °C until used. MALDI-TOF/MS and Amino Acid Analysis—Reversed-phase HPLC-purified peptide samples were applied to a MALDI-TOF/MS target in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as described previously (60Elhanany E. Ordentlich A. Dgany O. Kaplan D. Segall Y. Barak R. Velan B. Shafferman A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Peptide quantitation was by amino acid analysis using vapor acid hydrolysis (110 °C, 16 h) and phenylthiocarbamyl pre-column derivatization (phenylthiocarbamyl workstation, Waters Corp.). In-gel Asp-N Digestion—Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised from the gel and in gel-digested with 2 μg/ml endoproteinase Asp-N in 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 30% CH3CN. Following 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, peptides were extracted in 20 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min at room temperature and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS. Enzyme Assays and Michaelis-Menten Constant Determination— Km(app) and Vmax(app) were determined using GraphPad Prism software. The data obtained were fitted to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten rate equation. Peptide cleavage was initiated by the addition of 1 μloffurin(∼4 ng) to 100 μl of peptide solution containing 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm CaCl2 over a peptide concentration range of 0.05–20 μm at 37 °C, well within the affinity range of furin for the peptide substrates used in this work. At 1–2-min intervals (for up to 10 min), reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μlof 10% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by injection into a Supelcosil LC-318 analytical column (250 × 4.6 mm). The intact peptide and its N-terminal cleaved product were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS. Cleavage rates were calculated as the ratios of product peak area versus the sum of the substrate and product peaks at a given reaction time. The theoretical isotopic distribution of identical amino acid sequences for each peptide was determined as 0% deamidation (using Micromass MassLinx software). PA Heptamerization Assay—The PA heptamerization process was followed essentially as described previously (17Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7045-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 61Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Goel S. Swain P.K. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. PA samples (2 mg/ml) were cleaved by trypsin (0.25 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0). The reaction was stopped by 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration). LF was added to the PA samples at various molar ratios (25 °C), and the mixtures were immediately separated by native gel (4–15%) electrophoresis (PhastSystem) or by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). PA Biotinylation and Binding Assay—PA was labeled with biotin (Pierce kit 21430), at a 1:50 biotin/PA molar ratio according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotin substitution was evaluated following PA dialysis at 4 °C in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 16 h by the 2-hydroxyazobenzene-4′-carboxylic acid assay (Pierce kit 21430). PA binding studies were performed at 4 °C using biotinylated PA (1.3 mol of biotin/mol of PA). Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in 24-well plates to 1.5 × 105 cells/well in α-minimal essential medium and 10% fetal calf serum in an CO2 atmosphere (62Escuyer V. Collier R.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PA binding assay was performed at 4 °C. Biotinylated PA was added at various concentrations (0.25–10 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled PA (for nonspecific binding determination). Two h later, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 250 μlof cold buffer solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 units/ml DNase, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Extracted PA was applied to streptavidin-precoated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Pierce). Biotinylated bound PA was quantitated using guinea pig anti-PA polyclonal antibodies. PA cytotoxicity in the presence of LF decreased gradually upon storage at 25 °C and pH 8.0 with an apparent half-life of ∼7 days (Fig. 1A). Loss of cytotoxic activity was accompanied by gradual appearance of acidic isoforms exhibiting pI values lower than the calculated value of 5.8 (Fig. 1B, right panel) with no apparent molecular breakdown (left panel), suggesting the involvement of a deamidation process (42Solstad T. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6302-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 63Paradisi F. Dean J.L. Geoghegan K.F. Engel P.C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Note the presence of some acidic isoforms at time 0 (Fig. 1B, right panel), suggesting that a certain level of deamidation had occurred already during PA isolation and purification (see Fig. 5). To determine putative deamidated residues, we first ranked all of the 68 Asn residues of PA (Protein Data Bank code 1ACC) according to their theoretical deamidation half-lives calculated on the basis of the algorithm of Robinson and Robinson (available at www.deamidation.org) (39Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4367-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), which takes into account empirical studies as well as primary, secondary, and three-dimensional structures of the protein, under standard experimental conditions. This ranking procedure resulted in predicted Asn deamidation half-lives ranging from 24 days (Asn713) to >2.5 × 106 days (Asn602). Based on the PA storage time frame used in this study, a cutoff half-life of 60 days was selected. Only five Asn residues with calculated deamidation half-lives of <60 days fall in this category (Fig. 2B). These include Asn10, with no known role in the mechanism of PA cytotoxicity (1Moayeri M. Leppla S.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); Asn162 at P6 in the cleavage recognition sequence of furin (9Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H.

https://openalex.org/W1992150232,"Treatments for hematological malignancies have improved considerably over the past decade, but the growing therapeutic arsenal has not benefited adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients. Oncolytic viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have recently emerged as a potential treatment of solid tumors and leukemias in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we investigated the ability of VSV to lyse primary human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected T-lymphocytes from patients with ATL. Ex vivo primary ATL cells were permissive for VSV and underwent rapid oncolysis in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, VSV infection showed neither viral replication nor oncolysis in HTLV-1-infected, nonleukemic cells from patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and in naive CD4(+) T-lymphocytes from normal individuals or in ex vivo cell samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Interestingly, activation of primary CD4(+) T-lymphocytes with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody, and specifically with anti-CD3, was sufficient to induce limited viral replication and oncolysis. However, at a similar level of T-cell activation, VSV replication was increased fourfold in ATL cells compared to activated CD4(+) T-lymphocytes, emphasizing the concept that VSV targets genetic defects unique to tumor cells to facilitate its replication. In conclusion, our findings provide the first essential information for the development of a VSV-based treatment for ATL."
https://openalex.org/W2132226272,"The Syrian hamster Harderian gland has as the remarkable feature of an extraordinary rate of porphyrin production, even higher than the liver. The low activity of the last enzyme of the route gives rise to the accumulation of the uncomplex porphyrins in the female glands. Moreover, due to the localization of the Harderian gland, porphyrins exposed to light produce reactive oxygen species and, thus, the gland presents a physiological oxidative stress, with a great number of sings of degeneration, but without compromising the gland integrity. The appearance of abnormal features in this gland was largely described in the past, but the significance is interpreted for the first time in this study. We have found that autophagic processes are the first result of an elevated porphyrin metabolism, as it is observed in both sexes. This mechanism is considered, in this case, as a constant renovation system that allows the normal gland activity to be sustained. Furthermore, there is a second procedure, invasive processes toward connective tissue, which even occasionally reach blood vessels with intravasation of damaged gland components into the bloodstream. This effect is a consequence of a strong oxidative stress environment that is mainly observed in the female gland, resembling to tumoral progression. Both mechanisms, autophagy and invasive processes, have to be implied in the maintenance of the gland integrity."

Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the α-subunit of heterotrimeric G13 protein induces conformational activation of radixin via interaction with its N-terminal domain (Vaiskunaite, R., Adarichev, V., Furthmayr, H., Kozasa, T., Gudkov, A., and Voyno-Yasenetskaya, T. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 26206–26212). In the present study, we tested whether radixin can regulate Gα13-mediated signaling pathways. We determined the effects of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–318) and C-terminal domain (amino acids 319–583) of radixin on serum response element (SRE)-dependent gene transcription initiated by a constitutively activated Gα13Q226L. The N-terminal domain potentiated SRE activation induced by Gα13Q226L; RhoGDI inhibited this effect. Surprisingly, the C-terminal domain also stimulated the SRE-dependent gene transcription. When co-transfected with Gα13Q226L, the C-terminal domain of radixin synergistically stimulated the SRE activation; RhoGDI inhibited this effect. Using in vivo pull-down assays, we have determined that the C-terminal domain of radixin activated Rac1 but not RhoA or Cdc42 proteins. By contrast, Gα13Q226L activated RhoA but not Rac1 or Cdc42. We have also shown that both the C-terminal domain of radixin and Gα13Q226L can stimulate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, CaMKII. Activated mutant that mimics the phosphorylated state of radixin (T564E) stimulated Rac1, induced the phosphorylation of CaMKII, and stimulated SRE-dependent gene transcription. Down-regulation of endogenous radixin using small interference RNA inhibited SRE-dependent gene transcription and phosphorylation of CaMKII induced by Gα13Q226L. Overall, our results indicated that radixin via its C-terminal domain mediates SRE-dependent gene transcription through activation of Rac1 and CaMKII. In addition, the radixin-CaMKII signaling pathway is involved in Gα13-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription, suggesting that radixin could be involved in novel signaling pathway regulated by G13 protein.

Disruption of the gene encoding the G13 subunit in mice impairs the ability of endothelial cells to develop into an organized vascular system and results in embryo lethality, which underlines the physiological importance of this Gα subunit (3Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In cells, G13 plays a role in multiple cellular functions, such as stress fiber formation, cellular transformation, regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1), induction of mitogenesis and apoptosis, and regulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways (4Buhl A.M.

Thus, G13-mediated activation of big mitogen-activated protein kinase (also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5) is Ras- and Rho-independent (14Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M.

In order to identify novel putative G13 effectors, our laboratory had used yeast two-hybrid screening and demonstrated that G13 subunit interacts with cytoskeleton-associated protein radixin (1Vaiskunaite R.

Radixin belongs to the conserved ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family. ERM proteins play a role in multiple cell functions, such as cell shape maintenance, formation of microvilli, cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, membrane trafficking, and cell polarity (see reviews in Refs. 17Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Gautreau A. Poulett P.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ERM proteins consist of the high homology N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ERM) domain and the C-terminal domain (21Bretscher A. Reczek D. Berryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction between the N-terminal FERM domain and the C-terminal domain maintains a dormant inactive state of the ERM proteins. In an active open state, the N-terminal domain binds to the membrane proteins such as CD43, CD44, ICAM1–3, Na+/H+ exchanger regulator (NHE3), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and the 2-adrenergic receptor, whereas C-terminal domain binds to F-actin. Therefore, ERM proteins were originally regarded as cross-linkers between cytoskeletal actin and the plasma membrane. Recently, it was suggested that ERM proteins function as signaling molecules. Interaction of ezrin with the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cell survival (19Gautreau A. Poulett P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). ERM proteins have been shown to interact with and to be involved in Syk-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling (22Urzainqui A. Serrador J.M. Viedma F. Yanez-Mo M. Rodriguez A. Corbi A.L. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. Luque A. Deckert M. Vazquez J. Sanchez-Madrid F. Immunity. 2002; 17: 401-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Importantly, ERM proteins are involved in the regulation of the Rho pathway. Binding of the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) by the N-terminal domain of radixin promotes Rho activation in vitro (2Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of ERM at the C terminus by Rho kinase maintains radixin in a relaxed active state (23Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ERM proteins can act both upstream and downstream of the Rho signaling pathway. The fact that Gα13 interacts with radixin and induces the open active state of radixin, resulting in the increased binding for F-actin (1Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26206-26212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), leads us to propose that radixin may function as a signaling molecule for Gα13. To test this hypothesis, we examined the role of radixin on Gα13-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription. Extracellular signals such as serum and lysophosphatidic acid cause Rho activation and subsequently actin dynamics change; thereafter, the decrease of free G-actin pool initiates the activation of SRE-dependent gene transcription (24Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 25Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Other members of the small Rho GTPase family, Rac and Cdc42, also stimulate the SRE gene transcription (24Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). In addition, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ leads to SRE-dependent gene transcription and is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases, CaMKII and CaMKIV (26Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Here, we report that radixin via its C-terminal domain mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription through activation of Rac1 and CaMKII. We have also shown that radixin-CaMKII signaling is involved in Gα13 protein-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription. Materials—Full-length, N-terminal, and C-terminal domains of radixin have been described before (1Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol.

Schwartz and G. Bokoch (The Scripps Research Institute), respectively. The internal EE-tagged G13Q226L, the constitutively activated RhoA and Rac, and the dominant negative RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were purchased from the Guthrie Research Institute (Sayre, PA). The dominant negative CaMKII (K42M) and dominant negative CaMKIV (dCTK75E) were gifts from Dr. M. Rosner (University of Chicago) and Dr. J. Xie (University of Manitoba), respectively. Genistein, piceataneriod, LFM-A13, BAPTA/AM, KN-93, and cyclosporine A were purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies against RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, polyclonal antibodies against total and phosphorylated CaMKII, and polyclonal antibody against radixin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody against EE epitope was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transfection following the manufacturer's instructions. Radixin Down-regulation—Expression of the endogenous radixin was down-regulated by siRNA using the BD™ Knock-out RNAi Systems (BD Biosciences). The target sequence is the 19 nucleotides corresponding to the coding region between nucleotides 188 and 207 of the mouse radixin. The siRNA sequence contains the target sense sequence, hairpin loop, and target antisense sequence; the same sequence without the target antisense sequence was designed as control siRNA. The primers were chemically synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). After annealing, they were subcloned into the vector pSIREN-RetroQ (BD Biosciences). The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Reporter Gene Assay—SRE-mediated gene expression was determined by the SRE.L reporter system (Stratagene) as described previously (27Ponimaskin E.G. Profirovic J. Vaiskunaite R. Richter D.W. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20812-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells at 90% confluence grown on 24-well plates were transfected with the following plasmids (per well): 50 ng of pSRE.L reporter, 50 ng of pCMV-galactosidase (LacZ) (control plasmid for transfection efficiency), and 50–200 ng of other plasmids indicated in each experiments as described under “Results.” The cells were serum-starved overnight before assays. Washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, the cells were lysed and assayed following the manufacturer's instruction for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity with the Promega assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of β-galactosidase to correct the difference caused by different transfection efficiency. In Vivo Rho GTPase Activation Assay—Activation of Rho proteins in vivo was determined by using pull-down assays as described by us earlier (28Niu J. Profirovic J. Pan H. Vaiskunaite R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These assays involve the use of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the GTP-dependent binding domains from effectors that bind the various Rho GTPases. Rhotekin interacts with GTP-bound RhoA but not with Rac1 or Cdc42. Conversely, the PAK serine/threonine kinase interacts with activated Rac1 and Cdc42 but not with RhoA. pGEX expression vectors encoding GST fusion proteins that contain the isolated GTP-dependent binding domains of the Rac1 and Cdc42 effector PAK1 (amino acids 70–132 of PAK1; PAK PBD) or the RhoA effector rhotekin (amino acids 7–89 of rhotekin; rhotekin RBD) were used for the bacterial expression of GST fusion proteins. Confluent NIH 3T3 cells (100-mm dishes) were transfected with the indicated cDNAs for 48 h. Cells were serum-starved 24 h prior the experiment. Cells were then quickly washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min, and equal volumes of cell lysates were incubated with GST-RBD rhotekin beads or GST-RBD PAK beads (15 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and bound Rho, Rac1, or Cdc42 were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples eluted from the beads and the total cell lysates were then separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. Western Blotting for Detection of Phosphorylation of CaMKII—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture), and sonicated on ice. The insoluble material was removed from the lysates by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration of the total cell lysates was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Statistical Analysis—For statistical analysis, Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Activation of SRE-dependent Gene Transcription by the C-terminal Domain of Radixin—Rho proteins, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are regulated by the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which inhibit the dissociation of the nucleotide bound to these proteins. The dissociation of GDI from the protein is a prerequisite for membrane association and activation of these Rho proteins by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (29Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Based on the evidence that Gα13 interacts with and activates radixin (1Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26206-26212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that RhoGDI interacts with N-terminal domain of radixin, thereby displacing RhoGDI from Rho proteins in in vitro studies (2Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to expect that domain(s) of radixin may regulate Gα13-mediated activation of RhoA and subsequent cellular signaling. We tested how expression of the N-terminal (amino acids 1–318), or C-terminal (amino acids 319–583) domains of radixin affected the Gα13-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription. As shown in Fig. 1A, RhoGDI inhibited SRE activation induced by Gα13Q226L expression, supporting the notion that Rho proteins mediate SRE activation induced by Gα13Q226L. The N-terminal domain of radixin did not exhibit any basal activity compared with the empty vector. However, the N-terminal domain of radixin potentiated SRE activation induced by Gα13Q226L. RhoGDI inhibited SRE activation induced by the combination of Gα13Q226L and the N-terminal domain of radixin (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of radixin itself induced a 2-fold increase of the SRE-dependent gene transcription that was inhibited by RhoGDI (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, when co-transfected with Gα13Q226L, the C-terminal domain radixin synergistically stimulated the SRE activation (Fig. 1A). This activation was also inhibited by RhoGDI, suggesting that Rho proteins are involved in this signaling pathway. To rule out the possibility that observed synergistic stimulation of SRE was due to changes in expression of transfected proteins, we analyzed whether the expression of Gα13Q226L with internal EE epitope was affected by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Detection of Gα13Q226L-EE with EE antibody showed that the C-terminal domain of radixin did not change the expression of G13Q226L-EE (Fig. 1B), suggesting that observed stimulation of SRE activity was not due to increased expression of Gα13. Gα13Q226L-EE showed the similar to Gα13Q226L stimulation of SRE-dependent gene transcription (data not shown). Reprobing of the same blots with Gα13 antibody did not reveal a detectable difference of Gα13 expression in cells transfected with Gα13Q226L-EE or vector alone, suggesting that overexpression of the transfected construct was minimal. To further analyze the SRE-dependent gene transcription regulated by the C-terminal domain of radixin, we evaluated how different amounts of C-terminal domain of radixin cDNA affected Gα13Q226L-dependent SRE activation (Fig. 1C). Data showed that the C-terminal domain of radixin stimulated SRE-dependent gene transcription in a dose-dependent manner both alone and in the presence of Gα13Q226L (Fig. 1C). Involvement of Rac1 in SRE Activation Induced by the C-terminal Domain of Radixin—To evaluate the effect of radixin on activation of individual Rho GTPases, we used the Rho-binding domain of the RhoA effector, rhotekin, to affinity-precipitate active RhoA, as a direct readout for RhoA activation. We have also used the Rac1- and Cdc42-binding domains of Rac1 and Cdc42 effector PAK to affinity-precipitate active Rac1 and Cdc42 as a direct readout for Rac1 and Cdc42 activation. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with either the C-terminal domain of radixin or Gα13Q226L. Data showed that Gα13Q226L induced a 5–6-fold increase in RhoA activity (Fig. 2A). Importantly, Gα13Q226L did not activate Rac1 or Cdc42 (Fig. 2A). The C-terminal domain of radixin expressed alone or in the presence of Gα13Q226L did not affect RhoA activity (Fig. 2A; data not shown). In addition, wild-type and N-terminal domain of radixin did not affect the activity of Rho proteins (data not shown). By contrast, the C-terminal domain of radixin activated Rac1 but not RhoA and Cdc42 (Fig. 2A). The C-terminal domain of radixin expressed in the presence of Gα13Q226L did not further enhanced Rac1 activity (data not shown). Equal protein expression of the C-terminal domain of radixin or Gα13Q226L was controlled by Western blotting (data not shown), which confirmed that the different effects of these proteins on activation of Rho GTPases was not due to difference in the amount of expressed protein. These data provided the direct evidence that in mammalian cells, Gα13Q226L stimulated RhoA, whereas the C-terminal domain of radixin stimulated Rac1 proteins. To further support the observation that the C-terminal domain of radixin stimulated Rac1 protein, we have used dominant negative mutants of these GTPases. Data showed that dominant negative mutants of Rac1 (T17N) but not RhoA (T19N) or Cdc42 (T17N) inhibited SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin (Fig. 2B). Thus, this result further corroborated the finding that C-terminal domain of radixin regulated activity of Rac1 but not RhoA or Cdc42 proteins. In addition, the data showed that both C3 toxin and dominant negative Rac1(T17N) inhibited Gα13-induced SRE activation (Fig. 2C). The different sensitivities of reporter assay and pull-down assay may have contributed to the differences in the data. Involvement of CaMKII in SRE Activation Induced by C-terminal Domain of Radixin and Gα13Q226L—Partial inhibition by dominant negative Rac1 of the SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin suggested that an additional pathway involved in SRE activation might exist. Since some tyrosine kinases and two isoforms of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, CaMKII and CaMKIV, have been shown to stimulate SRE gene transcription (26Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20047-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we determined how inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and inhibitors of CaMK affect the SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. At concentrations chosen for the activity against the respective target enzymes, general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50 μm) and selective Syk tyrosine kinase inhibitor piceataneriod (10 μm) did not affect the transcriptional activity (data not shown), suggesting that tyrosine kinases are probably not involved in the SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. To test the involvement of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase pathway, we examined how intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), calmodulin kinase inhibitor (KN-93), and calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine) affect SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Our results showed that BAPTA/AM and KN-93 inhibited SRE activation (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase pathway may be involved in the regulation of SRE gene transcription induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Because both CaMKII and CaMKIV stimulate SRE gene transcription and KN-93 inhibits the activity of both kinases, next we examined whether the dominant negative mutants of CaMKII and CaMIV can affect the SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. As shown in Fig. 3B, the dominant negative mutant of CaMKII but not of CaMKIV inhibited the SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Because dominant negative Rac1 induced partial inhibition of SRE activity (Fig. 2B), we tested whether simultaneous inhibition of Rac1 and CaMKII inputs will further decrease the SRE activity induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Data showed that both dominant negative Rac1 and kinase-dead CaMKII partially inhibited SRE activity induced by C-terminal domain of radixin (Fig. 3C). Simultaneous inhibition of Rac1 and CaMKII by dominant negative constructs further inhibited SRE activity (Fig. 3C), suggesting that both inputs contributed to the SRE activity induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. We tested the involvement of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase pathway in Ga13-mediated signaling. Our results showed that BAPTA/AM and KN-93 inhibited SRE activation (Fig. 4A), suggesting that Ca2+/calmodulin dependent kinase pathway may be involved in the regulation of SRE gene transcription induced by the Gα13 protein. Interestingly, dominant negative mutants of CaMKII and CaMKIV inhibited the SRE activation induced by Gα13Q226L (Fig. 4A), suggesting that both CaMKII and CaMKIV are involved in Gα13-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription. The phosphorylation state of CaMKII was analyzed using specific antibody targeted to the autophosphorylation site of CaMKII at residue of Thr286. We observed significant increase of the endogenous CaMKII phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and C) in cells transfected with the C-terminal domain of radixin, whereas total CaMKII expression remained constant. Wild-type radixin or its N-terminal domain did not induce CaMKII phosphorylation (data not shown). Importantly, Gα13Q226L also induced CaMKII phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and C). Co-transfection of C-terminal domain of radixin together with Gα13Q226L resulted in a further increase of CaMKII phosphorylation. These data provided evidence that both the C-terminal domain of radixin and Gα13Q226L stimulated CaMKII. Radixin Mutant Mimicking Phosphorylated State Activates Rac1 and Induces CaMKII Phosphorylation and SRE-dependent Gene Transcription—Activation of radixin requires relief of the intramolecular association, and this is believed to involve phosphorylation of threonine 564 (17Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To determine whether the C-terminal radixin accurately reflects an activated state of radixin, we made the mutant T564E radixin, which mimics the phosphorylated state of radixin (17Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Data showed that radixin (T564E) induced activation of Rac1 (Fig. 5A), phosphorylation of CaMKII (Fig. 5B), and SRE activation (Fig. 5C). Together, these results suggested that the C-terminal domain of radixin can reflect the activated state of radixin. Involvement of Radixin in Gα13-mediated SRE Gene Transcription—To test the involvement of radixin in Gα13-mediated signaling, we used siRNA technology to reduce the expression of endogenous radixin in NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were transfected with constructs containing either radixin or control siRNA, and 24 h later cell lysates were analyzed using Western blotting with antibodies against radixin, ezrin, or moesin. Densitometry analysis showed that expression of the endogenous radixin was down-regulated by ∼50% upon transfection of the NIH 3T3 cells with vector containing radixin siRNA (Fig. 6A). The transfection of the control siRNA vector did not affect the expression of the endogenous radixin. However, expression of endogenous ezrin or moesin was not affected by either control or radixin siRNAs (Fig. 6A), suggesting that siRNA-induced down-regulation of radixin was specific. Next, we tested whether down-regulation of the endogenous radixin can affect Gα13-mediated activation of SRE. Data showed that in the cells expressing vector containing radixin siRNA, SRE activity induced by Gα13Q226L was reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 6B). In the cells expressing control siRNA, Gα13-induced SRE activation was not affected. Importantly, SRE activity induced by a downstream effector of Gα13, p115RhoGEF, was not affected by down-regulation of radixin (Fig. 6B), indicating that the reduction of Gα13Q226L-mediated SRE activation by radixin siRNA was specific. Furthermore, radixin siRNA but not control siRNA also reduced the phosphorylation of CaMKII by Gα13Q226L (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data suggested that radixin-CaMKII signaling is involved in the Gα13-induced SRE gene transcription. In the present study, we have demonstrated for the first time that radixin can activate Rac1 and induce phosphorylation of CaMKII. Activation of these proteins resulted in the stimulation of SRE-dependent gene transcription. We have also demonstrated that Gα13 can induce CaMKII phosphorylation. In addition, reducing endogenous radixin with siRNA demonstrated that the radixin-CaMKII signaling pathway is involved in Gα13-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription. The partial inhibition by dominant negative Rac1(T17N) suggests the possibility that the radixin-Rac1 signaling pathway is also involved in Gα13-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription. Taken together, our studies suggest that radixin could be involved in a novel signaling pathway regulated by Gα13 protein. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Gα13 also activates CaMKII in a radixin-independent manner (Fig. 7). Activation of Rac1 by C-terminal Domain of Radixin—In contrast to the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain of radixin alone induced a 2-fold increase in SRE activity (Fig. 1). We explored the possible mechanism of this activation using pull-down assays for activation of Rho proteins. The results indicated that the C-terminal domain of radixin activated Rac1, but not RhoA or Cdc42 (Fig. 2). Because Rac1 can also stimulate SRE-dependent gene transcription, these data suggested that Rac1 might mediate the stimulation of SRE induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Inhibition of C-terminal domain-induced SRE activity by Rac1 (T17N) but not by RhoA (T19N) or Cdc42 (T17N) confirmed that the C-terminal domain of radixin stimulated SRE via Rac1 (Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicated that Rac1 is at least in part responsible for the stimulation of gene transcription by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Activation of Rac1 by the C-terminal domain of radixin was consistent with the other studies. Overexpression of ezrin T567D, in which an aspartic acid mimics the constitutive threonine phosphorylation of the C terminus, resulted in increased membrane ruffling and lamellipodia (36Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently reported that ezrin T567D induced Rac1 activation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (37Pujuguet P. Del Maestro L. Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2181-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that activated ERM proteins in an open relaxed state may activate Rac1. Our results indicated that the C-terminal domain of radixin mediated Rac1 activation. Furthermore, ezrin was shown to be cleaved by calpain following the stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (38Shcherbina A. Bretscher A. Kenney D.M. Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this proteolytic cleavage is currently unclear, although it might be a mechanism of releasing N- and C-terminal domains. How the C terminus of radixin activates Rac1 remains unknown. It is possible that the C-terminal domain of radixin may regulate Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). One candidate is Tiam, a specific GEF for Rac. Interestingly, CaMKII was shown to activate Tiam (39Buchanan F.G. Elliot C.M. Gibbs M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9742-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 40Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Since the C-terminal domain of radixin also induced the autophosphorylation of CaMKII (Fig. 6), it is possible that CaMKII and Tiam are involved in the activation of Rac1. This hypothesis is currently being tested in the laboratory. Activation of CaMKII by C-terminal Domain of Radixin—Because dominant negative Rac1 induced partial inhibition of SRE activity (Fig. 2B), we tested whether other signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of SRE activity induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. We determined that intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM and CaMK inhibitor KN-93 inhibited SRE activation induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the dominant negative mutant of CaMKII but not CaMKIV inhibited the SRE activity induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin (Fig. 3). Using the specific antibody against the autophosphorylation site at Thr286 of CaMKII, we determined that both the C-terminal domain of radixin and Gα13Q226L increased the autophosphorylation of CaMKII (Fig. 4). These results provided strong evidence indicating the involvement of CaMKII in SRE activity induced by the C-terminal domain of radixin. Both CaMKII and CaMKIV have been shown to stimulate SRE activity (26Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The mechanism for CaMKIV-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription had been defined (35Davis F.J. Gupta M. Camoretti-Mercado B. Schwartz R.J. Gupta M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20047-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, CaMKIV phosphorylates transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase and dissociates it from serum response factor, removing this repression molecule from the transcription complex. Recently, CaMKII was shown to use the similar mechanism to stimulate the myocyte enhancer factor-2 transcription factor in neuron cells (41Linseman D.A. Bartley C.M. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. Bouchard R.J. Meintzer M.K. Li M. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41472-441481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that CaMK II might use a similar mechanism to activate SRE-dependent gene transcription. Gα13/Radixin Signaling Pathway—Radixin is involved in the signaling pathways regulated by of RhoA, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases (17Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that activated Gα13, via the N-terminal domain, interacts with radixin and increases radixin binding to F-actin. In the present studies, we have shown that both N-terminal and C-terminal domains were involved in the Gα13-dependent SRE activation (Fig. 1A). Down-regulation of endogenous radixin resulted in the inhibition of SRE activation induced by Gα13Q226L (Fig. 6B). Although Gα13Q226L did not activate Rac1, we showed that the radixin-CaMKII signaling is involved in Gα13-stimulated SRE-dependent gene transcription. The lines of evidence include that (i) BAPTA/AM, KN-93, and dominant negative CaMKII inhibited SRE activation by both the C-terminal domain of radixin and Gα13Q226L (Figs. 3 and 4), (ii) both the C-terminal domain of radixin and Gα13Q226L induced the phosphorylation of CaMKII (Fig. 4), and (iii) down-regulation of radixin using siRNA reduced the phosphorylation of CaMKII induced by Gα13Q226L (Fig. 6). According to the proposed model, Gα13 should be able to activate Rac1 (Fig. 7). However, we did not observe that in the pull-down assay (Fig. 2A). On the another hand, the dominant negative mutant of Rac1(T17N) partially inhibited the Gα13Q226L-mediated SRE gene transcription in the reporter assay (Fig. 2C). This discrepancy could be due to several possibilities. (i) Rac1 activation by Gα13Q226L is cell condition-dependent. Thus, it was reported that stably expressed Gα13Q226L induced Rac1 activation in NIH 3T3 cells (42Radhika V. Onesime D. Ha J.H. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49406-49413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gα13Q226L may activate Rac1 under certain cellular conditions. (ii) The small inhibition of dominant negative mutant Rac1 also suggests that Gα13 may activate Rac1, but the activation may be not strong enough to detect it using a pull-down assay. One major reason for small inhibition is that Gα13Q226L activates RhoA, which in turn dominantly stimulates SRE. Therefore, Gα13Q226L may stimulate SRE via three pathways: 1) RhoA; 2) radixin-CaMKII; 3) radixin-Rac1. Considering the three parallel pathways and dominance of RhoA, the radixin-Rac1-stimulated SRE should be relatively small. It should be pointed out that inhibition was significant. (iii) The pull-down assay to assess the direct activation of small G proteins is capable of detecting femtomolar amounts of the activated enzyme. By contrast, the quantitative reporter assay that uses firefly luciferase allows detection of subattomole amounts of enzyme (43Bronstein I. Fortin J. Stanley P.E. Stewart G.S. Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, one of the dominant signalings of Gα13Q226L is the activation of RhoA. It is known that activation of RhoA could inhibit activation of Rac1 (44Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The degree of RhoA activation by Gα13Q226L in different cell conditions may affect Rac1 activation by Gα13Q226L in a dynamic manner. In other words, the Rac1 activation by G13Q226L could be transient, and this would be more difficult to detect by the pull-down assay. By contrast, interference with the function of endogenous Rac1 by the dominant negative mutant could be relatively stable after the mutant is expressed. (iv) While this paper was in revision, a study was published describing that Gα13 mediates reactive oxygen species production by Rac activation (45Fujii T. Onohara N. Maruyama Y. Tanabe S. Kobayashi H. Fukutomi M. Nagamatsu Y. Nishihara N. Inoue R. Sumimoto H. Shibasaki F. Nagao T. Nishida M. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23041-23047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Direct activation of Rac1 by Gα13 was not shown in this paper. However, the authors determined that an inhibitor of Gα12/13, the Gα12/13-specific regulator of G protein signaling domain of p115RhoGEF, inhibited angiotensin-induced activation of Rac1. (v) It is also possible that Gα13Q226L does not activate Rac1 when transiently transfected in NIH 3T3 cells. If this were the case, Gα13 would not use radixin in the signaling. Instead, Gα13Q226L can activate the downstream CaMKII in a radixin-independent manner. This means that Gα13Q226L and radixin would independently regulate the phosphorylation and activity of CaMKII and then the downstream SRE gene transcription. Our data do not exclude this possibility. Taken together, it should be pointed out that the direct signaling from Gα13 to radixin is likely, but further evidence is needed (Fig. 7), and further studies are also needed to distinguish among the above possibilities. In summary, our studies indicate that radixin stimulates SRE-dependent gene transcription. This activity requires activation of Rac1 and CaMKII by radixin via its C-terminal domain. Our results also suggest that the radixin-CaMKII signaling is involved in Gα13-mediated SRE-dependent gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2079357250,"AMID is an apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-homologous and mitochondria-associated protein that has been implicated in caspase-independent apoptosis. Transcription of human AMID gene is upregulated by p53 and downregulated in tumors in comparison to their matched normal tissues, suggesting the possibility that AMID is involved in the downstream effects of p53. To investigate the physiological functions of AMID, we generated AMID-deficient mice by gene targeting. AMID-deficient mice are viable and fertile, develop normally and lack obvious phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice up to 1 year old. AMID−/− mice up to 1 year old have no spontaneous tumors and show similar fibrosarcoma incidence after MCA inoculation compared to wild-type mice. AMID−/− embryonic fibroblasts exhibit normal proliferation but slightly increased resistance to genotoxin-induced growth arrest. These findings suggest that AMID is not required for normal development and p53-mediated tumor suppression."

The ligands in this family are dimers that are disulfide linked in most, but not all, cases (GDF-9 and BMP15, for example) (2Shimasaki S. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Erickson G.F. Endocr.

The distinguishing characteristic of the TGFβ ligand subunits is six conserved cystine residues that form a core“cystine knot” motif analogous to that found in nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (3Muller Y.A.

Crystallographic studies indicate that the cystine pattern translates into a high degree of secondary and tertiary structural homology among subunits of the family (5Greenwald J. Vega M.E.

Ligands adopt a three-dimensional structure resembling a left hand, with a“wrist” domain and four“fingers” extended outward from the central cystine knot (Fig. 1). Similarities in receptor interaction sites on the ligands result from structural homology, and have led to the identification of the convex finger region of TGFβ superfamily ligands as the site for interaction with type II receptors, and the concave finger region as the type I receptor interaction site (6Hart P.J.

Activin is a unique ligand within the TGFβ superfamily because it has a naturally occurring antagonist called inhibin. Inhibin is an endocrine hormone, also a member of the TGFβ superfamily, and blocks the paracrine actions of activin in a classical negative feedback loop (11Channing C.P. Gordon W.L. Liu W.K. Ward D.N. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1985; 178: 339-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Woodruff T.K. Mather J.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 219-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One of the reasons that these ligands act as functional antagonists is their structural similarity. Activin is a dimer of two TGF-like β subunits (βA and/or βB), whereas inhibin is assembled from a βA or βB subunit and a distinct α subunit. The α and β subunits share less than 40% homology, but retain the conserved cystines. Connection of the two subunits through a disulfide bridge is necessary for production and activity of the antagonist. At the surface of the pituitary gonadotrope, activin stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by binding with high affinity to the activin type II receptors, ActRII or ActRIIB, inducing phosphorylation of the activin type I receptor, ALK4. ALK4 is a serine-threonine kinase receptor that phosphorylates cytoplasmic Smad2 and Smad3 transcriptional regulators (1Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Inhibin binds ActRIIB, presumably through its single β subunit, to block activin signaling through its cell surface receptor. Inhibin binds both ActRII and ActRIIB, and possesses a higher affinity for the receptor in the presence of the accessory protein betaglycan (13Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To better understand the structure-function relationship between this agonist-antagonist pair, we generated a series of rationally designed point mutants that introduce an α subunit residue into the βA subunit and examined ActRIIB binding characteristics and bioactivity. This study not only revealed the residues essential for activin binding to its receptors, but provided insight into the structural basis for inhibin antagonism of activin signaling. Mutagenesis and Protein Production—Activin A mutants were produced by the PCR technique according to the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene). Primers containing oligonucleotide substitutions encoding the codon for the desired amino acid were used to introduce mutations to a pcDNA3.0 plasmid containing the βA subunit of activin A. The mutation was verified by sequencing in an ABI3100 Capillary DNA Sequencer. Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with plasmids encoding the proper mutation was performed according to the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) method. Transfected cells were selected using G418 and carried in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME)/F-12 media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At confluence, media was exchanged for DME/F-12 serum-free media and grown for 5 days before collection. Following collection, serum-free media was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and protein solution was concentrated by Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore). Protein Concentration Determination by Fluorescence—The concentration of wild type and mutant activin A solutions was determined by intensity of fluorescence using the ODDYSEY Imaging System (LI-COR). Western blot analysis was performed using a polyclonal activin βA antibody (provided by Dr. Wylie Vale, the Salk Institute), followed by an Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Luciferase Assays—Bioactivity of wild type and mutant activin A protein was determined by use of an LβT2 gonadotrope cell line stably transfected with the -338 region of the FSHβ promoter conjugated to a luciferase reporter. Cells were carried out as reported previously (14Suszko M.I. Lo D.J. Suh H. Camper S.A. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 318-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and treated with 10 ng/ml mutant protein for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-free DME/F-12, phenol red-free, supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Following treatment, cells were lysed in GME buffer, and then treated with assay buffer (GME buffer, 16.5 mm KPO4, 2.2 mm ATP, and 1.1 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was measured for 30 s using an AutoLumat (Berthold Technologies Co.). Ligand Iodination and Binding Competition Assay—Purified activin A ligand was iodinated using the lactoperoxidase method. 1 μg of ligand was diluted in 0.4 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6, immediately before addition of 10 μl of Na125I (MPBiomedicals). 5 μl of 1 unit/ml lactoperoxidase in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6, was added, followed by addition of two 5-μl aliquots of diluted H2O2 with a 5-min incubation after each addition. The reaction was stopped by adding 272 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. COS-7 cells were carried in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Three days prior to the binding competition assay, cells were split to 2 × 106 cells per 60-cm2 plate. Twenty-four hours later cells were transfected with 10 μg of rat ActRIIB expression plasmid (provided by Dr. Kelly Mayo, Northwestern University) according to the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) method. Following overnight recovery in normal growth media cells were plated on 12-well plates. Following overnight recovery cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit-BSA (128 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 m MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 50 mm HEPES, 0.5% BSA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were treated with appropriate solution of 125I-activin A and/or competitor ligand, incubated at 4 °C for 3.5 h, then washed four times in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit-BSA before lysing with 0.5 m NaOH for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were counted in a Geiger counter to quantify radioactivity. Immunoprecipitation of Receptor Complexes—Immunoprecipitation was performed on COS-7 cells transfected with rat ActRIIB-FLAG and rat ActRIB-HA expression plasmids (provided by Dr. Kelly Mayo, Northwestern University) as described above. Cells split to 6-well plates were incubated in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit-BSA for 30 min at 37 °C, before treating with 100 ng/ml of purified or mutant activin A in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit-BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized using RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 5 mm EDTA). 1 μg of FLAG or HA monoclonal antibodies was added to each lysate for overnight incubation at 4 °C, followed by addition of 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Vector Labs) and a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. After washing beads and incubating in gel loading buffer at 90 °C, protein was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Detection of βA subunit was carried out as described above. Smad3 Phosphorylation Determination—LβT2 cells split to 6-well plates were treated with 10 ng/ml of wild type or mutant activin A in DME/F-12 without phenol red or serum, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Pierce), and 50 μl of lysate was run on 4–12% SDS-PAGE NuPage gels (Invitrogen). Western blot analysis was performed using phospho-Smad2 and -3 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) at 1:500 dilution in TBS-Tween with 5% BSA. Detection of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was performed according to the ECL Western Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The βA Subunit, but Not the α Subunit, Binds ActRIIB—Unlike activin, TGFβ, and BMP, inhibin is a heterodimer of a β subunit and a unique α subunit. The α subunit retains seven of the conserved cystines characteristic of ligands of the superfamily, but has significant differences in key topological domains thought to be important for ligand-receptor interaction (Fig. 1a). Previous studies demonstrated that inhibin has a greatly reduced affinity for the activin type II receptor in the absence of accessory proteins (13Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 15Chapman S.C. Bernard D.J. Jelen J. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 196: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We used gel filtration chromatography of pre-assembled complexes to determine the molar ratio of ligand to receptor. The recombinant human ActRIIB extracellular domain (ECD) was produced in insect cells and purified by metal affinity chromatography as previously reported (9Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells were used to produce recombinant human activin A, and the ligand was purified using previously established methods (16Pangas S.A. Woodruff T.K. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 172: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a). Recombinant human inhibin A was a gift of Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc. (Houston, TX). Activin- or inhibin-ActRIIB-ECD complexes were applied to a size exclusion column to determine the ratio of ligands and receptors in each complex (Fig. 2b). A complex at 58 kDa was resolved, representing a 26-kDa activin A molecule bound to two ActRIIB-ECD receptors (Fig. 2b, peak I). The inhibin A-ActRIIB-ECD complex eluted from the column at 45 kDa, reflecting a 32–34-kDa ligand bound to one receptor (Fig. 2b, peak II). Excess receptor eluted at a position equal to 18 kDa for both experiments (Fig. 2b, peak III). These data support those reported in recent ultracentrifugation experiments (5Greenwald J. Vega M.E. Allendorph G.P. Fischer W.H. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 485-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and indicate that the α subunit is either unable to bind ActRIIB or binds weakly. Rationale, Design, and Synthesis of Activin-Inhibin Mutants—The results of the chromatographic experiments described in the previous section prompted an analysis of the activin A-ActRIIB, activin A-Act-RII, TGFβ3-TβRII, and BMP2-BRIA structures (5Greenwald J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to predict specific inhibin amino acids important to the mechanism of inhibin antagonism. ActRIIB binds to the convex surface of the finger domain of activin A. This region is characterized by a large number of hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1c) with side chains that pack against an equally hydrophobic-rich patch on the ActRIIB ECD. Compared with the TGFβ3-TβRII interaction, which occurs at the tips of the ligand fingers, the activin-ActRIIB binding region possesses a buried surface area nearly three times larger. Side chains for amino acids Phe17, Ile30, Ala31, His36, Ser90, Leu92, Tyr94, Ile100, and Lys102, point toward the receptor (Fig. 1c), and we replaced these residues with the corresponding α subunit residue, according to an alignment of the α and βA subunits, or with non-conserved amino acids (Fig. 1a). Of the 15 mutations produced in the ActRIIB binding region of activin (alignment of the subunits does not definitively specify Arg109 or Thr110 of the α subunit as being in the same site as Leu92 of the βA subunit, so mutations were made to both arginine and threonine) only substitution of phenylalanine at position 17 by asparagine appeared to alter processing. This mutation resulted in proteins of ∼26, 28, and 30 kDa, presumably representing different glycoforms (Fig. 3). The binding site for ALK4 on activin has not been determined. Modeling the receptor into the concave region of the activin βA subunit based upon the BMP2/BRIA crystal structure reveals 7 amino acids on the βA subunit that form a hydrophobic pocket conductive to protein-protein interactions. Also, two charged residues at the edge of the hydrophobic pocket could have an impact upon receptor interaction (Fig. 1d). These residues are highly conserved in the inhibin α and BMP subunits (TABLE ONE). Mutations of Phe16, Ile23, Trp25, Trp28, Tyr35, Tyr93, Lys103, and Ile105 to glutamic acid, and of Asp96 to lysine, were introduced to the βA subunit.TABLE ONEComparison of BMP2, BMP7, βA, and α ligand subunits Comparison of amino acids on BMP2 important for ligand interaction with BRIA to similarly aligned residues of BMP7, activin βA, and inhibin α subunits. Alignment reveals a high degree of conservation between the ligands. Homology in the site may be indicative of an ALK4 binding site on the βAand α subunits.BMP-2BMP-7Activin βAInhibin αLeu19Leu43Phe16Leu35Val27Leu50Ile23Leu42Trp29Trp52Trp25Trp44Trp32Trp55Trp28Trp47Tyr39Tyr62Tyr35Phe54Tyr91Tyr116Tyr93Thr110Glu94Asp119Asp96Gly114Lys101Lys126Lys103Glu121Tyr103Tyr128Ile105Val123 Open table in a new tab Activin A mutants containing substitutions in ActRIIB and ALK4 binding sites were characterized as described under“Materials and Methods.” Wild type activin A produced using the same methods as used for production of mutant activin A served as a positive control for FSH bioassays, and competition studies. The bioassays utilized a mouse gonadotrope cell line, LβT2, and an activin-responsive reporter gene. Using this bioassay, we were able to achieve highly comparable luciferase activity using either purified ligand or ligand-containing media (Fig. 4a). Activin Mutants with Normal Receptor Binding and Activin Bioactivity—A difference between the α and βA subunits in the activin A-ActRIIB binding interface is the N-linked glycosylation site encoded by Asn-Ile-Ser at position 36–38 of the α subunit. A F17N mutant was produced to test whether substitution of asparagine at position 17 (leading to the required Asn-Val-Ser consensus sequence) and subsequent glycosylation at the homologous site on βA disrupted ActRIIB binding (Fig. 3). A non-conserved F17A mutation was also produced. Both mutants were bioactive in assays utilizing a luciferase reporter compared with wild type activin A (Fig. 4b), and stimulated FSH secretion from primary pituitary cells (data not shown). Both mutants also had binding affinities for ActRIIB similar to that of wild type activin (Fig. 4c). Activin mutants in which the ActRIIB-binding site amino acids His36, Tyr94, and Ile100 were substituted with the corresponding inhibin α subunit residues were biologically active in gonadotrope cell bioassays utilizing a luciferase reporter system, and retained wild type binding properties (Fig. 4, b and c). In contrast, A31Y had 2-fold lower affinity for binding to the ActRIIB, but retained normal biological activity (Fig. 4, b and c). Three concave surface activin A mutants, F16E, D96K, and K103E, exhibited normal bioactivity and binding characteristics (Figs. 4c and 6a), suggesting that alterations to the amino acid at these residues are not independently important to ActRIIB or ALK4 binding or biological activity. Like His36 and Tyr94 mentioned above, Phe16, Asp96, and Lys103 are located at the edge of the hydrophobic-rich pocket in the putative ALK4 binding site. Thus, of the 9 amino acids whose mutations have little effect upon bioactivity and receptor binding, 8 are situated on the outer edge of the receptor binding sites. Activin Mutants That Are Unable to Bind ActRIIB and Are Not Bioactive—The I30N, S90H, L92(A/R/T), and I100N activin A mutants were secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells, yet none bound ActRIIB with normal affinity or exhibited biological activity comparable with wild type activin A (Fig. 4, b and c). Thus, Ile30, Ser90, Leu92, and Ile100 are important to βA subunit interaction with ActRIIB. S90H and L92(R/T) are mutants in which an α subunit residue was substituted into the βA chain. The inability of these activin mutants to bind ActRIIB suggests that these residues are the key structural elements that define the functional difference between the βA and α subunits, and may be essential for inhibin antagonism of activin action through ActRIIB. The substitution of a polar asparagine for Ile100 may disrupt the packing of receptor and ligand surfaces during interaction. As mentioned above, a phenylalanine substitution at this position most likely stabilizes the hydrophobic interaction, leading to a higher observed binding affinity. Consistent with this finding, substitution of Ile30, which also packs against a hydrophobic-rich region of ActRIIB and interacts with Val73 of the receptor, with a non-conserved polar side chain (asparagine) resulted in loss of binding and bioactivity. βA subunit amino acids Trp28, Tyr35, and Tyr93 were predicted to bind ALK4. The α subunit has conserved residues in each of these positions, and the BMP2 amino acid sequence matches that of βA subunit exactly (TABLE ONE). Whereas each of these activin mutants is produced and secreted normally and can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the substitution of glutamic acid residues results in proteins that have reduced affinities for ActRIIB and are not bioactive (Figs. 4c and 6). The disruption of interaction is evident in immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments (Fig. 6B), but W28E, unlike Y35E and Y93E, appears to have complete loss of interaction with ALK4. Because the side chains of these residues on the βA subunit point into the concave (putative RI) interaction site (Fig. 1d), non-conserved changes to glutamic acid may alter the conformation of the finger region, also disrupting ActRIIB binding. An Activin Type IIB Mutant with Normal Bioactivity—Substitution of the α subunit tyrosine for Lys102 of the βA subunit produced an activin A mutant with normal activity in both luciferase and FSH secretion assays (Fig. 4b and data not shown). Interestingly, K102Y only competes weakly with radiolabeled purified activin A for binding to ActRIIB expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4c). To explore those contradictory results, we transfected LβT2 cells with an activin-responsive CAGA-luciferase reporter and a dominant negative ActRIIB receptor (DNRIIB), and treated the cells with activin A or K102Y mutant ligand (Fig. 5a). Introduction of the dominant negative receptor reduced luciferase activity following treatment with wild type activin A. Luciferase activity following treatment with K102Y, however, was not significantly altered in the presence of DNRIIB. Small interfering RNA technology was used to explore whether the K102Y mutant signals through the canonical activin pathway. Small interfering RNA directed toward the ALK4 receptor reduced luciferase activity in LβT2 cells treated with either wild type or K102Y mutant activin A (Fig. 5B). Small interfering RNA directed toward intracellular Smad3 also led to loss of bioactivity of both wild type and K102Y mutant activin A (Fig. 5c). K102Y interaction with ALK4 stimulated downstream phosphorylation of Smad2 and -3, and disruption of K102Y binding to the ALK4 inhibitor SB431542 resulted in loss of phosphorylation of both Smads as detected by immunoreactivity (Fig. 5d). Thus, the K102Y activin A mutant utilized the canonical activin signaling pathway. To assess the direct interaction between K102Y and cell surface receptors, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged ActRIIB and HA-tagged ALK4 receptor. Immunoprecipitation of receptor complexes from cells treated with wild type activin or the K102Y mutant indicated a reduced interaction of the mutant activin with ActRIIB compared with ALK4 binding (Fig. 5e). These data suggest that the K102Y activin A mutant may be functionally similar to several BMP ligands of the TGFβ superfamily, which have a higher affinity for their type I receptors. Activin Mutants That Bind ActRIIB but Not ALK4—As mentioned above, Ile30 packs against a hydrophobic-rich region of ActRIIB, and interacts with Val73 of the receptor, and the non-conserved change to a polar side chain (asparagine) resulted in complete loss of binding. Insertion of a more conservative valine to mimic the α subunit resulted in binding to ActRIIB with wild type affinity. However, the I30V mutant was not fully bioactive in any of the bioassays, suggesting that this mutant may affect downstream ALK4 binding and/or activation. Ile23, Trp25, Trp28, Tyr35, Tyr93, and Ile105 at a treatment concentration of 10 ng/ml failed to induce luciferase production above background levels in activin-responsive cells (data not shown). Increasing the concentration 10-fold resulted in a higher luciferase response only in cells treated with I23E (Fig. 6a). We evaluated the phosphorylation of Smad3 to assess whether intracellular signaling events occurred with treatment of cells with the mutant ligands. An expected increase in the Smad3 phosphorylation state was observed for cells treated with 100 ng/ml I23E (Fig. 6a). This suggests that this mutant has a lower affinity for ALK4, but that the interaction is not completely disrupted. IP experiments revealed that the W25E and I105E mutants bound to ActRIIB, but that binding of these mutants to ALK4 was disrupted (Fig. 6, b and c). Binding competition assays utilizing cells expressing only the type II receptor verified that the binding of W25E, and I105E, was similar to that of wild type activin A (Fig. 4c). We hypothesized that activin A mutants that exhibit normal binding to the type II receptor and disrupted ALK4 interaction would act as antagonists to wild type activin A signaling. The W25E mutant was purified, and its ability to disrupt activin A-stimulated luciferase production was assessed in LβT2 cells (Fig. 7). Two naturally occurring activin antagonists, inhibin A and follistatin, were also tested. At higher concentrations, W25E was able to disrupt activin A-stimulated luciferase activity better than inhibin A and comparable with Fst288. The physiological role of activin is constantly expanding, from its originally described function in reproduction to current evidence of its impact upon cell proliferation, changes in cell morphology, and its ability to recruit a wide number of cellular response factors (1Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar, 17Chang H. Lau A.L. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 180: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the activin signaling mechanism, as well as its interactions with binding proteins, is also important for understanding the function of other ligands and receptors of the TGFβ superfamily. An important difference between activin and the BMP and TGFβ ligand subfamilies is the antagonistic association between inhibin and activin, which has been extensively studied in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Understanding the mechanism of antagonism utilized by inhibin is relevant to a number of disease states, including early onset of menopause in women, and Sertoli cell disease in men. To explore the functional relationship between activin and inhibin from a structural perspective, we undertook a mutational analysis of two receptor binding regions on the surface of the βA subunit (TABLE TWO). The crystal structure of activin in complex with the type II receptor, ActRIIB, was integral to defining the interacting residues on the βA subunit (5Greenwald J. Vega M.E. Allendorph G.P. Fischer W.H. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 485-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Each subunit interacts with a single ActRIIB molecule on the convex surface of the ligand, creating a 1:2 ligand to receptor ratio. Equally important to our analysis was the determination of the binding affinity between inhibin A and ActRIIB (13Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W.
