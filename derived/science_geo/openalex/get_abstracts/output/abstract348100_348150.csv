https://openalex.org/W2105613536,"The c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor (Myc) is pathologically activated in many human malignancies. Myc is known to directly upregulate a pro-tumorigenic group of microRNAs (miRNAs) known as the miR-17-92 cluster. Through the analysis of human and mouse models of B cell lymphoma, we show here that Myc regulates a much broader set of miRNAs than previously anticipated. Unexpectedly, the predominant consequence of activation of Myc is widespread repression of miRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that much of this repression is likely to be a direct result of Myc binding to miRNA promoters. We further show that enforced expression of repressed miRNAs diminishes the tumorigenic potential of lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that extensive reprogramming of the miRNA transcriptome by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1967278561,"A major challenge in transplantation medicine is controlling the very strong immune responses to foreign antigens that are responsible for graft rejection. Although immunosuppressive drugs efficiently inhibit acute graft rejection, a substantial proportion of patients suffer chronic rejection that ultimately leads to functional loss of the graft. Induction of immunological tolerance to transplants would avoid rejection and the need for lifelong treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Tolerance to self-antigens is ensured naturally by several mechanisms; one major mechanism depends on the activity of regulatory T lymphocytes. Here we show that in mice treated with clinically acceptable levels of irradiation, regulatory CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells stimulated in vitro with alloantigens induced long-term tolerance to bone marrow and subsequent skin and cardiac allografts. Regulatory T cells specific for directly presented donor antigens prevented only acute rejection, despite hematopoietic chimerism. By contrast, regulatory T cells specific for both directly and indirectly presented alloantigens prevented both acute and chronic rejection. Our findings demonstrate the potential of appropriately stimulated regulatory T cells for future cell-based therapeutic approaches to induce lifelong immunological tolerance to allogeneic transplants."

https://openalex.org/W2122560272,"Economic choice entails assigning values to the available options and is impaired by lesions to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Recent results show that some neurons in the OFC encode the values that monkeys (Macaca mulatta) assign to different goods when they choose between them. A broad and fundamental question is how this neuronal representation of value depends on the behavioral context. Here we show that neuronal responses in the OFC are typically invariant for changes of menu. In other words, the activity of a neuron in response to one particular good usually does not depend on what other goods are available at the same time. Neurons in the OFC encode economic value, not relative preference. The fact that their responses are menu invariant suggests that transitivity, a fundamental trait of economic choice, may be rooted in the activity of individual neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2135721953,"Basal-like breast cancer (BBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with poor prognosis. Inherited mutations of BRCA1, a cancer susceptibility gene involved in double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair, lead to breast cancers that are nearly always of the BBC subtype; however, the precise molecular lesions and oncogenic consequences of BRCA1 dysfunction are poorly understood. Here we show that heterozygous inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene Pten leads to the formation of basal-like mammary tumors in mice, and that loss of PTEN expression is significantly associated with the BBC subtype in human sporadic and BRCA1-associated hereditary breast cancers. In addition, we identify frequent gross PTEN mutations, involving intragenic chromosome breaks, inversions, deletions and micro copy number aberrations, specifically in BRCA1-deficient tumors. These data provide an example of a specific and recurrent oncogenic consequence of BRCA1-dependent dysfunction in DNA repair and provide insight into the pathogenesis of BBC with therapeutic implications. These findings also argue that obtaining an accurate census of genes mutated in cancer will require a systematic examination for gross gene rearrangements, particularly in tumors with deficient DSB repair."
https://openalex.org/W1998202992,"High-content screening is transforming drug discovery by enabling simultaneous measurement of multiple features of cellular phenotype that are relevant to therapeutic and toxic activities of compounds. High-content screening studies typically generate immense datasets of image-based phenotypic information, and how best to mine relevant phenotypic data is an unsolved challenge. Here, we introduce factor analysis as a data-driven tool for defining cell phenotypes and profiling compound activities. This method allows a large data reduction while retaining relevant information, and the data-derived factors used to quantify phenotype have discernable biological meaning. We used factor analysis of cells stained with fluorescent markers of cell cycle state to profile a compound library and cluster the hits into seven phenotypic categories. We then compared phenotypic profiles, chemical similarity and predicted protein binding activities of active compounds. By integrating these different descriptors of measured and potential biological activity, we can effectively draw mechanism-of-action inferences."
https://openalex.org/W2020696713,"Satellite cells purified from adult skeletal muscle can participate extensively in muscle regeneration and can also re-populate the satellite cell pool, suggesting that they have direct therapeutic potential for treating degenerative muscle diseases. The paired-box transcription factor Pax7 is required for satellite cells to generate committed myogenic progenitors. In this study we undertook a multi-level approach to define the role of Pax7 in satellite cell function. Using comparative microarray analysis, we identified several novel and strongly regulated targets; in particular, we identified Myf5 as a gene whose expression was regulated by Pax7. Using siRNA, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies we confirmed that Myf5 is directly regulated by Pax7 in myoblasts derived from satellite cells. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry were used to purify Pax7 together with its co-factors. This revealed that Pax7 associates with the Wdr5-Ash2L-MLL2 histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex that directs methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4, refs 4-10). Binding of the Pax7-HMT complex to Myf5 resulted in H3K4 tri-methylation of surrounding chromatin. Thus, Pax7 induces chromatin modifications that stimulate transcriptional activation of target genes to regulate entry into the myogenic developmental programme."

https://openalex.org/W2087694981,"The involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mosquito immunity against bacteria and Plasmodium was investigated in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Strains of An. gambiae with higher systemic levels of ROS survive a bacterial challenge better, whereas reduction of ROS by dietary administration of antioxidants significantly decreases survival, indicating that ROS are required to mount effective antibacterial responses. Expression of several ROS detoxification enzymes increases in the midgut and fat body after a blood meal. Furthermore, expression of several of these enzymes increases to even higher levels when mosquitoes are fed a Plasmodium berghei-infected meal, indicating that the oxidative stress after a blood meal is exacerbated by Plasmodium infection. Paradoxically, a complete lack of induction of catalase mRNA and lower catalase activity were observed in P. berghei-infected midguts. This suppression of midgut catalase expression is a specific response to ookinete midgut invasion and is expected to lead to higher local levels of hydrogen peroxide. Further reduction of catalase expression by double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing promoted parasite clearance by a lytic mechanism and reduced infection significantly. High mosquito mortality is often observed after P. berghei infection. Death appears to result in part from excess production of ROS, as mortality can be decreased by oral administration of uric acid, a strong antioxidant. We conclude that ROS modulate An. gambiae immunity and that the mosquito response to P. berghei involves a local reduction of detoxification of hydrogen peroxide in the midgut that contributes to limit Plasmodium infection through a lytic mechanism.

The Anopheles gambiae mosquito is the most important vector of human malaria in Africa, a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that affects more than 500 million people every year and causes more than one million deaths (1Organization World Health Global Malaria Report 2005. World Health Organization, Geneva2005Google Scholar). The mosquito is infected upon ingestion of Plasmodium gametocytes that transform to gametes. Their fertilization takes place in the lumen of the midgut and gives rise to motile ookinetes that traverse midgut epithelial cells and develop into oocysts. Oocyst formation is a bottleneck in the parasite life cycle, as most parasites die either during midgut invasion or as they come in contact with components of the mosquito immune system present in the hemolymph (2Ghosh A.

In vertebrates, activated macrophages undergo a respiratory burst in which superoxide anion (O2·¯) is produced by a NADPH oxidase and transformed to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Subsequently, myeloperoxidase uses H2O2 as a substrate and produces hypochlorous acid (HOClO), a highly bactericidal compound. Insect hemocytes (functionally similar to vertebrate neutrophils and macrophages) are also capable of generating a respiratory burst (11Lavine M.D. Strand M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol.

ROS are potentially toxic to the host, so it is important that they be generated transiently and kept well localized. Host cells are protected from oxidative damage by enzymes that detoxify ROS such as SOD that detoxifies O2·¯, and catalase, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and thioredoxin peroxidase that detoxify H2O2. We have previously shown that differences in systemic levels of ROS in the mosquito influence melanotic encapsulation responses against Plasmodium (7Kumar S. Christophides G.K. Cantera R. Charles B. Han Y.S. Meister S. Dimopoulos G. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14139-14144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A mosquito strain genetically selected to be highly susceptible (S) to Plasmodium has lower levels of hemolymph H2O2 than the unselected G3 strain. Furthermore, a strain that has been selected to melanize Plasmodium and is refractory (R) to infection has significantly higher levels (2–3 times) than the parental G3 and the S strains (7Kumar S. Christophides G.K. Cantera R. Charles B. Han Y.S. Meister S. Dimopoulos G. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dietary supplementation of R females with antioxidants decreases hemolymph levels of H2O2 and inhibits parasite melanization (7Kumar S. Christophides G.K. Cantera R. Charles B. Han Y.S. Meister S.

In this study we explore how differences in ROS levels affect mosquito survival after a bacterial challenge. Ookinete development and midgut invasion take place in the complex environment of a blood meal undergoing digestion. Blood-meal digestion and absorption by the midgut provides the nutrients required for oogenesis (16Raikhel A.S. Dhadialla T.S. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 217-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The fat body uses amino acids obtained from the blood meal to synthesize vitellogenin, a major storage protein that is transported into the developing oocyte. These metabolic changes are expected to increase the rate of ROS generated, and indeed, H2O2 levels in hemolymph increase, and midgut expression of ROS detoxifying enzymes is induced 24 h post-feeding (PF) (7Kumar S.

In this study we investigate how ingestion of a Plasmodium-infected meal affects ROS production and detoxification. Our results indicate that Plasmodium infection exacerbates systemic oxidative stress after a blood meal and can result in substantial mosquito mortality. Paradoxically, at the local level midgut epithelial cells suppress expression of catalase, a major enzyme involved in H2O2 detoxification, in response to ookinete invasion. Reduced catalase activity is expected to increase local levels of H2O2. Further reducing catalase expression by dsRNA-mediated silencing decreases ookinete survival in G3 females through a lytic mechanism that does not involve melanization. We propose that, besides the well characterized strategy of increasing ROS production in response to pathogens, local reductions in ROS detoxification enzymes can also contribute to increased local ROS concentration as immune effector molecules. An. gambiae Strains and Malaria ParasitesThree An. gambiae strains were used: the refractory L3–5 (R) (22Collins F.H. Sakai R.K. Vernick K.D. Paskewitz S. Seeley D.C. Miller L.H. Collins W.E.

Ansorge W. Kafatos F.C. Collins F.H. Science. 1997; 276: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mosquitoes were reared at 27 °C and 80% humidity on a 12-h light-dark cycle under standard laboratory conditions. The two Plasmodium berghei strains used, ANKA 234 and CTRP– (24Dessens J.T. Beetsma A.L. Dimopoulos G. Wengelnik K. Crisanti A. Kafatos F.C. Sinden R.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6221-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), were maintained by serial passage in 3–4-week-old female BALB/c mice or as frozen stocks. Bacterial Challenge of MosquitoesThree-day-old adult females were injected with a mixture of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. Bacterial cultures were grown to an optical density of 0.5 (600 nm) in LB broth, and 200 μl from each culture were mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 125 μl of PBS. Mosquito survival was monitored daily for 8 days after intrathoracic injection of 0.138 μl of either PBS or bacterial suspension using a microinjection system and a micromanipulator (Nanoject II microinjection system; Drummond). Three groups of 30 mosquitoes were used for each treatment, and survival curves were analyzed by the log rank survival test (SigmaStat). Antioxidant feeding of female mosquitoes began from emergence with 10% sugar solution supplemented with either 25 mg/ml vitamin C or 1 mg/ml uric acid. H2O2 Injection of MosquitoesSugar-fed 4-day-old An. gambiae G3 females were injected as above with 18 nmol of H2O2 (in 69 nl); controls received H2O injection. Mosquitoes were kept at 27 °C, and 6 h after treatment, groups of 10 were collected. P. berghei Infection of MosquitoesFemale mosquitoes (5 days old) were infected with P. berghei by feeding on anesthetized infected BALB/c mice. The infectivity of the mice was established by determining the parasitemia and by performing an exflagellation assay as described previously (25Billker O. Shaw M.K. Margos G. Sinden R.E. Parasitology. 1997; 115: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In all the studies mice having parasitemias between 4 and 8% and 2–3 exflagellations/field under 400× magnification were used to infect mosquitoes. Blood-fed infected and control mosquitoes were kept at 21 °C and 80% humidity. P. berghei midgut infection was quantified 24 and 48 h post-infection (PI) by immunofluorescence using mouse anti Pbs21 antibody as previously described (26Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) or by light microscopy 11 days PI with mercurochrome staining (0.05% in water). Quantitation of Gene ExpressionMosquito midguts and abdominal walls containing fat body were dissected on ice-cold Ashburner-PBS, placed in ice-cold RNAlater (Ambion), and stored at –70 °C until mRNA extraction. Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from groups of 10 midguts or 10 abdominal walls using Oligotex-dT beads (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene expression was assessed by SYBR green quantitative real-time PCR (DyNAmo HS; New England Biolabs) in a Chromo4 system (Bio-Rad). PCR involved an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, 44 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Fluorescence readings were taken at 72 °C after each cycle. A final extension at 72 °C for 5 min was completed before deriving a melting curve (70–95 °C) to confirm the identity of the PCR product. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements were made in duplicate. Relative quantitation results were normalized with An. gambiae ribosomal protein S7 as internal standard and analyzed by the 2–ΔΔCt method (27Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). The annotated An. gambiae genome contains four genes coding for SOD (mitochondrial Mn-SOD (ENSANGP00000020588), CuZn-SOD2 (ENSANGP00000015824), and two CuZn-SOD3 (ENSANGG00000013675) splice forms, CuZn-SOD3A (ENSANGP-00000016164) and CuZn-SOD3B (ENSANGP-00000032094)) and catalase (ENSANGP-00000021298) and Gpx (ENSANGP00000013972). Primers used and amplified product length (bp) were the following (5′-3′): S7 (149 bp) forward (F)-AGAACCAGCAGACCACCATC, reverse (R)-GCTGCAAACTTCGGCTATTC; catalase (276 bp) F-GGATAAGGTGACGGCTACGA, R-GAGAAGCGTACGGCTAGTGG; Gpx (98 bp) F-CAAGGTGCTGCTAATCGTCA, R-CCTTATCCGCGTACTTCTGC; Mn-SOD (136 bp) F-GGAGCACTCTTTTCCACTGC, R-GGTGGTGAAGCTCCATGATT; CuZn-SOD 2 (171 bp) F-CACATTCACGAGAAGGTGA, R-CGTGTCCGAGTAGGACGTTT; CuZnSOD3A (310 bp) F-GGTAGACTTGACCGCTACGC, R-GCTCAGTTCATGTCCCCCTA; CuZnSOD3B (133 bp) F-TCGGTAACATCGTGGCCTAT, R-CGCCCTAAATCATCCTCTA. Hemolymph H2O2 QuantitationMosquito hemolymph was collected by flushing the hemocoel. The cuticle from the last abdominal segment was torn open, 8 μl of PBS containing 2 mg/ml catalase inhibitor 3-amino-triazole (AT) were injected into the thorax, and 5 μl of flushed hemolymph was collected from the aperture in the posterior end. Hemolymph from five mosquitoes was pooled together and analyzed for H2O2 using the Amplex red assay fluorimetric test (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions. Catalase Activity AssayMidguts and abdominal walls of adult An. gambiae G3 females were dissected in PBS 24 h PF, and the blood meal was carefully removed. Groups of 10 midguts or 10 abdominal walls were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C until assayed. Catalase activity was measured as AT-inhibitable H2O2 degradation with a spectrophotometric assay (Sigma, CAT100). Briefly, samples were homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Homogenate was centrifuged 2 min at 16 × g, and supernatant was separated for the assay. Half of each supernatant received a final concentration of 60 mm AT. The catalase assay was initiated by mixing 15 μl of supernatant with 50 mm H2O2 in a 100-μl total volume. The reaction was carried at room temperature for 5 min and stopped with 900 μl of 15 mm sodium azide. H2O2 was measured colorimetrically with 10 μl of reaction mix with 1 ml of 150 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 2 mm 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzen-sulfonic acid and horseradish peroxidase, and after a 15-min room temperature incubation, absorbance was read at 520 nm. Protein quantitation of midgut and abdominal wall homogenates was done with the micro BCA protein assay (Pierce). dsRNA-mediated Catalase KnockdownA 496-bp DNA fragment of catalase was amplified by PCR from a full-length catalase cDNA using the primers Cat-forward (5′-GCAACAATACGCCCATCTTCTTCA-3′) and Cat-reverse (5′-GGAATGAGCGGGAATTCGTT-3′) and cloned into the pCR®II-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). T7 polymerase promoter sites were incorporated onto both ends of this fragment by amplification with the following vector primers: forward 5′-CTCGAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTAGTAACGGCCGCCAGTGT-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCGAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCCAGTGTGATGGATATCTGC-3′. The PCR product was used as template to synthesize double-stranded catalase RNA in vitro using the MEGAscript RNA-mediated interference kit (Ambion). dsRNA was further purified with water and concentrated to 3 μg/μl using a Microcon YM-100 filter (Millipore). Each female mosquito was injected with 69 nl (207 ng of dsRNA) at 1–2 days post-emergence using a Nanoject II microinjection system (Drummond). A 218-bp fragment of the LacZ gene was amplified using the primers LacZ-forward (5′-GAGTCAGTGAGCGAGGAAGC-3′) and LacZ-reverse (5′-TATCCGCTCACAATTCCACA-3′), cloned into the pCR®II-TOPO® vector, and used to generate a 492-bp dsLacZ RNA using primers M13F (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and XhoI-T7-M13R (5′-CTCGAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′). In all experiments control females were injected with 69 nl (207 ng) of dsLacZ and fed on the same Plasmodium-infected mouse as the double-stranded catalase-injected group. Antioxidant Supplementation and Mosquito Survival after P. berghei InfectionMosquitoes received 1 mg/ml uric acid in 10% sucrose beginning 3 days post-emergence. Mosquitoes were blood-fed a control or infected mouse 5 days post-emergence. Three groups of 30 mosquitoes were used for each treatment, and survival curves were analyzed by the log rank survival test (SigmaStat). ROS Levels Affect the Mosquito's Immune Response against BacteriaWe took advantage of the genetic differences in systemic H2O2 levels between mosquito strains (R > G3 > S) (7Kumar S. Christophides G.K. Cantera R. Charles B. Han Y.S. Meister S. Dimopoulos G. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14139-14144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) to investigate whether ROS have a general effect in the mosquito's immune competence. Groups of 3-day-old females from each strain were challenged by injecting them with a fixed bacterial dose, and their survival followed over time. Susceptibility to bacterial infection of the three An. gambiae strains correlated directly with their systemic levels of H2O2 (Fig. 1A). The survival of R females, which have the highest H2O2 levels, was significantly higher. Conversely, survival of the S strain, which has the lowest level of H2O2, was significantly reduced (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, reduction of ROS in G3 mosquitoes by dietary supplementation with vitamin C or uric acid (strong antioxidants) dramatically decreased survival after bacterial challenge (Fig. 1, B and C). Vitamin C feeding also decreased the survival of mosquitoes injected with sterile PBS, but the effect was relatively mild compared with that seen in the bacteria-challenged group (Fig. 1B). Uric acid feeding did not affect mortality of uninjected mosquitoes compared with control uninjected mosquitoes (Fig. 1C). Together, these data indicate that ROS levels greatly influence the mosquito's capacity to mount an effective immune response against bacteria. Blood-fed Females Respond to Oxidative Stress by Increasing Systemic Expression of ROS Detoxification EnzymesCells protect themselves from ROS damage by inducing the expression of enzymes involved in detoxification such as SOD (superoxide anion detoxification), catalase, and Gpx (H2O2 detoxification). We have previously shown that the rate and magnitude of midgut induction of catalase and CuZnSOD2 expression after a blood meal is directly correlated with the ROS levels in a given An. gambiae strain. For example, induction of these two enzymes is faster and higher in the R strain, which has the highest ROS levels (7Kumar S. Christophides G.K. Cantera R. Charles B. Han Y.S. Meister S. Dimopoulos G. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14139-14144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To establish whether mRNA levels of ROS detoxification enzymes could be used as indicators of oxidative stress in different tissues, the response of An. gambiae G3 females to H2O2 was directly tested. Injection of H2O2 into adult females induces a 3- and 2-fold increase in catalase and Gpx mRNA levels, respectively (Fig. 2A), indicating that expression on these enzymes appears to respond to oxidative stress. We analyzed the kinetics of mRNA expression for catalase, Gpx, MnSOD (mitochondrial enzyme), and cytosolic CuZn-SODs (CuZnSOD2-3) in the midgut and fat body after blood feeding (Fig. 2B) as putative indicators of oxidative stress. Blood-fed G3 females were kept at 27 °C. Catalase, CuZnSOD2, and CuZnSOD3A mRNAs are induced in both the midgut and fat body. CuZnSOD3B, however, is only induced in the midgut, whereas Gpx and MnSOD induction is limited to the fat body (Fig. 2B). In general, genes are induced earlier in the midgut where inductions are already detected by 12 h PF, whereas expression in the fat body tends to peak later (24–36 h PF) (Fig. 2B). Plasmodium Infection Exacerbates the Oxidative Stress Induced by Blood FeedingWe tested the hypothesis that Plasmodium infection would increase systemic oxidative stress in the mosquito. This was done by comparing the mRNA expression of ROS detoxification enzymes in G3 females fed on P. berghei-infected or uninfected mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Blood-fed mosquitoes were kept at 21 °C, a temperature permissive for P. berghei development. At this lower temperature MnSOD was the only enzyme induced by 24 h PF in the fat body of females fed uninfected blood relative to sugar-fed controls (Fig. 3A). Overall, the level of induction of all genes in the fat body after an uninfected blood meal is lower when mosquitoes are kept at 21 °C than at 27 °C (see Fig. 2B). P. berghei-infected mosquitoes respond very differently, and the expression of catalase, Gpx, MnSOD, and CuZnSOD3A mRNA is significantly induced in the fat body compared with control blood-fed mosquitoes. Thus, P. berghei infection appears to exacerbate the oxidative stress induced by blood feeding. Hemolymph H2O2 levels also increase significantly 24 h after the ingestion of either an uninfected or a P. berghei-infected blood meal, but no significant difference was detected between these two groups (Table 1). Therefore, it appears that induction of ROS detoxification genes by Plasmodium infection prevents a further increase in hemolymph H2O2 levels.TABLE 1Effect of blood feeding on An. gambiae G3 hemolymph H2O2 levelsSampleH2O2 levelsaResults are expressed as the mean ± S.E. 24 h PFpmol/mosquitoSF22.5 ± 2.2bSignificantly different (analysis of variance; p < 0.05).BF44.5 ± 6.8BI54.5 ± 4.3a Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E.b Significantly different (analysis of variance; p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Plasmodium Infection Suppresses Induction of Catalase Expression in the MidgutIn general, midgut mRNA levels of most detoxification enzymes increase in both P. berghei-infected or uninfected An. gambiae G3 controls (Fig. 3B). Expression of Gpx and CuZnSOD3A is significantly higher in infected midguts, similar to the response observed in the fat body tissue. Induction of MnSOD was similar in control and infected blood-fed mosquitoes 16 h PF, but mRNA levels decreased significantly 24 h PF in the infected group; however, the most striking and unexpected difference was a complete lack of induction of catalase mRNA in the midgut of P. berghei-infected mosquitoes 24 h PF. Midgut catalase activity was directly measured in midgut extracts 24 h PF and was also found to be significantly lower in Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes relative to the uninfected blood-fed controls (Table 2).TABLE 2Effect of P. berghei infection on An. gambiae G3 midgut catalase activityBlood mealCatalase activityaResults are expressed as the mean ± S.E. 24 h PFnmol H2O2/min/μg proteinBF247 ± 15BI196 ± 2bSignificantly different from control (t test, p < 0.05).a Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E.b Significantly different from control (t test, p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab To further investigate the mechanism by which Plasmodium suppresses catalase expression, we compared the induction of catalase between mosquitoes kept at a temperature permissive for P. berghei infection (21 °C) with those kept at 27 °C PF. At this higher temperature, ookinetes do not form, and parasite midgut invasion is prevented. Suppression of catalase induction in infected midguts (kept at 21 °C) was confirmed (Fig. 4); however, when ookinete formation was prevented by keeping mosquitoes at 27 °C, a robust induction of catalase was observed. This rules out the possibility that the lack of catalase induction in infected midguts is due to some inhibitory component(s) present in infected mouse blood. Induction of catalase mRNA in uninfected midguts is higher when mosquitoes are kept at a higher temperature (about 2.5-fold at 21 °C and more than 5-fold at 27 °C) (Fig. 4). To investigate the possibility that early zygotes or ookinetes secrete a soluble factor that suppresses catalase expression, induction of catalase mRNA in midguts infected with parasites in which the CTRP gene has been disrupted (CTRP–) was evaluated. The CTRP– mutant strain forms ookinetes that are unable to effectively invade the midgut. The induction of midgut catalase in response to CTRP– parasites was similar to that of uninfected controls, indicating that ookinete invasion is necessary for suppression of catalase expression in the midgut (Fig. 4). dsRNA-mediated Knockdown of Mosquito Catalase Reduces Plasmodium InfectionTo test the hypothesis that reducing catalase expression is an effective mechanism to limit Plasmodium infection, catalase expression was reduced systemically by dsRNA-mediated silencing in G3 An. gambiae females. A reduction of catalase mRNA expression of 50% was achieved 24 h PI in the whole mosquito and resulted in a decrease of 87 and 94% of catalase activity in the midgut and the fat body, respectively (Fig. 5A). Catalase knockdown led to a 39% increase in hemolymph H2O2 (Fig. 5A), consistent with the importance of catalase in H2O2 clearance. Catalase knockdown also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of parasites present in the midgut 1, 2, and 11 days PI (Fig. 5, B–D). The number of ookinetes present 1 and 2 days PI was determined by immunofluorescence; only intact parasites were counted. Reduced catalase expression resulted in extensive ookinete lysis by 2 days PI (Fig. 5C), suggesting that parasites are very labile to increased hydrogen peroxide levels during their transit through the midgut epithelium.

https://openalex.org/W2090590520,"Posttranslational modifications of histones such as methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Here we show that protein-kinase-C-related kinase 1 (PRK1) phosphorylates histone H3 at threonine 11 (H3T11) upon ligand-dependent recruitment to androgen receptor target genes. PRK1 is pivotal to androgen receptor function because PRK1 knockdown or inhibition impedes androgen receptor-dependent transcription. Blocking PRK1 function abrogates androgen-induced H3T11 phosphorylation and inhibits androgen-induced demethylation of histone H3. Moreover, serine-5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II is no longer observed at androgen receptor target promoters. Phosphorylation of H3T11 by PRK1 accelerates demethylation by the Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain-containing protein JMJD2C. Thus, phosphorylation of H3T11 by PRK1 establishes a novel chromatin mark for gene activation, identifying PRK1 as a gatekeeper of androgen receptor-dependent transcription. Importantly, levels of PRK1 and phosphorylated H3T11 correlate with Gleason scores of prostate carcinomas. Finally, inhibition of PRK1 blocks proliferation of androgen receptor-induced tumour cell proliferation, making PRK1 a promising therapeutic target."

LD is caused by mutations in either the E3 ubiquitin ligase malin or the dual specificity phosphatase laforin. A hallmark of LD is the accumulation of insoluble glycogen in the cytoplasm of cells from most tissues. Glycogen metabolism is regulated by phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes. One regulator of this phosphorylation is protein targeting to glycogen (PTG/R5), a scaffold protein that binds both glycogen and many of the enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis, including protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and laforin. Overexpression of PTG markedly increases glycogen accumulation, and decreased PTG expression decreases glycogen stores. To investigate if malin and laforin play a role in glycogen metabolism, we overexpressed PTG, malin, and laforin in tissue culture cells. We found that expression of malin or laforin decreased PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation by 25%, and co-expression of malin and laforin abolished PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation. Consistent with this result, we found that malin ubiquitinates PTG in a laforin-dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro, and targets PTG for proteasome-dependent degradation. These results suggest an additional mechanism, involving laforin and malin, in regulating glycogen metabolism.

LD is unique among the progressive myoclonus epilepsies because of the rapid neurological deterioration of the patient and the accumulation of cytoplasmic non-proteinacious inclusion bodies called Lafora bodies (LBs).LBs develop in the cytoplasm of cells from multiple tissues, including brain, kidney, skin, liver, and cardiac and skeletal muscle (1Lafora G.R.

Like glycogen, LBs are composed of α1,4-glycosidic linkages between glucose residues with α1,6 branches. However, unlike glycogen the branching in LBs is not as ordered and branches occur far less frequently, every 15–30 glucose monomers versus every 12–14 for glycogen (10Sakai M. Austin J. Witmer F. Trueb L. Neurology. 1970; 20: 160-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yokoi S. Austin J. Witmer F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1967; 26: 125-127PubMed Google Scholar). Another naturally occurring carbohydrate that is similar to LBs is plant amylopectin, the major component of plant starch. Amylopectin is also composed of α1,4-glycosidic linkages between glucose residues with α1,6 branches occurring every 12–20 residues. Accordingly, multiple studies have found that the biochemical properties of LBs resemble amylopectin (10Sakai M. Austin J. Witmer F. Trueb L.

Intriguingly, of the 128 human phosphatases laforin is the only phosphatase that possesses a CBM of any type.

Consistent with this precedence, we demonstrated that laforin and a laforin-like protein from plants, called SEX4 (20Niittyla T. Comparot-Moss S. Lue W.-L. Messerli G. Trevisan M. Seymour M.D.J.

Two laboratories have shown that the RING domain of malin functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (23Lohi H. Ianzano L. Zhao X.-C. Chan E.M. Turnbull J. Scherer S.W. Ackerley C.A. Minassian B.A. Hum.

Additionally, we found that malin directly binds and ubiquitinates laforin, and targets laforin for degradation (26Gentry M.S. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Malin was recently shown to ubiquitinate glycogen debranching enzyme (AGL/GDE) and target it for degradation as well (29Cheng A. Zhang M. Gentry M.S. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Saltiel A.R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2399-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Herein, we demonstrate that malin also ubiquitinates protein targeting to glycogen (PTG/R5), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This ubiquitination both targets PTG for degradation and inhibits glycogen accumulation. Additionally, PTG ubiquitination, both in vivo and in vitro, is dependent on the presence of laforin. Despite the ubiquitination of PTG by malin, we were unable to detect a direct interaction between malin and PTG and postulate that laforin acts as a scaffold protein to facilitate PTG ubiquitination by malin. These results suggest that malin degrades multiple enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism to tightly control this process. Thus, when malin is defective glycogen metabolism proceeds aberrantly and LBs are produced.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Proteins–Laforin and malin constructs and protein purification were described previously (18Wang J.

Glycogen was hydrolyzed to glucose with 500 μl of 250 milliunits/ml amyloglucosidase (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 2–8 h with constant rocking. Samples were neutralized with 125 μl of 0.5 m NaOH and cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g. Glucose concentrations were determined using the Roche Applied Science d-glucose determination kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. 50–200 μl of cell lysate was added to a hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, and the resulting NADPH was measured at 340 nm.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay–In vitro ubiquitin assays were performed as previously described (26Gentry M.S. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with the following changes. PTG was used as a substrate instead of laforin. 35S-Labeled PTG was made in vitro using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), it was then immunoprecipitated out of the reaction mixture with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), washed three times with ubiquitin assay buffer, and eluted into 50 μl of assay buffer with 10 μg of FLAG peptide (Sigma). 6 μl of immunopurified 35S-PTG was used in each reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Reaction products were separated, transferred, and subjected to Western analysis using avidin-HRP (Boston Biochem) to detect biotinylated ubiquitin. After detection, blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% NaN3 to abolish the HRP signal, dried, and exposed on film to detect 35S-PTG.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBecause LD patients develop cytoplasmic accumulations of insoluble carbohydrate, the disease likely involves the mis-regulation of glycogen metabolism. The enzymes regulating glycogen metabolism, as well as detailed mechanisms of how these enzymes are modulated, have been elucidated over the past 40 years (32Roach P.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 33Roach P.J. Skurat A.V. Harris R.A. Jefferson L.S. Cherrington A.D. The Endocrine Pancreas and Regulation of Metabolism.

Glycogen metabolism is subject to multiple levels of regulation all of which impinge on glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis, and/or phosphorylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorolysis of the α1,4-glycosidic linkages.One regulator of these enzymes is PTG (gene PPP1R3C), a regulatory subunit of PP1. PTG is expressed in all tissues except testis, and is most abundant in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver (36Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). PTG binds both glycogen and the primary enzymes involved in regulating glycogen metabolism, phosphorylase, and glycogen synthase (37Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Two groups have shown that disruption of the PTG gene product substantially decreases glycogen stores in tissue culture cells and a mouse model (38Crosson S.M. Khan A. Printen J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Greenberg C.C. Danos A.M. Brady M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, PTG directly interacts with laforin (40Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Criado-Garcia O. Heath K.E. Garcia-Fojeda B. Medrano-Fernandez I. Gomez-Garre P. Sanz P. Serratosa J.M. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3161-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we hypothesized that laforin and/or malin might inhibit the activity of PTG, either directly or indirectly.Co-expression of Malin and Laforin Reduces Glycogen Accumulation–Overexpression of PTG leads to an increase in glycogen accumulation in tissue culture cells and ex vivo organ models (41Gasa R.

Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We sought to test the hypothesis that malin and laforin oppose the action of PTG. To gain insights into the mechanistic nature that malin and laforin play in glycogen metabolism, we measured glycogen accumulation in tissue culture cells expressing various combinations of PTG, laforin, and malin.We utilized CHO-IR cells because they do not express PTG and produce a minimal amount of glycogen under normal tissue culture conditions (Fig. 1, A and B) (37Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, they exhibit a 7-fold increase in glycogen production when transfected with PTG (Fig. 1, A and B) (37Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We transfected CHO-IR cells with a combination of PTG, laforin, and/or malin to determine how laforin and malin affect glycogen stores. Cells transfected with PTG and either laforin or malin yielded a 25% reduction in glycogen amounts compared with cells transfected with PTG and a vector control (Fig. 1A). This reduction was not dependent on the phosphatase activity of laforin, because transfection with PTG and the catalytically inactive laforinC266S yielded a similar reduction in glycogen stores (Fig. 1A). However, the reduction was dependent on the protein-protein interaction domain of malin. Cells transfected with PTG and a LD disease mutation in the NHL domain of malin, malinE280K, contained similar glycogen stores as vector control cells (Fig. 1A). The effect of malin and laforin in concert was quite striking. Cells transfected with PTG, malin, and laforin contained a similar amount of glycogen as cells transfected with a vector control (Fig. 1A). Therefore, malin and laforin each independently decreased PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation, and cumulatively, they essentially eliminated PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation.To determine whether this result was a nonspecific affect of overexpressing an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we transfected cells with PTG and MDM2, the E3 ligase that negatively regulates p53 (45Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 46Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar, 47Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Whereas cells transfected with wild-type malin decreased PTG-stimulated glycogen stores, MDM2 did not reduce PTG-stimulated glycogen stores (Fig. 1B). In a similar manner, we wished to ensure that simply overexpression of another gene or the addition of another plasmid did not reduce PTG-stimulated glycogen stores. Therefore, we transiently expressed PTG and either DJ-1, a protein involved in Parkinson disease, or pEB6 (empty vector). In each case the transfected cells accumulated a similar amount of PTG-stimulated glycogen stores as PTG alone (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the decrease in PTG-stimulated glycogen stores was not an artifact generated by a second vector, another gene being expressed, or expression of another E3 ubiquitin ligase.PTG is one of five regulatory subunits that target PP1 to glycogen and modulate glycogen accumulation (36Armstrong C.G.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We investigated if malin and laforin specifically inhibit PTG-stimulated glycogen stores, or if they inhibit stimulated glycogen stores of other PTG family members. PTG and R6 (gene PPP1R3D) are expressed in a wide range of human tissues, including the brain (36Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The other three PP1 targeting subunits display tissue-specific expression patterns in skeletal muscle, and/or heart and liver tissue (48Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 49Munro S. Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Diplexcito J. Cohen P.T.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One such subunit is GL (gene PPP1R3B), which is expressed in muscle and liver tissue (48Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 50Munro S. Cuthbertson D.J. Cunningham J. Sales M. Cohen P.T. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis, we transfected cells with PTG, R6, or GL alone, and along with malin and laforin. As expected, PTG, R6, and GL all stimulated increased glycogen accumulation (Fig. 1C). Malin and laforin inhibited R6-stimulated glycogen accumulation, but they did not inhibit GL-stimulated glycogen accumulation (Fig. 1C). Therefore, malin and laforin inhibit PP1 regulatory subunit-stimulated glycogen accumulation of some PP1 regulatory subunits, PTG/R5 and R6, but not all of them. Interestingly these are the only two regulatory subunits that exhibit a wide expression pattern and are expressed in brain tissue (36Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that needs a soluble form of receptor called sIL-6R to exert its effects in some cellular models. In that case, sIL-6R exerts agonistic action. This mechanism can make up for the partial or total absence of membrane-anchored IL-6 receptors in some cell types, such as chondrocytes. Our study shows that IL-6, sIL-6R, or both inhibit type II collagen production by rabbit articular chondrocytes through a transcriptional control. The cytokine and/or sIL-6R repress COL2A1 transcription by a -63/-35 sequence that binds Sp1·Sp3. Indeed, IL-6 and/or sIL-6R inhibit Sp1 and Sp3 expression and their binding activity to the 63-bp promoter. In chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, IL-6·sIL-6R induced an increase in Sp3 recruitment to the detriment of Sp1. Knockdown of Sp1·Sp3 by small interference RNA and decoy strategies were found to prevent the IL-6- and/or sIL-6R-induced inhibition of COL2A1 transcription, indicating that each of these Sp proteins is required for down-regulation of the target gene and that a heterotypic Sp1·Sp3 complex is involved. Additionally, Sp1 was shown to interact with Sp3 and HDAC1. Indeed, overexpression of a full-length Sp3 cDNA blocked the Sp1 up-regulation of the 63-bp COL2A1 promoter activity, and by itself, inhibits COL2A1 transcription. We can conclude that IL-6, sIL-6R, or both in combination decrease both the Sp1·Sp3 ratio and DNA-binding activities, thus inhibiting COL2A1 transcription.

Type II collagen is the major collagen synthesized by chondrocytes in mature articular cartilage. Each α1(II) procollagen chain of the triple helix is encoded by the COL2A1 gene, whose transcription is regulated by DNA elements within both the promoter and the first intron regions (2Sandell L.J.

In healthy cartilage, chondrocytes maintain steady-state expression of collagens and PGs and are sensitive to a number of growth factors and cytokines that either enhance or reduce type II collagen synthesis. In osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, structural and functional breakdown of the ECM is accompanied by phenotypic changes of the resident chondrocytes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ play key roles in these pathologies, inducing overexpression of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and decreased synthesis of tissue-specific macromolecules, including type II collagen and aggrecan (9Goldring S.R. Goldring M.B. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2004; 427: S27-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). IL-6 expression, which is induced by IL-1, is likely to take part in the degradation process. IL-6 cytokine family consists of IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor (10Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cardiotrophin-1 (11Senaldi G. Varnum B.C. Sarmiento U. Starnes C. Lili J. Scully S. Guo J. Elliott G. McNinch J. Shaklee C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11458-11463Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (12Kishimoto T. Blood. 1989; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These factors activate target genes involved in hematopoiesis as well as in acute-phase and immune responses of the organism (12Kishimoto T. Blood. 1989; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokines of the IL-6 family bind to plasma membrane receptor complexes containing the common signal transducing receptor chain glycoprotein 130 (gp130). Signal transduction generally involves the activation of Janus kinase tyrosine kinase family members, leading to the activation of transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Another major signaling pathway for the cytokines of the IL-6 family is the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (13Heinrich P.C. Behrmann L. I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 14Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). IL-6 binds to a specific IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and this complex associates with two molecules of the ubiquitously expressed gp130 leading to initiation of signaling (15Jones S.A. Rose-John S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Taga T. Kishimoto T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although cells that do not express IL-6R are nonresponsive to IL-6 alone, these cells can be stimulated by a complex of IL-6 and its soluble IL-6R (15Jones S.A. Rose-John S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T.

Commun. 1992; 189: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the cells that release the soluble IL-6R render other cells that only express gp130 responsive toward IL-6, through a pathway named transsignaling (20Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that IL-6 and its soluble receptor are implicated in both inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases. First, increased levels of IL-6 and sIL-6R have been found in synovial fluids and sera from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients (21Kaneko S. Satoh T. Chiba J. Cytokines Cell Mol. Ther. 2000; 6: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and these levels correlate with the increased leukocyte infiltration in synovial tissue (22Desgeorges A. Gabay C. Silacci P. Novick D. Roux-Lombard P. Grau G. Dayer J.-M. Vischer T. Guerne P.-A. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1510-1516PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in IL-6-deficient mice immunized with type II collagen, a decrease of inflammatory cells in knee joints and a reduced antibody response to type II collagen have been observed, suggesting that IL-6 plays a crucial role in the development of autoimmune collagen-induced arthritis (23Alonzi T. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Costa P. Probert L. Kollias G. De Benedetti F. Poli V. Ciliberto G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In rabbit articular chondrocytes (RACs), IL-6 treatment was found to repress PG synthesis and enhanced PG degradation induced by IL-1β (24Jikko A. Wakisaka T. Iwamoto M. Hiranuma H. Kato Y. Maeda T. Fujishita M. Fuchihata H. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the role of IL-6 on the depletion of the cartilage ECM remains controversial. Indeed, some authors could not demonstrate any effect of IL-6 on the expression of PG (25Kandel R.A. Petelycky M. Dinarello C.A. Minden M. Pritzker K.P.H. Cruz T.F. J. Rheumatol. 1990; 17: 953-957PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that injection of recombinant IL-6 in the joint cavity corrected the IL-6 deficiency and significantly reduced cartilage destruction in the IL-6 gene knockout mouse model (26van de Loo F.A. Kuiper S. van Enckevort F.H. Arntz O.A. van den Berg W.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 acts synergistically with IL-1β and oncostatin M to up-regulate matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-13 in bovine and human cartilage explant cultures (27Cawston T.E. Curry V.A. Summers C.A. Clark I.M. Riley G.P. Life P.F. Spaull J.R. Goldring M.B. Koshy P.J. Rowan A.D. Shingleton W.D.

Cawston T.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1620-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). By contrast, it was also reported that the IL-6·sIL-6R complex induces the up-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 and blocks IL-1-induced collagenolytic activity (29Silacci P. Dayers J.M. Desgeorges A. Peter R. Manueddu C. Guerne P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13625-13629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Part of the controversy related to these data is probably due to the fact that most of in vitro studies were performed in the absence of sIL-6R. Indeed, levels of membrane-bound IL-6R on chondrocytes are lower compared with those of other cell types such as hepatocytes, and the addition of sIL-6R to IL-6 is required to observe the full effect of the cytokine (30Guerne P.-A. Desgeorges A. Jaspar J.-M. Relic B. Peter R. Hoffmeyer P. Dayer J.-M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this way, the sIL-6R·IL-6 complex may partially account for the loss of PG commonly associated with arthritic lesions, because it has been shown to increase aggrecanase-mediated catabolism of PG in articular cartilage (31Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Curtis C.L. Caterson B. Jones S.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In cultured articular chondrocytes, we have reported that IL-6·sIL-6R decreased the amount of aggrecan core and link protein mRNA steady-state levels (32Legendre F. Dudhia J. Pujol J-P. Bogdanowicz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2903-2912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas they increase those of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 (33Legendre F. Bogdanowicz P. Boumediene K. Pujol J.-P. J. Rheumatol. 2005; 32: 1307-1317PubMed Google Scholar). Very little is known on the effect of IL-6·sIL-6R on type II collagen expression. In bovine articular chondrocytes, IL-6·sIL-6R was shown to reduce the steady-state levels of COL2A1 mRNA (32Legendre F. Dudhia J. Pujol J-P. Bogdanowicz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2903-2912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but the nature of transcription factors mediating IL-6·sIL-6R inhibition of COL2A1 gene is still largely unknown. Extensive studies have established the central role of the STAT family of transcription factors in IL-6 cytokine family signaling. In response to IL-6 stimulation, STAT1 and STAT3 are tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus where STAT homo- and/or heterodimers bind to specific DNA elements in the promoters of IL-6 target genes (34Wegenka U.M. Bushmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 35Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Previous data from our laboratory have shown that IL-6·sIL-6R induced activation of STAT1/STAT3 proteins in bovine articular chondrocytes and that this activation was accompanied by an increase of the DNA binding of the STAT proteins on a STAT consensus sequence. We have already reported that two other cytokines, TGF-β1 and IL-1β, exert a repressive effect on type II collagen expression in primary RAC by a transcriptional regulatory mechanism, which involves a -41/-33-bp promoter sequence binding Sp1 and Sp3 (8Chadjichristos C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39762-39772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of these cytokines results from a decrease in Sp1·Sp3 ratio, which prevents Sp1-induced transactivating effects. In the present study, we show for the first time that IL-6, sIL-6R, or both repress COL2A1 gene transcription through the same promoter region and that this effect implicates both Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. It seems therefore that cytokines that have a repressive effect on type II collagen expression involve similar transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that converge on the same complex in which the Sp1 and Sp3 binding activities and the Sp1·Sp3 ratio are decreased.

The cells were seeded generally at 2 × 105 cells per 9.6-cm2 dishes or 1 × 106 cells per 55-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml). They were grown at 37 °C ina5%CO2 humidified atmosphere, with medium change every 2–3 days. Collagen Labeling–To assay newly synthesized collagen, RAC cultures at 80% confluency were preincubated in 10% FCS-containing DMEM in 9.6-cm2 dishes for 15 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate. Then, the medium was changed to fresh medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate, 100 μg/ml β-aminopropionitrile, and 2 μCi/ml [3H]proline containing or not increasing concentrations (5–100 ng/ml) of human recombinant IL-6 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), human recombinant sIL-6R (R&D Systems), or both. 24 h later, the culture medium and the cell layer were collected, and the amount of labeled collagen was assayed as previously described (36Chadjichristos C.

Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR–Total RNA was extracted by the guanidium hydrochloride method (37Chomszinski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar), and the integrity of samples was checked by 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Then, 2 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA in the presence of 50 pmol of random hexamers, 40 units/μl of RNase inhibitor, 10 mm of each dNTPs, first-strand buffer 5×, and 60 units/μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus in a final reaction volume of 25 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the cDNA synthesis was stopped by heating the reaction mixture at 90 °C for 15 min. To test the efficiency of reverse transcription, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was submitted to 40 cycles of amplification (1 cycle: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) in an Omni-E-Hybaid thermocycler and using a PCR kit (Invitrogen). Then, the samples were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed (38Beauchef G. Kypriotou M. Chadjichristos C. Widom R.L.

In these experiments, the pSV40β-gal construct has not been cotransfected, because Sp1 is able to increase SV40 promoter activity, due to the presence of several Sp1 DNA-binding sites in this promoter (8Chadjichristos C.

Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein amount was determined by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activities were normalized, and means ± S.D. of three independent samples were expressed as relative luciferase units (RLU). To inhibit Sp1 and Sp3 expression, we used the technique of small interfering RNA (siRNA). The Sp1 and Sp3 siRNAs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and are directed against the human Sp1 and Sp3 mRNAs. 80% confluent RACs were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using the pGL2-0.110 kb chimeric COL2A1-luciferase reporter vector, pSV40β-gal plasmid, and with 2 μg of Sp1 and/or Sp3 siRNA as described above. After the overnight transfection period, the cells were incubated for 24 h with IL-6, sIL-6R, or both. At the end of incubation, the cells were harvested and relative transcriptional activities were determined. In parallel, similar transfection experiments were performed to follow the efficiency of Sp1 and/or Sp3 silencing, but in that case, the reporter vector was not transfected. The down-regulation of Sp1·Sp3 expressions was measured through their steady-state mRNA levels or DNA-binding activity, by real-time RT-PCR with the primers presented in Table 1, and electromobility shift assay (EMSA) respectively. Decoy Experiments–RACs were transfected with double-stranded oligonucleotides to interfere with Sp1 and Sp3 binding to their cognate cis-acting elements within the 63-bp short promoter of the COL2A1 gene. Two copies of the -50/+1 wild-type (wt) sequence found in the COL2A1 promoter as well as the corresponding mutated sequence were used as decoy oligonucleotides (Table 1). Medium was changed to fresh medium containing the decoy oligonucleotides 10–15 h after transfection, and the cultures were incubated for a further 24-h period with or without 25 ng/ml of IL-6, sIL-6R, or both. Relative luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as well as protein amounts were determined as described previously. Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts, and Gel Retardation Assays–To prepare cytoplasmic extracts, RACs were seeded in 55-cm2 Petri dishes, and incubated for 24 h at 80% confluency with or without IL-6, sIL-6R, or both at 10 ng/ml. Following treatment, chondrocytes were rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin at 10 μg/ml).

Based on previous work, two models can be proposed in which PsbS is either 1) the gene product where the quenching activity is located or 2) a proton-sensing trigger that activates the quencher molecules. The first hypothesis requires xanthophyll binding to two PsbS-binding sites, each activated by the protonation of a dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding lumen-exposed glutamic acid residue. To assess the existence and properties of these xanthophyll-binding sites, PsbS point mutants on each of the two Glu residues PsbS E122Q and PsbS E226Q were crossed with the npq1/npq4 and lut2/npq4 mutants lacking zeaxanthin and lutein, respectively. Double mutants E122Q/npq1 and E226Q/npq1 had no qE, whereas E122Q/lut2 and E226Q/lut2 showed a strong qE reduction with respect to both lut2 and single glutamate mutants. These findings exclude a specific interaction between lutein or zeaxanthin and a dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding site and suggest that the dependence of nonphotochemical quenching on xanthophyll composition is not due to pigment binding to PsbS. To verify, in vitro, the capacity of xanthophylls to bind PsbS, we have produced recombinant PsbS refolded with purified pigments and shown that Raman signals, previously attributed to PsbS-zeaxanthin interactions, are in fact due to xanthophyll aggregation.

This process, although present in all photosynthetic organisms, has been particularly studied in higher plants and green algae. Early work identified thylakoid lumen acidification as an essential factor for NPQ (1Briantais J.M. C.R. Acad. Sci. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. D. 1966; 263: 1899-1902PubMed Google Scholar). Excess light increases proton pumping into the thylakoid lumen, which elicits chlorophyll fluorescence quenching dependent on protein protonation events. This is shown by the inhibitory effects of DCCD, a protein-modifying agent that covalently binds to protonatable residues in hydrophobic environments (2Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Horton P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been found that the photosystem II subunit PsbS, a DCCD-binding protein (3Dominici P. Caffarri S. Armenante F. Ceoldo S. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22750-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), is required for NPQ and, in particular, for its rapid and reversible component qE (4Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). In fact, the capacity for qE depends on the stoichiometric presence of PsbS polypeptide (5Li X.P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33590-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Some insight into the importance of xanthophylls for the NPQ mechanism can be gained from the xanthophyll biosynthesis mutants found in NPQ-depleted plants. In the npq1 mutant, which is unable to convert violaxanthin into zeaxanthin upon lumen acidification, qE is reduced, whereas npq2, which constitutively accumulates zeaxanthin, has faster NPQ induction and slower relaxation kinetics (6Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In the lut2 mutant, lacking lutein (7Pogson B.J. Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. DellaPenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13324-13329Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and in the lut2/npq2 double mutant, which has zeaxanthin as the only xanthophyll (8Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E. DellaPenna D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Havaux M. Dall'Osto L. Cuine S. Giuliano G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13878-13888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), qE is also significantly reduced, whereas the npq1/lut2 double mutant totally lacks qE (10Niyogi K.K. Shih C. Soon C.W. Pogson B.J. DellaPenna D. Bjorkman O. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 67: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because xanthophyll mutants have normal PsbS levels and the npq4 mutation is epistatic over xanthophyll biosynthesis mutations (4Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), these data suggest that both lutein and zeaxanthin are involved in the mechanism of quenching downstream PsbS activation by lumen acidification.A more detailed analysis of PsbS activation has been obtained by studying the DCCD-binding properties of two lumen-exposed glutamate residues in PsbS, Glu-122 and Glu-226. Inactivation of each site in Arabidopsis thaliana by construction of the point mutants E122Q and E226Q decreases by 50% both qE and DCCD binding capacity, as glutamine is not protonatable in the physiological pH range, whereas the double mutant is analogous to the PsbS deletion mutant npq4 (11Li X.P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus PsbS has two independent functional domains, the first activated by protonation of Glu-122 and the second by protonation of Glu-226. These residues are localized symmetrically with respect to the 2-fold mirror axis within the four-helix structure of PsbS. The need for two xanthophyll species and two activated DCCD binding domains, for full expression of qE, has been rationalized in the “two xanthophyll-binding sites” model (12Holt N.E. Fleming G.R.

This model was supported by the following: (i) the finding that a 535 nm spectral feature appearing during establishment of qE was PsbS-dependent and exhibited the Raman spectrum of zeaxanthin (14Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and (ii) the report that in vitro binding of zeaxanthin by PsbS (15Aspinall-O'Dea M. Wentworth M.

A. 2002; 99: 16331-16335Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reproduced the zeaxanthin absorption spectral feature at ∼530 nm. The two xanthophyll-binding sites model, however, does not explain the low NPQ phenotype of the npq5 mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which lacks the Lhcbm1 subunit of the major antenna complex (16Elrad D. Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1801-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and of the ch1 mutant of A. thaliana, depleted in antenna proteins while retaining a normal level of PsbS, lutein, and zeaxanthin (3Dominici P.

Additional emphasis on Lhcb proteins as quenching sites was recently provided by the report that A. thaliana lacking Lhcb6 has reduced qE (18Kovacs L. Damkjaer J. Kereiche S. Ilioaia C. Ruban A.V. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Horton P. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3106-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An alternative model that reconciles these observations can be proposed in which the phenotypes related to lumen acidification are due to PsbS activation, whereas the phenotypes of xanthophyll biosynthesis mutations are mediated by xanthophyll binding to Lhc proteins (19Horton P. Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Noctor G. Young A.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 20Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

In such a model PsbS would act as a pH-sensitive trigger, and quenching would be performed by chlorophyll-carotenoid-binding proteins activated though a conformational change of PsbS and propagated to neighboring antenna proteins. A distinctive critical characteristic between the two models is whether PsbS binds lutein and/or zeaxanthin or not. It is worth noting that xanthophyll binding is well established for Lhc proteins but controversial for PsbS (3Dominici P. Caffarri S. Armenante F. Ceoldo S. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Pigment binding to PsbS would support the Two xanthophyll-binding site model, although PsbS without pigments would support the second model, which will be denoted as the “PsbS trigger” model.In this work we have studied in vivo the dependence of NPQ on xanthophyll composition by combining xanthophyll biosynthesis mutations npq1 (6Niyogi K.K.

Moreover, we have studied in vitro the xanthophyll and chlorophyll binding capacity of recombinant PsbS. The results are discussed in terms of their consistency with the above models.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Material and Construction of Double Mutants—Pollen from A. thaliana PsbS point mutants E122Q and E226Q (11Li X.P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used to fertilize pistils of previously emasculated double mutant plants npq1/npq4 (26Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and lut2/npq4. 3L. Dall'Osto, unpublished results. We obtained four double mutants, E122Q/npq1, E122Q/lut2, E226Q/npq1, and E226Q/lut2, and we checked for homozygosis before use. Other control genotypes used in this work are npq4 complemented with WT PsbS (11Li X.P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), npq4 (4Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K.

BMC Plant Biol. 2006; 6: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All mutants are in the Col-O ecotype background.NPQ Measurements—NPQ measurements were performed using a PAM-101 (Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany), actinic light 1260 μEm-2s-1, and saturating light 3380 μEm-2s-1. Minimum fluorescence (F0) was measured with a 0.15 μmol m-2 s-1 beam; Fm was determined with a 0.8-s light pulse, and continuous light was supplied by a KL1500 halogen lamp (Schott, Mainz, Germany). NPQ is expressed as (Fm - Fm′)/Fm′.Pigment Analysis—Pigments were extracted from leaf disks; samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in 85% acetone buffered with Na2CO3, and then the supernatant of each sample was recovered after centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g, 4 °C); separation and quantification of pigments were performed by HPLC (27Casazza A.P. Tarantino D. Soave C. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 68: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot—SDS-PAGE of thylakoid membranes samples (28Bassi R. Rigoni F. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 29-38Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was performed with the Tris-Tricine buffer system as described previously (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and developed using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum.Recombinant PsbS Overexpression and Purification—The coding region for the mature protein was amplified by PCR on a full-length cDNA encoding Hordeum vulgare (cultivar Nure) PsbS (forward primer, CCAGGATCCGCGCCGGCCAAGAAGGTCG; reverse primer, GGGAAGCTTGTCGTCGTCCTCGCCGCTG) and cloned in pQE50/His vector (Invitrogen) under pLac promoter control in fusion with a 6-histidine tail at the C terminus. The recombinant protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, BL21 strain (Invitrogen), purified from bacterial lysate using 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% SDS, then loaded on a nickel immobilized methyl affinity chromatography (chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences), and eluted in the Reconstitution Buffer (40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 12.5% sucrose, 2% LDS, 5 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine).In Vitro Reconstitution of PsbS Protein with Pigments—In vitro refolding was performed with purified pigments as described previously (30Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The refolding experiments were also performed at different pH values, changing Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.8, with Mes-NaOH buffer, pH 5.5. In vitro refolding by sonication of recombinant PsbS with zeaxanthin and/or lutein was performed as described previously (15Aspinall-O'Dea M. Wentworth M. Pascal A. Robert B. Ruban A. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16331-16335Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).In Vitro Refolding without Pigments—Starting from the recombinant protein in denaturing buffer (40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 12.5% sucrose, 2% LDS, 5 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine), LDS was precipitated by adding 150 mm KCl and exchanged with 1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. The sample, now in milder detergent conditions, was ultracentrifuged for 15 h in an SW 60 Beckman rotor at 60,000 rpm. In addition to 0.1-1 m sucrose, the gradient solution contained 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and 5 mm phosphate, pH 7.5.Circular Dichroism and Absorption Measurements—CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter, scan rate 200 nm/min. Absorption spectra were obtained with an AMINCO DW2000 spectrophotometer, scan rate 2 nm/s, bandwidth 1 nm, optical path length 1 cm.Resonance Raman Spectra—The resonance Raman spectra were obtained with excitation at 441.6 nm using a He-Cd laser (Kimmon, IK4121R-G), 514.5 nm using an Ar+ laser (Coherent, Innova 90/5) and 530.9 nm using a Kr+ laser (Coherent, Innova 302). The backscattered light from a slowly rotating NMR tube was collected and focused into a triple spectrometer (consisting of two Acton Research SpectroPro 2300i and a SpectroPro 2500i in the final stage with 1800 grooves/nm grating) working in the subtractive mode, equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Roper Scientific Princeton Instruments). The RR spectra were calibrated with indene as standard to an accuracy of 1 cm-1 for isolated bands. The peak intensities and positions of the C-H wagging vibrations in the 900-1000-cm-1 region were determined by a curve-fitting program (LabCalc, Galactic) using Lorentzian line shapes and 8.5-cm-1 bandwidth.RESULTSIn Vivo Analysis of Xanthophyll Binding to PsbS and Interaction between DCCD-binding Sites and Xanthophyll-binding Sites—We approached the problem of assessing whether PsbS binds xanthophylls by crossing A. thaliana carrying single Glu → Gln mutations at either of the two DCCD-binding residues Glu-122 and Glu-226 of PsbS (13Li X.P. Gilmore A.M. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Golan T. Kramer D. Niyogi K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22866-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) with npq1/npq4 and lut2/npq4 genotypes, lacking PsbS and zeaxanthin or lutein, respectively.The rationale of this experiment was to verify whether the observed effect of xanthophyll composition on NPQ (7Pogson B.J. Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. DellaPenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13324-13329Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), namely a reduced NPQ amplitude whenever either lutein or zeaxanthin is absent, can be explained by the properties of the two putative xanthophyll-binding sites of PsbS as proposed by the two xanthophyll sites model. This was achieved by inactivation of each DCCD-binding site and changing the xanthophyll composition of the plant. Screening of the F2 progeny for xanthophyll composition, in dark conditions and after high light exposure, and for the PsbS protein enabled four double mutants, E122Q/npq1, E122Q/lut2, E226Q/npq1, and E226Q/lut2, to be obtained. Four-week-old plants of control genotypes npq1, lut2, npq1/lut2, PsbS E122Q, PsbS E226Q, the double mutant PsbS E122Q/E226Q, npq4, and the four newly obtained double mutants were assayed for NPQ (Figs. 1, 2, 3).FIGURE 2Double mutants (lut2 background) phenotypes.

According to previous reports (11Li X.P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Li X.P. Gilmore A.M. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Golan T. Kramer D. Niyogi K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22866-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), the amplitude of the major fast reversible (100 s) component of NPQ is approximately half that of WT (3.1 ± 0.1) in the single Glu → Gln mutants (1.9 ± 0.1 and 1.7 ± 0.1 for E122Q and E226Q, respectively) and is completely abolished in the double E122Q/E226Q mutant. Fig. 1B shows the NPQ kinetics of the npq1 and lut2 mutants and the double npq1/lut2 mutant. The lut2 mutant has reduced qE (1.7 ± 0.1) with respect to WT (3.1 ± 0.1), npq1 has an even lower qE (0.6 ± 0.03) and a different kinetic behavior, displaying a more rapid rise and a slower second phase. Immunoblotting with an anti-PsbS antibody shows that all genotypes have comparable amounts of PsbS on a chlorophyll basis with the exception of the E122Q/E226Q double mutant, which has a 40% reduction (Fig. 1C). The double npq1/lut2 mutant shows an extremely reduced level of quenching upon illumination. Moreover, this quenching was not reversible during dark recovery, suggesting that it was due to photoinhibition, in agreement with previous reports of a high photosensitivity in this genotype (10Niyogi K.K. Shih C. Soon C.W. Pogson B.J. DellaPenna D. Bjorkman O. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 67: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dall'Osto L. Lico C. Alric J. Giuliano G. Havaux M. Bassi R. BMC Plant Biol. 2006; 6: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A lower level of irreversible quenching was observed in npq4, suggesting that the capacity for zeaxanthin synthesis in this genotype partially compensates for lack of qE with respect to npq1/lut2, which lacks both zeaxanthin and qE.NPQ of lut2 double mutants is compared with that of the single mutants lut2 and E122Q and E226Q in Fig. 2. The amplitude of NPQ is very similar in lut2 and the E122Q and E226Q mutants (Fig. 2, A and B). However, for both the Glu single mutants the initial kinetic behavior was faster than in lut2. The E122Q/lut2 mutant shows a 3-fold reduced activity (0.5 ± 0.03) with respect to both lut2 (1.7 ± 0.1) and E122Q (1.9 ± 0.1), whereas the initial rate was intermediate. Nevertheless, a rapid dark reversible phase was present in this sample, implying that some level of qE activity is compatible with the double mutation. The residual activity in the E226Q/lut2 mutant was 0.5 ± 0.1. Fast recovery from quenching was observed upon transition to the dark, contrasting with the behavior of the npq4, npq1/lut2, and E122Q/E226Q genotypes.Both of the double mutants E122Q/npq1 and E226Q/npq1 show almost null levels of qE, the NPQ kinetics being hardly distinguishable from that of npq4 (Fig. 3, A and B). It should be noted that the trace levels of NPQ in E122Q/npq1 differ with respect to that of npq4 during the first 2 min of illumination, in which a very small and transitory quenching effect is visible. Long term recovery of fluorescence was incomplete in both genotypes suggesting a similar degree of photoinhibition. The above results show that the npq1 mutation has a stronger inhibitory effect on qE than the lut2 mutation and that the effect of both lutein and zeaxanthin in promoting qE is not dependent on the activity of a specific DCCD-binding site in PsbS.We further analyzed the effect of zeaxanthin by measuring NPQ on leaves pre-illuminated to induce zeaxanthin accumulation (31Andersson J. Walters R.G. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The leaves were illuminated with white light (1260 μEm-2 s-1) for 8 min, followed by a 15-min dark period before NPQ analysis (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Zeaxanthin pre-loading experiment. Effect of light pretreatment, inducing zeaxanthin synthesis, on the NPQ behavior of plants carrying single DCCD-binding residues on PsbS. Leaves were treated with 1260 μEm-2 s-1 white light for 8 min to induce zeaxanthin synthesis while NPQ was being measured, and the leaves were then dark-adapted for 15 min before a second measurement. NPQ was induced by 1260 μEm-2 s-1 actinic white light.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pre-illuminated leaves showed a faster initial rate of NPQ with respect to dark-adapted leaves, the half-rise time (t½) being 110 ± 16 s versus 18 ± 3 s, 169 ± 27 s versus 36 ± 11 s, and 191 ± 18 s versus 43 ± 9 s for WT, E122Q, and E226Q, respectively. Therefore, in the presence of zeaxanthin, t½ is 6.1-, 4.7-, and 4.4-fold faster for WT, E122Q, and E226Q, respectively, compared with dark-adapted leaves. The maximum level of NPQ was slightly lower in pre-illuminated leaves, because of residual background quenching from zeaxanthin accumulated during the previous light treatment (26Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A similar effect was observed in both E122Q and E226Q mutants and in E122Q/lut2 and E226Q/lut2 mutants (data not shown). All genotypes carrying npq1 or npq4 mutations, and the E122Q/E226Q double mutant did not show the increased rate of qE. Moreover, the second illumination yielded a slower residual quenching rate (data not shown). HPLC analysis showed that light treatment leads to the production of similar amounts of zeaxanthin in all genotypes, part of which was still present at the onset of the NPQ measurement (Table 1).TABLE 1Zeaxanthin content measured by HPLC analysis of WT and mutant plants upon 8 min of illumination followed by 15 min of dark adaptationWTE122QE226Qnpq4Illumination (8 min)0.34 ± 0.010.29 ± 0.020.41 ± 0.020.26 ± 0.01Dark re-adaptation (15 min)0.10 ± 0.020.19 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.030.15 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Analysis of Direct Binding of Lutein and Zeaxanthin to PsbS in Vitro—An alternative strategy for studying pigment binding to proteins belonging to the Lhc family is to express the apoproteins in E. coli followed by reconstitution of the pigment-protein complex in vitro (32Plumley F.G.

https://openalex.org/W2062797708,"Methods enabling prion replication ex vivo are important for advancing prion studies. However, few such technologies exist, and many prion strains are not amenable to them. Here we describe a prion organotypic slice culture assay (POSCA) that allows prion amplification and titration ex vivo under conditions that closely resemble intracerebral infection. Thirty-five days after contact with prions, mouse cerebellar slices had amplified the abnormal isoform of prion protein, PrP(Sc), >10(5)-fold. This is quantitatively similar to amplification in vivo, but fivefold faster. PrP(Sc) accumulated predominantly in the molecular layer, as in infected mice. The POSCA detected replication of prion strains from disparate sources, including bovines and ovines, with variable detection efficiency. Pharmacogenetic ablation of microglia from POSCA slices led to a 15-fold increase in prion titers and PrP(Sc) concentrations over those in microglia-containing slices, as well as an increase in susceptibility to infection. This suggests that the extensive microglial activation accompanying prion diseases represents an efficacious defensive reaction."

The calcium sensing receptor (CaR) is essential for mediating Ca2+ signaling during Ca2+o-induced differentiation. Inactivation of the endogenous CaR-encoding gene CASR by adenoviral expression of a CaR antisense cDNA inhibited the Ca2+o-induced increase in intracellular free calcium (Ca2+i) and expression of terminal differentiation genes, while promoting apoptosis. Ca2+o also instigates E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which plays a critical role in orchestrating cellular signals mediating cell survival and differentiation. Raising Ca2+o concentration ([Ca2+]o) from 0.03 to 2 mm rapidly induced the co-localization of α-, β-, and p120-catenin with E-cadherin in the intercellular adherens junctions (AJs). To assess whether CaR is required for the Ca2+o-induced activation of E-cadherin signaling, we examined the impact of CaR inactivation on AJ formation. Decreased CaR expression suppressed the Ca2+o-induced AJ formation, membrane translocation, and the complex formation of E-cadherin, catenins, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), although the expression of these proteins was not affected. The assembly of the E-cadherin-catenin-PI3K complex was sensitive to the pharmacologic inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases but was not affected by inhibition of Ca2+o-induced rise in Ca2+i. Inhibition of CaR expression blocked the Ca2+o-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-, γ-, and p120-catenin, PI3K, and the tyrosine kinase Fyn and the association of Fyn with E-cadherin and PI3K.

Keratinocytes proliferate and differentiate in cultures in a manner recapitulating the process of epidermal differentiation in vivo (1Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol.

Previous studies demonstrated an obligatory role for the CaR, a G-protein-coupled receptor, in mediating Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+o-induced keratinocyte differentiation (6Tu C.L. Chang W. Bikle D.D. J.

Activation of the CaR by Ca2+o stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) to convert phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglylcerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in turn induces Ca2+ release from internal stores and increases Ca2+i (9Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CaR expression led to a decline of Ca2+i pools and altered cellular Ca2+ handling, hence reducing the Ca2+i response to Ca2+o and impairing differentiation in keratinocytes (8Tu C.L.

One of the immediate cellular responses to Ca2+o in epithelial cells is the formation of cell-cell contacts, a process mediated by the adhesion molecule E-cadherin (10Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is a major classical cadherin in keratinocytes and is expressed throughout the epidermis (11Furukawa F. Fujii K. Horiguchi Y. Matsuyoshi N. Fujita M. Toda K. Imamura S. Wakita H. Shirahama S. Takigawa M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 38: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+o stimulation, the extracellular portion of E-cadherin interacts with E-cadherin molecules on the surface of neighboring cells, whereas its cytoplasmic tail interacts with β- (or γ-), α-, and p120-catenins to form the core adhesive structure of adherens junctions (AJ) (12Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion plays key roles in remodeling of epithelial cell-cell interaction and maintaining proper epidermal differentiation (10Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E.

The sequential binding of catenins physically links E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton and other signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (10Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte differentiation induced by Ca2+o necessitates the activation of PI3K. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K blocks the expression of late differentiation markers and induces apoptosis in differentiating keratinocytes (16Calautti E. Li J. Saoncella S. Brissette J.L. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32856-32865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Xie Z. Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y. Bikle D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3236-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Through interactions with the E-cadherin-catenin complex PI3K is recruited to the cell membrane, where it converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate in turn binds and activates PLCγ1 (17Xie Z. Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y. Bikle D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3236-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which is required for maintaining the Ca2+o-induced increase in Ca2+i crucial for keratinocyte differentiation (18Xie Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20421-20424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Inactivating E-cadherin function by specific antibody or blocking E-cadherin expression by small interfering RNA prevents Ca2+-induced activation of PI3K and, thus, keratinocyte differentiation (16Calautti E. Li J. Saoncella S. Brissette J.L. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32856-32865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Xie Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol.

Besides E-cadherin, our recent studies demonstrated that the Ca2+o-induced recruitment of PI3K to cell membrane, activation of PI3K, and keratinocyte differentiation require β- and p120-, but not γ-catenin (19Xie Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8695-8703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, E-cadherin-dependent cell adhesion plays a key role not only in coordinating cellular organization and movement in epidermis, but also in transducing cellular signals that influence keratinocyte differentiation. Keratinocyte differentiation induced by Ca2+o is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation (17Xie Z. Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y. Bikle D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3236-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Filvaroff E. Calautti E. Reiss M. Dotto G.P. J. Biol.

Many studies have demonstrated that tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for the assembly of AJ and the interaction of PI3K with the E-cadherin-catenin complex. Pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine kinase perturbs the formation of AJ and prevents activation of PI3K by Ca2+o (16Calautti E. Li J. Saoncella S. Brissette J.L. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol.

In differentiating mouse keratinocytes, Ca2+o-induced assembly of E-cadherin-catenin complex and the recruitment of PI3K to E-cadherin are accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of β-, γ-, and p120-catenin (22Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Paolo Dotto G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The stimulation of E-cadherin/PI3K signaling by Ca2+o involves activation of Src family tyrosine kinases. Inhibiting Src family tyrosine kinases effectively blocks formation of AJ (22Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Paolo Dotto G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), abolishes Ca2+o activation of PI3K, and suppresses expression of differentiation markers in keratinocytes (17Xie Z. Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y. Bikle D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3236-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that Src family kinases control keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion, Fyn tyrosine kinase colocalizes with E-cadherin at the cell membrane (22Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Paolo Dotto G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Additionally, Fyn-deficient keratinocytes exhibit decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-, γ-, and p120-catenin, abnormalities in cell adhesion (22Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Paolo Dotto G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and compromised differentiation (21Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hence, in contrast to what has been found in transformed or mitogenically stimulated cells, tyrosine phosphorylation plays a positive role in control of cell adhesion in differentiating keratinocytes (24McLachlan R.W. Yap A.S. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ca2+o activates CaR-mediated Ca2+i signaling and E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion that lead to differentiation. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of CaR in the activation of E-cadherin signaling. Knocking down CaR expression blocked the Ca2+o-induced formation of AJ, the association of PI3K with the E-cadherin-catenin complex, and expression of late differentiation markers. Furthermore, the Ca2+o-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-, γ-, and p120-catenin and Fyn were blocked in the CaR-deficient keratinocytes. This indicates that the CaR regulates the E-cadherin/PI3K pathway via a Src family tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling and impacts on keratinocyte differentiation. MaterialsThe membrane permeable Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-AM (BAPTA-AM), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), and Src kinase inhibitor PP2 and its non-functional analog PP3 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Stock solutions of these compounds were prepared in Me2SO. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All DNA constructs used in generation of adenoviruses were prepared using Qiagen Maxi-prep columns (Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for Bip (GRP78) and α2 integrin were obtained from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab) for CaR, ADDR, was raised against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 215-236 of the human keratinocyte CaR (6Tu C.L. Chang W. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41079-41085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal and mAbs against E-cadherin, α-, β-, γ-, and p120-catenin, c-Src, Fyn, and the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85α, were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin was from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA). Cell CultureNormal human keratinocytes (NHKs) were isolated from neonatal human foreskins and grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (154CF, Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) as described (17Xie Z. Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y. Bikle D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3236-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were isolated from newborn human foreskins by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 4 °C, 16 h), and primary cultures were established in growth medium containing 0.07 mm CaCl2. Second passage keratinocytes were plated in medium containing 0.03 mm CaCl2 and used in the experiments described. Generation of Adenoviral Stocks and Infection of KeratinocytesA replication-defective adenovirus carrying the antisense human CaR cDNA (Ad-ASCaR) and the control viruses Ad-DNR were constructed using an Adeno-X Expression System II kit (BD Biosciences) as described (8Tu C.L. Chang W. Bikle D.D. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 1074-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Viral particles were collected and titered using an Adeno-X rapid titer kit (BD Biosciences) and used to infect NHKs. For inactivation of the CaR, subconfluent NHKs were infected with the Ad-ASCaR adenovirus (60 pfu/cell) in growth medium containing 0.03 mm CaCl2 and cultured for 5 to 7 days before exposure to 1.2 mm CaCl2 for 5-10 min to induce formation of AJ or for 3 days to induce differentiation. Three days after infection, the viral supernatant was replaced with fresh culture medium containing 0.03 mm CaCl2. No additional adenovirus was provided after the initial infection. Control cells were infected with an adenovirus Ad-DNR. Quantitative Real-time PCR (q-PCR) AnalysisThe expression of late differentiation genes was determined by q-PCR. NHKs were infected with adenovirus (60 pfu/cell) in growth medium containing 0.03 mm CaCl2 and cultured for 5 days before exposure to 1.2 mm CaCl2 for 3 days. Total RNA were then isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy RNA purification kit (Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of RNA samples were reverse transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Crop.) to generate cDNA. qPCR was performed on cDNA using TaqMan premixed primer/probes and reagents from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) or SYBR Green primers. RNA levels of late differentiation markers in keratinocytes were normalized to mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 for all experiments. TUNEL StainingKeratinocyte cultures grown on glass coverslips were infected with adenovirus as described. Then cells were cultured in 0.03 or 1.2 mm CaCl2 for 2 days before fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Apoptotic cells were detected by ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, fixed cells were washed and endogenous peroxidase activity is quenched by hydrogen peroxide. Cells were incubated with TdT enzyme in the presence of digoxigenin at 37 °C for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody. After washing with PBS, the sections are incubated with DAB substrate for 5 min to reveal peroxidase activity. Following the color reactions, the coverslips are washed and mounted. Digital images of 10 representative fields per experimental condition were acquired and quantified using a computer-assisted program (BIOQUANT, Nashville, TN). The degree of apoptosis was presented as the number of TUNEL-positive cells per 100 cells in the field. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+%The Ca2+i responses to elevated Ca2+i was measured using a Dual-wavelength Fluorescence Imaging System (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH) as described (25Oda Y. Tu C.L. Chang W. Crumrine D. Komuves L. Mauro T. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Pre-confluent keratinocytes were infected with an adenovirus carrying the antisense human CaR cDNA (Ad-ASCaR) or a control virus (Ad-DNR) on a coverslip in medium containing 0.03 mm Ca2+. Five to 7 days later, cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 0.1% Pluronic F127 in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, 1 mg/ml glucose) containing 0.07 mm Ca2+. Cells were then washed and measured in buffer A containing 0.03 mm Ca2+ before exposure to 2 mm Ca2+. The cells were alternately illuminated with 340 and 380 nm light, and the fluorescence at emission wavelength 510 nm was recorded. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The signals from 20 to 50 single cells for each measurement were recorded. Each sample was calibrated by the addition of 20 μm ionomycin (Rmax) followed by 20 mm EGTA/Tris, pH 8.3 (Rmin). Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was calculated from the ratio of emission at the two excitation wavelengths based on the formula [Ca2+]i = KdQ(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R), r = F340/F380, Q = Fmin/Fmax at 380 nm, and Kd for Fura-2 for Ca2+ is 224 nm. Cell Lysate Preparation and ImmunoblottingTotal cell lysates and membrane proteins were prepared from NHKs 5 to 7 days after adenoviral infections. Keratinocytes were washed twice in PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed for 30 min on ice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors (Complete™ protease inhibitor tablet, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Total cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected. Keratinocyte membrane lysates were prepared using the Mem-PER Eukaryotic Membrane Protein Extraction Reagent Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentrations in the total cell lysates and membrane lysates were determined by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Corp.). 50 μg of protein samples were electrophoresed through reducing polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, 0.45 μm; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), the blots were incubated at 4 °C overnight with appropriate primary antibodies: polyclonal Abs against E-cadherin, α- and p120-catenin at a dilution of 1:300, mAbs against PI3K-p85α, phosphotyrosine, β- and γ-catenin at a dilution of 1:200, polyclonal Abs against Fyn and c-Src at a dilution of 1:200, mAbs against Bip and α2 integrin at a dilution of 1:250. Subsequently the blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h at room temperature. The bound antibody was visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Kit (Pierce Corp.) and subsequent exposure to x-ray film. ImmunoprecipitationsTotal cell lysates containing 0.5-1 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated by 3 μg of mAbs against β-, γ-, and p120-catenin, Fyn, PI3K-p85α, and phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and 200 μg membrane proteins by mAbs to E-cadherin and PI3K-p85α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by Sepharose-conjugated protein G (ImmunoLink Immobilized Protein G, Pierce Corp.) in 1 ml of cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C with gentle tumbling overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, eluted, and then analyzed by Western analysis. Immunofluorescence StainingKeratinocytes were cultured on coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeablized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking with 5% goat serum in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of primary antibodies at 4 °C for overnight. Subsequently cells were incubated with the appropriate fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (20 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 1 h. For F-actin staining, cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, coverslips were washed in PBS, mounted on glass slides using Gel-Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and examined with a Leica TCS NT/SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Inhibition of CaR Expression Reduced Ca2+i Response to Ca2+o, Promoted Apoptosis, and Suppressed Ca2+o-induced Keratinocyte DifferentiationTo study the role of CaR in activation of E-cadherin signaling and Ca2+o-induced differentiation, we inhibited CaR expression by infecting preconfluent human keratinocytes with an adenovirus carrying a full-length CaR antisense cDNA (Ad-ASCaR). Immunoblotting (Fig. 1A) and immunostaining (Fig. 1B) showed that Ad-ASCaR effectively blocked the endogenous CaR protein level as compared with the cells infected with a control adenovirus (Ad-DNR). To determine whether inhibition of CaR expression altered Ca2+ signaling, we examined its impact on Ca2+i response to Ca2+o. Consistent with our previous studies (6Tu C.L. Chang W. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41079-41085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Tu C.L. Chang W. Bikle D.D. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 1074-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), knockdown of CaR inhibited the Ca2+o-induced increase in Ca2+i. As shown in Fig. 1C, raising Ca2+o from 0.03 to 2 mm induced an increase in Ca2+i in keratinocytes infected with the control virus Ad-DNR from 82 ± 7to472 ± 40 nm (mean ± S.D.; n = 49). Keratinocytes infected with the Ad-ASCaR virus had comparable resting Ca2+i (71 ± 12 nm; n = 45), but had a marked reduction in the rise of Ca2+i (to 202 ± 31 nm) in response to 2 mm Ca2+o.As knockdown of CaR inhibited much of, but not completely blocked, the ability of Ca2+o to increase Ca2+i, other mechanisms, such as calcium channels, independent of CaR appear to play a role in mediating Ca2+o-induced Ca2+i response. To investigate whether the change in Ca2+ signaling following reduction in CaR expression affected cell survival, we compared the apoptosis in keratinocytes infected with Ad-ASCaR to that in control cells infected with Ad-DNR by TUNEL staining. Quantitative analysis of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2) showed that fewer than 2% of control keratinocytes undergo apoptosis when cultured in either 0.03 or 1.2 mm Ca2+o, whereas the number of apoptotic cells increased greatly in the Ad-ASCaR-infected keratinocytes (21 ± 3 and 13 ± 4% in 0.03 and 1.2 mm Ca2+o, respectively), indicating an important role of CaR in cell survival. To determine whether the decrease in CaR expression affected differentiation, we examined its impact on Ca2+o-induced expression of terminal differentiation genes by quantitative real-time PCR in keratinocytes infected with Ad-ASCaR or Ad-DNR viruses. As shown in Fig. 3, 72 h of incubation in 1.2 mm Ca2+ significantly increased the mRNA levels of terminal differentiation markers loricrin, filaggrin, and caspase 14 in control keratinocytes infected with Ad-DNR (4-, 2.4-, and 5.5-fold increase, respectively), but failed to do so in the cells infected with Ad-ASCaR. However, neither Ca2+o nor CaR knockdown decreased keratin 14 (K14), a marker for basal layer keratinocytes. These results demonstrated that CaR regulates calcium signaling, cell survival, and differentiation in keratinocytes. Inhibition of CaR Expression Blocked E-cadherin-mediated Cell-Cell Adhesion and Recruitment of PI3K to the Cell MembraneOne of the early cellular responses to Ca2+o in keratinocytes is the formation of the E-cadherin-catenin complex at cell-cell contacts and the linkage of this core adhesive structure to the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate whether CaR is required for Ca2+o activation of E-cadherin signaling, we examined the impact of CaR knockdown on the assembly of the E-cadherin-catenin complex. Fluorescence immunolocalization revealed that the initiation of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell AJ formation occurred within 5 min after the Ca2+o was switched from 0.03 to 2 mm in Ad-DNR-infected keratinocytes (Fig. 4, A-D). Ca2+o promoted the co-localization of E-cadherin with α- (Fig. 4C), β- (Fig. 4A), and p120-catenin (Fig. 4B), as well as actin filaments (Fig. 4D) in AJ in control keratinocytes, whereas inhibition of CaR expression by Ad-ASCaR blocked the ability of Ca2+o to induce the formation of this complex. We then tested whether inhibition of CaR expression affects the production of the components of the E-cadherin signaling pathway. Immunoblotting analyses were performed on the total cell lysates from keratinocytes infected with Ad-ASCaR or Ad-DNR and treated with or without 2 mm Ca2+ using antibodies against E-cadherin, α-, β-, γ-, and p120-catenins, and p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Neither CaR knockdown nor the 5-min Ca2+ treatment significantly altered the expression levels of these proteins (data not shown). To confirm the immunolocalization results, we assessed whether CaR knockdown influences the cell membrane localization of these proteins. Immunoblotting analyses on the plasma membrane lysates demonstrated that 5 min of Ca2+ treatment promoted translocation of E-cadherin, α-, β-, γ-, p120-catenin, and PI3K-p85α to the cell membrane in Ad-DNR-infected keratinocytes, whereas the Ca2+o-induced membrane association of E-cadherin, catenins, and PI3K-p85α were markedly reduced in the Ad-ASCaR-infected cells (Fig. 5A). α2-Integrin was used as a control to demonstrate equal membrane protein extraction.

Netrin promoted the formation of a protein-protein interaction complex that included DOCK180 and the netrin receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC). Inhibition of DOCK180 reduced activation of Rac1 by netrin. Both axon outgrowth and axon attraction induced by netrin were inhibited after DOCK180 knockdown in vertebrate neurons. The in vivo functional role of DOCK180 was demonstrated by its requirement for projection of commissural axons in the neural tube. These findings indicate that netrin stimulation recruits DOCK180 through DCC, which then activates small GTPases, suggesting an essential role for DOCK180 in mediating attractive responses by neurons to netrin-1."
https://openalex.org/W2009177754,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is a key regulator of gene expression in response to signaling of the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) family cytokines, including interleukin 6, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Many efforts have been made to identify Stat3 target genes and to understand the mechanism of how Stat3 regulates gene expression. Using the microarray technique, hundreds of genes have been documented to be potential Stat3 target genes in different cell types. However, only a small fraction of these genes have been proven to be true direct Stat3 target genes. Here we report the identification of novel direct Stat3 target genes using a genome-wide screening procedure based on the chromatin immunoprecipitation method. These novel Stat3 target genes are involved in a diverse array of biological processes such as oncogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation. We show that Stat3 can act as both a repressor and activator on its direct target genes. We further show that most of the novel Stat3 direct target genes are dependent on Stat3 for their transcriptional regulation. In addition, using a physiological cell system, we demonstrate that Stat3 is required for the transcriptional regulation of two of the newly identified direct Stat3 target genes important for muscle differentiation.

When cytokines bind to their cell surface receptors, the receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases become activated and in turn phosphorylate a single tyrosine residue in the STAT molecule. The phosphorylated STATs then enter the nucleus as dimers and bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of their target genes to regulate transcription. Although the seven members of the STAT family have similarity in their molecular structure and function, they play diverse physiological roles in a wide variety of biological processes (3Akira S.

One member of the STAT family, Stat3, mediates the signaling of cytokines that share the gp130 receptor chain, which include interleukin-6, oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (4Akira S.

In response to gp130 ligand stimulation, Stat3 is phosphorylated on Tyr-705 and forms dimers through phosphotyrosine-Src homology 2 domain interactions (6Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The dimerized Stat3 molecules enter the nucleus and bind to a consensus DNA sequence in the promoters of its target genes to regulate transcription (7Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of Stat3 is mediated by its transcription activation domain located in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule (8Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar). In addition to the tyrosine phosphorylation, the Stat3 transcription activation domain contains a serine residue (Ser-724) that is also phosphorylated to achieve maximum transcription activity (9Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 10Sun W. Snyder M. Levy D.E. Zhang J.J.

Furthermore, non-tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 has been shown to be able to activate transcription in cooperation with other transcription factors such as NFκB (15Yang J. Liao X. Agarwal M.K. Barnes L. Auron P.E. Stark G.R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1396-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 16Yoshida Y. Kumar A. Koyama Y. Peng H. Arman A. Boch J.A. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1768-1776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Stat3 plays essential roles in a diverse array of cellular processes. For example, Stat3 activation is associated with oncogenesis and tumor metastasis (17Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar, 18Haura E.B. Turkson J. Jove R. Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2005; 2: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Stat3 is also necessary for the normal development of multiple cellular systems, including early embryogenesis, lymphocyte growth, wound healing, and postnatal survival, as demonstrated by the various Stat3 knockout mouse models (19Shen Y. Schlessinger K. Zhu X. Meffre E. Quimby F. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). LIF-mediated self-renewal of murine embryonic stem cells also requires Stat3 activation (21Raz R. Lee C.K.

Because of these wide ranging physiological functions of Stat3, it is critical to identify Stat3 target genes to fully understand how Stat3 mediates its effect on these various cellular processes. Several microarray analyses have been carried out, and numerous potential downstream targets of Stat3 have been identified (24Paz K. Socci N.D. van Nimwegen E. Viale A. Darnell J.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8455-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Clarkson R.W. Boland M.P. Kritikou E.A. Lee J.M. Freeman T.C. Tiffen P.G. Watson C.J. Mol.

Biol. 2007; 27: 4444-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Particularly among them are genes that regulate cell cycle progression, cell survival/growth, and migration, correlating with the concept that Stat3 is a critical factor in oncogenesis and making it a suitable drug target for cancer treatment (29Darnell J.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 595-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Huang S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1362-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential to identify direct Stat3 target genes to develop specific therapeutic treatments as well as to understand how Stat3 regulates gene transcription to achieve diverse physiological impacts. However, the large numbers of potential Stat3 target genes from the microarray studies make it difficult to systemically distinguish the direct Stat3 targets for further analyses. In this study, we used a genome-wide screening method utilizing the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify Stat3 target genes. Because this method is based on the binding of Stat3 to DNA, the target genes identified are direct Stat3 targets. We show here that we have identified direct Stat3 target genes in NIH3T3 cells that are regulated by OSM. These direct Stat3 target genes include some of the genes that have been identified by previous microarray screening. However, a significant number of novel Stat3 target genes were also identified by this method. These novel genes are diverse in their function, including involvement in oncogenesis, neuronal development, and muscle differentiation. We further demonstrate that Stat3 functions as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor for its direct target genes. Using the Stat3-deficient MEF cells, we show that most of the novel Stat3 direct targets are dependent on Stat3 for their transcriptional regulation. In addition, to test the physiological relevance of these novel direct Stat3 target genes, we showed that Stat3 represses two of its direct target genes in a myoblast cell line for muscle differentiation, and knock down of Stat3 in this myoblast cell line prevents their differentiation. Therefore, we have identified a set of novel direct Stat3 target genes important for a wide range of biological processes, including the control of cellular growth and differentiation. Cell Culture and Reagents–NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc.). Wild-type and Stat3-deficient MEFs (provided by David Levy, New York University) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 cells (from Chisa Hidaka, Hospital for Special Surgery) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for growth conditions. C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (Sigma) for differentiation conditions. The antibodies used were anti-phosphotyrosine-Stat3 (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-Stat3 (BD Transduction Laboratories). Recombinant mouse OSM was from R&D Systems. Recombinant mouse LIF was from Chemicon International. Genome-wide Screening of Direct Target Genes of Stat3 by ChIP–NIH3T3 cells were grown in 15-cm dishes to 80–90% confluency. Cells were then treated with 25 ng/ml mouse OSM for 30 min. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (10Sun W. Snyder M. Levy D.E. Zhang J.J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5880-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with 2.5 μg of Stat3 antibody. The precipitated genomic DNA was further purified three different ways to determine whether different techniques used for the DNA isolation yielded the same target genes. DNA was ethanol-precipitated with yeast tRNA twice, isolated with QIAquick PCR purification kit once, or agarose gel purified once, respectively. For agarose gel purification, DNA fragments ranging in size from 200 bp to 2 kb were excised. DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of sterile deionized water and blunted with the DNA terminator end kit (Lucigen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. There was no significant difference in the final numbers of clones obtained with these various DNA purification methods, and some genes were repetitively pulled out with the different methods. The blunted genomic DNA was amplified by ligation-mediated PCR with linkers containing EcoRI sites (LMPCR.1, 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′, and LMPCR.2, 5′-GAATTCAGATC-3′) as follows. For kinase reaction of LMPCR.2, 9 μl of linker (350 ng/μl), 6 μl of sterile deionized water, 2 μl of kinase buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm ATP, and 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The kinase was then heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min. The entire 20-μl LMPCR.2 reaction was annealed to 9 μl (350 ng/μl) of LMPCR.1. The reaction was heated to 95 °C for 2 min, 65 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 10 min, and 25 °C for 20 min. A total of 3 μl of the annealed linkers were ligated to 10 μl of blunted ChIP DNA with 1 μl (2000 units) of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) at 16 °C for 16 h. Ligation mixtures were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit to obtain the ChIP DNA/linker mixture. The ChIP DNA-linker complex was then PCR-amplified in a reaction containing 5 μl of the ChIP DNA-linker complex, 1 μl of Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 200 pmol of LMPCR.1, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.75 mm dNTPs in a final volume of 50 μl. PCR was performed with the following conditions: 1 cycle 95 °C/50 s, 25 cycles 94 °C/15 s, 55 °C/30 s, 68 °C/2 min, followed by 1 cycle at 68 °C for 7 min. The PCR-amplified DNA was purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit and then digested with 60 units of EcoRI in a 200-μl reaction at 37 °C for 2 h. The EcoRI-digested DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit again and ligated into the EcoRI site of pBluescript followed by transformation into DH5α (Invitrogen) and plated onto LB agar plates containing ampicillin and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Plasmid DNAs were purified from white colonies and sequenced with T7 and T3 primers. Most of the plasmids contained inserts of concatemers of 10–20 bp in length from different genes. Sequences were identified with NCBI BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) against the mouse genome using a combination of the data bases nr, refseq_genomic, and refseq_rna. All sequences were considered potential targets regardless of the location of the sequence within the gene, even if the sequence was not located in the promoter region. GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 software (Agilent Technologies) was used to find genes that are common to a microarray list and our ChIP list. Three publications of microarray studies of mouse cell lines were utilized (24Paz K. Socci N.D. van Nimwegen E. Viale A. Darnell J.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8455-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Clarkson R.W. Boland M.P. Kritikou E.A. Lee J.M. Freeman T.C. Tiffen P.G. Watson C.J. Mol.

Gene-specific ChIP Analysis–NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in 15-cm dishes to 80–90% confluency. Cells were then either treated with 25 ng/ml mouse OSM or left untreated. ChIP analysis was performed as described previously (10Sun W. Snyder M. Levy D.E. Zhang J.J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5880-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with 2.5 μg of Stat3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA from one 15-cm dish was used for a total of six separate PCRs. If promoter sequences for a potential Stat3 target gene could be obtained from NCBI, putative Stat3 sites were identified within these sequences. Some genes do not have promoter sequences available from NCBI, and putative Stat3 sites for these genes were identified by obtaining complete genomic sequences from NCBI followed by searching for potential Stat3 sites 1–3 kb upstream of the translational start site. All subsequent gene-specific ChIP primers were designed to flank the putative Stat3 sites and could amplify PCR fragments that were about 200 bp in size. Primers for the ChIP are as follows: Boc, 5′-GTCTCGCTGGTGTCAGCTC-3′ and 5′-ACACACACCACGGCAGAGT-3′; Cln6, 5′-GAAATGCAGAGAACCCAGGA-3′ and 5′-GGAGGGAGGAGGAATGAGAG-3′; Angpt1, 5′-TTCCTGTCAAGTCATCTTGTGAA-3′ and 5′-GCGTCAGCTGCGAGTACATA-3′; Smad9, 5′-CTGGCTCCACTTTCCAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGGAAAGAGGATGAGAC-3′; Perq1, 5′-CAGGGGAAAAGCTGGTGTAG-3′ and 5′-TCCCAAACCTCACCTTGTTC-3′; TNF-R, 5′-ACCTTCTCTCTCCCCTCAGC-3′ and 5′-ATTGACAACGCTCGTGAATG-3′; Pcnt, 5′-GCGCTGGATTCAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CGGTGGGGAAGAAATCCTA-3′; Pax4, 5′-TTGATGCATGGGAAACTTTG-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTGGCTCTACCCTGAA-3′; Bcl3, 5′-GGCACAATGAGCAGAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCGACTGAACTGAAGGGACT-3′; Fgl2, 5′-TCCATTTAAAGAGCGGACCTT-3′ and 5′-TTCTTCCCACTAAATGTCACCA-3′; Gbp1, 5′-TCCCAGCCTTAGCTCAGAGA-3′ and 5′-AAAGGGGTGGAGTTTCCAGT-3′; Cdo, 5′-GCCTCCGCTTACTGAAAAAC-3′ and 5′-TCCTAGTCCCCAGAAGAAGGA-3′; CBP, 5′-CTGTTTCCGCGAGCAGGT-3′ and 5′-TGTCATTCGCGGAGAAGC-3′; Ect2, 5′-GAAGGATAAGCGAGGACTGC-3′ and 5′-GTGCTCAGTTCCGGGTTC-3′; FasL, 5′-GCCTGGTTTACCAGCCTTCT-3′ and 5′-TGAGACACCCACTCACTTGC-3′; Peg10, 5′-GTCCGGACTCCCGATACAC-3′ and 5′-AGGCTCGGTGGACCTTCT-3′. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)–NIH3T3 cells were grown in 6-well dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS until cells were 80% confluent. Cells were then serumstarved for 24 h. The cells were then either left untreated or treated with mouse OSM at 25 ng/ml for lengths of time as indicated. C2C12 cells were grown to about 80% confluence in growth medium and then cultured in differentiation medium for 24 h followed by treatment with mouse OSM at 25 ng/ml or LIF 100 ng/ml for lengths of time as indicated. WT MEFs and Stat3-deficient MEFs were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to about 80% confluence. The medium was then changed to DMEM without serum for 24 h followed by treatment with OSM at 25 ng/ml. RNA from these various cells was extracted using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis was performed using the SYBR Green Core PCR reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR primers are as follows: TNF-R, 5′-CAGTCTGCAGGGAGTGTGAA-3′ and 5′-CACGCACTGGAAGTGTGTCT-3′; Pcnt, 5′-CCAGATTTCCCCACTCAAGA-3′ and 5′-GTCCTTCCGGACAACTTCAG-3′; Fgl2, 5′-CGTGCTAGGAAGGAGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-CCGGCTTTGTAGTCTTTCCA-3′; Smad9, 5′-GCCTAGCAAGTGTGTCACCA-3′ and 5′-AACGGGAACTCACAGCACTC-3′; Boc, 5′-CATGGATGAACGTGACTTGG-3′ and 5′-GGAGATTGGCTAGCGTCACT-3′; Cln6, 5′-TCTCAACAAGCCAAGTGTCG-3′ and 5-CTGGCTCCCATGATGAAAGT-3′; Angpt1, 5′-TCAGTGGCTGCAAAAACTTG-3′ and 5′-TTTCAAGTCGGGATGTTTGA-3′; Bcl3, 5′-GCCAGACTGCAATTCACCT-3′ and 5′-CTCCAGGAGCAGCAGAACA-3′; Perq1, 5′-TGGAGGATGAGGATGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGTGAGCTGGAGTTCTCTGG-3′; Gbp1, 5′-TGGAGACTTCACTGGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTGGTCCTCCTGTATCC-3′; FasL, 5′-TCCATCTTGTGGGCCTAGAG-3′ and 5′-TCCTAATCCCATTCCAACCA-3′; Cdo, 5′-CAGGAAGCAACTGGAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CAGGGACACCTTCTGATCGT-3′; mMyog, 5′-GGCATGCAAGGTGTGTAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCGCAGGATCTCCACTTTAG-3′. Stat3 siRNA–Stat3 siRNAs and control siRNAs were obtained from Qiagen (catalog numbers SI01435294 and SI01435287 for Stat3 and 1022563 for control siRNA). C2C12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (growth medium) to a density of 1 × 105 cells. Cells were then transfected with Stat3 siRNAs or control siRNAs according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were grown in growth medium for 3 days and then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (differentiation medium) for 24 h. A portion of the transfected cells was analyzed by Western blotting assay to determine the knockdown of Stat3. The transfected cells were further treated with OSM for 4 h or left untreated followed by real time qRT-PCR analyses. Western Blot Analyses–Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with the indicated antibodies followed by chemiluminescence (DuPont). Identification of Direct Stat3 Target Genes by Genome-wide ChIP Screening–To identify direct Stat3 target genes, we used a genome-wide screening method based on ChIP followed by ligation-mediated PCR and subcloning. A similar approach has been utilized to identify direct target genes for other transcription factors such as cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein (31Impey S. McCorkle S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2004; 119: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). For our screening, we used NIH3T3 cells that have been extensively used as a cell line for studying Stat3 function (17Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). OSM activates Stat3 robustly in NIH3T3 cells (10Sun W. Snyder M. Levy D.E. Zhang J.J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5880-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and was chosen as a ligand to activate Stat3 at maximum level for genome wide screening of Stat3 target genes. Because ligand-activated STATs become de-phosphorylated and inactivated rapidly (32Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 33Xu W. Nair J.S. Malhotra A. Zhang J.J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a 30-min OSM treatment time point was chosen to capture as many direct Stat3 target genes as possible, as well as to make it feasible for a scaled up ChIP assay. NIH3T3 cells were treated with OSM for 30 min, and ChIP assays were performed with a Stat3-specific antibody. The precipitated genomic DNA fragments from the ChIP were then amplified by ligation-mediated PCR and further subcloned into pBluescript followed by sequencing of the cloned inserts (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The DNA sequences obtained were used to BLAST search against the mouse genome data base. Four separate independent ChIP-subcloning experiments were performed, and ∼400 genes were identified. These potential Stat3 target genes function in a wide range of biological processes, including immune response, oncogenesis, cell cycle control, development, cell adhesion, and differentiation. Out of these potential direct Stat3 target genes, about one-fourth have been identified previously by microarray analyses of mouse cell lines (24Paz K. Socci N.D. van Nimwegen E. Viale A.

Most of these microarray-identified genes have not been confirmed by ChIP to demonstrate that they are direct Stat3 target genes. Therefore, using the genome-wide screen method based on ChIP, we have identified the direct Stat3 target genes from these microarray studies. Identification of Novel Direct Stat3 Target Genes–The majority of the Stat3 target genes isolated by ChIP using NIH3T3 cells with a 30-min OSM stimulation have not been identified previously by microarray analyses. To confirm that we have identified novel direct Stat3 target genes, gene-specific ChIP analyses were further performed on these potential Stat3 target genes. Some of the novel Stat3 target genes (34 genes) were cloned out multiple times and therefore were more likely to be true Stat3 target genes (supplemental Table S2). We focused on this group of genes to perform the gene-specific ChIP analyses, as well as including several genes fromsupplemental Table S1 and novel genes that have only been identified once by the ChIP screening method. Putative Stat3-binding sites (TTC/GN2–4GAA) (7Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ChIP PCR primers were designed to flank the potential Stat3 sites to generate ∼200-bp PCR fragments. We performed gene-specific ChIP on 22 genes fromsupplemental Table S2, 9 genes fromsupplemental Table S1, and 1 novel gene that had been isolated once (FasL). 7 of the genes fromsupplemental Table S1 (TNF-R, Pcnt, Bcl3, Gbp1, Pax4, Fgl2, and Cdo) showed an increase in the amount of Stat3 bound to their promoters in response to OSM treatment compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1A), whereas two genes, Tek and Ltbp3, had constitutive binding of Stat3 (data not shown and seesupplemental Table S4). The c-fos promoter is shown as a positive control (Fig. 1A). Of the 22 novel Stat3 target genes tested with gene-specific ChIP assay, 11 of them showed an increase in Stat3 binding to the promoter in response to OSM treatment. Results for Cln6, Perq1, Smad9, Boc, CBP, Ect2, FasL, Angpt1, and Peg10 are shown in Fig. 1B. Il28ra and Dzip1 also showed an increase in Stat3 bound to their promoters in response to OSM treatment (data not shown and seesupplemental Table S4). 7 of the novel Stat3 target genes (Notch4, Bag4, V2r4, Sema3g, Itga11, Paxip1, and Pax1) showed constitutive Stat3 binding to their promoters that were not affected by OSM treatment (data not shown and seesupplemental Table S4). Only 4 of the potential direct Stat3 targets (B3bp, Nav1, Ighmbp2, and Ddef2) had no detectable Stat3 binding (data not shown) in either treated or untreated conditions. Because the ChIP primers usually flank only one of several putative Stat3 sites in these genes, it is possible that we did not choose the right Stat3 sites for these four genes. However, these results demonstrate that with preliminary gene-specific ChIP analyses most of the potential novel Stat3 target genes (∼82%) identified by the ChIP assay are true direct Stat3 target genes. Stat3 Can Both Activate and Repress Its Direct Target Genes in Response to OSM–To further understand how Stat3 regulates its direct target genes, RNA expression of the target genes was analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR. NIH3T3 cells were either untreated or treated with OSM for 2 and 4 h. cDNA-specific RT-PCR primers were designed for all the target genes that showed in"
https://openalex.org/W2083101713,"Mate choice is an evolutionarily critical decision that requires the detection of multiple sex-specific signals followed by central integration of these signals to direct appropriate behavior. The mechanisms controlling mate choice remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the glial amino-acid transporter genderblind controls whether Drosophila melanogaster males will attempt to mate with other males. Genderblind (gb) mutant males showed no alteration in heterosexual courtship or copulation, but were attracted to normally unappealing male species-specific chemosensory cues. As a result, genderblind mutant males courted and attempted to copulate with other Drosophila males. This homosexual behavior could be induced within hours using inducible RNAi, suggesting that genderblind controls nervous system function rather than its development. Consistent with this, and indicating that glial genderblind regulates ambient extracellular glutamate to suppress glutamatergic synapse strength in vivo, homosexual behavior could be turned on and off by altering glutamatergic transmission pharmacologically and/or genetically."
https://openalex.org/W2023456818,"mTORC1 is a complex of proteins that includes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and several regulatory proteins. It is activated by a variety of hormones (e.g. insulin) and nutrients (e.g. amino acids) that act to stimulate cell growth and proliferation and repressed by hormones (e.g. glucocorticoids) that act to reduce cell growth. Curiously, mTORC1 signaling is reported to be rapidly (e.g. within 1-2 h) activated by inhibitors of protein synthesis that act on either mRNA translation elongation or gene transcription. However, the basis for the mTORC1 activation has not been satisfactorily delineated. In the present study, mTORC1 signaling was found to be activated in response to inhibition of either the initiation or elongation phases of mRNA translation. Changes in mTORC1 signaling were inversely proportional to alterations in the expression of the mTORC1 repressor, REDD1, but not the expression of TRB3 or TSC2. Moreover the cycloheximide-induced increase in mTORC1 signaling was significantly attenuated in cells lacking REDD1, showing that REDD1 plays an integral role in the response. Finally, the half-life of REDD1 was estimated to be 5 min or less. Overall, the results are consistent with a model in which inhibition of protein synthesis leads to a loss of REDD1 protein because of its rapid degradation, and in part reduced REDD1 expression subsequently leads to de-repression of mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 is a complex of proteins that includes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and several regulatory proteins.

In contrast, mTORC2 contains GβL, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (rictor), and hSIN1. Repression of mTORC1 signaling using the selective inhibitor rapamycin not only leads to a reduction in the size of cells in culture (3Fingar D.C. Salama S. Tsou C. Harlow E. Blenis J.

The signaling pathways through which these hormones act to increase mTOR signaling (e.g. the phosphatidylinositide (PI) 3-kinase and extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways) converge on a GTPase activator protein referred to as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2 (Tuberin) (15Kwiatkowski D.J. Manning B.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R251-R258Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). TSC2, in a complex with TSC1 (Hamartin), promotes the GTPase activity of the ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). Rheb binds directly to mTOR, and when present as a Rheb·GTP complex, activates mTOR. Conversely, the binding of Rheb·GDP to mTOR is inhibitory. By activating the GTPase activity of Rheb, TSC2 causes a redistribution of Rheb from the stimulatory Rheb·GTP complex into the inhibitory GDP-bound form. mTORC1 signaling is also activated by nutrients, particularly amino acids (16Fox H.L. Pham P.T. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Lynch C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1232-C1238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acids may also act through Rheb to activate mTORC1 (17Long X. Lin Y.

For example, glucocorticoids act rapidly (i.e. within 4 h) to upregulate the expression of the mTORC1 repressor, regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD1) (23Wang H. Kubica N.

Increased REDD1 expression promotes the assembly of the active TSC1·TSC2 complex, leading to decreased mTORC1 signaling.Reports in the literature suggest that mTORC1 signaling is up-regulated following the inhibition of protein synthesis (26Beugnet A.

Physiol. 2000; 279: E74-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibitors of the elongation phase of mRNA translation have been used to repress protein synthesis, and one report (31Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) suggests that accumulation of intracellular amino acids under these conditions might be responsible for the observed activation of mTORC1 signaling. Another possibility is that the activation of mTORC1 is mediated specifically through the inhibition of elongation, perhaps in a manner analogous to the generation of the signaling molecule ppGpp in bacteria (32Jones S. Nat. Rev. Molec. Cell Biol. 2007; 5 (331-331)Google Scholar). To date, there have been no reports to indicate whether or not inhibitors of the initiation phase of mRNA translation might produce a similar activation of mTORC1 signaling. Another condition under which activation of mTORC1 signaling occurs is following inhibition of gene transcription with actinomycin D treatment (30Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E74-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Loreni F. Thomas G. Amaldi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6594-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this case, the activation of mTORC1 signaling occurs prior to detectable inhibition of global rates of protein synthesis, so it is unlikely that the effect is due to an accumulation of intracellular amino acids. A potential explanation for the observed activation of mTORC1 signaling under all of these conditions is that inhibitors of protein synthesis acting either on the elongation or initiation phases of mRNA translation, or gene transcription, cause the rapid loss of a specific protein that acts to repress mTORC1. Such a protein would have to turnover rapidly because activation of mTORC1 signaling is observed within 1-2 h of inhibiting the elongation phase of mRNA translation (30Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E74-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, mTORC1 signaling was shown to be activated when either mRNA translation initiation or elongation was inhibited. Moreover, activation of mTORC1 signaling was proportional to the extent of inhibition of protein synthesis. A search for a potential upstream repressor of mTORC1 whose turnover was rapidly increased upon inhibition of mRNA translation revealed that REDD1, but not TSC2 or TRB3, expression was directly proportional to changes in protein synthesis and inversely proportional to alterations in mTORC1 signaling. In addition, the half-life of REDD1 was estimated to be <5 min. Together with the observation that induction of mTORC1 signaling by cycloheximide is dramatically attenuated in REDD1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), the results presented herein are consistent with a model in which inhibitors of protein synthesis acting on either the initiation or elongation phase of mRNA translation, or gene transcription, cause a rapid reduction in REDD1 protein expression, resulting in activation of mTORC1 activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureWild type (GCN2+/+) and GCN2-/- MEFs (kindly provided by Drs. David Ron and Heather Harding, NY University School of Medicine) were maintained at 37 °C in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Wild type (REDD1+/+) and REDD1-/- MEFs (kindly provided by Dr. Leif Ellisen, Harvard Medical School) were similarly maintained. In all experiments, cells were ∼50-70% confluent. On the day of the study, cells were randomly divided into five groups. One group of cells (control) was placed in serum-free medium. Two other groups of cells were placed in serum-free medium containing either 1 μm cycloheximide (A. G. Scientific, Inc.) or 5 mm histidinol (Sigma-Aldrich). The final two groups of cells were placed in serum-free medium lacking His, and in one of those groups, the medium also contained 5 mm histidinol. Cells were returned to the incubator for 2 h prior to harvest unless otherwise indicated.Measurement of Global Rates of Protein SynthesisGlobal rates of protein synthesis were estimated by the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine into protein as described previously (34Kimball S.R. Farrell P.A. Nguyen H.V. Jefferson L.S. Davis T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E585-E592Google Scholar).Western Blot AnalysisCells were harvested by scraping in SDS sample buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 12.5% v/v glycerol; 1.25% SDS; 1.25% v/v β-mercaptoethanol; 0.1% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and equal volumes of each sample were subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (35Kimball S.R. Orellana R.A. O'Connor P.M.J. Suryawan A. Bush J.A. Nguyen H.V. Thivierge M.C. Jefferson L.S. Davis T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E637-E644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Pall Life Sciences), and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies: anti-phospho-Ser51 (BIOSOURCE International, Invitrogen) or total eIF2α, anti-4E-BP1 (Bethyl Laboratory), anti-S6K1 (Bethyl), anti-TSC2 (Cell Signaling) anti-TRB3 (EMD Chemicals, Inc.), or anti-REDD1 (ProteinTech Group Inc.). Membranes were then incubated in secondary antibody (Bethyl) at room temperature for one hour and blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Images were captured using a GeneGnome HR Bioimager (SynGene) and quantitated using GeneTools software (SynGene).Sucrose Density GradientsFor polysome analysis, cells were scraped in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 75 mm KCl; 5 mm MgCl2; 250 mm sucrose; 1:10 volume 10% Triton X-100, and 13% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide), and the suspension was rocked for 10 min at 4 °C to lyse the cells. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (36Palmer L.K. Rannels S.L. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Keil R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E1267-E1275Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, discontinuous 9-step 20% (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 250 mm KCl; 5 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm EDTA; 20% w/w sucrose) to 47% (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 250 mm KCl; 5 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm EDTA; 47% w/w sucrose) sucrose density gradients were formed as previously described (36Palmer L.K. Rannels S.L. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Keil R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E1267-E1275Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that the KCl concentration was changed to 75 mm. An equal amount of protein was loaded onto each gradient and centrifuged at 288,200 × g at 4 °C for 1 h 50 min. Gradients were fractionated using an ISCO gradient pump (Teledyne Isco, Inc.) while the absorbance at 254 nm was continuously recorded. The ratio of ribosomes present in the nonpolysomal fraction to those present in polysomes was calculated from the area under the curve for each fraction.RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time PCRRNA was extracted from wild type and GCN2-/- MEFs using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR as described previously (23Wang H. Kubica N. Ellisen L.W. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39128-39134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), with the exception that primers corresponding to the mouse REDD1 and GAPDH mRNAs were used for amplification. The primers used were as follows: GAPDH forward primer, 5′-GTTGTCTCCTGCGACTTCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGCTGTAGCCGTATTCATTG-3′; REDD1 forward primer, 5′-TGGTGCCCACCTTTCAGTTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCAGGGACTGGCTGTAACC-3′. mRNA expression levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression.Measurement of Intracellular Amino Acid ContentFor measurement of intracellular amino acid content, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in 3% perchloric acid, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was neutralized with 1 m K2HPO4, mixed, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was subjected to amino acid analysis by HPLC (37MacLean D.A. Spriet L.L. Hultman E. Graham T.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in the General Clinical Research Center at The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with the corresponding post-test using the InStat software program (GraphPad) as noted in the figure legends.RESULTSIn the present study, wild type MEFs and MEFs lacking GCN2 (GCN2-/-) were employed as experimental model systems to distinguish mRNA translation initiation-versus elongation-induced changes in mTORC1 signaling following selective inhibition of either process. Changes in mTORC1 signaling that occurred in response to inhibition of translation elongation by cycloheximide in MEFs were compared with changes associated with inhibition of initiation in cells deprived of His or in cells treated with the histidinyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor, histidinol, to induce His-tRNA deacylation (38Hansen B.S. Vaughan M.H. Wang L-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3854-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deprivation of essential amino acids such as His leads to activation of the protein kinase GCN2 by deacylated tRNA (39Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). GCN2 subsequently phosphorylates the α-subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α) on Ser51, resulting in inhibition of initiation relative to elongation. Initially, the effectiveness of cycloheximide and His deprivation in inhibiting protein synthesis was assessed by measuring changes in [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine incorporation into protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, global rates of protein synthesis were reduced to ∼15% of the control value in wild type MEFs treated with cycloheximide and to about 30% of the control value in wild type MEFs deprived of His. Addition of histidinol to His-containing medium was significantly less effective in repressing protein synthesis compared with His deprivation. However, the combination of His deprivation and histidinol treatment reduced protein synthesis to ∼10% of the control value. In GCN2-/- MEFs, the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by cycloheximide was similar in magnitude to the decrease observed in wild type MEFs (Fig. 1B). As reported previously using perfused livers from GCN2-/- mice (40Zhang P. McGrath B.C. Reinert J. Olsen D.S. Lei L. Gill S. Wek S.A. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), the inhibition of protein synthesis in GCN2-/- MEFs caused by His deprivation and/or histidinol treatment was also similar in magnitude to wildtype MEFs. To confirm that the GCN2-/- MEFs lacked functional GCN2, the phosphorylation state of eIF2α was measured by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes the protein when Ser51 is phosphorylated. As shown in Fig. 1C, His deprivation, treatment with histidinol, and His deprivation combined with histidinol treatment all led to a significant increase in eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser51 compared with wild type control MEFs or wild type MEFs treated with cycloheximide. In contrast, eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser51 was not increased in GCN2-/- MEFs in response to any of the treatments.A possible explanation for the decrease in protein synthesis that occurred in GCN2-/- MEFs during His deprivation and/or histidinol treatment is that in the absence of GCN2, accumulation of deacylated tRNA resulting from deprivation of an essential amino acid leads to an inhibition of translation elongation rather than initiation. To assess this possibility, polysome aggregation was measured in wildtype and GCN2-/- MEFs using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In this type of analysis, inhibition of initiation relative to elongation leads to disaggregation of polysomes with an increase in the proportion of ribosomes present as 80 S monomers (41Safer B. Jagus R. Kemper W.M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of elongation relative to initiation has the opposite effect, i.e. ribosomes accumulate in polysomes. As expected, cycloheximide treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of ribosomes present as 80 S monomers concomitant with accumulation of ribosomes in polysomes in both wild type and GCN2-/- MEFs (Fig. 2), indicative of an inhibition of elongation. In wildtype MEFs, His deprivation, histidinol treatment, or a combination of His deprivation and histidinol treatment all caused a decrease in the number of ribosomes present in the polysomal fraction of the gradient with a corresponding increase in ribosomes present as 80 S monomers, a result consistent with inhibition of initiation. In contrast, in GCN2-/- MEFs, His deprivation and/or histidinol treatment resulted in an inhibition of elongation as indicated by a shift of ribosomes from 80 S monomers into polysomes.FIGURE 2Analysis of polysomal aggregation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Wild type (A, C, E, G, and I) and GCN2-/- (B, D, F, H, and J) cells were treated with cycloheximide (C and D) or histidinol (E and F) or were deprived of His with (I and J) or without (G and H) histidinol treatment as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Cell supernatants were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The black arrow in each panel denotes the location of 80 S monomers. The ratio of the ribosomal content of the non-polysomal to the polysomal fraction (NP/P) is shown as an inset to each panel. The dashed vertical line in each panel denotes the separation between the two fractions.

Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar), were measured as altered migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The electrophoretic migration of both proteins is inversely proportional to their phosphorylation state, with the most highly phosphorylated forms of the proteins exhibiting the slowest migration during electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3, cycloheximide- and His deprivation-induced changes in phosphorylation of both proteins were inversely proportional to alterations in protein synthesis. Thus, all four treatments led to increased phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and S6K1. However, the magnitude of the increase was greater in cells treated with cycloheximide or treated with histidinol in medium lacking His compared with cells either deprived of His or treated with histidinol alone. Moreover, the pattern of response in GCN2-/- MEFs (Fig. 3, B and D) was identical to that in wild type cells (Fig. 3, A and C). Interestingly, phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and S6K1 in untreated wild type MEFs tended to be higher than in untreated GCN2-/- MEFs, a point discussed further below.FIGURE 3Effect of inhibition of translation initiation or elongation on mTOR signaling in wild type and GCN2-/- MEFs. Wild type (A and C) and GCN2-/- (B and D) MEFs were treated with cycloheximide or histidinol or were deprived of His with or without histidinol treatment as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (A and B) and S6K1 (C and D) was assessed by changes in migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was calculated as the proportion of the protein present in the hyperphosphorylated γ-form and phosphorylation of S6K1 was calculated as the proportion of the protein present in the hyperphosphorylated β, γ, and δ forms.

Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) suggested that activation of mTORC1 signaling that occurred in response to inhibition of translation elongation by agents such as cycloheximide was due to accumulation of intracellular concentrations of amino acids. To determine whether or not such a change would explain the activation of mTORC1 signaling observed in the present study, the intracellular content of His and the branched-chain amino acids was measured in control cells and cells deprived of histidine. The content of the branched-chain amino acids was measured because in many cells they are as potent as a complete mixture of amino acids in activating mTORC1 (43Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 227S-231SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that the intracellular His content was reduced to 43% of the control value in His-deprived wild type MEFs and the intracellular contents of Leu, Ile, and Val in His-deprived wild type MEFs was 105, 93, and 91% of the control values, respectively (n = 3 experiments; within each experiment three dishes of cells were independently analyzed). Similarly, in His-deprived GCN2-/- MEFs, the intracellular contents of Leu, Ile, and Val were 116, 114, and 111% of the control value, respectively. Thus, an increase in the intracellular branched-chain amino acids is unlikely to explain activation of mTORC1 signaling associated with His deprivation in MEFs.An alternative explanation for the activation of mTORC1 signaling observ"

Using in vitro cell culture models, we show that n-6 PUFAs was pro-adipogenic under conditions with base-line levels of cAMP, but anti-adipogenic when the levels of cAMP were elevated. The anti-adipogenic action of n-6 PUFAs was dependent on a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated induction of cyclooxygenase expression and activity. We show that n-6 PUFAs were pro-adipogenic when combined with a high carbohydrate diet, but non-adipogenic when combined with a high protein diet in mice. The high protein diet increased the glucagon/insulin ratio, leading to elevated cAMP-dependent signaling and induction of cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin synthesis. Mice fed the high protein diet had a markedly lower feed efficiency than mice fed the high carbohydrate diet. Yet, oxygen consumption and apparent heat production were similar. Mice on a high protein diet had increased hepatic expression of PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α) and genes involved in energy-demanding processes like urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis. We conclude that cAMP signaling is pivotal in regulating the adipogenic effect of n-6 PUFAs and that diet-induced differences in cAMP levels may explain the ability of n-6 PUFAs to either enhance or counteract adipogenesis and obesity.

The effect of dietary fat on human health is not solely a matter of quantity but depends also on the nature of the fatty acids. The current recommendation is to replace saturated fat by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). 5The abbreviations used are:PUFApolyunsaturated fatty acidCOXcyclooxygenasePGE2 and PGF2αprostaglandin E2 and F2α, respectivelyRTreverse transcriptionqPCRquantitative PCRGCgas chromatographyMIXmethylisobutylxanthineCREcAMP-response elementCREBCRE-binding protein6-MB-cAMPN6-monobutyryl-cAMP.5The abbreviations used are:PUFApolyunsaturated fatty acidCOXcyclooxygenasePGE2 and PGF2αprostaglandin E2 and F2α, respectivelyRTreverse transcriptionqPCRquantitative PCRGCgas chromatographyMIXmethylisobutylxanthineCREcAMP-response elementCREBCRE-binding protein6-MB-cAMPN6-monobutyryl-cAMP. Today, more than 85% of the total dietary PUFA intake in Western diets is n-6 PUFAs, mainly linoleic acid, a precursor of arachidonic acid, whereas the consumption of n-3 PUFAs has declined (1Simopoulos A.P. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2002; 56: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Since the high intake of n-6 has been associated with childhood obesity, concerns regarding this matter have been raised (2Ailhaud G. Massiera F. Weill P. Legrand P. Alessandri J.M. Guesnet P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, animal studies have yielded conflicting results, with some studies demonstrating that a diet enriched in n-6 PUFAs decreases adipose tissue mass (3Matsuo T. Takeuchi H. Suzuki H. Suzuki M. Asia Pac. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 11: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Okuno M. Kajiwara K. Imai S. Kobayashi T. Honma N. Maki T. Suruga K. Goda T. Takase S. Muto Y. Moriwaki H. J.

Johnson P.R. Stern J.S. Hirsch J. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E279-E286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dichotomy of action of n-6 PUFAs in feeding experiments is mirrored by the dichotomy of the effects of arachidonic acid on fat cell differentiation in vitro. On one hand, arachidonic acid has been identified as one of the adipogenic components of serum and is required for induction of differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells and Ob1771 preadipose cells (9Gaillard D. Negrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, arachidonic acid and its metabolites generated by cyclooxygenases (COXs) inhibit differentiation of primary preadipocytes (10Serrero G. Lepak N.M. Goodrich S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 1246 cells (11Serrero G. Lepak N.M. Goodrich S.P.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5641-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).In the present study, we present data that reconcile and explain the disparate effects of n-6 PUFAs on adipocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that cAMP signaling plays a pivotal role controlling the production of antiadipogenic prostaglandins. In vivo, the obesigenic action of n-6 PUFAs is determined by the balance between dietary carbohydrates and protein. A high carbohydrate/protein ratio translated into a high plasma insulin/glucagon ratio, and in this setting, dietary n-6 PUFAs promoted strongly adipose tissue expansion. Conversely, a high protein/carbohydrate ratio translated into a high plasma glucagon/insulin ratio and enhanced cAMP-dependent signaling. In this setting, COX-mediated prostaglandin synthesis was enhanced, and dietary n-6 PUFAs decreased white adipose tissue mass. The decreased obesigenic action of n-6 PUFAs in mice fed a protein-rich diet did not result from increased dissipation of energy by uncoupled respiration but rather reflected increased energy expenditure in relation to gluconeogenesis and urea formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Differentiation—3T3-L1 cells were cultured and induced to differentiate by 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 1 μg/ml insulin (MDI) as previously described (13Hansen J.B.

The mice were kept at a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22 °C. After acclimatization, the animals were fed ad libitum or pair-fed experimental diets. The compositions of the diets are presented in supplemental Table 1. Corn oil was chosen as the n-6 fatty acid source, since this oil is particularly enriched in linoleic acid, and analysis of the diet confirmed that more than 50% of the fatty acids in the diets were linoleic acid (supplemental Table 2). The diet did not contain arachidonic acid, but analysis of the fatty acid composition of red blood cells confirmed conversion of ingested n-6 PUFAs to arachidonic acid (supplemental Table 2). Body weight was recorded twice a week. Mice were killed by cardiac puncture under anesthesia (Dormitor (1 mg/kg body weight) and Ketalar (75 mg/kg body weight)), and serum was prepared from blood. Tissues were dissected out, freeze-clamped, and frozen at -80 °C.Analyses in Computerized Metabolic Cages—Male C57BL/6J mice 6 weeks of age were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Maastricht, The Netherlands). Animals received a standard chow diet (AIN93G/95). After 1 week of acclimatization in the experimental facility, the animals were fed a corn oil diet supplemented with sucrose (n = 8) or protein (n = 8) for a period of 5 weeks before the start of the metabolic cage experiments. Mice were acclimatized to the metabolic cage environment for 1 day prior to starting of the monitoring period. During the metabolic cage experiment, oxygen consumption, CO2 production, food intake, and activity (x-y-z-axis) were measured as described elsewhere (16den Hoek van A.M. Heijboer A.C. Voshol P.J.

Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-goat, or anti-rabbit antibodies obtained from DAKO.Fatty Acid Composition—The fatty acids in diets and isolated red blood cells were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) (v/v) and saponified and methylated using 12% BF3 in methanol. The fatty acid composition of total lipids was analyzed on a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer as previously described (18Arslan G. Brunborg L.A. Frøyland L. Brun J.G. Valen M. Berstad A.

Phillips F. Morton R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Massiera F. Saint-Marc P. Seydoux J. Murata T. Kobayashi T. Narumiya S. Guesnet P. Amri E.Z.

Res. 2001; 9: 234S-238SCrossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These disparate findings may be explained by our previous finding that the effect of n-6 PUFAs depends on the intracellular level of cAMP (19Petersen R.K. Jorgensen C. Rustan A.C. Froyland L. Muller-Decker K. Furstenberger G. Berge R.K. Kristiansen K. Madsen L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2320-2330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in the presence of the cAMP-elevating agent methylisobutylxanthine (MIX), arachidonic acid inhibited adipogenesis (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of PKA activity by (Rp)-cAMPS/(Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS or of cyclooxygenase activity by indomethacin restored adipocyte differentiation in the presence of arachidonic acid and MIX (Fig. 1A). By contrast, in the absence of MIX, arachidonic acid promoted adipogenesis, which, however, was inhibited by selective activation of PKA by N6-monobutyryl-cAMP (6-MB-cAMP). Inclusion of indomethacin rescued differentiation in the presence of 6-MB-cAMP (Fig. 1B).COX-2 protein expression is transiently induced when adipocyte differentiation is induced by MDI treatment (19Petersen R.K. Jorgensen C. Rustan A.C. Froyland L. Muller-Decker K. Furstenberger G. Berge R.K. Kristiansen K. Madsen L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2320-2330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A cAMP-responsive element (CRE) has been identified in the COX-2 promoter (20Xie W. Fletcher B. Andersen R. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and hence it is likely that COX-2 expression is regulated via cAMP-dependent signaling in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Treatment with the cAMP-elevating agent MIX induced the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the wild-type COX-2 promoter transiently transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas no induction was observed when the regulatory CRE element in the COX-2 promoter was mutated. Of note, combined treatment with MIX and arachidonic acid resulted in a greater activation than treatment with MIX alone (Fig. 1C).To further analyze the interplay between cAMP and arachidonic acid in regulation of COX expression, 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate in the absence or presence of MIX with or without arachidonic acid, and RNA was harvested at different time points. A combined treatment with arachidonic acid and MIX led to a strong and sustained expression of both COX-1 and COX-2 during initiation of differentiation, whereas treatment with arachidonic acid or MIX alone led to a weak induction of COX-1 and COX-2 expression (Fig. 1D). As anticipated, omitting MIX from the induction mixture abolished the transient induction of COX-2 (and COX-1). Together, these results suggest the existence of a regulatory circuit by which cAMP/PKA-dependent induction of COX expression sensitizes the cell to an inhibitory action of arachidonic acid, which depends on COX activity, and further that the synthesized prostaglandins feed back, securing sustained expression of COX-1 and COX-2.To corroborate the existence of such a regulatory circuit in mediating an inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid on adipocyte differentiation, COX-1 and COX-2 were retrovirally expressed, alone or in combination in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Retroviral expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1E). Since forced expression of COX-1 induced COX-2 expression, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (NS398) was added to the COX-1-expressing cells. Similarly, cells with forced expression of COX-2 were treated with a selective COX-1 inhibitor (SC560). Twenty-four hours after the induction of differentiation, media were collected and analyzed for the main prostaglandins produced by 3T3-L1 cells (21Hyman B.T. Stoll L.L. Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Forced expression of COX-1 or COX-2 alone did not per se enhance prostaglandin synthesis, but when COX-1 and COX-2 were simultaneously expressed, the production of PGE2 and PGF2α was increased. However, exogenous arachidonic acid was required to boost the synthesis of prostaglandins (Fig. 1F). In accordance with this, forced expression of the COXs was not able to inhibit MDI-induced differentiation per se (Fig. 1G) but sensitized 3T3-L1 cells for arachidonic acid-mediated inhibition of differentiation, as indicated by the lack of Oil Red-O staining of cells expressing COX-1 and COX-2 treated with 30 μm arachidonic acid (Fig. 1G).If the role of cAMP/PKA signaling in mediating arachidonic acid-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation is solely linked to induction of COX expression, forced expression of the COXs should alleviate the requirement for elevated cAMP levels in arachidonic acid-mediated inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. In keeping with this prediction, arachidonic acid completely prevented adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells with forced expression of COX-1 and COX-2 also in the absence of MIX (Fig. 1G). Finally, both PGF2α and PGE2 were able to inhibit differentiation in the absence or presence of MIX (Fig. 1, H and I), providing further evidence for the importance of the cAMP-PKA-COX-prostaglandin axis in regulating the effect of arachidonic acid on adipocyte differentiation.The Effect of Corn Oil on Body Weight and Adipose Tissue Mass Is Regulated by the Balance between Carbohydrate and Protein in the Feed—As for in vitro studies, fundamentally opposite effects of n-6 fatty acids on adipose tissue development in vivo have been reported. Some studies have demonstrated that a diet enriched in n-6 PUFAs decreases adipose tissue growth (3Matsuo T. Takeuchi H. Suzuki H. Suzuki M. Asia Pac. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 11: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Okuno M. Kajiwara K. Imai S. Kobayashi T. Honma N. Maki T. Suruga K. Goda T. Takase S. Muto Y. Moriwaki H. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas other studies have associated dietary n-6 PUFAs with an increased propensity to obesity (5Cleary M. Phillips F. Morton R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Massiera F. Saint-Marc P. Seydoux J. Murata T. Kobayashi T. Narumiya S. Guesnet P. Amri E.Z. Negrel R.

Since the adipogenic potential of n-6 PUFAs is dependent on the cAMP status in vitro, we hypothesize that the hormonal status, such as the glucagon/insulin ratio in particular, might be of importance in regulating the effect of n-6 PUFAs on adipose tissues also in vivo. Since the glucagon/insulin ratio is altered in response to intake of carbohydrates versus protein, we predicted that the adipogenic effect of n-6 PUFAs might be determined by the ratio between carbohydrates and protein in the feed.To test this hypothesis, obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice were fed an energy-dense high fat diet enriched in n-6 fatty acids (corn oil), supplemented with either protein or sucrose (supplemental Tables 1 and 2) for 53 days. The C57BL/6J mice were chosen in order to limit adaptive thermogenesis that occurs in most mice strains when fed an energy-dense diet (22Watson P.M. Commins S.P. Beiler R.J. Hatcher H.C. Gettys T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E356-E365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Corn oil was chosen as an n-6 fatty acid source, since this oil is enriched in linoleic acid, the predominant PUFA in Western diets (23Zhou L. Nilsson A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1521-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the diet confirmed that more than 50% of the fatty acids in the diets were linoleic acid (supplemental Table 2). The diet did not contain arachidonic acid, but analysis of the fatty acid composition of red blood cells confirmed conversion of the dietary n-6 PUFAs to arachidonic acid (supplemental Table 2). The corn oil-enriched diets were isocaloric and contained a total of 24.3 ± 0.3 and 24.9 ± 0.1 weight % fat, respectively. It should be noted that the sucrose-enriched diet contained 20 weight % protein and hence was not protein-deficient.Mice fed the sucrose-supplemented corn oil diet ad libitum gained considerably more weight than mice fed the high protein-supplemented corn oil diet (Fig. 2A). The higher total body weight gain in mice fed corn oil in combination with sucrose was to a large extent due to an increase in white adipose tissue mass (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2A high corn oil diet supplemented with sucrose, but not protein, induces obesity in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice (n = 6) were fed a high corn oil diet supplemented with protein or sucrose ad libitum. After 53 days, the experiment was terminated, and the mice and adipose tissue were weighted (A). B-H, C57BL/6J mice (n = 6) were pair-fed a high corn oil-supplemented diet with protein or sucrose, whereas a third group received a normal chow diet. The weight was recorded twice per week (B). After 56 days, the experiment was terminated, the mice were photographed, and adipose tissues (interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT)) were dissected out and weighed (C). D, glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels in serum. Expression of the cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) and cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase 4b (PDE4b) was measured by RT-qPCR and normalized to TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) in adipose tissue (E). Phosphorylation of CREB was determined by Western blotting. Expression of vimentin verified equal loading of protein (F). Expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in adipose tissues was measured by RT-qPCR. The expression in each animal was normalized to TBP (G). H, serum PGE2 and PGF2α.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate whether the different effect of the diets could be explained by altered energy expenditure and/or voluntary activity of the animals, the mice were individually housed in metabolic cages. No difference in oxygen consumption was found between the two groups, but the respiratory exchange rate was lower in mice fed corn oil in combination with protein than with sucrose (Fig. 3), indicating that relatively more fat and possibly protein were used as substrates for oxidation. However, no increase in expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in muscle or liver was observed (Fig. 4). In fact, a lower heat production, indicating lower total energy expenditure, was observed in mice fed the protein-supplemented diet (Fig. 3). This was not an effect of reduced animal activity but could partly be explained by the observed lower food intake (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Metabolic parameters of mice fed corn oil in combination with protein or sucrose. Obesityprone C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) were fed a high corn oil diet supplemented with protein or sucrose. After 5 weeks, respiratory exchange ratio, heat production, oxygen consumption, total X activity, accumulated feeding, and accumulated drinking were measured during a 50-h period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4The expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation is similar in liver and muscle of mice fed corn oil in combination with protein or sucrose. Obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) were fed ad libitum a high corn oil diet supplemented with protein or sucrose. After 5 weeks, liver and muscle (gastrocnemius/plantaris) were collected. RNA was isolated, and cDNA was synthesized from each individual animal. Expression of CPT1, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 was measured by RT-qPCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A high protein intake is known to increase satiety and thereby to reduce energy intake (24Halton T.L.

Appetite. 2005; 45: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to exclude the possibility that reduced adipose tissue mass in mice fed corn oil and protein ad libitum was simply due to reduced caloric intake, a third set of mice was pair-fed the same diets for 56 days. The mice fed corn oil in combination with sucrose gained an average of 11.3 g of body weight and became visibly obese (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 1). The mice fed corn oil in combination with protein gained on average less than 1.8 g of body weight during the 56 days of feeding and had small amounts of white adipose tissue (Table 2 and Fig. 2, B and C). In fact, the weight gain and amount of body fat in mice fed a high corn oil diet supplemented with protein was comparable with the body weight gain and adipose tissue mass in mice fed an energy-restricted low fat chow diet (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 1).TABLE 1Feed intake, weight gain, and energy efficiency in pair-fed miceChowHigh sucrose plus corn oilHigh protein plus corn oilFeed intake (g)Total142.4 ± 0.7140.9 ± 0.3137.1 ± 2.4Daily2.66 ± 0.012.63 ± 0.062.56 ± 0.04Energy intake (kcal)Total634 ± 3aDifferent letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).767 ± 16bDifferent letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).842 ± 14cDifferent letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).Daily12.0 ± 0.1aDifferent letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).14.5 ± 0.3bDiff"
https://openalex.org/W1985954581,"Ordinary gustatory experiences, which are usually evoked by taste mixtures, are determined by multiple interactions between different taste stimuli. The most studied model for these gustatory interactions is the suppression of the responses to sweeteners by the prototype bitter compound quinine. Here we report that TRPM5, a cation channel involved in sweet taste transduction, is inhibited by quinine (EC(50)=50 microM at -50 mV) owing to a decrease in the maximal whole-cell TRPM5 conductance and an acceleration of channel closure. Notably, quinine inhibits the gustatory responses of sweet-sensitive gustatory nerves in wild-type (EC(50)= approximately 1.6 mM) but not in Trpm5 knockout mice. Quinine induces a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of TRPM5-dependent responses of single sweet-sensitive fibers to sucrose, according to the restricted diffusion of the drug into the taste tissue. Quinidine, the stereoisomer of quinine, has similar effects on TRPM5 currents and on sweet-induced gustatory responses. In contrast, the chemically unrelated bitter compound denatonium benzoate has an approximately 100-fold weaker effect on TRPM5 currents and, accordingly, at 10 mM it does not alter gustatory responses to sucrose. The inhibition of TRPM5 by bitter compounds constitutes the molecular basis of a novel mechanism of taste interactions, whereby the bitter tastant inhibits directly the sweet transduction pathway."

This approach also has potential applications for profiling histone modifications and DNA methylation changes during embryonic development, in cancer biology, and in the development and assessment of cancer therapeutics. The development of microarray and bioinformatic technologies has provided new tools to address the biological mechanisms of development and disease. These tools also allow assessment of biological responses to environmental stimuli at the single gene or pathway level or across the entire genome. This capability to study chemical effects on the expression of thousands of genes either simultaneously or sequentially within regulatory pathways encompasses the discipline of toxicogenomics (1Schmidt C.W. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: A750-A755PubMed Google Scholar). Current toxicogenomic research has generated transcriptional profiles resulting from specific environmental contaminants, with the aims of characterizing their potential mechanisms of action and to develop biomarkers of chemical exposures (2Neumann N.F. Galvez F. Biotechnol. Adv. 2002; 20: 391-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such approaches have the potential to provide a wealth of mechanistic information related to gene expression as well as uncover adverse reactions to compounds at levels of toxicity that are beyond the limits of conventional assays (3Irwin R.D. Boorman G.A. Cunningham M.L. Heinloth A.N. Malarkey D.E. Paules R.S. Toxicol. Pathol. 2004; 32: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The intricate process governing transcriptional regulation of gene expression is overlaid with a complex set of molecular instructions that regulate both gene expression and chromatin organization through two coordinated sets of molecular alterations. First, the reversible addition of methyl groups at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides can directly prevent the binding of proteins to their binding motifs as well as recruit protein complexes that promote transcriptional repression (4Bernstein B.E. Meissner A. Lander E.S. Cell. 2007; 128: 669-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 5Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar). The dynamic and plastic epigenetic patterning of DNA methylation within the cell plays key roles in development. These roles include the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression, the maintenance of chromatin organization, and the maintenance of X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting (5Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar, 6Esteller M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The consequences of inappropriate methylation contribute to cancer progression. Aberrant hypermethylation of gene promoter regions can repress tumor suppressor genes, whereas the mis-timed hypomethylation of chromatin regions is implicated in genomic instability. Both types of alterations are well defined characteristics of cancer progression (6Esteller M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar, 7Rodenhiser D. Mann M. CMAJ. 2006; 174: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA methylation patterns, nucleosomal histone proteins are targets for a wide array of post-translational modifications. These modifications occur primarily along the amino-terminal histone tails and include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation events (5Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar, 6Esteller M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The complex biological effects of these changes are only partially understood, although in general, lysine acetylation usually correlates with chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity, whereas lysine methylation has both activating and repressive effects (4Bernstein B.E. Meissner A. Lander E.S. Cell. 2007; 128: 669-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 5Kouzarides T.

These results demonstrate the involvement of acetylation and other histone marks at functional regulatory elements across the human genome. Together, DNA methylation and histone modifications modulate a landscape that organizes and maintains the integrity of the nuclear architecture while establishing and enabling (or in some cases, impeding) the expression patterns of specific genes within chromatin regions. chromatin immunoprecipitation α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked benzo-(a)pyrene BCL2-associated X protein breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 3 breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 dimethyl sulfoxide growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase histone H3 histone H3 lysine 9 histone deacetylase 1 immunoprecipitation methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 methyl-CpG-binding protein 3 methyltransferase 5 domain containing 1 metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3 NGFI-A-binding protein 2 TATA element modulatory factor 1 University of California Santa Cruz. The dynamic nature of DNA methylation and histone modifications means that alterations in their placement or removal can have significant health consequences. In fact, such abnormalities are contributing factors in autoimmune diseases and aging, as well as causative factors in genetic disorders, pediatric syndromes, and cancer (7Rodenhiser D. Mann M. CMAJ. 2006; 174: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Cancer progression is a particularly well defined paradigm for epigenetic alterations, primarily in the context of CpG hypermethylation events that inactivate tumor suppressor genes (6Esteller M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar, 7Rodenhiser D. Mann M. CMAJ. 2006; 174: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 10Esteller M. Corn P.G. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3225-3229PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the histone modifications are less well documented, although DNA methylation has been correlated with deacetylation of histones 3 and 4, along with shifts in histone methylation patterns (11Fraga M.F. Ballestar E. Villar-Garea A. Boix-Chornet M. Espada J. Schotta G. Bonaldi T. Haydon C. Ropero S. Petrie K. Iyer N.G. Perez-Rosado A. Calvo E. Lopez J.A. Cano A. Calasanz M.J. Colomer D.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7213-7218PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these changes may be part of the defining signature in tumorigenesis (6Esteller M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). It is the dynamic nature of these histone modifications that renders them particularly susceptible to environmental influences. For example, dietary fluctuations, such as low folate levels, can alter methyl metabolism, shift methylation patterns, and change gene expression (13Ghoshal K. Li X. Datta J. Bai S. Pogribny I. Pogribny M. Huang Y. Young D. Jacob S.T. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 1522-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Kim Y.I. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2703-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Similarly, exposures to environmental pollutants such as vehicular exhaust, tobacco smoke, and heavy metals elicit epigenetic changes and affect genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, or chemical detoxification pathways (15Herceg Z. Mutagenesis. 2007; 22: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Mahadevan B. Keshava C. Musafia-Jeknic T. Pecaj A. Weston A. Baird W.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we describe a ChIP-on-chip approach using human promoter tiling arrays to identify genome-wide changes in histone acetylation patterns because of the environmental pollutant benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). BaP is a common polyaromatic hydrocarbon and an environmental toxicant present in vehicle emissions, environmental tobacco smoke, certain foods, and occupational exposures (17Scherer G. Frank S. Riedel K. Meger-Kossien I. Renner T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 373-380PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dipple A. Bigger C.A. Mutat. Res. 1991; 259: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). BaP activates multiple signal transduction pathways and directly affects transcription through the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (19Revel A. Raanani H. Younglai E. Xu J. Rogers I. Han R. Savouret J.F. Casper R.F. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2003; 23: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Metabolites of BaP damage DNA by forming stable DNA adducts at methylated CpG dinucleotides (20Weisenberger D.J. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23948-23955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and induce epigenetic events and cell cycle disruptions (21Sadikovic B. Rodenhiser D.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 216: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, these DNA adducts, if not recognized and repaired, may increase the risk over time of creating pre-tumorigenic cells harboring DNA damage, which then proliferate into a larger at-risk cell population that is susceptible to later mutational events. We addressed our hypothesis that BaP would cause genome-wide histone acetylation changes, and we provide the first evidence that BaP exposure induces hypoacetylation changes as well as hyperacetylation events that correlate with gene-specific expression changes in some genes. This ChIP-on-chip approach has practical applications as a method to generate histone acetylation profiles of environmental toxicants and to determine their mechanisms of action. Cell Treatments–Breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES Buffer Solution (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin in humidified tissue culture incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells (2 × 106) were plated on 15-cm tissue culture plates in 20 ml of growth media. After 24 h the cells were treated with 0.05% Me2SO (Fisher) or 0.5 μm BaP (Sigma) suspended in Me2SO to a total 30-ml volume and exposed for 4 days. ChIP-on-Chip–Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by the microarray hybridization (ChIP-on-chip) was performed with the Affymetrix Human Promoter 1.0R Arrays using a modification of the Affymetrix chromatin immunoprecipitation assay protocol. Sequences used in the design of this microarray platform were selected from the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 34), with repetitive elements removed by RepeatMasker and containing probes targeted to regions proximal to transcription start sites and representing 59% of the CpG islands annotated by University of California Santa Cruz. Chromatin was cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde while shaking the plates for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cell pellets were suspended and lysed using 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The chromatin was sonicated to reduce the size of DNA fragments to 200–1000 nucleotides, and 100 μl of chromatin (3 μg/μl) was aliquoted as input, immunoprecipitated (IP), and nonspecific (IgG) for later steps. Chromatin was pre-cleared with 45 μl of protein A-agarose solution (Upstate), followed by immunoprecipitation using 2.5 μg of chip-grade anti-acetyl-H3K9 antibody (Abcam; ab4441; IP), or 2.5 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc2027) overnight. The antibody-associated DNA fragments were recovered using 45 μl of protein A-agarose and washed using Buffer 1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl), Buffer 2 (Buffer 1 with 500 mm NaCl), Buffer 3 (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl), and 2× TE Buffer. Chromatin was eluted by vortexing and rotation at room temperature in 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3, de-cross-linked by adding NaCl (to 0.2 m), and incubated at 65 °C overnight. The DNA was purified using the QIA-quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Random priming reactions, followed by the genomic PCR, were performed as per the Affymetrix chromatin immunoprecipitation assay protocol using the following PCR conditions: 94 °C, 2 min; 94 °C, 1 min, 52 °C, 2 min, 72 °C, 3 min for 5 cycles; 94 °C, 0.5 min, 52 °C 2 min, 72 °C, 1.5 min for 25 cycles; and 72 °C, 5 min. Probes for hybridization were generated as per Affymetrix chromatin immunoprecipitation assay protocol; 7.5 μg of double-stranded DNA was fragmented with uracil DNA glycosylase and apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease for 1 h. Targets were then labeled with Affymetrix labeling reagent and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for 1 h. Mixtures were hybridized to the GeneChips for 16 h at 45 °C at 60 rpm. Gene-Chips were stained with streptavidin/phycoerythrin, followed by a biotin-conjugated anti-streptavidin and a second streptavidin/phycoerythrin solution, with all liquid handling performed by a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. GeneChips were scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the London Regional Genomic Centre (Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada). Data Analysis–Data from .cel files (GCOS 1.3 software) were imported into the Partek Genomic Suite Software. The imported data were pre-normalized using the Robust Multichip Averaging algorithm (22Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8516) Google Scholar) and converted to log2. To obtain “true” antibody-specific intensities, we subtracted the mean of the signal from the IgG arrays directly from each IP array, across all 4.2 million probes. All probes with positive signal after this subtraction represent regions of antibody-specific binding. To identify significant signals, we used the predefined ChIP-on-chip workflow tool, and set our statistical parameters at p < 0.05 (single-sided t test) with a window of 250 nucleotides. This analysis detected all significantly acetylated regions for both control and treated cells, which satisfied the statistical criteria in 2/2 replicate experiments. These regions were then annotated to their corresponding genes using the Probeset ID annotation file from the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays. To detect specifically acetylated genes in control and treated cells, we used the VENN analysis tool from Partek (Fig. 1). Hypoacetylated targets are defined as sequences that were specifically acetylated in control cells and represent genes that lost their signal levels after the BaP treatment. Hyperacetylated targets were those target sequences that were significantly increased in the treated cells relative to the controls. The genes in the cross-section area of the VENN diagram represent significantly acetylated gene promoters in both control and BaP-treated cells. We used the Partek Region View tool to generate heat maps of the acetylation signals in our genes of interest. These heat maps were then converted to .wig files using the Partek Create Gene List tool and were uploaded to the Cruz BLAT genomic browser at USCS. This approach permitted us to overlay the acetylation signal intensity maps in the context of the UCSC tracks and genomic features of interest, such as CpG islands, repetitive elements, and exon sequences. ChIP-PCR–The original DNA aliquots from the microarray experiment (input, IP, and IgG) were used to specifically amplify hypoacetylated and hyperacetylated genes of interest using specific primer sets (supplemental Table 1), as described previously (23Butcher D.T. Mancini-DiNardo D.N. Archer T.K. Rodenhiser D.I. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DNA (1 μl) was amplified for up to 30 cycles, ensuring log phase amplification. Equal volumes of PCR products were separated on 6% acrylamide gels and visualized using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager Gel Doc system. The results shown are representative of at least two replicate experiments. Real Time PCR–Control Me2SO and BaP-treated MCF-7 cells were subjected to RNA isolation using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA generation using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCRs were performed using SYBR Green PCR mixture (Bio-Rad), PTC 200 Thermocycler, and Chromo 4 continuous fluorescence detector (MJ Research). Signal was quantitated using Opticon Monitor 3.1 software (MJ Research), and reactions were performed in triplicate for each of three DNA aliquots. Signals were normalized to GAPDH expression and presented as BaP/Me2SO ratio. Network Identification and Canonical Pathway Analysis–The genes significantly acetylated in BaP-treated or control MCF-7 cells were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software version 5.0 (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). Those genes (Affymetrix ID) and their corresponding log2 acetylation values were uploaded as the input data set into the software, and analyses were performed with both BaP treatment-specific and control-specific acetylated genes (referred to as hyper- and hypoacetylated genes, respectively). As well, these genes were uploaded for a concurrent analysis, in which case the log2 levels of acetylation for the hypoacetylated genes were converted to negative values. Each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge base, and a subset of “focus” genes were mapped to their corresponding gene objects in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge data base. Networks of these focus genes were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity, assigned a score, and ranked based on relevance to the input data set. A right-tailed Fisher's test was used to calculate the p value for networks. The network identified was then presented as a graph to indicate the molecular relationships between genes/gene products. Each network or pathway was arbitrarily set to have a maximum of 35 focus genes. Genes or gene products are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported by at least one literature reference of direct physical, transcriptional and enzymatic interactions or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge base. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of hyper-(blue) or hypoacetylation (yellow). Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product, and edges are displayed with various labels indicating the nature of the relationship between the nodes as described in figure legends. Functional analysis of a network identifies the biological functions and/or diseases that were most significant to the genes in the network. Canonical pathways analysis identifies the pathways, from the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis library of canonical pathways, which were most significant to the input data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was determined based on two parameters as follows: 1) a ratio of the number of genes from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of genes that map to the canonical pathway, and 2) a p value calculated using Fisher's exact test determining the probability that the association between the genes in the data set and the canonical pathway is because of chance alone. Probe Generation and Microarray Identification of Hypoacetylated and Hyperacetylated Genes–MCF-7 cells were exposed to 0.5 μm BaP (or as a control to 0.05% Me2SO) for 96 h, as described previously (21Sadikovic B. Rodenhiser D.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 216: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and were immunoprecipitated using H3K9-acetyl-specific (IP) or nonspecific (IgG) antisera. H3K9-acetyl-specific immunoprecipitation (Abcam) was verified by gene-specific PCR amplification of the constitutively active and normally hyperacetylated GAPDH promoter (24Myers F.A. Evans D.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20197-20205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). Successful chromatin fragmentation and random-prime amplification of genomic DNA fragments confirmed that high quality DNA was produced for labeling reactions and microarray hybridization (Fig. 1b). We used the Affymetrix human promoter 1.0R microarray platform to identify gene regulatory regions that are hypo- and hyperacetylated. This single-chip technology is composed of over 4.6 million, 25-bp probes tiled at an average resolution of 35 bp. These probes cover a minimum of 7.5 kb upstream through 2.45 kb downstream of transcription start sites of over 25,500 human promoter regions. Labeled DNA generated from ChIP control and BaP samples was hybridized to the Affymetrix chip, and the IP signals for each sample were normalized by IgG signal subtraction. Statistical detection of the significantly acetylated regions (p < 0.05) in Me2SO- and BaP-treated samples and VENN analysis was performed (Fig. 1c). We detected 775 hypoacetylated and 1456 hyperacetylated gene promoters in response to BaP treatment. There were approximately twice as many hyperacetylated compared with hypoacetylated genes as a result of BaP exposure. Also, the majority of significantly acetylated genes in control cells also remained acetylated after BaP treatment (4014 genes in the VENN common region). Mapping of hypoacetylated and hyperacetylated regions using the Partek Genomic View tool showed a net increase in the number of acetylated genes in BaP-treated cells. We observed a broad distribution of these signals across the genome, as well as a range of diverse signal intensities at particular chromosomal regions (Fig. 2). Annotated gene lists of both hypoacetylated and hyperacetylated genes, including their genomic location, Affymetrix (HGU133_plus 2.0) probe set ID, and mean signal intensity, are provided in supplemental Tables 2a and 3a, respectively. Size, signal intensity, and p values at the significant regions within these gene promoters are also shown in supplemental Tables 2b and 3b, respectively. The larger number of significantly acetylated regions compared with the number of corresponding genes is because of certain genes harboring more than one significantly acetylated region within the tiled 10–12.5-kb target regions. Gene-specific Verification of Promoter Acetylation–We selected several representative hypoacetylated and hyperacetylated gene targets for further analysis to verify our microarray findings on a gene-specific basis (Table 1). These include chromatin remodeling-associated genes (HDAC1, MBD2, MBD3, METT5D1, and ATRX), genes associated with transcription (NAB2 and TMF1), cancer-associated genes (MTA3, BRMS1L, and BCAR3), and DNA damage-associated genes (CYP1B1, GADD45B, and BAX). Six genes were selected on the basis of their hypoacetylated status (MTA3, HDAC1, ATRX, MBD2, MBD3, and METT5D1), whereas the remaining genes were identified because of promoter hyperacetylation (NAB2, TMF1, BRMS1L, BCAR3, CYP1B1, GADD45B, and BAX). Five of the six chosen hypoacetylated targets are genes with roles related to chromatin remodeling or are involved in transcriptional repression (6Esteller M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar), whereas the sixth (METT5D1) encodes a novel, uncharacterized transcript that possesses a putative methyltransferase domain.TABLE 1ChromosomeStartEndGene titleGene symbolMean of regionsRegion(s)Average p valueHypoacetylated 24276020542772813Metastasis-associated 1 family, member 3MTA30.7931970.01 13225018032262679Histone deacetylase 1HDAC10.73840.02 X7579500175805076α-Thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linkedATRX0.7859710.01 185000052550013145Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2MBD21.9728560.01 112808864628098596Methyltransferase 5 domain containing 1METT5D11.869220.01 1915412021553652Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3MBD31.0028710.01Hyperacetylated 125576165655771659NGFI-A binding protein 2 (EGR1-binding protein 2)NAB23.4516400.01 36903185769042002TATA element modulatory factor 1TMF13.0047020.02 195413992854152447BCL2-associated X proteinBAX0.943551/20.01 143427565534288105Breast cancer metastasis-suppressor 1-likeBRMS1L1.7120950.02 19351999093529940Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 3BCAR31.292090.01 23827535138285327Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1CYP1B10.4437320.01 1924172562429777Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, βGADD45B1.1133490.02 Open table in a new tab We verified the acetylation status of representative hypoacetylated (HDAC1) and hyperac"

Previously, μ-calpain was found to be enriched in mitochondrial fractions isolated from rat cerebral cortex and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, but the submitochondrial localization of μ-calpain was not determined. In the present study, submitochondrial fractionation and digitonin permeabilization studies indicated that both calpain 1 and calpain small subunit 1, which together form μ-calpain, are present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The N terminus of calpain 1 contains an amphipathic α-helical domain, and is distinct from the N terminus of calpain 2. Calpain 1, but not calpain 2, was imported into mitochondria. Removal of the N-terminal 22 amino acids of calpain 1 blocked the mitochondrial calpain import, while addition of this N-terminal region to calpain 2 or green fluorescent protein enabled mitochondrial import. The N terminus of calpain 1 was not processed following mitochondrial import, but was removed by autolysis following calpain activation. Calpain small subunit 1 was not directly imported into mitochondria, but was imported in the presence of calpain 1. The presence of a mitochondrial targeting sequence in the N-terminal region of calpain 1 is consistent with the localization of μ-calpain to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and provides new insight into the possible functions of this cysteine protease.

Calpains (EC 3.4.22.17) are a family of Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases, including both ubiquitous and tissue-specific isoforms, that cleave their substrate proteins at discrete sites to modulate activity (1Friedrich P.

The best characterized, and the predominant calpains in the central nervous system, are the classical m- and μ-calpains. Their physiological roles have not been fully elucidated but include cell motility, cell differentiation, membrane fusion, platelet activation, and signal transduction (3Suzuki K. Hata S. Kawabata Y. Sorimachi H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S12-S18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also extensively investigated have been the pathological roles of calpains in cell death, where calpains can cleave key structural proteins and contribute to the release of death-related proteins such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) 3The abbreviations used are: AIFapoptosis-inducing factorAEBSF4-[2 aminoethyl]bensenesulfonyl fluorideBCAbicinchoninic acidβ-galβ-galactosidaseCSS1calpain small subunit 1CSS2calpain small subunit 2GFPgreen fluorescent proteinIMSmitochondrial intermembrane spaceIVTin vitro transcription and translationMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidmHSP70mitochondrial 70-kDa heat shock proteinVDACvoltage-dependent anion channel. 3The abbreviations used are: AIFapoptosis-inducing factorAEBSF4-[2 aminoethyl]bensenesulfonyl fluorideBCAbicinchoninic acidβ-galβ-galactosidaseCSS1calpain small subunit 1CSS2calpain small subunit 2GFPgreen fluorescent proteinIMSmitochondrial intermembrane spaceIVTin vitro transcription and translationMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidmHSP70mitochondrial 70-kDa heat shock proteinVDACvoltage-dependent anion channel.

They are each heterodimers consisting of a unique 80-kDa large catalytic subunit (calpain 1 or 2) and a common 28-kDa small regulatory subunit (calpain small subunit 1 or 2) (2Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). In vitro, the substrates of m- and μ-calpains are similar, if not identical (10Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Knock-out of the μ-calpain large subunit, calpain 1, results in viable mice with reduced platelet aggregation and impaired tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets, but not overt phenotype (11Azam M.

Knock-out of the m-calpain large subunit, calpain 2, or of calpain small subunit 1 (CSS1) is embryonically lethal (12Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell.

An association of m- and μ-calpains with subcellular organelles including endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus has been observed, but this association is hydrophobic, and the calpains are largely localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the organelle membranes (17Gopalakrishna R. Barsky S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13936-13942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hood J.L. Logan B.B. Sinai A.P. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Previously, calpain-like activity was observed in both the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space of rat liver mitochondria (20Tavares A. Duque-Magalhaes M.C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 523-529PubMed Google Scholar). We recently observed an association between μ-calpain and mitochondria (21Garcia M. Bondada V. Geddes J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but whether this represented a hydrophobic association on the external mitochondrial surface or a submitochondrial localization of μ-calpain was not determined. An atypical calpain, calpain 10, was recently localized to the mitochondrial matrix (22Arrington D. Van Vleet T. Schnellmann R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1159-C1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The results of the present study demonstrate that μ-calpain, including both the large and small subunits, is present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The results further demonstrate that the μ-calpain large subunit, calpain 1, contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence in its N terminus, and that CSS1 is imported into mitochondria by attaching to the calpain 1 large subunit. The identification of a mitochondrial targeting sequence in calpain 1 and localization of μ-calpain to the mitochondrial intermembrane space provides new insight into its possible functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsBicinchoninic acid protein assay kit and the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate were purchased from Pierce. Percoll was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Reagents for Western blotting including acrylamide, bis, nitrocellulose, and molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad. AEBSF (4-[2 aminoethyl]benzenesulfonyl fluoride, HCl) was obtained from EMD/Calbiochem. EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Cell culture media was obtained from GIBCO/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Animals were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Primary antibodies included mouse anti-AIF (E-1 clone, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO); antibodies against domain III (mouse IgG1) of calpain 1, domain III of calpain 2 (rabbit polyclonal), and against CSS1 (mouse IgG1) (EMD/Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and against CSS2 (rabbit polyclonal, Triple Point Biologics, Forest Grove, OR). Species-appropriate IRDye secondary antibodies were obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). DsRed2-mito was from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated.Mitochondrial Isolation and SubfractionationAll experimental protocols involving animals were approved by the University of Kentucky Animal Use and Care Committee. Mitochondrial isolation from SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and from rat cerebral cortex was as described previously (21Garcia M. Bondada V. Geddes J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) but without AEBSF in the isolation buffer. The mitochondrial outer membrane was disrupted by incubation in hypotonic medium (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 4 °C, 20 min) (23Ohsato T. Ishihara N. Muta T. Umeda S. Ikeda S. Mihara K. Hamasaki N. Kang D. Eur. J. Biochem./FEBS. 2002; 269: 5765-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Following incubation isotonic conditions were re-attained by adding 2× MIB. The mitoplasts were obtained following centrifugation at 1,900 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 15 min, with the supernatant containing proteins in the intermembrane space, and the pellet containing fragments of the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane.For proteinase K treatment, the mitochondrial fraction or mitoplasts (2–4 mg/ml) were suspended in the extraction buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to terminate the proteinase K activity, followed by 10 min of incubation. Mitochondria or mitoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To confirm the activity of the proteinase K, the mitochondrial or mitoplast fraction was solubilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, incubated with proteinase K, centrifuged at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (21Garcia M. Bondada V. Geddes J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Naga K.K. Sullivan P.G. Geddes J.W. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7469-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).For digitonin permeabilization, isolated mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.05–0.4 mg/ml digitonin for 30 min. at 4 °C. Low digitonin concentrations (0.05–0.2 mg/ml) cause selective permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane while higher concentrations (0.2–0.4 mg/ml) result in permeabilization of the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane and of the mitochondrial matrix. Following digitonin treatment, the samples were centrifuged at 22,800 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Construction of Plasmids and in Vitro Translation and TranscriptionHuman calpain 1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Rodney P. Guttmann (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). Rat calpain 2 and Δ86 CSS1 cDNAs were a generous gift from Dr. Peter L. Davies, Queens University. CSS1 was generated by PCR amplification from library grade cDNA (SMART cDNA Library construction kit, cat. 634901, Clontech) which was generated from P90 rat brain total RNA, with the 5′ primer harboring T7 promoter sequence apart from CSS1 5′ sequence (forward: 5′-GAA TTG TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC GGC AAA CAT GTT CTT GGT GAA TTC G-3′ and reverse: 5′-GAA GCA GCG AAT GGA GAG TTT ATT TCC TCT TGG GC-3′) purified PCR product was used for in vitro transcription and translation reaction. Human calpain small subunit 2 (CSS2) cDNA clone was purchased from OpenBiosystems MHS1011-62749, accession no. BC006000. Rat Calpain 10 DNA was PCR-amplified using mammalian expression rat calpain 10 (OpenBiosystems cat. MRN1768-98078701) plasmid as a template, with primers harboring Kpn1 and Xho1 at the 5′(5′-CGCGGGGTACCATGCGGGCGGTCCGGGC-3′) and 3′(5′-GGC GCCTCGAGTGTCGTCCC TGA CT-3′) ends and cloned into Blue script SK+ downstream to the T7 promoter.Δ22 Calpain 1 was generated by PCR amplification and cloned into Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene) with primers harboring the restriction sites EcoR1 and Sma1 at the 5′ and 3′, respectively, which resulted in downstream to T7 promoter (forward: 5′-GGC GCG GAA TTC ATG GCC AGG GAG CTG GGC CTG GGC CGC CAT GAG AAT GCC A-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCG CGG CCC GGG T CAT GCA AAC ATG GTC AGC TGC AAC CAC-3′).N-terminal 40 and 60 amino acid constructs were prepared by PCR amplification of 120 and 180 bp, respectively and cloned into a modified pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO (Invitrogen) containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence, a kind gift from Dr. George Smith, University of Kentucky, with BamH1 and Spe1 at the 5′ and 3′ regions to result in a GFP fusion protein (N40 and N60 forward: 5′-GGC GCG GGA TCC ATG TCG G AG GAG ATC AT-3′, N40 reverse: 5′-GCG GGC ACT AGT CTG GCC CAG GTA CTT GAT-3′ and N60 reverse: 5′-GCG GGC ACT AGT GGC CTC ATC ACG GAA GAG-3′). To make the GFP chimera construct, in vitro translational and transcription compatible N40-GFP and N60-GFP sequence was subcloned to Bluescript SK+ using BamH1 and Xho1 downstream to T3 promoter (N40 and N60 forward: 5′-GGC GCG GGA TCC ATG TCG G AG GAG ATC AT-3′ and N40-GFP, N60-GFP reverse primer: 5′-GCG CGG CTC GAG GGA GGG GCA AAC AAC AGA TGG CTG GCA-3′).Addition of the first 22 amino acids of rat calpain 1 (Open-Biosystems cat. MRN1768-9144823) to rat calpain 2 (Open-Biosystems cat. MRN1768-9144916) was achieved by amplifying the sequence corresponding to first 22 amino acids in the 5′ primer (5′-GCGGCGATATCATGGCAG AGGAGTTAATCACACCTGTGTACTGCACCGGGGTGTCAGCCCAAGTGCAGAAGCAACGGATGGCGGGCATCGC-3′) apart from the 5′ region of rat calpain 2 and PCR-amplified using 3′ calpain 2 primer (5′-GGCGCGAATTCTCAGAGTACTGAAAAACTCAGCCACGAGA-3′) and cloned into Blue script SK(+) at EcoRV and EcoRI. Substitution of 40 amino acids of rat calpain 2 with rat calpain 1 was achieved by introducing a restriction site Nae1 by site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) at amino acid position 2 (forward site 1: 5′-CGAATTCCTGCAGATGGC CGGCATCGCGATGAAACTG-3′ and reverse site 1: 5′-CAGTTTCATCGCGATGCCGGCCA TCTGCAGGAATTCG-3′) and 40 (forward site 2: 5′-CACTGCGGAACGAGTGCCGGCAGGCCG GGGCGCTCTT CCAGG-3′ and reverse site 2: 5′-CCTGGAAGAGCGCCCCGGCCTGCCGGCACTCGTTCCGCAGTG-3′). All constructs were sequenced prior to use. In vitro transcription and translation was performed as per the instructions of the TNT T7/T3-coupled reticulocyte lyaste system (L5010, Promega). IVT proteins were labeled by FluoroTect Green-Lys, cat. L5001 (Promega) or with 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (specific activity of 10 mCi/ml, cat. 51006 MP Biomedicals) per IVT.Mitochondrial Import AssayMitochondria were isolated from rat cortex as described above. In the presence and absence of ATP, 25 μg of mitochondria were resuspended in 25 μl of 2× import buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.22 m mannitol, 5 mm NADH, 20 mm sodium succinate, 0.25 m ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg of creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science) per ml, and 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2) and incubated with 25 μl of reticulocyte lysate-synthesized protein. ATP, creatine phosphate, and creatine kinase were added as an ATP regeneration system, except where indicated (-ATP). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 50 min. Assays were terminated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature (25Fan A.C. Bhangoo M.K. Young J.C. J. Biol.

The pellet was washed and resuspended in 25 μl of 1× sample buffer, and the supernatant fractions were resuspended in 25 μl of 3× sample buffer, for electrophoretic analysis 25% of the sample volume was run on 10% SDS-PAGE. The presence and absence of imported protein was deciphered by fluorescence detection on Typhoon 9600 (Molecular Dynamics) at 532 nm excitation at normal sensitivity.Subcellular Localization of Calpain 1 N-terminal GFP Expression ConstructsB35 rat neuroblastoma cells were grown on 35-mm cover glass-bottom cultures dishes precoated with fibronectin (Millipore). N40-GFP, N60-GFP, or GFP mammalian expression constructs were transfected with a DsRed2-mito construct (Clontech) in the ratio of 3:1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48-h post-transfection, live cell imaging was performed with a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope with an environmental chamber. Images were captured sequentially using an argon gas laser for N40-GFP and a HeNe gas laser for Mito-DsRed2.In Silico AnalysisThe protein sequences of human calpain 1 (Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL Accession Number P07384) and human calpain 2 (P17655) were compared using the SIM local similarity program based on the algorithm of Huang and Miller (28Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Applied Mathematics. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (831) Google Scholar), using the web interface, with the resultant comparison visualized using LALNVIEW (29Duret L. Gasteiger E. Perriere G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 507-510PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of the amphipathic nature of the N terminus of calpain 1 and additional proteins, the Emboss pepwheel helical wheel plot was utilized.RESULTSMitochondrial SubfractionationTo determine the submitochondrial localization of calpain 1, we examined the resistance of calpain 1 and CSS1 to proteinase K digestion in mitochondria and mitoplasts. In mitochondria isolated from SH-SY5Y cells, Calpain 1 and CSS1 were protected following incubation of the mitochondrial fraction with proteinase K (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that both the large and small subunits of μ-calpain are not located on the external face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Following disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane by incubation in hypo-osmotic medium, calpain 1 was predominantly localized to the supernatant fraction while AIF was in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1B). The small amount of calpain 1 remaining in the resultant mitoplasts was sensitive to proteinase K (Fig. 1A). CSS1 was not detected in the mitoplasts. AIF and mHSP70 were present in mitoplasts where AIF was vulnerable to, and mHSP70 was protected from, proteinase K digestion. This is in agreement with the anchoring of AIF in the inner mitochondrial membrane and projection into the IMS (30Otera H. Ohsakaya S. Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial matrix localization of mHSP70 (31Bolliger L. Deloche O. Glick B.S. Georgopoulos C. Jeno P. Kronidou N. Horst M. Morishima N. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Digitonin PermeabilizationAn additional method to examine submitochondrial localization is digitonin permeabilization, in which low concentrations of digitonin selectively permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane with higher concentrations resulting in inner membrane permeabilization (32Griparic L. van der Bliek A.M. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Incubation of mitochondria isolated from SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with digitonin concentrations as low as 0.05 mg/ml resulted in the release of calpain 1 (Fig. 2A). With higher digitonin concentrations, membrane associated proteins AIF and VDAC were released into the soluble fraction. For CSS1, there appeared to be two phases to the release. Much of the protein was released with the 0.05 mg/ml digitonin, similar to calpain 1, while additional protein was released with 0.4 mg/ml digitonin. This suggests that within the intermembrane space, CSS1 may bind to proteins or lipids additional to calpain 1. Similar results were obtained following digitonin permeabilization of mitochondria isolated from rat cerebral cortex (Fig. 2B), except that CSS1 could not be examined in the rat because of the species specificity of the primary antibody.FIGURE 2Mitochondrial permeabilization with digitonin. Mitochondrial-enriched fractions were obtained from human SH-SY5Y cells (A) or rat cortex (B), and incubated with digitonin concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.40 mg/ml. Following centrifugation, the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were probed for calpain 1, CSS1, AIF, and VDAC. CSS1 could not be detected in the rat cortical mitochondrial because of the species specificity of the primary antibody. Without added digitonin, the proteins were largely absent from the supernatant. Following mitochondrial incubation with 0.05 mg/ml digitonin, calpain 1 and CSS1 were found predominantly in the supernatant. Increasing digitonin concentrations were necessary to release AIF and VDAC from the mitochondrial (pellet) into the supernatant fraction. The very mild digitonin conditions required to release calpain 1 and CSS1 are consistent with their localization in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mitochondrial Import of Calpain 1Although calpains 1 and 2 share a high degree of homology, the amino terminus of mammalian calpain 1 contains an additional 11 amino acids that are not present in calpain 2 (Fig. 3). Based on our previous localization of calpain 1 to mitochondria, we hypothesized that this N terminus of calpain 1 represents a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Five programs that predict subcellular or mitochondrial location of protein sequences (MitoProt (33Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J.

Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar)) indicated a low probability that calpain 1 is localized to mitochondria. However, further analysis indicated that human calpain 1 contains an amphipathic helix or coiled-coil in its N-terminal domain (Fig. 3). This is a characteristic of proteins imported into mitochondria via the translocase complex in the outer mitochondrial membrane (38von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 39Herrmann J.M. Hell K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and is similar to the amphipathic N terminus of calpain-10 (Fig. 3), also previously localized to mitochondria (22Arrington D. Van Vleet T. Schnellmann R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1159-C1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast to calpains 1 and 10, the N terminus of calpain 2 (Fig. 3), CSS1, and CSS2 is non-amphipathic. The N terminus of calpain 1 is highly conserved in mammalian species (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3In silico analysis of calpain 1 and calpain 2. Comparison of the protein sequence for human calpain 1 and 2 using the algorithm of Huang and Miller (28Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Applied Mathematics. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (831) Google Scholar) reveals an overall 64% homology. However, the N terminus 11 amino acids of calpain 1 are not homologous to the N terminus of calpain 2 (A). The N-terminal methionine residues are not shown. Comparison of amino acids 2–21 of calpain 1 from various mammalian species (B) demonstrates the high degree of homology in this region. The SwissProt accession number for each protein is indicated in parentheses. Identical amino acids are shaded in black, amino acids common to at least two of the four species are shaded in gray. Plotting amino acids 2–19 of human calpain 1, calpain 2, and calpain 10 on a helical wheel plot (C) reveals the amphipathic nature of the N terminus of calpains 1 and 10, but not of calpain 2. Hydrophobic/non-polar residues are marked as squares; other residues are unmarked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Incubation of in vitro translated protein with mitochondria isolated from rat cortex demonstrated that calpain 1, but not calpain 2, is imported into mitochondria in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Calpain 1 without the first 22 amino acids (Δ22 calpain1) was not imported into mitochondria (Fig. 4), indicating that the N terminus of calpain 1 is necessary for its mitochondrial import. To determine if the N terminus is sufficient for mitochondrial import, we constructed chimera proteins with the first 40 and 60 N-terminal amino acids of calpain 1 fused to GFP. Both chimeric proteins were imported into mitochondria (Fig. 4). A potential concern is possible contamination of the mitochondrial fraction by other organelles. As in our previous study (21Garcia M. Bondada V. Geddes J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we evaluated possible contamination by Western blotting of the mitochondrial fraction for Na+/K+ ATPase to indicate possible plasma membrane contamination, calnexin as an indicator of endoplasmic reticulum, and actin as a cytosolic marker. The results demonstrated a strong enrichment of the mitochondrial protein VDAC in the final mitochondrial fraction, and lack of enrichment and minimal contamination by other organelles (results not shown). Together, these findings demonstrate that the N terminus of calpain 1 contains a mitochondrial targeting signal.FIGURE 4Mitochondrial import of calpain 1 and CSS1. The various calpain 1 constructs utilized are illustrated in panel A. Fluorograms obtained following import of in vitro translated calpain 1 and related constructs, calpain 2, CSS1, CSS2, andβ-Gal into mitochondria isolated from rat cerebral cortex are shown in panels B–I.

In this study we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Mal regulates its interactions with TLR4, MyD88, interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-2, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-6 and is important for signaling. Overexpression of wild-type Mal in human embryonic kidney 293T cells induced its constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and led to activation of p38, NF-κB, and IL-8 gene expression. Mutagenesis of Tyr-86, Tyr-106, and Tyr-159 residues within the Toll-IL-1 receptor domain impaired Mal tyrosine phosphorylation, interactions with Bruton tyrosine kinase, phosphorylation of p38, and NF-κB activation. Lipopolysaccharide triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Mal and initiated Mal-Bruton-tyrosine kinase interactions in 293/TLR4/MD-2 cells and human monocytes that were suppressed in endotoxin-tolerant cells. Compared with wild-type Mal, Y86A-, Y06A-, and Y159A-Mal variants exhibited higher interactions with TLR4 and MyD88, whereas associations with IRAK-2 and TRAF-6 were not affected. Overexpression of Y86A- and Y106A-Mal in 293/TLR4/MD-2 cells exerted dominant-negative effects on TLR4-inducible p38 phosphorylation and NF-κB reporter activation to the extent comparable with P125H-Mal-mediated suppression. In contrast, tyrosine-deficient Mal species did not affect NF-κB activation when signaling was initiated at the post-receptor level by overexpression of MyD88, IRAK-2, or TRAF-6. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of Mal is required for adapter signaling, regulates Mal interactions with TLR4 and receptor signaling, and is inhibited in endotoxin tolerance.

The bridging adapters have been postulated to act by delivering cytoplasmic signaling adapters into a close proximity to cell surface-localized TLRs, whereas endosomal localization of TLR3 and TLR7–9 is thought to allow these TLRs to directly associate with TRIF or MyD88 (31Oshiumi H.

However, IL-1 receptor, IL-18 receptor, and TLR5 are expressed on the cell surface, but they do not require bridging adapters for their interactions with MyD88 (for review, see Ref. 35Sheedy F.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 82: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is possible that specific utilization of bridging adapters by some, but not all TLRs could be due to different structures of their TIR domains, yet how exactly the adapters initiate or specify signaling is still poorly understood. In addition to adapter engagement, signalosome formation at TLRs involves recruitment and activation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4, IRAK-1, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase-1. These result in activation of downstream adapter TRAF-6 and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1, IκB kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinases, leading to induction of transcription factors NF-κB, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 (22Muzio M.

Therefore, endotoxin tolerance has been postulated to curtail excessive inflammatory responses and prevent septic shock. Although LPS tolerance was initially suggested to result from suppressed cell surface expression of TLR4/MD2 (48Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Mal and serine phosphorylation and myristoylation of TRIF were found to regulate TLR signaling (55Gray P. Dunne A. Brikos C. Jefferies C.A. Doyle S.L. O'Neill L.A. J.

For instance, Mal is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk), and mutations of Tyr-86 or Tyr-106 render Mal functionally incompetent and confer upon it the capacity to act as a dominant negative inhibitor of LPS-mediated NF-κB reporter activation (55Gray P.

However, functional significance of Mal tyrosine phosphorylation in activation of endogenous signaling intermediates was not characterized. In addition, molecular mechanisms by which Mal tyrosine deficiency alters its signaling functions still remain unknown. It is also unclear to what extent “reprogramming” of LPS responsiveness in endotoxin tolerance is linked to altered posttranslational modifications of adapter proteins.In this study we determined tyrosine residues within the TIR domain important for Mal activation of endogenous signaling intermediates and examined how tyrosine deficiency of Mal affects its interactions with Btk, TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-2, and TRAF-6. In addition, we studied whether endotoxin tolerance alters LPS-induced Mal tyrosine phosphorylation and Mal-Btk interactions. Our results indicate a critical role for Mal tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating associations with Btk and TLR4 as well as in TLR4-initiated IRAK-1 phosphorylation, IκB-α degradation, NF-κB reporter activation, and IL-8 gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Cell CultureAnti-MyD88, Mal, IκB-α, tubulin, β-actin, anti-Btk, anti-hemagglutinin (HA)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and IRAK-1 antibodies (Abs) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho (p)-p38 and anti-p-IRAK-1 Abs were from Promega (Madison, WI) and Abcam (Cambridge, MA), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2012138620,"The present work explores cell cultivation in macroporous alginate scaffolds as a means to reproduce hepatocyte terminal differentiation in vitro. Newborn rat liver cell isolates, consisting of proliferating hepatocytes and progenitors, were seeded at high cell density of 125 x 10(6)/cm(3) within the scaffold and then cultivated for 6 wk in chemically defined medium. Within 3 days, the alginate-seeded cells expressed genes for mature liver enzymes, such as tryptophan oxygenase, secreted a high level of albumin, and performed phase I drug metabolism. The cells formed compacted spheroids, establishing homotypic and heterotypic cell-to-cell interactions. By 6 wk, the spheroids developed into organoids, with an external mature hepatocyte layer covered by a laminin layer encasing inner vimentin-positive cells within a laminin-rich matrix also containing collagen. The hepatocytes presented a distinct apical surface between adjacent cells and a basolateral surface with microvilli facing extracellular matrix deposits. By contrast, viable adherent cells within collagen scaffolds presenting the identical porous structure did not express adult liver enzymes or secrete albumin after 6 wk. This study thus illustrates the benefits of cell cultivation in macroporous alginate scaffolds as an effective promoter for the maturation of newborn liver cells into functional hepatic tissue, capable of maintaining prolonged hepatocellular functions."

Evidence presented here shows that unlike an AUG initiation codon, efficiency of this non-AUG initiation codon is significantly affected by its sequence context, in particular the nucleotides at positions –3 to –1 relative to the initiation codon. A/A/R (R represents A Or G) and C/G/C appear to be the most and least favorable sequences at these positions, respectively. Mutation of the native context sequence –3 to –1 from AAA to CGC reduced translation initiation from the UUG codon up to 32-fold and resulted in loss of mitochondrial respiration. although an AUG initiation codon is, in general, unresponsive to context changes in yeast, an AAA (–3 to –1) to CGC mutation still reduced its initiating activity up to 8-fold under similar conditions. these results suggest that sequence context is more important for translation initiation in yeast than previously appreciated.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a group of primordial enzymes, each of which catalyzes the attachment of a specific amino acid to its cognate tRNAs. Typically there are 20 amino-acyl-tRNA synthetases in prokaryotes, one for each amino acid (1Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology.

In eukaryotes, protein synthesis occurs not only in the cytoplasm but also in organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts (5Dietrich A. Weil J.H. Maréchal-Drouard L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, eukaryotes such as yeast need two distinct sets of enzymes for each aminoacylation activity, one localized to the cytoplasm and the other localized to the mitochondria. Each set aminoacylates the isoaccepting tRNAs within its respective cell compartment and is sequestered from the isoacceptors confined in other compartments. In most cases, the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities are encoded by two distinct nuclear genes, regardless of the cellular compartments to which they are confined. However, two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, HTS1 (the gene encoding histidyl-tRNA synthetase) (6Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and VAS1 (the gene encoding valyl-tRNA synthetase) (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specify both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms through alternative initiation from two in-frame AUG codons. Each of these genes encodes mRNAs with distinct 5′-ends. The mitochondrial form of the enzyme is translated from the first AUG on the “long” mRNAs, whereas the cytosolic form is translated from the second AUG on the “short” mRNAs that have their 5′-ends located between the first and second AUG codons. Hence, the mitochondrial enzymes have the same polypeptide sequences as their cytosolic counterparts, except for a short amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The transit peptide is subsequently cleaved away upon import into the mitochondria. Because the isozymes are targeted to different compartments, the two isoforms of valyl-tRNA synthetase, for example, cannot functionally substitute for each other in vivo (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P.

Although two isoforms of AlaRS are generated in a similar manner in Candida albicans, the longer form per se appears dual-targeted and thus can be functional in both compartments (10Huang H.Y.

Recently, two rare cases of one gene encoding both activities have been reported in yeast in which the protein isoforms are produced by alternative use of two in-frame initiation codons: an upstream non-AUG initiator and a downstream AUG initiator (11Chang K.J.

Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a stringent process requiring not only initiator tRNA but also many protein factors, including eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, eIF4F, and eIF5. Upon binding to the cap structure, the 43 S preinitiation complex, composed of the 40 S ribosome and initiation factors, moves along the mRNA in a3′ direction until it encounters the first AUG codon. At this point, GTP hydrolysis that leads to dissociation of the eIF2-GDP complex from the initiator tRNA in the preinitiation complex and subsequent Pi release signifies a 3-bp codon/anticodon interaction between Met-tRNAMeti and the start codon (13Unbehaun A. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3078-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that eIF1 plays a critical role in start codon selection. Mutations of eIF1 may lead to reduced interaction of this initiation factor with 40 S subunits and increased initiation at UUG codons (14Cheung Y.N. Maag D. Mitchell S.F. Fekete C.A. Algire M.A. Takacs J.E. Shirokikh N. Pestova T. Lorsch J.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Previous studies on CYC1 (15Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Schweingruber A.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae suggested that AUG is the only codon recognized as the translational initiator and that the AUG codon nearest the 5′-end of an mRNA serves as the start site for translation. If the first AUG codon is mutated, then initiation can begin at the next available AUG from the 5′-end of the mRNA. The same rules apply to all eukaryotes. However, there are many examples in higher eukaryotes, where cellular and viral mRNAs can initiate from non-AUG codons that differ from AUG by just one nucleotide (16Kozak M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The relatively weak base pairing between a non-AUG codon and the anticodon of an initiator tRNA appears to be compensated for by interactions with nearby nucleotides, in particular a purine (A or G) at position –3 and a G at position +4 (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pisarev A.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pisareva V.P. Merrick W.C. Hellen C.U.T. Pestova T.V. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 624-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations in the sequence surrounding the first AUG can lead to its inefficient utilization as an initiator and subsequent use of an AUG at a downstream location. In addition to sequence context, a stable hairpin structure located 12–15 nucleotides downstream from the initiator can also facilitate recognition of a weak initiator by the 40 S ribosomal subunit (19Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Although some reports suggest that sequences immediately preceding the initiation codon may also play a role in modulating the efficiency of translation initiation in yeast, the magnitude of this context effect appears relatively insignificant (20Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Baim S.B. Sherman F. Mol.

Perhaps for that reason, yeast cannot efficiently use non-AUG codons as the translation start site (23Zitomer R.S. Walthall D.A. Rymond B.C. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Clements J.M. Laz T.M. Sherman F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4533-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, three yeast genes, GRS1 (one of the two gly-cyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) genes in S. cerevisiae) (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), ALA1 (the only AlaRS gene in S. cerevisiae) (12Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and CARP2A (the gene coding for acidic ribosomal protein P2A in C. albicans) (25Abramczyk D. Tchorzewski M. Grankowski N. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have recently been reported to use naturally occurring non-AUG triplets as translation initiators. In the case of CARP2A, a non-AUG codon, i.e. GUG, serves as the exclusive translation initiator, whereas in the cases of ALA1 and GRS1, non-AUG codons act as alternative translation initiators that are accompanied by a downstream in-frame AUG initiation codon. Although two homologous GlyRS genes, namely GRS1 and GRS2, have been identified in the yeast genome, only one, i.e. GRS1, is functional and provides both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aminoacylation activities, whereas the other, i.e. GRS2, appears to be dispensable for growth (26Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further studies by site-specific mutagenesis indicated that two functionally exclusive protein isoforms are alternatively generated from GRS1. A short form that is responsible for the cytoplasmic activity is translationally initiated from a classical AUG initiator, whereas a longer isoform that provides the mitochondrial activity is initiated from an upstream in-frame UUG codon (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expression of ALA1 follows a similar scenario. The mitochondrial form of AlaRS is initiated from two successive in-frame ACG triplets 69 nucleotides upstream of the AUG initiator of the cytoplasmic form (12Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This feature of redundancy of ACG initiators may in itself represent a novel mechanism to improve the efficiency of a poor initiation event (27Chang K.J. Lin G. Men L.C. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7775-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, in general the detailed molecular mechanism that enables the ACG (in ALA1) and UUG (in GRS1) codons to serve as translation initiation sites remains poorly understood. In particular, if other factors such as sequence context do not play a role in recognition of non-AUG initiators, the initiating ribosome should not be able to differentiate an authentic non-AUG initiation codon from other random non-AUG codons. In the work described here, we looked for the most and least favorable sequence contexts for the UUG initiator of GRS1 and compared the effects of these contexts on the efficiency of translation initiation. Contrary to many previous reports on context effect, our results argued that sequence context, in particular the nucleotides at relative position –3 to –1, is very important to the efficiency of the non-AUG initiator in GRS1. Mutation of the nucleotides at its relative position –3 to –1 from AAA to CGC reduced its initiating activity up to 32-fold. As a result, a GRS1 construct carrying this mutation was unable to maintain mitochondrial function because of drastically lowered protein levels. Although AUG was relatively insensitive to context changes under similar conditions, an AAA (–3 to –1) to CGC mutation still reduced its initiating activity up to 8-fold, suggesting that an AUG initiation codon could be subject to the same rule of modulation, albeit to a lesser extent. In this sense, a non-AUG initiator could perhaps serve as a better model in identifying the sequence and structural elements important for translation initiation in yeast. Construction of PlasmidsCloning of GRS1 from S. cerevisiae into pRS315, a low copy number yeast shuttle vector (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pADH, a high copy number yeast shuttle vector with a constitutive ADH promoter, has previously been described (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Construction of various GRS1-lexA fusions for Western blot analysis was as previously described (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Chang K.J. Lin G. Men L.C. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7775-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To clone a wild-type lexA sequence in pADH, the open reading frame of lexA was amplified by PCR as an NdeI-XhoI fragment and cloned in the appropriate sites in pADH. To clone an initiator mutant of lexA (designated here as lexA*), the NdeI site was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to a SpeI site. Therefore, in the wild-type lexA clone, the ATG initiator of lexA is part of the NdeI site, whereas in lexA*, the native ATG initiator is mutated to ACT and becomes part of the SpeI site. A wild-type or mutant GRS1 sequence containing base pairs –88 to –12 relative to ATG1 was amplified by PCR as a PstI-NdeI or PstI-SpeI fragment and cloned in-frame into the 5′-end of the wild-type lexA or its initiator mutant. These constructs were expressed under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter (29Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of GRS1-lacZ fusions followed a similar strategy. Basically, the lexA* portion in GRS1-lexA* fusions was replaced by an initiator mutant of lacZ. Thus, the only translation initiation site for the GRS1-lacZ fusions is TTG(–23) (or its derivatives) located in the GRS1 portion. For generating various mutations in the 5′-untranslated region of the GRS1 gene, a short GRS1 sequence containing bp –300 ∼+300 (relative to ATG1) was PCR-amplified from the full-length GRS1 clone as an EagI-XbaI fragment and cloned in the appropriate sites of pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This plasmid containing the 600-bp GRS1 sequence was subsequently used as template for mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was carried out following standard protocols provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After mutagenesis, the GRS1 fragment (–300 to +260 bp) carrying the desired mutation was removed from the plasmid by EagI/Bsu36I digestion and then fused in-frame to the 5′-end of a truncated version of GRS1 lacking the EagI-Bsu36I segment. Note that Bsu36I is a native cutting site between bp +260 and +266 of GRS1. RT-PCRTo estimate the relative levels of specific GRS1-lexA mRNAs generated from the fusion constructs, an RT-PCR experiment was carried out following the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The relative amounts of GRS1-lexA mRNAs were determined using a set of primers complementary to –40 to –20 nucleotides of GRS1 (5′-TTACTCTCAGATTGTTAAAAA-3′) and +370 to +390 nucleotides of lexA (5′-CAAGTCACCATCCATAATGCC-3′), respectively. For a more accurate comparison, cDNA products for each construct were obtained from three different cycle numbers of PCR amplification as indicated in the figure. As a control, the relative amounts of actin-specific mRNAs were determined using a set of primers complementary to +537 to +560 nucleotides (5′-ACCAACTGGGACGATATGGAAAAG-3′) and +696 to +719 nucleotides (5′-TTGGATGGAAACGTAGAAGGCTGG-3′) of actin, respectively. Complementation Assays for the Mitochondrial Function of GRS1The yeast GRS1 knockout strain, RJT3/II-1, has been described previously (26Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test the mitochondrial function of the GRS1 constructs, RJT3/II-1 was first transformed with a test plasmid (carrying a LEU2 marker) and plated on a selection medium lacking uracil and leucine. Following 5-fluoroorotic acid selections, a single colony of the transformants was picked and grown to stationary phase in a synthetic medium lacking leucine. Starting from 1.0 A600, the cultures were 10-fold serially diluted, and 5-μl aliquots of each dilution were spotted on the designated YPG plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. (Photos for the complementation assays were taken at day 3 following incubation.) Because a yeast cell cannot survive on glycerol without functional mitochondria, the transformants do not grow on YPG plates unless a functional mitochondrial GlyRS is present. Western BlotThe protein expression patterns of the GRS1-lexA fusions were determined by a chemiluminescence-based Western blot analysis. The lexA fusion constructs were first transformed into INVSc1 (Invitrogen), and the transformants were subsequently grown in a selection medium lacking leucine. Total protein extracts were prepared from each of the transformants with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the protein extracts (10–40 μg) were loaded onto a mini gel containing 10% polyacrylamide (size: 8 cm × 10 cm) or a medium gel containing 18% polyacrylamide (size: 16 cm × 20 cm) and electrophoresed at 100 volts for 2–4 h. Following electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were transferred using a semi-dry transfer device to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a buffer containing 30 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris base, pH 8.3, 0.037% SDS, and 20% methanol. The membrane was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) and then exposed to an x-ray film following addition of the appropriate substrates. The Western blot data were obtained from at least three independent experiments (only one blot was shown in each figure), and the relative intensity of the protein bands shown was presented as a percentage using the mean value of the intensity of the protein band translated from the native initiator or an initiator with the native context as a reference. β-Gal AssayYeast cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s and resuspended in 100 μl of breaking buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 100-μl beads. The cells were then lysed at 4 °C using a bead beater, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min. Aliquots of the supernatants (5–200 μg) were diluted to 0.8 ml with Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). β-Gal activity assays were initiated (at 37 °C) by adding 0.2 ml of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside (4 mg/ml). The reaction mixtures were then incubated with constant shaking at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and the A420 of the supernatants was determined. Relative β-gal activities were calculated from A420 readings normalized to protein concentrations. Production of GlyRS Isoforms through Leaky ScanningOur previous study showed that two distinct protein isoforms are generated from the yeast GRS1 gene via alternative initiation of translation. The longer form that accounts for the mitochondrial activity is initiated from UUG(–23) (the number “–23” in UUG(–23) refers to the 23rd codon triplet that precedes AUG1), whereas the short form that is responsible for the cytoplasmic activity is initiated from AUG1 (Fig. 1) (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The leader peptide that is encoded by the nucleotide sequence between the two initiators acts as a targeting signal for the mitochondrial precursor form of GlyRS. Because only one mRNA species having its 5′-end located at position –88 relative to AUG1 was transcribed from GRS1 (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and UUG(–23) is a poor initiation codon, translation of the GRS1 mRNA was expected to follow the mechanism of “leaky scanning” proposed by Kozak (30Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). To provide direct evidence that scanning ribosomes can skip the relatively poor UUG initiation site and initiate at a downstream AUG, we employed Western blot analysis. Because the processed form of mitochondrial GlyRS is almost indistinguishable in size from its cytoplasmic counterpart, it is unfeasible to directly assay the relative amounts of the isoforms using Western blots. To circumvent this problem, we chose to use lexA as a reporter to measure the relative initiation activities of the alternative initiators of GRS1 (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Huang H.Y. Tang H.L. Chao H.Y. Yeh L.S. Wang C.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, to avoid mitochondrial import and cleavage of the signal peptide, only part of the leader sequence of GRS1 (bp –88 to –12) was used in construction of the GRS1-lexA fusions. Signal peptide deduced from the truncated leader sequence (containing amino acid residue Met*(–23) to Val(–5)) lacks the predicted matrix processing peptidase cleavage site (Fig. 1) and was shown to be unable to target GlyRS into mitochondria (data not shown). As schematized in Fig. 2, a wild-type or mutant GRS1 fragment containing bp –88 to –12 was PCR-amplified and fused inframe to the 5′-end of lexA, yielding various GRS1-lexA fusions. These fusions were cloned in the yeast shuttle vector pADH and expressed under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter. As expected, two distinct protein bands were generated from the parental GRS1-lexA fusion (Fig. 2, number 1). Inactivation of the TTG or ATG initiator on the fusions specifically impaired the production of the upper and lower bands, respectively (compare numbers 2 and 4), suggesting that the upper and lower bands were initiated from the TTG and ATG codons, respectively. Consistently, inactivation of both initiators impaired the production of both bands (see number 5). Interestingly but not surprisingly, mutation of TTG(–23) to ATG strongly increased the levels of the upper band and completely abolished the production of the lower band (see number 3). Further mutation of the downstream ATG initiation codon to ACT in this construct did not alter the pattern of protein expression (see number 6). These results suggest that TTG(–23) can be readily bypassed by scanning ribosomes, and two protein isoforms can be generated from the GRS1 mRNA through leaky scanning. Scanning for Sequence Elements Important for Non-AUG InitiationThe question arose as to why UUG(–23), and not other non-AUG codons that also differ from AUG by a nucleotide in the leader sequence, can be recognized by the preinitiating complex as an alternative translation initiator in GRS1. One possibility is that this non-AUG initiation site contains an unusual sequence context that can effectively compensate for the poor interaction between the initiator codon and initiator tRNA. To test this hypothesis, a trinucleotide scanning strategy was carried out to map the approximate sequence elements important for non-AUG initiation. The mutations were first aimed at the nucleotide sequences flanking the initiating site. In practice, the 5′-flanking sequences that are rich in A were mutated to T in a fashion of one codon at a time, whereas the 3′-flanking sequences that are rich in T and C were mutated to A in a similar fashion (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows that mutations of the nucleotides at positions –3 to –1 relative to the TTG initiator to TTT had the strongest effect among all the mutations tested and reduced the initiating activity up to 10-fold (Fig. 3B, number 4), whereas mutations at other positions, including positions –9 to –7 (to TTT), –6 to –4 (to TTT), +4 to +6 (to AAA), +7 to +9 (to AAA), and +10 to +12 (to AAA), altered the initiating activity less than 2-fold (Fig. 3B, numbers 2, 3, and 5–7). These results suggest that the nucleotides at position –3 to –1 relative to the TTG initiator are the most important sequence elements for translation among the flanking sequences tested. Identifying the Best and Worst Sequence ContextsThe trinucleotide scanning strategy provided a rough picture about which triplet might be important for non-AUG initiation. However, it was still not clear which nucleotide of the triplet affects the initiating activity the most and to what extent. Pursuant to this objective, the nucleotides at position –3 to –1 (relative to TTG(–23)) were each mutated from A to T, G, and C, and the resultant mutants were analyzed for their initiating activities by Western blots. As shown in Fig. 4, mutation of A(–3) to T, C, and G reduced the initiating activity 6-, 12-, and 4-fold, respectively. Mutation of A(–2) to T, C, and G reduced the initiating activity 3-, 2-, and 4-fold, respectively. Although mutation of A(–1) to T and C reduced the initiation activity 3-and 6-fold, respectively, mutation of A(–1) to G slightly increased the initiating activity, around 1.2-fold. Thus, nucleotides at all these positions play an important role in modulating the efficiency of initiation from the non-AUG codon, and the nucleotide at position –3 appears to be the most influential one among the three. In addition, A/A/R (R represents A or G) and C/G/C appear to be the most and least favorable nucleotides at these positions, respectively. Previous studies in higher eukaryotes showed that recognition of an AUG initiator is significantly modulated by the nucleotides at its relative positions –3 and +4 (16Kozak M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In contrast, our current study showed that mutations of the nucleotides at positions +4 to +6 had barely detectable effect in yeast (Fig. 3). To rule out the possibility that triple A mutations cannot faithfully reflect the effect of individual nucleotides on initiation, nucleotides at these positions were individually mutated and tested. As shown in Fig. 4A, except for mutation of T(+4) to A, which increased the initiating activity ∼2-fold, mutations at +4, +5, and +6 had little effect on initiation. It should be noted that changing C(+5) to A would create an in-frame stop codon, TAG, and in turn block protein translation. To avoid this unfortunate situation, the nucleotide at posit"

Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 6Minor W. Steczko J. Stec B. Otwinowski Z. Bolin J.T. Walter R. Axelrod B.

Lipoxygenases have a two-domain structure, an N-terminal C2-like or β-barrel domain, and the larger, mainly α-helical, catalytic domain that holds the iron in the active site. In the catalytic domain the LOX enzymes share five well conserved amino acid ligands to the iron, four histidines (or three His and one Asn or Ser) and the carboxylate group of the very C-terminal amino acid, usually Ile. Analysis of the structure-function of LOX enzymes suggests that the β-barrel domain plays a role in membrane binding and/or substrate acquisition (9Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Chen X.S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas the catalytic domain is involved in controlling the reaction of polyunsaturated fatty acid with molecular oxygen (2Schneider C. Pratt D.A. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 473-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). lipoxygenase (di)hydro(per-o)xyeicosatetraenoic acid hydro(pero)xyoctadecadienoic acid dihydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid phosphatidylcholine reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography straightphase high pressure liquid chromatography correlation spectroscopy gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine. Individual lipoxygenases tend to exhibit a distinct reaction specificity and produce a single chiral fatty acid hydroperoxide as product. For example, the two common classes of plant LOX form either the 9S-hydroperoxides of linoleic (18:2ω6) and linolenic (18:3ω3) acids, or the 13S-hydroperoxides (11Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Similar LOX activities were described recently in two species of cyanobacteria (12Koeduka T. Kajiwara T. Matsui K. Curr. Microbiol. 2007; 54: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Lang I. Feussner I. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There are also specific LOX enzymes identified that produce 10 of the 12 possible regio- and stereoisomers of hydroperoxide from arachidonic acid (20:4ω6) (3Funk C.D. Chen X.S. Johnson E.N. Zhao L. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Schneider C. Brash A.R. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Over the years, considerable efforts have been made toward understanding the structural basis underlying the reaction specificity of individual LOX enzymes. This has led to models explaining reaction specificity partly by the mode of substrate binding and partly by the influence of individual active site amino acids that control the direction of oxygen attack on the substrate (e.g. Refs. 15Knapp M.J. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11466-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Kuhn H. Saam J. Eibach S. Holzhutter H.G. Ivanov I. Walther M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Within the context of further understanding the structure-function of LOX enzymes in general, we have taken an interest in LOX enzymes that display unusual structural or reaction characteristics. The original cloning of lipoxygenases that synthesize hydroperoxide products with R chirality provided some important comparisons and contrasts with the well known S-specific LOX in plants and animals (18Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Boeglin W.E. Kim R.B. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6744-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The more recent appearance of a novel gene sequence that apparently encodes a conspicuously small lipoxygenase of only ∼49 kDa offered the potential for new insights into essential elements of structure-function within this class of enzymes. The mini-LOX sequence occurs in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120. The Anabaena genus of cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that grow in long strings or filaments and that can develop a nitrogen fixing ability in specialized heterocysts. They are studied as a model for prokaryotic developmental biology (20Golden J.W. Yoon H.S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The LOX gene in question is equally unusual in encoding a fusion protein in which the N-terminal domain has sequence similarity to catalase, and the LOX domain comprises the C terminus. The nearest match of this fusion protein in the data bases is a peroxidase-lipoxygenase fusion protein in coral (indeed this is the only other known fusion protein involving a lipoxygenase) (8Oldham M.L. Brash A.R. Newcomer M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 39: 39545-39552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Koljak R. Boutaud O. Shieh B.-H. Samel N. Brash A.R.

A. 2005; 102: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The LOX domain of the coral fusion protein converts arachidonic acid to the 8R-hydroperoxide and the catalase-related domain converts this hydroperoxide to an unstable epoxide known as an allene oxide. In initial studies of the Anabaena fusion protein, we characterized an allylic epoxide synthase as the catalytic activity of the catalase-related domain, with linolenic acid being converted to an allylic epoxide with a bicyclobutane in the carbon chain together with a leukotriene A-type epoxide (23Schneider C. Niisuke K. Boeglin W.E. Voehler M. Stec D.F. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 18941-18945Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Herein we report on the properties and control of fatty acid oxygenation in the Anabaena LOX domain. Materials–Fatty acids were purchased from NuChek Prep Inc. (Elysian, MN). [1-14C]Linoleic, [1-14C]linolenic, and [1-14C]arachidonic acids were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1-Palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (C16/LA-PC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (C16/AA-PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 9E,11Z,14Z-Eicosatrienoic acid and its methyl ester derivative were synthesized by Dr. Jin K. Cha, Wayne State University, using standard methods (supplemental Fig. 1). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Anabaena LOX–A sample of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 DNA was a kind gift from Dr. James W. Golden of TexasA&M University (College Station, TX). The gene for the putative LOX fusion protein resides on the Gamma plasmid and is designated with the locus tag all8020 “similar to 8R-lipoxygenase-allene oxide synthase fusion protein” in GenBank™ and at CyanoBase (bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/). In addition to the full-length cDNA encoding amino acids 1-773, we also prepared cDNA constructs encoding a 430-amino acid lipoxygenase domain (amino acids 344-773 of the full-length fusion protein). The cDNA for the full-length LOX fusion protein was cloned by PCR using the primers 5′-CATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGATTTGAATACTTACTTGAAGTTG-3′ incorporating a His6 tag (or the identical sequence minus the His6 codons) and 5′-AAGCTTCTAAATGTTGATACTCATCATGAG-3′. The LOX domain was cloned from this full-length cDNA sequence using a new upstream primer 5′-CATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACAAGGATGATTTGCCTGGAAAACCAGTT-3′ and the original downstream primer. Sequencing confirmed the identity to the published sequence. PCR products were each cloned into pET17b for heterologous expression in E. coli. Expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) was accomplished with methods described previously using 100-ml bacterial cultures in 500-ml flasks (24Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments using crude bacterial extracts we established that the addition of the His6 tag had no detrimental effect of catalytic activity, and all experiments herein used the His6-tagged proteins, purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the affinity column and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Fractions containing the highest concentrations of protein were pooled and dialyzed against a buffer of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl to remove imidazole. Measurement of Iron or Manganese Content in Anabaena LOX–The iron content of the purified Anabaena LOX was determined according to the colorimetric assay reported by Percival (25Percival M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10058-10061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate sample, the content of iron and manganese was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry using a PerkinElmer ELAN DRC II instrument. A sample of Anabaena LOX (14.5 mg of protein/ml) was dialyzed twice into 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8). This sample was diluted 100-fold with 1% nitric acid for analysis of Mn55 and Fe57.A blank buffer sample and the diluent were similarly analyzed. The instrument was calibrated using a series of standards of known iron or manganese content in 1% nitric acid (10-500 μg/liter); repeat measurements were reproducible within 3%. The instrumental settings were 1 liter/min nebulizer flow, RF power 1350 W, plasma gas flow 15 liters of argon/min, lens voltage 6.5 V, and In115 served as internal standard. Site-directed Mutagenesis–Mutagenesis was performed on the His6-tagged Anabaena LOX in the pET17b vector by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with overlapping mismatching oligonucleotide primers designed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue super-competent cells (Stratagene), and correctly mutated clones were subsequently identified by sequencing. Enzyme Activity Assays–Small scale incubations with purified enzymes were typically conducted in a 0.5-ml UV cuvette and analyzed by UV spectrophotometry in an incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Enzyme activity was monitored by repetitive scanning in the range 350-200 nm, or by monitoring in the time drive mode the appearance of the signal at 235 nm for incubations with linoleic acid (18:2ω6), α-linolenic acid (18:3ω3), γ-linolenic acid (18:3ω6), arachidonic acid (20:4ω6), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5ω3), and C16/LA-PC, and at 270 nm for reactions with 9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid. 40 nm Purified enzyme was used in assays with linoleic, linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and 9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acids and 0.8 μm purified enzyme with C16/LA-PC. Sodium deoxycholate (final concentration, 4 mm) was included in the reaction buffer to solubilize the PC substrates. Experiments with Stereospecifically Labeled [11-3H]Linoleic Acids–In previous studies we prepared 3H-labeled linoleic acids with a pro-R or pro-S tritium label on the bis-allylic 11-carbon, each mixed with [1-14C]linoleic acid, which served as internal standard for assessment of tritium loss or retention in the transformation to lipoxygenase products (26Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Lai S. Cha J.K. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For use in the present study, aliquots were re-purified by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm), a solvent of MeOH/H2O/glacial acetic acid, 95:5:0.01, by volume, and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, giving a retention time for linoleic acid of ∼19 min. An aliquot of each purified sample corresponding to ∼3000 cpm 3H was kept for accurate determination of the 3H/14C ratio by liquid scintillation counting. The specific activities were 858 cpm of 3H/μg for the [11R-3H,1-14C]linoleic acid and 365 cpm/μg for the [11S-3H,1-14C]linoleic acid. Reactions of labeled linoleic acids with Anabaena LOX (∼10 μg/ml [11R-3H,1-14C]linoleic acid; 19 or 29 μg/ml [11S-3H,1-14C]linoleic acid) were monitored by UV spectrophotometry; aliquots (1 ml) were removed at three time points and added to 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. The reaction products were reduced by adding 50 μl of 10 mg/ml NaBH4 in ethanol, and subsequently acidified to pH 5 and extracted using a Waters Oasis C18 cartridge. The products and unreacted substrate were isolated by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm), a solvent of MeOH/H2O/glacial acetic acid, 90:10:0.01, by volume, and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The products were further purified by SP-HPLC using a Beckman silica Ultrasphere column (25 × 0.46 cm), a solvent of hexane/isopropyl alcohol/glacial acetic acid, 100:2:0.1, by volume, and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The peak of 9-HODE was collected in a counting vial, evaporated to dryness with a stream of nitrogen, and the 3H/14C ratio determined by liquid scintillation counting; for most samples, >20,000 counts were accumulated in the 14C channel in 10 min (6,000 counts at the least). Extraction and HPLC Analysis–For extraction of lipoxygenase products, enzyme reactions were slightly acidified by addition of sufficient 1 n hydrochloric acid to adjust the solution to pH ∼4 and extracted with 2 volumes of methylene chloride. The aqueous phase was removed and the organic phase was washed three times with water. The methylene chloride extract was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in a small volume of methanol or ethanol, and stored at -20 °C until further analysis. The Bligh and Dyer method (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) was used for extractions of products from C16/LA-PC. Products from [1-14C]linoleic acid were analyzed initially by SP-HPLC using a Beckman silica column (0.46 × 25 cm), a solvent system of hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid (100:2: 0.1 by volume), and a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and further by chiral phase HPLC using a Daicel Chiralpak AD column (0.46 × 25 cm), hexane/methanol (100:5 by volume), and 1 ml/min, on an Agilent (Palo Alto, CA) 1100 HPLC equipped with a diode array detector connected on-line to a Flo-One A-100 radioactive detector (Radiomatic Instruments and Chemical, Meridian, CT). Products from 9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid were analyzed by SP-HPLC using a Beckman silica column (0.46 × 25 cm), hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid (100:1.5:0.1 by volume) and 1 ml/min; the naphthoyl derivative of the methyl ester of the main product was analyzed by chiral phase HPLC using a Daicel Chiralpak AD (0.46 × 25 cm), hexane/methanol/ethanol (95:5:5 by volume), and 1 ml/min. Metabolites from incubations with C16/LA-PC were transesterified using sodium methoxide (28Brash A.R. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5465-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the methyl esters were analyzed by SP-HPLC using a Beckman silica column (0.46 × 25 cm), hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid (100:2:0.1 by volume), and 1 ml/min, and by chiral phase HPLC using a Daicel Chiralpak AD column (0.46 × 25 cm), hexane/methanol (100:5 by volume), and 1 ml/min. Derivatization and GC-MS Analysis–Methyl esters of the triphenylphosphine- or NaBH4-reduced products were prepared using ethereal diazomethane/methanol (5:1); pentafluorobenzyl esters were prepared using the method of Greeley (29Greeley R.H. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 88: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Catalytic hydrogenations were performed in 100 μl of ethanol using about 1 mg of palladium on alumina and bubbling with hydrogen for 2 min at room temperature. The hydrogenated products were recovered by the addition of water and extraction with ethyl acetate. Trimethylsilyl ester and trimethylsilyl ether derivatives were prepared by treatment with bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoracetamide (10 μl) and pyridine (5 μl) at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, the reagents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and the samples dissolved in hexane for GC-MS. Analysis of the methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether derivatives of the products was carried out in the positive ion electron impact mode (70 eV) using a Hewlett-Packard 5989A mass spectrometer coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a RTX-1701 fused silica capillary column (17 m × 0.25 mm, internal diameter). Samples were injected at 150 °C, and after 1 min the temperature was programmed to 300 °C at 12 or 20 °C/min. Spectra collected during elution of the GC peak (typically about 20 spectra) were averaged for calculation of the isotopic compositions. NMR–1H NMR and 1H,1H COSY NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DXR 600MHz spectrometer at 298 K. The parts/milllion values are reported relative to residual non-deuterated solvent (δ = 7.16 ppm for C6H6). Preparation of Racemic Hydroperoxides from Methyl-9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoate–A mixture of methyl-9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoate (∼100 μg) and α-tocopherol (∼50 μg) was taken to dryness in a 5-ml Reacti-Vial, flushed with oxygen, and allowed to autoxidize at room temperature. The sample was examined hourly by redissolving the sample in 1 ml of methanol, diluting a 50-μl aliquot to 0.5 ml with methanol, and recording the spectrum between 200 and 350 nm using a PerkinElmer Lambda-35 scanning spectrophotometer. Reaction was continued until ∼10-15% conversion was observed (∼14 h). (As a technical comment, the rate of autoxidation was unpredictable, and if reaction was allowed to proceed beyond ∼20% conversion, the autoxidation could quickly consume all substrate and leave a complex mixture of by-products; therefore, under the conditions we used, it was important to stop the reaction early to recover only the primary hydroperoxide products.) After reduction with triphenylphosphine, subsequent HPLC analysis was carried out as described above for the enzymatic reaction with 9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid and the peak corresponding to the main enzymatic product was collected and used as a racemic standard. Exciton-coupled Circular Dichroism–This method requires the presence of two suitable chromophores at the asymmetric carbon (30Schneider C. Schreier P. Humpf H.-U. Chirality. 1997; 9: 563-567Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in this case one being provided by the conjugated triene comprised by C-10 to C-15, and the other introduced at C-9 by derivatization to the naphthoate ester. The through space coupling of the two chromophores gives rise to Cotton effects. Enantiomers give opposite Cotton effects and thus CD spectra with opposite signs and shapes. Collected products from the chiral phase HPLC separations were evaporated from solvent under a stream of nitrogen, and dissolved in 25 μl of anhydrous acetonitrile, 1 μl of 1,8-diazabicyclo(5,4,0)undec-7-ene and a few grains of 1-(2-naphthoyl)-chloride were added. The reaction was kept at room temperature overnight, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 1.5 ml of methylene chloride, washed three times with acidified water (1 ml of water plus 100 μl of 1 n hydrochloric acid), once with plain water, and evaporated; finally, the naphthoate derivatives were purified by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with methanol/acetic acid (100:0.01 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and further by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with acetonitrile/water (95:5 by volume) at 1 ml/min. For CD spectroscopy, the collected products were evaporated from column solvent and each (∼0.25 absorbance units at 270 nm) dissolved in 400 μl of acetonitrile. CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-700 spectropolarimeter. Comparative Modeling of the Anabaena LOX Structure–Coral 8R-LOX is the closest homolog to the Anabaena LOX identified by BLAST search. Both consist of a single-chain polypeptide with a catalase-related protein at the N terminus and a LOX at the C terminus; thus, the structure of coral 8R-LOX (PDB code 2FNQ) was chosen as the template for comparative modeling. The sequences of the template, coral 8R-lipoxygenase, and the target, the Anabaena LOX, were aligned using Megalign™ with some subsequent manual adjustments. The modeling process was automated using the Swiss-Model server (expasy.ch/swissmod). PyMOL (open source, 0.99rc6) was used to visualize and align the structures. Characteristics of the LOX Domain–The size of the LOX domain of the Anabaena fusion protein is ∼430 amino acids in length or smaller, corresponding to a molecular mass of ≤49 kDa. This is at least 26 kDa smaller than the smallest conventional LOX enzyme, and less than half the size of the larger plant LOX proteins. The changeover point between the N-terminal catalase-related domain and the LOX domain is not obvious, leading to the ambiguity in the actual size. Not only is the Anabaena LOX small in size, the initial ∼70 amino acids display no meaningful homology in sequence with other lipoxygenases, including the mini-lipoxygenase generated from soybean lipoxygenase by proteolytic cleavage (31Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F. Finazzi-Agro A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Beyond this point, the rest of the sequence is very lipoxygenase-like, and it includes the usual conserved iron ligands (three His residues, one Asn, and an Ile, the C-terminal amino acid in the protein). Even so, there are numerous gaps in the alignment, because even this well conserved part of the protein is relatively small in size. Expression and Purification of the Anabaena LOX–We prepared constructs for heterologous expression in E. coli of the full-length Anabaena fusion protein, and the LOX domain of 430 amino acids. The LOX domain by itself expressed very strongly, giving highly active protein at the level up to 85 mg/liter of bacterial culture (Fig. 2A). Measurement of the iron content after nickel affinity column purification using a colorimetric iron-specific assay (25Percival M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10058-10061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) gave an iron:protein molar ratio of 0.54. A separate sample was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for quantitation of iron and manganese content. The results indicated an iron:protein molar ratio of 56%, and a manganese:protein ratio of 3.1%; by comparison the corresponding values in the blank buffer were >100-fold lower. We conclude that the Anabaena LOX enzyme is essentially a Fe-LOX, which under the expression and purification condition is recovered with only >50% iron content and possibly with a minor fraction containing manganese. Expression of the full-length fusion protein required many adjustments in expression conditions, until the better preparations eluted from the nickel affinity column with the color of weak (brown) tea, and the main Soret band in the UV-visible spectrum was evident at 406 nm with an absorbance reading of ∼0.5; the 88-kDa protein represented a main band on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2B), but based on the 280:406 nm ratio, the heme content was in the order of only 10%. The results reported here on catalytic activities used the highly expressing LOX domain, although the catalytic specificity for oxygenation of C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids was confirmed using the full-length fusion protein. Activity of the Anabaena LOX Enzyme–The endogenous fatty acid composition of different cyanobacteria including strains of Anabaena reveals high percentages of linoleic (5-15%) and α-linolenic (15-40%) acids (whereas C20 fa"
https://openalex.org/W1967998674,"Mcm10 plays a key role in initiation and elongation of eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication. As a first step to better understand the structure and function of vertebrate Mcm10, we have determined the structural architecture of Xenopus laevis Mcm10 (xMcm10) and characterized each domain biochemically. Limited proteolytic digestion of the full-length protein revealed N-terminal-, internal (ID)-, and C-terminal (CTD)-structured domains. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that xMcm10 self-associates and that the N-terminal domain forms homodimeric assemblies. DNA binding activity of xMcm10 was mapped to the ID and CTD, each of which binds to single- and double-stranded DNA with low micromolar affinity. The structural integrity of xMcm10-ID and CTD is dependent on the presence of bound zinc, which was experimentally verified by atomic absorption spectroscopy and proteolysis protection assays. The ID and CTD also bind independently to the N-terminal 323 residues of the p180 subunit of DNA polymerase α-primase. We propose that the modularity of the protein architecture, with discrete domains for dimerization and for binding to DNA and DNA polymerase α-primase, provides an effective means for coordinating the biochemical activities of Mcm10 within the replisome.

Eukaryotic DNA replication is carried out by large multiprotein machines that coordinate DNA unwinding and synthesis at the replication fork. Initiation of replication involves ordered assembly of the replisome and local denaturation of duplex DNA at the origin followed by replisome activation.

A number of interactions have been observed between Mcm10 and proteins found in the pre-replicative complexes and at the replication fork. Mcm10 is a component of active replication complexes in Xenopus and budding yeast (12Pacek M. Tutter A.V. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Walter J.C. Mol.

Mcm10 interacts genetically with Mcm2-7, DNA pol δ and ϵ, origin recognition complex, and Dpb11 (2Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In vitro, interactions of Mcm10 with initiation factor origin recognition complex, Mcm2-7, Cdc45, and Cdc7/Dbf4 have been observed by co-immunoprecipitation from cell extracts (8Lee J.K. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Importantly, Cdc45 and replication protein A cannot load onto chromatin in Mcm10-depleted Xenopus egg extracts, preventing DNA unwinding (6Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, the essential role of Mcm10 in initiation links the pre-replicative complexes with origin unwinding. Several lines of evidence suggest that Mcm10 migrates with the elongating replication fork through association with DNA polymerases and DNA. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mcm10 (spMcm10) affects chromatin binding and subnuclear distribution of pol α (19Yang X. Gregan J. Lindner K. Young H. Kearsey S.E. BMC Mol. Biol. 2005; 6: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Gregan J. Lindner K. Brimage L. Franklin R. Namdar M. Hart E.A. Aves S.J. Kearsey S.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm10 (scMcm10) has been shown to interact with and stabilize the catalytic subunit of pol α in vivo (7Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18414-18425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In vitro, spMcm10 interacts with and stimulates the activity of the catalytic (polymerase) subunit of pol α (28Fien K. Cho Y.S. Lee J.K. Raychaudhuri S. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16144-16153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and has been shown to contain primase activity (29Fien K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22248-22260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, an interaction between diubiquitinated scMcm10 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen is essential for replication in budding yeast (30Das-Bradoo S. Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4806-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, spMcm10 binds to single (ss)- and double-stranded (ds) DNA in vitro, and DNA binding activity is localized in the N-terminal 300 residues of the protein (28Fien K. Cho Y.S. Lee J.K. Raychaudhuri S. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16144-16153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The interactions between Mcm10, DNA, and pol α have led to the suggestion that Mcm10 helps to recruit pol α to the replisome and may regulate its activity. Studies in Xenopus extracts have demonstrated that when an elongating fork stalls, Mcm10 and DNA polymerases α, δ, and ϵ are uncoupled from the Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS helicase (12Pacek M. Tutter A.V. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 581-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of Mcm10 from divergent eukaryotes show stretches of consecutive residues that are phylogenetically conserved (Fig. 1A), suggesting that these regions may be important to the structure and function of the protein. Mcm10 from Metazoa contains ∼100-300 residues not present in the yeast proteins, and conservation from yeast to human is limited to ∼200-amino acids in the middle of the protein. Consistent with Mcm10 DNA binding activity, the conserved central region contains an invariant CCCH zinc binding motif (22Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar, 23Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 18414-18425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The lack of sequence similarity outside of the central region raises a question of whether the function of Mcm10 is conserved from yeast to Metazoa. In the present study we report the first structure-function analysis of vertebrate Mcm10 using the Xenopus laevis protein (xMcm10). Limited proteolytic digestion of xMcm10 revealed the protein to be composed of at least three structural domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) that forms homodimers in solution and highly conserved internal (ID) and C-terminal domains (CTD) that bind to ssDNA, dsDNA, and to the p180 subunit of pol α. Our results confirm and extend previous work from yeast and suggest that vertebrate Mcm10 contains a CTD not present in the yeast orthologs. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of xMcm10The cDNAs encoding full-length xMcm10 (FL, 1-860) and deletion fragments 1-145, 1-230, 230-427, 427-860, and 596-860 were PCR-amplified from a previously described plasmid encoding a GST-xMcm10 fusion (6Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The FL-xMcm10 PCR product was ligated into a modified pMAL-c2x vector (New England Biolabs) to generate an maltose-binding protein (MBP)-xMcm10-His6 fusion protein, and xMcm10 fragments were ligated into a modified pET-32a plasmid (Novagen) to generate N-terminal thioredoxin (Trx)-His6 fusion proteins. Protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 5 μm ZnSO4, and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Proteins were overexpressed at 22 °C for 4 h (FL) or at 16 °C for 16 h (fragments). The cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and lysed under pressure (25,000 p.s.i.) using an EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (Avestin, Inc.). FL-xMcm10 was purified by tandem nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and amylose affinity chromatography, cleavage of the MBP tag, and SP-Sepharose cation exchange. Protein was concentrated and stored in FL buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). xMcm10 fragments were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by cleavage of the Trx-His6 tag. The cleaved proteins were further purified by cation exchange (fragments 230-427, 427-860, 596-860) or anion exchange (1-145 and 1-230) chromatography followed by gel filtration on a Superdex™ 200 preparative column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with S-200 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Structural integrity of fragment proteins was verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Limited Proteolysis and Fragment IdentificationProteolysis experiments were carried out in S-200 buffer, in which 5-20 μm xMcm10 was incubated with 1-200 ng of protease (trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, elastase, or endoproteinase-Glu-C) in a 10-μl reaction at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteolysis protection reactions contained 10 mm EDTA. Proteases were inactivated by adding 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 700 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% w/v SDS, 0.03% w/v bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Proteolytic fragments from MBP-xMcm10-His6 were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with Trypsin Gold (Promega) using standard procedures (32Anumanthan G. Halder S.K. Friedman D.B. Datta P.K. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10824-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and TOF/TOF tandem MS using a Voyager 4700 (Applied Biosciences, Framingham MA). Peptide ion masses (M+H) were accurate to within 20 ppm after internal calibration using either trypsin autolytic peptides or xMcm10-derived peptides confirmed by TOF/TOF MS. Molecular masses of xMcm10 domains resulting from proteolysis of deletion mutants Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 were obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the proteolysis reactions before SDS-PAGE. Reactions were concentrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed with 3 μl of saturated sinapinic acid in 60:40 (v/v) acetonitrile:1% trifluoroacetic acid/distilled H2O, and 1 μl was deposited onto a gold 100-well plate. Mass spectra were acquired on a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager Elite TOF spectrometer equipped with a laser desorption ionization source and an extended-path ion reflector. Protein standards from Sigma (MSCAL1-1KT) were used for mass calibration. For N-terminal sequencing of xMcm10 domains, intact proteolytic fragment proteins were transferred from SDS gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Ponceau S, extracted from the membrane, and subjected to Edman degradation chemistry using an Applied Biosystems Model 492HT Protein/Peptide Sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Zinc QuantitationQuantitative analysis of zinc bound to xMcm10 was performed using graphite furnace atomic absorption (GFAA) spectroscopy. Analyses were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HGA SIMAA 6000 graphite furnace equipped with an AAnalyst 800 GFAA/FLAA spectrophotometer. xMcm10 domains were quantified by absorbance spectroscopy at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 0.092 (NTD), 1.09 (ID), and 0.524 (CTD) ml·mg-1·cm-1. Gel Filtration Chromatography and Analytical UltracentrifugationSize exclusion chromatography of FL-xMcm10 was performed on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. xMcm10 domains were eluted from an analytical Superdex™ 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with S-200 buffer. 50-μl solutions of either xMcm10 (∼1-2 mg/ml) or molecular weight standards were eluted at 0.5 ml/min. The standard curve was generated from thyroglobulin (670 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.4 kDa). Sedimentation velocity analysis was conducted at 20 °C and 55,000 rpm using interference optics with a Beckman-Coulter XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. Double sector synthetic boundary cells equipped with sapphire windows were used to match the sample and reference menisci. FL-xMcm10 was prepared in FL-buffer, and NTD and CTD were prepared in S-200 buffer. The data were initially analyzed using the program DCDT+, which computes the apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution function g(s*) using the time-derivative method (33Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 34Stafford 3rd, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). For CTD, the molecular weight and sedimentation coefficient of the main component was obtained by global fitting of the data sets collected at multiple concentrations to a hybrid discrete-continuous model with Sedphat (35Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). For NTD, the data were fit to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model using the programs Sedanal (36Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and Sedphat. Molecular masses, partial specific volumes, and solvent densities were calculated using the SEDNTERP program (37Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. SEDNTERP. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). Fluorescence AnisotropyDNA binding was measured by following an increase in fluorescence anisotropy as protein (MBP-xMcm10-His6, NTD, ID, or CTD) was added to oligonucleotide d(TGACTACTACATGGTTGCCTACCAT) containing a 6-carboxyfluorescein moiety at the 3′-end either alone (ssDNA) or annealed to an excess of the complementary strand (dsDNA). Forked DNA substrate tested against full-length Mcm10 was generated from two 50-mer deoxyoligonucleotides in which dC25 was added to the 3′-end of the sequence above and to the 5′-end of the complementary sequence. For Mcm10-ID and -CTD, forked and bubble DNA substrates were generated from the sequences d(GGTAGGCACGAACCATGTAGTAGTA)/d(AACCATGTAGTAGTACGTGCCTACC) and d(GGTAGGCACGAACCATGTAGTAGTAGGCAATCAGC)/d(GCTGATTGCCAACCATGTAGTAGTACGTGCCTACC), respectively, in which the boldface denotes duplex regions. Protein was added over the concentration range of 0.05-50 μm to a solution containing 25 nm DNA in S-200 buffer. For EDTA titrations, the buffer was supplemented with 0.1, 1, 10, and 25 mm EDTA. Polarized fluorescence intensities using excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 515 nm, respectively, were measured for 30 s (1/s) and averaged. Anisotropy (r) was calculated using the equation r = (Ipar - Iperp)/(Ipar + 2Iperp), where Ipar and Iperp are the observed fluorescence intensities recorded through polarizers oriented parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the direction of vertically polarized light. Dissociation constants (Kd) were derived by fitting a simple two-state binding model to data from three experiments using Kaleidagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software). Mcm10-Pol α Binding AssayRecombinant DNA polymerase α-primase was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from extracts of Hi-5 insect cells co-infected with four recombinant baculoviruses as previously described (38Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The p180 subunit was prepared identically except only one recombinant baculovirus was used for infection. p180N (aa 1-323) was amplified by PCR on a cDNA template pBR322-p180 and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of a pGEX-2T expression vector (GE Healthcare). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (39Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). For the binding experiments, a total of 7 μg of purified polymerase α-primase or p180 was incubated with SJK132-20 antibodies covalently coupled to Sepharose-4B beads (GE Healthcare), or 7 μg of purified p180N was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) in binding buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2) containing 2% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Reactions contained either 5 or 15 μg of Trx-His6-xMcm10-domain proteins. The beads were washed once with binding buffer, three times with wash buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 75 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.25% inositol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once with binding buffer (rotated for 10 min during each wash). The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Half of each sample was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 2CT25, specific for the p180 subunit of polymerase α-primase, rabbit anti-GST (Invitrogen) for p180N, and H-15 anti-His (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for xMcm10 domains. Trx-only control experiments were performed to confirm that pol α, p180, and p180N did not interact with the Trx affinity tag. DNA Primase AssayOligoribonucleotide synthesis activity was measured as previously described for spMcm10 (29Fien K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22248-22260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-8 pmol of purified xMcm10 or 0.6-2.4 pmol of purified polymerase α-primase were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min with 1.0 μm dT50, 25 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and 0.1 mm ATP in a 10 μm reaction containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were treated with 1 unit of calf intestine phosphatase at 37 °C for 40 min. After the addition of 3 μl of sequencing gel running buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), samples were heated to 98 °C for 5 min and separated on a 25% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. RNA was visualized by autoradiography. xMcm10 Contains Three Structural DomainsIn the current study experiments to characterize the domain architecture of vertebrate Mcm10 were carried out using the X. laevis ortholog because of previous investigations of the function of the protein using Xenopus egg extracts (6Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 40Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Homology exists in three distinct regions of the protein (Fig. 1A, supplemental Fig. S1). The internal region (aa 240-430) is highly conserved among all known Mcm10 orthologs, with an overall similarity of 21.3% (39.0% for non-yeast Mcm10). Likewise, the C terminus contains a region of high (aa ∼700-860) and moderate (aa 510-700) similarity among higher eukaryotes. However, this region is not present in the yeast proteins (23.3% similarity for metazoan as compared with 3.6% for all eukaryotes). Moderate sequence similarity also exists at the N terminus (10% similarity for aa 1-130 in non-yeast sequences). This sequence analysis immediately suggested the presence of at least three domains tethered by disordered linkers. Consistent with this, no secondary structure was predicted in regions 130-230 and 575-624 (supplemental Fig. S1), and region 130-230 was predicted to be largely disordered. To experimentally determine the domain organization of Mcm10, the full-length protein was overexpressed in E. coli with a cleavable N-terminal MBP tag and a C-terminal His6 tag. The purified MBP-xMcm10-His6 protein was subjected to limited proteolytic digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, and the major proteolytic fragments were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS (Fig. 1B). Peptide masses were mapped to the xMcm10 amino acid sequence to define domains (supplemental Fig. S2). In most cases the end point regions were defined by peptide ions that were present in the full-length protein but absent in the fragment under study, and in some cases the end point was confirmed with tandem MS on unique peptide(s) that were generated by chymotrypsin cleavage on one side (from limited proteolysis) and trypsin cleavage on the other (from in-gel digestion). Peptides analyzed in this way revealed proteolytic-resistant domains separated by cleavage sites at amino acids 159, 241, 425, 484, 525, 566, and 599 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). Using the proteolytically sensitive regions as a guide, three deletion constructs encompassing the entire protein were designed to define the domain boundaries more accurately: xMcm101-230 (Δ1), xMcm10230-427 (Δ2), and xMcm10427-860 (Δ3). Each of these proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified, and subjected to limited proteolysis by trypsin (supplemental Fig. S3). Precise endpoints of tryptic fragments were identified by Edman degradation and MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 1C). Chymotrypsin, elastase, and endoproteinase-Glu-C digestion was also performed (data not shown). Despite the unique specificities of each protease tested, the resulting cleavage patterns were similar for each Mcm10 deletion mutant. Proteolysis of each deletion mutant revealed the presence of smaller fragments that were resistant to digestion and that were consistent with the cleavage pattern of the full-length protein (Fig. 1B) and with regions of sequence conservation (Fig. 1A). Cleavage of the C-terminal ends of Δ1 and Δ2 yielded xMcm101-145 and xMcm10230-417, respectively. For Δ3, ∼170 residues were cleaved from the N terminus, yielding xMcm10596-860. The resistance of xMcm101-145, xMcm10230-417, and xMcm10596-860 to further degradation indicates the presence of stable tertiary folds that sterically preclude protease access to their cleavage sites. To prepare for further characterization, regions 1-145 (NTD), 230-417 (ID), and 596"

To determine whether or not flagellin glycosylation in this serotype requires O-antigen genes, flagellin was isolated from the wild type, three O-antigen-deficient mutants wbpL, wbpO, and wbpP, and a wbpO mutant complemented with a plasmid containing a wild-type copy of wbpO. Flagellin from the wbpO mutant was smaller (42 kDa) than that of the wild type (45 kDa), or other mutants strains, and exhibited an altered isoelectric point (pI 4.8) when compared with PAK flagellin (pI 4.6). These differences were because of the truncation of the glycan moiety in the wbpO-flagellin. Thus, flagellin glycosylation in P. aeruginosa PAK apparently requires a functional WbpO but not WbpP. Because WbpP was previously proposed to catalyze a metabolic step in the biosynthesis of B-band O-antigen that precedes the action of WbpO, these results prompted us to reevaluate the two-step pathway catalyzed by WbpO and WbpP. Results from WbpO-WbpP-coupled enzymatic assays showed that either WbpO or WbpP is capable of initiating the two-step pathway; however, the kinetic parameters favored the WbpO reaction to occur first, converting UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine to UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucuronic acid prior to the conversion to UDP-N-acetyl-d-galacturonic acid by WbpP.

In some cases, these precursors may be shared between different systems. In Neisseria meningitidis, for example, more than three unlinked loci are required for synthesis and attachment of the pilin glycan (1Power P.M. Roddam L.F. Dieckelmann M. Srikhanta Y.N. Tan Y.C.

One of these loci includes galE, a gene that is required for synthesis of UDP-galactose, which in turn is required both for the production of lipo-oligosaccharide and for glycosylation of the pilin subunits (3Stimson E.

Another example of the interrelationship between biosynthesis pathways for cell-surface glycoconjugates is pilin glycosylation in P. aeruginosa strain 1244 (serotype O7). The covalently attached pilin glycan is identical to the repeat unit from the B-band O-antigen, one of two types of O-antigen possessed by P. aeruginosa strains (6DiGiandomenico A. Matewish M.J. Bisaillon A. Stehle J.R. Lam J.S. Castric P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In fact, a mutation in the gene that encodes the initiating glycosyltransferase WbpL, which transfers the first monosaccharide of the O-antigen unit from UDP-N-acetyl-d-quinovosamine (UDP-d-QuiNAc) to the lipid carrier undecaprenol phosphate, abrogates pilin glycosylation as well as O-antigen LPS. P. aeruginosa produces a single polar flagellum that has been shown to be an important virulence factor in pulmonary disease and is important for colonization of the respiratory tract in patients with cystic fibrosis and individuals with nosocomial pneumonia (7Tang H.B. DiMango E. Bryan R. Gambello M. Iglewski B.H. Goldberg J.B. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 37-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flagellar filament is composed of flagellin subunits encoded by fliC, and in this species flagellin is classified as either a-type or b-type based on their amino acid sequence, apparent molecular weight, and antigenicity (9Spangenberg C. Heuer T. Burger C. Tummler B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Allison J.S. Dawson M. Drake D. Montie T.C. Infect.

Hung. 1970; 17: 35-48PubMed Google Scholar). Like the pilin of P. aeruginosa 1244, the a-type flagellins of strain PAK (serotype O6) are glycosylated, although less is known about the nature of the glycosylation (13Brimer C.D. Montie T.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schirm M. Arora S.K. Verma A. Vinogradov E. Thibault P. Ramphal R. Logan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2523-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Totten P.A. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7188-7199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flagellin of strain PAK contains two variable length O-linked oligosaccharide chains, each with up to 11 monosaccharides (14Schirm M. Arora S.K. Verma A. Vinogradov E. Thibault P. Ramphal R. Logan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2523-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the exact composition of the flagellin glycans is unknown, evidence suggests that each glycan begins with an l-rhamnose residue and contains pentoses, hexoses, deoxyhexoses, hexuronic acids, and/or deoxyhexoses with amino and formyl substitutions. A cluster of 14 genes, located upstream of the flagellin gene fliC in the PAK genome, has been designated as the flagellin glycosylation island (16Arora S.K. Bangera M. Lory S. Ramphal R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9342-9347Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Two of the genes in this cluster have been shown through individual null mutations to be required for flagellin glycosylation, but the function of the remaining 12 genes remains unknown, and because of the paucity of information about the composition of the glycans, it is not possible to propose a biosynthesis pathway at this time. The objective of this study was to determine whether flagellin glycosylation in P. aeruginosa PAK (serotype O6) requires genes involved in B-band O-antigen biosynthesis as does pilin glycosylation in strain 1244. The genes responsible for biosynthesis of the serotype O6 O-antigen have been characterized and designated as the wbp gene locus (17Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the structure of the O-antigen of strain PAK is a tetrasaccharide repeat of [→2)-α-l-rhamnose-(1→4)-α-d-2-acetamido-3-O-acetyl-6-aminogalacturonic acid-(1-4)-α-d-6-amino-2-deoxy-2-formamido-d-galacturonic acid-(1→3)-α-d-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-glucose-(1→] (18Knirel A. Kochetkov N.K. Biokhimiia. 1994; 59: 1784-1851PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated and compared flagellin from wild-type PAK and three mutants, wbpL, wbpO, and wbpP. Null mutations in these genes, contained within the O6 O-antigen cluster, have been generated, and analysis of the LPS phenotypes from these mutants showed the absolute requirement of these genes for O-antigen production (17Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). WbpL is the initiating transferase of O-antigen biosynthesis and transfers the first sugar of the O-repeat unit, N-acetyl-d-quinovosamine (d-QuiNAc), from UDP-d-QuiNAc to the undecaprenol phosphate (C55-P) lipid carrier (Fig. 1). WbpP and WbpO are required for synthesis of the UDP-N-acetyl-d-galacturonic acid (UDP-d-GalNAcA), a precursor to the galactosaminuronic acid-derived residues of the O-antigen. WbpP has been characterized as a UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (UDP-d-GlcNAc) 4-epimerase (19Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and WbpO has been characterized as a 6-dehydrogenase that accepts UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (UDP-d-GalNAc), the product of WbpP/UDP-d-GlcNAc reactions, and produces UDP-d-GalNAcA (20Zhao X. Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Egbosimba E. Li J. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33252-33259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that WbpO is required for flagellin glycosylation, but WbpP is not. This is surprising because WbpP was proposed to catalyze an earlier step in the metabolic pathway than WbpO, and it prompted us to conduct more indepth evaluation of the metabolic steps catalyzed by these two proteins in the O-antigen biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa strain PAK. Here we present the biochemical evidence to show that whereas either WbpP or WbpO could initiate the two-step pathway, the kinetic parameters of the two enzymes indicated a strong preference for WbpO to convert UDP-d-GlcNAc into UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-d-GlcNAcA) prior to catalysis of this compound by WbpP to generate UDP-d-GalNAcA. MaterialsUDP-d-GlcNAc, UDP-d-GalNAc, NAD+, NADP+, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate, transferrin, cytochrome c, bovine serum albumin, trypsinogen, alcohol dehydrogenase, and the antibiotics used in this study were obtained from Sigma. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), isoelectric focusing (IEF) sample loading buffer, Novex® IEF gels, and the SimplyBlue™ Safestain were purchased from Invitrogen.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) were used for the analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Hancock and Carey (23Hancock R.E. Carey A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 902-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), except that a mini-gel system was used (Bio-Rad). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis was performed using a P/ACE MDQ glycoprotein system with UV detection (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) as described previously (26Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Larocque S. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IEF was performed using an XCell Surelock™ Mini-Cell (Invitrogen). Samples containing flagella were mixed with an equal volume of IEF sample loading buffer and loaded onto Novex® IEF gels with a range of pH 3-7, and electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After electrophoresis, the IEF gel was fixed in 12% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min and then washed with distilled water over a period of 45 min with the water changed every 5 min. The IEF gel was stained with SimplyBlue™ Safestain (Invitrogen) and washed as described by the manufacturer's instructions. For the Western immunoblotting experiment, proteins were transferred from the IEF gel after electrophoresis to Biotrace™nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad transfer cell for 1 h at 150 mA using Tris-glycine transfer buffer as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For mass spectrometry (MS), lyophilized flagellin protein was first resuspended in water, and then a 1:1 mixture of protein solution to matrix solution (sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was made, and 1 μl was spotted onto the MALDI plate. Some of the flagellin samples were desalted directly on the MALDI plate by pipetting 2 μl of water onto the spot and removing after 1 min using a gel-loading tip. Analysis of intact flagellin proteins was performed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS instrument (model Reflex III, Bruker, Germany) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser (Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, University of Guelph). The instrument was externally calibrated using various protein standards, including cytochrome c, bovine serum albumin, trypsinogen, and alcohol dehydrogenase. MS analysis of intact flagellin was performed in the linear detection mode, in the positive mode, with laser energy set at 35-40%. Isolation of FlagellinFlagella were isolated from the different P. aeruginosa strains grown overnight in Davis minimal broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.01 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.015 mm thiamine, and 0.04 mg/ml casamino acids. Flagella were isolated and purified using the ammonium sulfate precipitation method as described by Brimer and Montie (13Brimer C.D. Montie T.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flagellin preparation was assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE analysis. Preparation of flagella from the P. aeruginosa LPS mutants was more difficult than from the wild-type strain because the LPS mutants were more prone to cell lysis during the initial steps of the isolation procedure, resulting in large amounts of contaminating protein. In the case where the sample was found to contain many contaminating proteins, the sample was brought up to a volume of 200 ml in sodium phosphate buffer, and the flagella were again recovered by repeated ammonium sulfate precipitation. Flagella prepared in this manner were about 90% pure, but trace amounts of pilin were found to be co-purified in the process. Adsorption of Nonspecific Antibodies from Anti-FliC AntiserumRabbit antiserum to P. aeruginosa strain PAK flagellin, FliC, was kindly provided by Dr. Reuben Ramphal (27Frisk A. Jyot J. Arora S.K. Ramphal R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1514-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To increase the specificity, the antiserum was adsorbed against proteins isolated from P. aeruginosa strain PAK-N1, a mutant that does not produce flagella. Whole cell protein lysates were prepared from strain PAK-N1 as follows: 5 ml of a bacterial culture grown overnight in Miller's LB broth, 37 °C, was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min, and the pellet was resuspended in protein sample buffer and boiled in a water bath for 10 min. This protein preparation was resolved on a 10% glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Biotrace™ nitrocellulose (VWR International, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The nitrocellulose was cut into 0.5 × 8-cm pieces. The original anti-serum (15 μl) was diluted in 7.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 125 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4·12H2O, 7 mm KCl, pH 7.0) and sodium azide (final concentration of 0.02%). Five nitrocellulose strips were incubated in 7.5 ml of antiserum for 4 h at room temperature on a CLAY ADAMS Brand Nutator (BD Biosciences). The strips were then removed, and five new strips were added, and the antiserum was again incubated as described. This process was repeated five times with fresh strips each time, and the antiserum was stored at -20 °C. The specificity of the antiserum for FliC was tested by Western immunoblotting using flagellin prepared from the wild-type PAK and PAK-N1 (serves as a negative control). Flagellin Glycosylation DetectionFlagellins were resolved on a 10% glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transblotted onto nitrocellulose. The glycosylation detection protocol of O'Shannessey et al. (28O'Shannessy D.J. Voorstad P.J. Quarles R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was used with the following modifications. All incubations took place at room temperature. After transfer of the proteins to the nitrocellulose, the membrane was washed with 10 ml of PBS (9 mm sodium phosphate, 27 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.2) for 10 min. The membrane was incubated in 15 mm sodium periodate in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for 30 min in the dark. The membrane was washed four times for 10 min with PBS followed by a 1-h incubation in 5 mm biotin hydrazide, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer. The nitrocellulose was then washed three times for 10 min in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 27 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.2) and then blocked for 30 min in TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The membrane was washed three times for 10 min in TBS and incubated for 2 h in a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase streptavidin (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) in TBS. This was followed by three 10-min washes in TBS. The membrane was developed using a substrate consisting of 30 mg of NBT and 15 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate in 100 ml of 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.8. The nonglycosylated WbpD protein used as a negative control was purified as described previously (29Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Keates R.A. Brewer D. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Construction of pET-28a wbpOThe wbpO gene was cloned into the pET-28a(+) expression vector with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. wbpO was amplified from genomic DNA (P. aeruginosa IATS O6) by PCR using the following primers: forward primer 5′-GTGCGAAGCATATGAAGGATCTGAAG-3′, which incorporates an NdeI restriction digestion site (underlined); reverse primer 5′-CAACTAAGCTTACAGGCGTAGATC-3′, which incorporates a HindIII restriction digestion site. The PCR consisted of 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μm of each primer, 2.5 mm of each dNTP, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1× buffer. A 5-min denaturation was carried out before the addition of 2.5 units of Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science), followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. A final elongation step of 7 min at 72 °C was performed. Both the PCR product and the pET-28a vector were digested with NdeI and HindIII, purified using UltraClean™15 (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA), and ligated overnight at 15 °C using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Pickering, Ontario, Canada). The construct obtained was analyzed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and subsequently transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, using kanamycin (50 μg/ml) for selection. Expression and Purification of EnzymesFor the expression of WbpO, 250 ml of Terrific Broth (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing kanamycin was inoculated with 6 ml of an overnight culture and grown at 37 °C, 200 rpm. When OD600 reached 0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and expression was allowed to proceed for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall Evolution RC, Mandel Scientific, Guelph, Ontario, Canada) at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and pellets were stored at -20 °C. WbpP and WbpAO5 were expressed as described previously (19Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

WbpAO5 from P. aeruginosa PAO1 (serotype O5) has been shown to be a UDP-d-GlcNAc 6-dehydrogenase (26Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Larocque S. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

For purification of WbpO or WbpP, the pellet from 250 ml of induced culture was resuspended in 25 ml of binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm sodium chloride). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication on ice and cell debris, and membrane fractions were removed by ultracentrifugation (Beckman L8-M, Beckman Coulter Canada, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at 175,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Purification using the HiTrap chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) was performed as recommended by the manufacturer, with nickel as the chelating ion and binding buffer containing 300 mm imidazole as the eluent. Following purification, the concentration of sodium chloride in purified WbpO or WbpP was reduced to 50 mm using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The purity of WbpO and WbpP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and purified protein was stored at -20 °C after the addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 25%. WbpAO5 was purified as described previously (26Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Larocque S. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

Enzymatic ReactionsCoupled reactions contained 2 mm substrate (UDP-d-GlcNAc or UDP-d-GalNAc), 5 mm NAD+, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 1.8 μg of WbpP, 18 μg of WbpO, and/or 1.8 μg of WbpAO5. Single enzyme reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, whereas coupled reactions were carried out in two steps. After addition of the first enzyme, the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of the second enzyme and further incubation for 1 h. For the pH and temperature optima studies of WbpO, reactions contained 1 mm substrate (UDP-d-GlcNAc or UDP-d-GalNAc), 2.5 mm NAD+, 100 mm buffer, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 5 μg of WbpO and were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C. For determination of the pH optimum, MES (pKa 6.1) was used as the buffer for pH 5, 5.5, 6, and 6.5; and BisTris propane (pKa1 6.8 and pKa2 9.0) was the buffer for pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, and 10. Reactions for the determination of the temperature optimum were carried out at 0, 15, 20, 30, 37, 42, 55 or 65 °C in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For both pH and temperature studies, substrate conversion was determined by CE. The cofactor requirements of WbpO were determined as described previously for WbpAO5 (26Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q.

After removal of protein by ultrafiltration (Centriplus YM3 cartridge from Millipore), UDP-d-Glc-NAcA was purified by anion-exchange on an Econo-Pac High Q column (Bio-Rad) using a linear gradient of 0-500 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The fractions containing UDP-d-GlcNAcA were pooled and lyophilized. Ten μmol of UDP-d-GalNAc was converted into UDP-d-GalNAcA in the same manner as for UDP-d-GlcNAcA, except that 1.5 mg of WbpO was used instead of WbpAO5. Analysis of the WbpO Reaction Products by NMR SpectroscopyThe purified reaction products of the WbpO reaction were suspended in 200 μl of 99% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories Inc., Andover, MA) and placed into 3-mm NMR tubes (Wilmad, Buena, NJ). Standard homo- and heteronuclear correlated two-dimensional 1H NMR, 13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy, COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY pulse sequences from Varian were used for general assignments.

https://openalex.org/W1970149293,"Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase activated by triple-helical collagen. So far six different isoforms of DDR1 have been described. Aberrant expression and signaling of DDR1 have been implicated in several human diseases linked to accelerated matrix degradation and remodeling, including tumor invasion, atherosclerosis, and lung fibrosis. Here we show that DDR1 exists as a disulfide-linked dimer in transfected as well as endogenously expressing cells. This dimer formation occurred irrespective of its kinase domain, as dimers were also found for the truncated DDR1d isoform. A deletion analysis of the extracellular domain showed that DDR1 mutants lacking the stalk region failed to form dimers, whereas deletion of the discoidin domain did not prevent dimerization. Point mutagenesis within the stalk region suggested that cysteines 303 and 348 are necessary for dimerization, collagen binding, and activation of kinase function. The identification of DDR1 dimers provides new insights into the molecular structure of receptor tyrosine kinases and suggests distinct signaling mechanisms of each receptor subfamily.

DDRs are distinguished from other RTKs by a discoidin domain in their extracellular region, which functions as a lectin in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (1Johnson J.D. Edman J.C. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5677-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There are two genes that code for DDRs in humans, DDR1 and DDR2 (2Vogel W.F. Abdulhussein R. Ford C.E. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Each DDR contains an extracellular region containing the ligand-binding discoidin domain, a stalk region, a single transmembrane region, as well as a cytoplasmic domain consisting of a juxtamembrane region and a tyrosine kinase domain. Through alternative splicing in the juxtamembrane or kinase domain of the human gene, at least five isoforms DDR1a– DDR1e are generated (3Alves F. Saupe S. Ledwon M. Schaub F. Hiddemann W. Vogel W.F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The longest DDR1 transcript codes for the c-isoform with 919 amino acids. Compared with the c-isoform, the a-isoform lacks 37 amino acids in the juxtamembrane region, and the b-isoform lacks six amino acids in the kinase domain because of alternative splicing (4Playford M.P.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). The DDR1d and e-isoforms are truncated variants that either lack the entire kinase region (d-isoform) or parts of the juxtamembrane region and the ATP-binding site (e-isoform (3Alves F. Saupe S. Ledwon M. Schaub F. Hiddemann W. Vogel W.F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)). A sixth isoform lacking parts of the extracellular domain has been described from rat testis (6Mullenbach E. Walter L. Dressel R. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 372: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DDR1 is expressed in a variety of cell types and tissues, specifically in the mammary gland, brain, kidney, lung, and colon mucosa and has been isolated from several carcinoma cell lines, including MCF7 mammary carcinoma cells, ovarian, lung, and esophageal cancer cells, and primary pediatric brain tumor samples (for review see Ref. 2Vogel W.F. Abdulhussein R. Ford C.E. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Immune cells, including macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as oligodendrocytes also express DDR1 (7Kamohara H. Yamashiro S. Galligan C. Yoshimura T.

From experiments with cultured cells, it was found that DDR1 regulates cell migration and branching morphogenesis within collagen-rich matrices (11Ferri N. Carragher N.O. Raines E.W. Am. J.

Homozygous mutant animals are smaller in size than control littermates and present with an altered renal basement membrane (13Vogel W.F. Aszodi A. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

The majority of DDR1-null females are unable to bear offspring because of defects in blastocyst implantation. Those null females that are able to give birth are unable to lactate, a defect caused by abnormal branching and differentiation of the mammary epithelium (13Vogel W.F. Aszodi A. Alves F. Pawson T.

The presence of the discoidin domain in DDR1 has been shown to be the essential region for collagen binding, and specific residues within the discoidin domain that interact with collagen were identified (21Curat C.A.

Recently, the structure of the DDR2 discoidin domain has been solved by NMR studies, but such information is as yet not available for DDR1 (24Ichikawa O. Osawa M. Nishida N. Goshima N. Nomura N. Shimada I. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4168-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In extension of the current model of RTK signaling, it was hypothesized that activation of DDR1 also involves ligand-induced dimerization (25Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 91: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, to date, the validity of this ligand-induced RTK dimerization model for DDR1 in particular has not been verified. In this study, we report the presence of disulfide-linked DDR1 dimers, which potentially contribute to receptor trafficking and ligand-induced receptor activation. We also assess the importance of the stalk region of DDR1, and we found that two cysteines in the stalk region are critical for dimerization. Cell Culture and Protein Expression—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and human breast carcinoma MCF-7 and T-47D cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection and cultivated under the recommended conditions. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector pIRES-Neo containing the FLAG-tagged human cDNA of DDR1 isoforms a and d. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and stably expressing clones isolated. Semi-confluent 293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 10 μg of plasmid DNA per 10-cm dish. The medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 18 h after transfection. Twenty four hours later, cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml rat tail type I collagen (BD Biosciences). Fifteen to 90 min after stimulation, cells were lysed using either Triton X-100 lysis buffer for Western blotting or Tween 20 lysis buffer for ELISA (each containing 1% detergent, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). For immunoprecipitation, 293 cells were transfected with plasmids coding for HA-tagged DDR1a and DDR1d. After stimulation, cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C using an HA-specific monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Western Blotting—Prior to Western blot analysis, protein concentration of cell lysates was quantified using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of each sample were boiled in either reducing Laemmli buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 15% β-mercaptoethanol) or nonreducing Laemmli (lacking β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and immunoblotted using antibodies diluted 1:1000 (monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-HA, or anti-FLAG (Sigma)) or 1:500 (anti-DDR1 C-terminal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight in NET-Gel (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% gelatin). Western blots were incubated with mouse and rabbit peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, respectively (Bio-Rad), and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For re-probing, the membranes were stripped in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 15 min and blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced into the DDR1b cDNA by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Point mutations were introduced to make the following single amino acid changes: C289S, C303S, and C348S (primer sequences are available upon request). The numbering refers to full-length DDR1, including its signal peptide. All constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the respective mutation. The deletion mutants lacking the discoidin domain or stalk region were described previously (21Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ELISA—Type I collagen was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a concentration of 50 μg/ml and added to 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl/well). Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. Wells were blocked with 150 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. Wells were washed once with 150 μl of wash buffer (0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). DDR1-transfected 293 cells were lysed with Tween 20-based lysis buffer, and lysate was added to each well and incubated at room temperature overnight (lysates were normalized for DDR1 expression by Western blot analysis prior to ELISA). Wells were washed six times with wash buffer. 50-μl aliquots of diluted anti-DDR1 C-terminal antibody (1:500 dilution in wash buffer) were added and incubated for 90 min. Wells were washed six times with wash buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 90 min. Bound protein was detected using 75 μl/well of 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium citrate and 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.0) with 0.012% hydrogen peroxide. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped using 50 μl/well of 3 m sulfuric acid. Plates were analyzed in an ELISA reader at 490 nm; buffer only values were subtracted, and normalized values were subjected to statistical analysis using Student's t test as calculated by Microsoft Excel. p values are indicated where applicable. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Collagen-agarose Affinity Purification—For total cell lysates of transfected 293 cells expressing wild type DDR1b, each Cys-Ser mutant and control-transfected cells were normalized for DDR1 expression by Western blotting and incubated overnight at 4 °C with collagen-linked Sepharose beads (Sigma) in HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Samples were washed three times with HNTG, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Bound material was detected using anti-DDR1 C-terminal antibody and secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase. Cell Surface Biotinylation—293 cells were transfected with wild type DDR1b or the Cys-Ser mutants as outlined above. Cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotinate (Pierce) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min, and washed three times with PBS containing 100 mm glycine. Cells were pelleted, lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Four hundred μg of total lysates were incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently washed four times with RIPA buffer, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Previous work showed that the full-length DDR1 isoforms a and b are expressed as ∼125-kDa proteins in a number of different cell types, including breast epithelial cells (Fig. 1) (5Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). To test whether DDR1 forms disulfide-linked dimers, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently transfected with the b-isoform of DDR1 or a vector-only control, stimulated with type I collagen for 90 min, and lysates analyzed by PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Western blot analysis was performed using an antibody specific to the C terminus of DDR1. Although DDR1 was expressed as single 125-kDa band in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, an additional band of ∼250 kDa was found in the absence of the reducing agent (Fig. 2A). Quantification of these bands indicated that ∼20% of total DDR1-immunoreactive protein is found as 250-kDa entity. Stimulation with collagen did not notably affect the ratio of 125- versus 250-kDa protein. To test whether the proposed dimer was present in cells expressing DDR1 endogenously, lysates from human breast carcinoma T-47D cells were examined under reducing and nonreducing conditions. In agreement with the data from 293 cells, DDR1 was detected as a 125-kDa monomeric protein under reducing conditions and as both a monomer and 250-kDa dimer under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2DDR1b forms covalent dimers. A, 293 cells were transiently transfected with DDR1b or an empty plasmid (control) and stimulated with type I collagen (col) for 90 min. Using an antibody specific for the C terminus of DDR1, Western blot analysis of gels run under reducing conditions (left panel) detected DDR1b as a monomeric protein (arrow), whereas under nonreducing conditions (right panel), DDR1b was present as both a monomer (arrow) and a dimer (chevron). B, T-47D cells that endogenously express DDR1b were stimulated with collagen for 18 h and lysates analyzed by Western blotting under reducing (left panel) and nonreducing conditions (right panel). The experiments were performed three times, and representative data are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DDR1a and -d were transiently transfected in 293 cells or stably transfected into human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1). This was done to determine whether DDR1 covalent dimer formation is also found other than just with the b-isoform. As for DDR1b, dimers of DDR1a and -d were detected by Western blotting of MCF-7 lysates analyzed under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3). Although the ratio of monomer to dimer for DDR1a was similar to the ratio of DDR1b (Fig. 2A), there was around 40% of total DDR1d found as dimer (Fig. 3B). Similarly to DDR1a or -b, the ratio of DDR1d monomer to dimer was not altered upon collagen exposure. These data suggest that the kinase domain, which is present in both a- and b-isoforms but absent in DDR1d, is not necessary for covalent linkage, and that DDR1 dimerization is likely mediated by the juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and/or extracellular regions. To investigate whether DDR1 could form heterodimers consisting of different isoforms, epitope-tagged DDR1a and d-isoforms were co-transfected using FLAG-tagged DDR1a and HA-tagged DDR1d. We found that these isoforms did not form covalently linked heterodimers, nor did they alter the monomer to homodimer ratio of each individual isoform (data not shown). These findings are in agreement with previous studies that failed to show interaction between full-length and truncated DDR1 isoforms (3Alves F. Saupe S. Ledwon M. Schaub F. Hiddemann W. Vogel W.F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Next, we asked the question whether dimeric DDR1 is phosphorylated upon collagen stimulation. To test this, we transfected 293 cells with plasmids coding for HA-tagged DDR1a and DDR1d and stimulated cells with collagen for 90 min. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of total lysates on nonreducing SDS gels revealed that the 250-kDa dimeric DDR1a entity is indeed phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation (Fig. 4A). To further confirm the identity of the 250-kDa band, we used lysates from 293 cells transfected with HA-tagged DDR1a and DDR1d for immunoprecipitation, followed by nonreducing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4B). Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting revealed phosphorylated 125- and 250-kDa DDR1a species, in a ratio comparable with the one observed with total lysates (Fig. 4A). Equal expression of DDR1a or -d was confirmed by reprobing with an HA-specific antibody (Fig. 4, A and B, right panels) and by additional Western blot analysis of total lysates separated by reducing gel electrophoresis (not shown). To further define a particular region of DDR1 that may be responsible for dimer formation, we employed deletion mutants, which either lack the discoidin domain (Fig. 1, Δ32–185) or the stalk region (Δ199–412) (21Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, monomeric receptor species were detected at 125 kDa for full-length DDR1b, at 100 kDa for the Δ32–185 mutant, and at 80 kDa for Δ199–412 (Fig. 5A). As detailed previously, both deletion mutants have lost the ability to undergo collagen-mediated kinase activation (21Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Importantly, under nonreducing conditions, additional bands corresponding to dimers were detected for full-length DDR1 (250 kDa) and Δ32–185 (200 kDa) but not for the Δ199–412 (expected at 160 kDa) mutant (Fig. 5B). This finding suggests that a sequence within the stalk region is necessary for the dimerization of DDR1. To explore this observation further, we identified a total of three cysteines at position 289, 303, and 348 in the stalk region (Fig. 1). These are a total of seven cysteines in the extracellular domain of DDR1. Four cysteines are located in the discoidin domain and are suggested to be disulfide-linked based on our studies using molecular modeling (22Abdulhussein R. McFadden C. Fuentes-Prior P. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31462-31470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce single amino acid exchanges switching each cysteine in the stalk region to serine. The resulting mutant constructs were expressed in 293 cells and total lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting of reducing gels showed strong ligand-triggered phosphorylation of wild type DDR1 and C289S mutant, but no signal was detected for the C303S and C348S mutants (Fig. 6, A and B). In the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, DDR1 dimers (250 kDa) were detected for wild type DDR1a and for the C289S mutant but not for C303S and C348S mutants suggesting that switching these residues to serines affected the dimerization of the receptor (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, we noted on Western blots obtained from nonreducing gels that C303S and C348S were expressed somewhat lower than wild type DDR1 or C289S (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that the cysteines at position 303 and 348 are involved in covalent dimerization and/or ligand-induced receptor activation. To verify these differences in the DDR1-collagen interaction, we assessed the ability of the stalk region cysteine mutants to bind collagen in vitro. First, a collagen-binding assay was performed where a collagen I-coated 96-well microtiter plate was incubated with cell lysates normalized for equal amounts of wild type DDR1, C289S, C303S, or C348S (Fig. 7A). We found that wild type and C289S bound to immobilized collagen at comparable levels, whereas C303S and C348S mutants had a significantly lower affinity, relative to wild type DDR1 (p < 0.001). Second, lysates from transfected cells were incubated with agarose beads that are coupled with type I collagen. DDR1b and C289S constructs bound to collagen-agarose beads equally well, whereas C303S and C348S mutants had no detectable affinity (Fig. 7B). Therefore, mutations at position Cys-303 or Cys-348 in the stalk region of DDR1 appear to change the topology of the receptor rendering it incapable of binding to collagen. As we noticed that C303S and C348S mutants ran at a slightly lower molecular weight on SDS-PAGE than the wild type (Fig. 6B), we wanted to confirm that both mutants undergo similar post-translational modification. Treating transfected cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation (26Tkacz J.S. Lampen O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), showed that all three cysteine mutants had a glyco moiety comparable with the wild type (data not shown). At this time, however, we cannot rule out that these mutants could be differentially glycosylated compared with wild type DDR1. Furthermore, the inability of the C303S and C348S mutants to be activated by collagen could be attributed to incorrect cellular trafficking. Therefore, we performed surface biotinylation and found that cell surface localization of neither C303S nor C348S is impaired compared with the wild type or C289S mutant (Fig. 7, C and D). In conclusion, our data provide evidence for the existence of a disulfide-linked, dimeric form of DDR1 in human cells, which is activated upon collagen stimulation. We further show that two cysteines in the stalk region of the receptor are most likely necessary not only for the formation of covalent dimers but also for proper receptor post-translational maturation. Data presented here are the first to report that DDR1 exists as disulfide-linked dimers. These dimers are found in cells transfected with DDR1 as well as in epithelial cells endogenously expressing DDR1. The three major isoforms of DDR1, -a, -b, and DDR1d, all demonstrated covalent dimerization. The ratio of monomers to dimers was similar between DDR1a and DDR1b, whereas DDR1d showed a greater proportion of dimers. Because DDR1d does not contain the tyrosine kinase domain, our data suggest a role for this region in regulating the extent of dimerization. In exploring the DDR1 dimer formation in more detail, we found that dimers do not form in the absence of the stalk region. Upon further analysis of the stalk region, mutation of cysteines 303 or 348 to serine resulted in a receptor that did not form covalent dimers and was no longer activated upon ligand stimulation. In addition, C303S and C348S mutants were unable to bind collagen in either an ELISA or a solid phase binding assay. On nonreducing gels, the expression level of these two mutants was somewhat reduced compared with C289S or the wild type receptor (Fig. 6D), possibly indicating altered cellular maturation and/or trafficking. Several previous studies on the mechanism of DDR signaling provided a basis for this study. Curat et al. (21Curat C.A. Eck M. Dervillez X. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45952-45958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) examined the role of the discoidin domain and the stalk region for DDR1 activation and collagen binding. Although the discoidin domain was essential for the interaction with collagen, omission of the stalk region resulted in DDR1 molecules still being able to bind to collagen. Conversely, deletion of the discoidin domain resulted in a receptor species that could neither bind to nor be activated by collagen. Additional mechanistic evidence for DDR1 signaling was obtained using an Fc affinity-tagged construct of the DDR1 ectodomain (23Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It was shown that DDR1 recognized collagen only as a dimeric and not as a monomeric construct, indicating a requirement for noncovalent receptor dimerization in DDR1-collagen signaling. Furthermore, the expression of recombinant discoidin as well as ectodomain in insect cells revealed that the ectodomain had an about 10-fold higher affinity to collagen than the discoidin domain alone (22Abdulhussein R. McFadden C. Fuentes-Prior P. Vogel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31462-31470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Following completion of this study, Noordeen et al.

Using chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, these authors found ligand-independent DDR1 dimers and monomers in a ratio very similar to this study. In contrast to this study, they failed to identify any cysteine residues in the stalk region responsible for dimer formation. Based on bacterial expression of the isolated DDR1 transmembrane region, Noordeen et al. (27Noordeen N.A. Carafoli F. Hohenester E. Horton M.A. Leitinger B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2125910127,"Nicotine in cigarette smoke has been linked to several deleterious side effects on the offspring of smoking mothers, including impaired development of the sympathoadrenal system, abnormal arousal reflexes, and sudden infant death syndrome. Catecholamine (CA) release from adrenomedullary chromaffin cells (AMCs) in response to asphyxial stressors, e.g., low O(2) (hypoxia) and elevated CO(2) (hypercapnia), is critical for adaptation to extrauterine life and occurs before splanchnic innervation. Here, we investigated the effects of prenatal nicotine bitartrate exposure on the ability of neonatal (P0) rat AMCs to respond appropriately to asphyxial stressors. Control AMCs isolated from pups born to saline-treated dams displayed typical responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia, including inhibition of outward K(+) current, membrane depolarization, increased cytosolic calcium, and CA secretion. In contrast, P0 AMCs from pups born to nicotine-treated dams showed a marked suppression or loss of hypoxic sensitivity, although hypercapnic sensitivity and the expression of CO(2) markers (i.e., carbonic anhydrase I and II) appeared normal. Moreover, isolated saline-treated P0 AMCs lost their hypoxic sensitivity when grown in culture for approximately 1 wk in the presence of a subsaturating concentration of nicotine base (50 microM), and this effect was abolished by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) blocker mecamylamine (100 microM). Taken together, these data suggest that the adverse effects of maternal smoking on sympathoadrenal function in the offspring are due in part to a loss or suppression of acute hypoxic sensitivity in adrenal chromaffin cells, triggered by the direct action of nicotine on endogenous nicotinic acetylcholine receptors."

We now demonstrate that a lipid A myristate deficiency in an E. coli O157:H7 msbB mutant constitutively activates PagP in outer membranes. The lipid A myristate deficiency is associated with hydrophobic antibiotic sensitivity and, unexpectedly, with serum sensitivity, which resulted from O-antigen polysaccharide absence due to a cytoplasmically determined truncation at the first outer core glucose unit of the R3 core oligosaccharide. Mutational inactivation of pagP in the myristate-deficient lipid A background aggravated the hydrophobic antibiotic sensitivity as a result of losing a partially compensatory increase in lipid A palmitoylation while simultaneously restoring serum resistance and O-antigen attachment to intact lipopolysaccharide. Complementation with either wild-type pagP or catalytically inactive pagPSer77Ala alleles restored the R3 core truncation. However, the intact lipopolysaccharide was preserved after complementation with an internal deletion pagPΔ5-14 allele, which mostly eliminates a periplasmic amphipathic α-helical domain but fully supports cell surface lipid A palmitoylation. Our findings indicate that activation of PagP not only triggers lipid A palmitoylation in the outer membrane but also separately truncates the R3 core oligosaccharide in the cytoplasm.

Like most enteric Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli surrounds its cytoplasmic membrane with a reticulated peptidoglycan exoskeleton (murein) and an outer membrane (OM), 5The abbreviations used are: OMouter membranel-Ara4N4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinoseApampicillinGmgentamycinHepL-glycero-d-manno-heptoseKdo3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acidLDAOlauroyldimethylamine-N-oxideLPSlipopolysaccharidePEtNphosphoethanolamineStrstreptomycinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.5The abbreviations used are: OMouter membranel-Ara4N4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinoseApampicillinGmgentamycinHepL-glycero-d-manno-heptoseKdo3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acidLDAOlauroyldimethylamine-N-oxideLPSlipopolysaccharidePEtNphosphoethanolamineStrstreptomycinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which demarcates the so-called periplasmic space. The enter-obacterial OM is an asymmetric lipid bilayer in which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exclusively lines the external leaflet, whereas phospholipids line the inner leaflet (1Kamio Y. Nikaido H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 2Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar). The asymmetric lipid organization provides a permeability barrier to hydrophobic antibiotics and detergents encountered in the natural and host environments. Although hydrophobic antibiotics can freely permeate through phospholipid bilayers, negative charges in LPS are bridged by Mg2+ ions to create tight lateral packing interactions, which largely prevent permeation (3Schindler M. Osborn M.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4425-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 4Leive L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 109-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). According to current models, perturbations of OM lipid asymmetry can result from the migration of phospholipids into the external leaflet to create localized rafts of phospholipid bilayers, which render bacteria susceptible to hydrophobic antibiotics (5Nikaido H. Nakae T. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1979; 20: 163-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 6Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol.

The LPS is a tripartite molecule consisting of the hydrophobic anchor lipid A (endotoxin), the core oligosaccharide, which is divided into the inner and outer core regions, and the O-antigen polysaccharide (7Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). The so-called rough LPS includes only the lipid A-core and is usually distinguished from the smooth LPS that also includes O-antigen. The O-antigen can provide bacterial resistance to serum by preventing deposition of the complement cascade's membrane attack complex (8Joiner K.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 121: 99-133PubMed Google Scholar). The entire LPS structure is assembled within three distinct subcellular compartments, namely the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasmic space, and the OM (9Bishop R.E. Contrib. Microbiol. 2005; 12: 1-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Raetz pathway for lipid A biosynthesis includes nine Lpx enzymes, which convert UDP-GlcNAc into a β-1′, 6-linked disaccharide of GlcN (7Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). The lipid A molecule is phosphorylated at positions 1 and 4′ and is acylated with R-3-hydroxymyristate in ester linkage at positions 3 and 3′ and in amide linkage at positions 2 and 2′ (Fig. 1). Attachment at position 6′ of two 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) sugars, which belong to the inner-most region of the inner core, is followed by secondary acylation reactions to create the so-called acyloxyacyl linkages. Attachment of laurate at position 2′ is usually followed by attachment of myristate at position 3′, which is catalyzed by the myristoyltransferase MsbB (LpxM) (10Clementz T. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Each of these enzymatic reactions takes advantage of cytoplasmic energy-rich biosynthetic precursors (7Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). The waa (rfa) operons encode cytoplasmic enzymes needed for the stepwise assembly of any one of the five known core oligosaccharides (K-12 and R1-R4) that can exist in E. coli. Although ∼170 distinct O-antigens have been identified in E. coli alone, they are all assembled on the lipid carrier analog of dolichol phosphate known as bactoprenol phosphate. Translocation of the lipid A-core and bactoprenol diphosphate-O-antigen to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane can be followed by polymerization of the O-antigen polysaccharide with its subsequent en bloc ligation to the outer core. At this periplasmic stage, several regulated partial modifications can occur on both lipid A and the inner core and include the addition of phosphoethanolamine (PEtN), derived from phosphatidylethanolamine, and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N), derived from bactoprenol phosphate-l-Ara4N (11Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). These modifications provide resistance to polymyxin B and can be induced by mildly acidic growth conditions, antimicrobial peptides, or Mg2+ limitation, which together activate the PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB two-component signal transduction pathways (12Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 13Bader M.W. Sanowar S. Daley M.E. Schneider A.R. Cho U. Xu W. Klevit R.E. Le Moual H. Miller S.I. Cell. 2005; 122: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). E. coli K-12 strains generally synthesize rough LPS lacking O-antigen polysaccharide unless certain genetic factors are exogenously provided (14Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast, smooth LPS with attached O157 polysaccharide is synthesized in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7. This most common serotype of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli is associated with hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans (15Tarr P.I. Gordon C.A. Chandler W.L. Lancet. 2005; 365: 1073-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). The core oligosaccharide of E. coli O157:H7 is of the R3 type, which is distinctly different from K-12 in the outer core regions (16Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The lipid A and inner core structures of the R3 and K-12 LPS are largely identical, with the exception of a few important differences that can be attributed to enzymes encoded in the plasmid pO157 shf locus. The conserved inner core includes, in addition to the two Kdo units, three units of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose (Hep), which can be modified with phosphate and/or PEtN moieties at key positions (Fig. 1). A defining feature of the R3 inner core is the partial modification of HepIII by an α-1,7-linked GlcNAc unit, which is controlled by the shf locus-encoded glycosyltransferase WabB (16Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Additionally, under normal laboratory growth conditions, where the corresponding enzymes of E. coli K-12 are found to be latent (17Gibbons H.S. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), E. coli O157:H7 introduces significant amounts of PEtN into the lipid A phosphate groups (18Kim S.H. Jia W. Parreira V.R. Bishop R.E. Gyles C.L. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, E. coli O157:H7 possesses two homologues of the msbB gene: msbB1 encoded on the chromosome, which is equivalent to the single msbB gene of E. coli K-12, and msbB2 encoded on the shf locus. Both msbB orthologues must be inactivated to create a myristate deficiency in the lipid A of E. coli O157:H7, and this is associated with reduced virulence (19Kim S.H. Jia W. Bishop R.E. Gyles C. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as similarly occurs in msbB-deficient Shigella flexneri (20D'Hauteville H. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Kussak A. Weintraub A. Mathison J. Ulevitch R.J. Wuscher N. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5240-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The only ascribed function for the single msbB2 gene is in the persistence of E. coli O157:H7 in its agricultural and bovine reservoirs (21Yoon J.W. Lim J.Y. Park Y.H. Hovde C.J. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2367-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The entire LPS structure is transported across the periplasmic space and delivered to the OM external leaflet, where lipid A can be further modified (11Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). PagP is the only known OM enzyme of LPS biosynthesis in E. coli, and it is controlled by PhoP/PhoQ (22Bishop R.E.

PagP acylates the lipid A position 2 R-3-hydroxymyristate chain with a phospholipid-derived palmitoyl group (23Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R.

PagP structure and dynamics demonstrate that the palmitate recognition pocket, known as the hydrocarbon ruler, is only accessible from the OM external leaflet and, thus, requires aberrant translocation of phospholipids into the external leaflet (30Ahn V.E.

Indeed, PagP remains dormant in the OM until perturbations to lipid asymmetry, which compromise the OM permeability barrier, directly trigger PagP activity (33Jia W. Zoeiby A.E. Petruzziello T.N.

PagP has been proposed to function as a sentinel that can be activated by a breach in the OM permeability barrier (34Bishop R.E. Biochim. Biophys.

We now demonstrate that a lipid A myristoylation mutant of enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157: H7, but not a similar mutant from E. coli K-12, necessarily triggers PagP activity in the OM to exert control on cytoplasmic enzymes that determine its characteristic R3 core oligosaccharide structure. PagP sensory transduction is not controlled by its cell surface catalytic machinery but depends instead on its periplasmic amphipathic α-helix.

High fidelity PCR was performed with a proofreading DNA polymerase (Advantage-HF2 PCR kit; BD Biosciences Clontech). Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and dNTP were obtained from Fermentas. Bacto MacConkey agar was obtained from Difco. All other materials were obtained from commercial sources. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions–The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1. Cells were generally grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. Antibiotics were added when necessary at final concentrations of 12 μg/ml for tetracycline, 20 μg/ml for chloramphenicol and gentamycin (Gm), 100 μg/ml for ampicillin (Ap), and streptomycin (Str), and 40 μg/ml for kanamycin. Antibiotic concentrations were reduced by a factor of 10 during selection of the hypersensitive E. coli O157:H7 strain 4303-TM. Single colonies were inoculated from plates into 5 ml of liquid medium and grown at 37 °C overnight to stationary phase. A 1% inoculum was then subcultured into the same medium and allowed to resume growth at 37 °C. Cultures were adjusted with EDTA using a stock solution of 250 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, which had been sterilized by using a 0.2-μm filter.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains/plasmidsDescriptionaAbbreviated descriptions used in some figures are included in square brackets.SourceE. coli O157:H74304Wild type (phage-type 14), (Strr)Ref. 19Kim S.H.

Open table in a new tab DNA Manipulations–Restriction enzyme digestions, ligations, transformations, and DNA electrophoresis were performed as described (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used for DNA sequencing and PCR gene amplification were manufactured by Invitrogen. Purification of plasmids, PCR products, and restriction fragments was performed with the QIAprep, QIAquick, and QIAEX II kits, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was purified using the Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed at the ACGT Corp. sequencing facility (Toronto, Canada). Mutant Constructions–An allelic exchange method was employed for creation of a pagP::aacC1 mutation in the double msbB mutant (4304-DM) of E. coli O157:H7 strain 4304 (Table 1). In brief, the pagP gene was amplified from wild type strain 4304 by PCR with primers CrcA (forward, ATGAGCTCAGGTTGACGATA) and CrcR (reverse, TTGAATTCTTGCTGACGTATC) to yield a 1.3-kb product. The amplicon was cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and the recombinant plasmid (pCrcAT) was digested with KpnI, which cuts a single site near the middle of the pagP gene. For insertion of the nonpolar Gm-cassette, the KpnI fragment containing the aacC1 gene was purified from pUCGM carrying the aacC1 gene in the multiple cloning site. The plasmid resulting from ligation of the aacC1 gene into pCrcAT was used as template DNA for a high fidelity PCR with proofreading DNA polymerase and the primer pair CrcA and CrcR. The 2.1-kb amplicon was purified for blunt end ligation with the pRE107 vector digested with SmaI. The resulting suicide vector construct was named pR7Crc-Gm. The SM10 donor E. coli was transformed with the pR7Crc-Gm plasmid harboring the mutated (pagP::aacC1) allele. Strain SM10 (pR7Crc-Gm) was mated with 4304-DM and incubated at 37 °C overnight on blood agar plates. This mating procedure was subsequently repeated using the wild-type strain 4304 to generate a single pagP:aacC1 mutant. The exconjugants were selected on LB agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics (StrR + GmR). The resulting exconjugants were spread on LB agar plates containing 7% sucrose and Gm and incubated at 30 °C in order to select isolates that had undergone a double crossover. A few selected colonies were purified, and the potential pagP::aacC1 mutants (Gmr and Aps) were tested by PCR for confirmation of the mutated allele. The primer pair of CrcA and CrcR was used for amplification of the pagP::aacC1 allele from the mutants. The expected size (2.1 kb) of the amplicon in the mutants was compared with that of the wild type pagP gene (1.3 kb) by 1% agarose-gel electrophoresis. The resulting pagP::aacC1 mutant of E. coli 4304-DM was named 4304-TM, whereas that of E. coli 4304 was named 4304-PM (Table 1). The msbB::Tn5 allele in the E. coli K-12 donor strain BMS67C12 was transferred by P1 transduction to the E. coli K-12 strain WJ0124 to create strain SK1061 (Table 1). A temperature-sensitive P1 cmr-100 lysate of BMS67C12 (36Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. Infect Immun. 1999; 67: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared as described elsewhere (18Kim S.H. Jia W. Parreira V.R. Bishop R.E. Gyles C.L. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and then mixed with E. coli WJ0124. The resulting msbB::Tn5 mutant of WJ0124 was verified by PCR. Analysis of Lipid A by TLC–Analysis of lipid A compositional profiles was done by TLC separation of 32P-labeled lipid A species released from a mild acid hydrolysis procedure, applied to bacteria cultured with or without EDTA treatment (33Jia W.

LPS Preparation and SDS-PAGE Analysis–LPS was prepared on a small scale from SDS-proteinase K-treated whole cell lysates (38Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Large scale LPS preparations were made by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether extraction procedure as described elsewhere (39Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The LPS was then separated on a 16% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) and was visualized by silver staining (40Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar). PAGE conditions were adjusted as recommended by the manufacturer. NMR Spectroscopy–NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C in D2O on a Varian UNITY INOVA 500 instrument, using acetone as a reference for proton (2.225 ppm) and carbon (31.5 ppm) spectra. Varian standard programs for COSY, NOESY (mixing time of 400 ms), TOCSY (spin lock time, 120 ms), HSQC, and gHMBC (long range transfer delay, 100 ms) were used. Isolation of the Core Oligosaccharide–LPS (30 mg) was hydrolyzed with 2% acetic acid (3 h, 100 °C). Lipid was removed by centrifugation, and soluble products were separated by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50 to yield core oligosaccharide (15 mg) and a low molecular mass fraction. The core was additionally purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Hitrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) using a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m over 1 h, and the major acidic core fraction was desalted by gel chromatography. Hydrazine O-Deacylation of the LPS–LPS (20 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous hydrazine (1 ml) and kept at 60 °C for 1 h, cooled, and poured into acetone (50 ml). Precipitate was collected, washed with acetone, dissolved in water, and freeze-dried to give O-deacylated LPS (12 mg). Monosaccharide Analysis–Hydrolysis was performed with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (110 °C, 3h), and monosaccharides were conventionally converted into alditol acetates and analyzed by gas chromatography on an Agilent 6850 chromatograph equipped with a DB-17 (30 × 0.25 mm) fused silica column using a temperature gradient from 180 °C (2 min) to 240 °C at 2 °C/min. Mass Spectrometry–Electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry spectra were obtained using a Micromass Quattro spectrometer in 50% acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid at a flow rate of 15 μl/min with direct injection. A 5-kV electrospray ionization voltage was used. Immunoblotting–The LPS samples of 4304, DM (msbB1/msbB2), and DM (pBAD-B2) were resolved by 16% Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in standard Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 buffer. Anti-O157 rabbit serum (Difco) and anti-rabbit IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. For chemiluminescent detection, the ECL detection kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of Plasmids for Phenotypic Complementation–The waaG gene of E. coli O157:H7 was amplified by PCR using 4304-WT genomic DNA and the two primers called WG24-Kpn (forward, GACAGGTACGTCGTTATGGTACCTGCTTTTTG) (where underlined italics identify restriction sites) and WG24-H3 (reverse, CTTTACCGCGCCAAAGCTTGGCAAACGGCTC) and then cloned into an arabinose-inducible pBAD24 expression vector digested with KpnI and HindIII. The insertion was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the construct was named pWG24. Also, the galU gene of E. coli O157:H7 was amplified by PCR using 4304-WT genomic DNA and the two primers called GalU-H3 (forward, TGCATTACAAGCTTATGTCGGCTGG) and GalU-Sal (reverse, GTCGATTGGTCGACGCCGTTTCGTG). The 1.1-kb amplicon, including the endogenous promoter region, was digested with HindIII and SalI and inserted into pACYC184 digested with the same restriction enzymes, and the resulting plasmid was named pGU184. The pagP gene of E. coli O157:H7 was amplified by a high fidelity PCR using genomic DNA and the two primers called Pag24-Kpn (forward, TGGTCACQAAATGGTACCGAGTAAATATGTCG) and Pag24-H3 (reverse, GAAGTTACTAAAGCTTCATTTGTCTCAA). The ∼600-bp amplicon was digested with KpnI and HindIII and cloned into an arabinose-inducible pBAD24 expression vector digested with KpnI and HindIII.

https://openalex.org/W2083148705,"Through its interactions with proteins and proteoglycans, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) functions at the interface of the cell membrane and the extracellular matrix to regulate matrix structure and cellular phenotype. We have previously determined the structure of the high affinity heparin-binding domain of TSP-1, designated TSPN-1, in association with the synthetic heparin, Arixtra. To establish that the binding of TSPN-1 to Arixtra is representative of the association with naturally occurring heparins, we have determined the structures of TSPN-1 in complex with heparin oligosaccharides containing eight (dp8) and ten (dp10) subunits, by x-ray crystallography. We have found that dp8 and dp10 bind to TSPN-1 in a manner similar to Arixtra and that dp8 and dp10 induce the formation of trans and cis TSPN-1 dimers, respectively. In silico docking calculations partnered with our crystal structures support the importance of arginine residues in positions 29, 42, and 77 in binding sulfate groups of the dp8 and dp10 forms of heparin. The ability of several TSPN-1 domains to bind to glycosaminoglycans simultaneously probably increases the affinity of binding through multivalent interactions. The formation of cis and trans dimers of the TSPN-1 domain with relatively short segments of heparin further enhances the ability of TSP-1 to participate in high affinity binding to glycosaminoglycans. Dimer formation may also involve TSPN-1 domains from two separate TSP-1 molecules. This association would enable glycosaminoglycans to cluster TSP-1.

Through its interactions with proteins and proteoglycans, TSP-1 functions at the interface of the cell membrane and the extracellular matrix to regulate matrix structure and cellular behavior. The N-terminal domain of TSP-1 (TSPN-1) plays an integral role in the interaction of TSP-1 with other secreted and transmembrane proteins (1Bornstein P. Agah A. Kyriakides T.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 2Chen H. Herndon M.E. Lawler J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 597-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). TSPN-1 contains binding sites for 1) glycosaminoglycans, 2) low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1, 3) various integrins, 4) calreticulin, and 5) fibrinogen (2Chen H. Herndon M.E. Lawler J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 597-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). β1 integrins that contain the α3, α4, α6, and α9 subunits have all been reported to interact with TSPN-1 (3Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Krutzsch H.C. Yurchenco P.D. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40679-40687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Calzada M.J.

Hemost. 2004; 30: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The glycosaminoglycan-binding site is involved in the association of TSP-1 with syndecan-1, -3, and -4, perlecan, decorin, and other proteoglycans (7Elzie C.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1090-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In some cases, the TSPN-1 domain may also interact with the core protein (8Winnemoller M. Schon P. Vischer P. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar). TSPN-1 has been shown to be required for the uptake of TSP-1 through a mechanism that involves proteoglycans and lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (9Wang S. Herndon M.E. Ranganathan S. Godyna S. Lawler J. Argraves W.S. Liau G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 766-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because proteins, such as matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, bind to TSP-1, it is possible that they are taken up along with this protein (1Bornstein P. Agah A. Kyriakides T.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Greenaway J. Lawler J. Moorehead R. Bornstein P. Lamarre J. Petrik J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 210: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial cell growth factor levels by this mechanism can affect angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. The domains of TSP-1 also have direct effects on endothelial cell migration and apoptosis (11Lawler J. Detmar M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whereas the type 1 repeats of TSP-1 are potent inhibitors of angiogenesis, TSPN-1 stimulates angiogenesis (12Ferrari do Outeiro-Bernstein M.A. Nunes S.S. Andrade A.C. Alves T.R. Legrand C. Morandi V. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Taraboletti G. Morbidelli L. Donnini S. Parenti A. Granger H.J. Giavazzi R. Ziche M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1674-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell tube formation, an in vitro model of angiogenesis, is stimulated by TSPN-1. This effect is mediated by the proteoglycan syndecan-4 (12Ferrari do Outeiro-Bernstein M.A. Nunes S.S. Andrade A.C. Alves T.R. Legrand C. Morandi V. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TSPN-1 also stimulates angiogenesis through integrin engagement. Immobilized TSPN-1 promotes endothelial cell proliferation and survival through α4β1 (4Calzada M.J. Zhou L. Sipes J.M. Zhang J. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides have been used to map the α4β1 binding site to a loop that follows the β12 strand of TSPN-1 (4Calzada M.J. Zhou L. Sipes J.M. Zhang J. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The α9β1 integrin on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells also binds TSPN-1 (14Staniszewska I. Zaveri S. Del Valle L. Oliva I. Rothman V.L. Croul S.E. Roberts D.D. Mosher D.F. Tuszynski G.P.

This interaction reportedly stimulates cell proliferation and migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. thrombospondin-1 N-terminal domain of TSP-1 heparin oligosaccharide containing eight subunits heparin oligosaccharide containing ten subunits root mean square deviation acidic fibroblast growth factor. We have previously reported the structures of TSPN-1 and TSPN-1 in complex with Arixtra, a synthetic pentameric heparin (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). From these structures, we have defined a major heparin-binding site on the base of the TSPN-1 globular β sandwich domain and observed that the sulfate groups of Arixtra bind to residues Arg-29, Arg-42, and Arg-77, but its polysaccharide chain was largely disordered. The fact that the Arixtra is partially disordered in the complex structure may suggest that the binding of the synthetic small heparin species to TSPN-1 is not well specified. The major TSPN-1·Arixtra associations seem to be from ionic interactions between heparin's sulfate groups and TSPN-1's positively charged residues in the heparin binding site, while the more specific hydrogen bonds between TSPN-1 and the backbone of the Arixtra molecule are not observed and/or are largely missing. The longest dimension of TSPN-1's heparin-binding site is close to the length of a pentasaccharide (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the minimum size (tetrasaccharide) of heparin that can bind to TSPN-1. The affinity of TSPN-1 for heparin increases with the length of the oligosaccharide up to a decasaccharide (16Mulatero C. Lyon M. Lawler J. Jayson G. Gallagher J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Can. Res. 2003; 44: 1430Google Scholar, 17Yu H. Tyrrell D. Cashel J. Guo N. Vogel T. Sipes J.M. Lam L. Fillit H.M. Hartman J. Mendelovitz S. Panel A. Roberts D.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In our early studies, we also discovered a long flexible linker (∼35 residues) between the TSPN-1 domain and the helical region that is involved in trimer formation (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This structure raises the possibility that the three TSPN-1 domains within one TSP-1 molecule, leashed by their long flexible linkers, can bind ligands either independently or cooperatively. Compared with the TSPN-1 domain alone, an intact TSP-1 molecule reportedly binds to heparin with a 20-fold higher affinity, suggesting multivalent interaction of trimeric TSP-1 to heparin (9Wang S. Herndon M.E. Ranganathan S. Godyna S. Lawler J. Argraves W.S. Liau G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 766-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Herndon M.E. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, we introduced a fractionated heparin species containing eight (dp8) or ten (dp10) monosaccharides into our co-crystallization experiments. Here we report two structures of TSPN-1 in complex with these fractionated heparins. These crystal complexes, which reveal two distinct dimeric binding modes for TSPN-1 bound to these heparin species, have been further supported by extensive in silico docking calculations that provide quantitative estimates of these binding interactions. We have also compared these complexes to another native TSPN-1 structure to demonstrate that it is the presence of the dp8 and dp10 heparin species that leads to the formation of these dimeric binding modes. Preparation of Recombinant TSPN-1–A recombinant version of the TSPN-1 (amino acids 1–240 of human TSP-1) was prepared as described previously (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Limited digestion with α-chymotrypsin (1:200 w/w) was performed with intact TSPN-1 for 20 h at 0 °C and was stopped by adding 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The principal proteolytic fragment was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography or heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Mass spectral analysis indicates that the proteolysis occurs between residues Cys-214 and Asn-230, resulting in the loss of the N-linked glycan that is attached to Asn-230, and the polyhistidine tail. This proteolysis appears to be necessary for crystallization on TSPN-1 (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography in protein buffer of 200 mm NaCl and 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.8. Size Exclusion Chromatography–Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl) and calibrated with pre-mixed protein standards, including myoglobulin (17,000 Da) and ovalbumin (44,000 Da). TSPN-1 (final volume of 200 μl) was applied to the column in the absence of dp10 or after mixing TSPN-1 (6 mg/ml, ∼0.31 mm) and dp10 (2.9 mm) in a 1:1 molar ratio at 4°C. The chromatography was carried out at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The calibration curve of Kav versus log molecular weight was prepared using the equation Kav = (Ve – Vo)/(Vt – Vo), where Ve = elution volume for the protein, Vo = column void volume, and Vt = total bed volume. Crystallization–The purified protein was concentrated to ∼10–15 mg/ml for crystallization with the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. Native protein crystals grew from buffer containing 30% polyethylene glycol 1500 and 0.08 m sodium acetate at pH 4.6. The same crystallization buffer was also used for the co-crystallization with heparins as discussed below. The majority of native crystals from the α-chymotryptic degradation product of the TSPN-1 construct were thin plates with the space group of P1 (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The preparation of heparin oligosaccharides containing eight (dp8) and ten (dp10) subunits by heparinase treatment of low molecular weight heparin is described elsewhere (19Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For TSPN-1 and fractionated heparin complexes, the digested TSPN-1 was used for co-crystallization with dp8 and dp10 with a molar ration of 1:2. The TSPN-1·dp8 co-crystal is chunky and has a trapezoid-like shape while TSPN-1·dp10 crystal has a well defined long tetragon-like shape with pointed tips at both ends. In this report, we describe the stable TSPN-1·dp8 and TSPN-1·dp10 complex structures and the TSPN-1 native P1 form structure. Data Collection–Diffraction data sets were collected from pre-frozen crystals at 100 K at the 19ID beamline of the Structure Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. All diffraction data sets were processed and reduced using the HKL2000 suite (Table 1) (20Otwinowski Z.M.W. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement–Both TSPN-1·dp10 and TSPN-1·dp8 co-crystal structures, as well as the native structure in P1 form, were solved using the refined TSPN-1 structure (PDB code: 1Z78) as the search model with the program Molrep in the CCP4 suite (21P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The model rebuilding and final refinement of the structure were done using the programs O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), respectively (Table 1). In the TSPN-1·dp10 complex structure, several sulfate groups were built into bulky densities associated with the major heparin-binding site as discussed under “Results.” Because O-sulfate and N-sulfate groups of these fractionated heparins are indistinguishable in the structure for the partially disordered molecule, all of them were modeled as O-sulfate groups and designated SO groups. In the final native TSPN-1 model, we observed broken or poorly resolved densities that had been described previously for the first native TSPN-1 structure (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the complexes TSPN-1·dp10 and TSPN-1·dp8 and the native TSPN-1 in P1 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the access codes 2OUH, 2OUJ, and 2ES3, respectively. Docking–To further evaluate the binding mode and interaction interface between TSPN-1 and the two fractionated heparin oligomers dp8 and dp10, we carried out in silico docking calculations using AutoDock4 (24Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). TSPN-1 structures from their co-crystallized complexes with heparin ligands dp8 and dp10 were used as the starting coordinates for our docking calculations. The heparins dp8 and dp10 were constructed from known heparin structures that are deposited in the PDB; prior to their use in our docking studies, they were corrected for bond order and orientation, and the refined models were then protonated. Dp8 and dp10 were subsequently energy minimized using a standard Tripos force field that employs Powellminimization and simplex optimization with a distance-dependent dielectric function and an energy gradient of 0.05 kcal/molÅ. AutoDock-Tool 1.4.5 was then used to compute the Gasteiger atomic charges followed by a merge of all nonpolar hydrogens such that the charge of these hydrogens were assigned to the atom to which they are directly bonded (25Bitomsky W. Wade R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3004-3013Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Huey R. Morris G.M. Olson A.J. Goodsell D.S. J. Comput. Chem. 2007; 28: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). To evaluate the structure of the TSPN-1 heparin complexes, we have used grid dimensions of 60 Å × 72 Å × 60 Å for both dp8 and dp10 in complex with TSPN-1. Docking grid maps were calculated using Autogrid4. The grid spacing for the dp8 TSPN-1 complex structure was 0.708 Å, and for the dp10 TSPN-1 complex structure, it was 0.802 Å. The interface of each TSPN-1 dimer complex was selected as the grid center for both the dp8 and dp10 TSPN-1 complexes. AutoDock4 uses a standard Lamarckian genetic algorithm that couples a typical Darwinian genetic algorithm for global searching and the Solis and Wets algorithm for local searching for this docking protocol. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm parameters used for the present docking study of both dp8 and dp10 heparin oligomers docked to the TSPN-1 dimer structure were as follows: the initial population of 50 randomly placed individuals, a maximum number of 25 × 105 energy evaluations or a maximum number of 27,000 generations, a mutation rate of 0.02, a crossover ratio of 0.80; an elitism value of 1, probability of performing local search on an individual was set to a frequency of 0.06, a maximum number of consecutive success or failures before doubling or halving the local search step size was 4, and a maximum of 800 iterations per local search. For each of the TSPN-1 complexes we calculated 20 independent docking runs, and only the lowest energy confirmation is presented. TSPN1·dp10 Co-crystal Structure–The fractionated heparin dp10 was co-crystallized with TSPN-1 under the condition of 30% polyethylene glycol 1500, 0.08 m sodium acetate at pH 4.6. The TSPN-1·dp10 co-crystal is in the space group of P212121 (Table 1), the same as the previously reported co-crystal of TSPN-1·Arixtra (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The unit cell dimension along the c axis of the TSPN-1·dp10 co-crystal is more than double that of TSPN-1·Arixtra co-crystal (Table 1). As a consequence, there are two TSPN-1 domains related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis almost perpendicular to the c-axis in each asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). There are no major structural variations between the two TSPN-1 domains or between them and the structure we reported earlier (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The two TSPN-1 domains can be superimposed on each other with an r.m.s.d. as low as 0.3 Å. Structural variation were only observed in a few loop regions, primarily the α1_β2 loop (G20AARKGSG) that is generally very flexible. The two TSPN-1 domains have a small hydrophobic interface that is mainly composed of residues from the β2_β3 loop of TSPN-1, including residues Leu-30, Pro-36, Ser-37, and Pro-39 (Fig. 1). With the exception of a few water molecule bridges, there are no specific hydrogen bonds that are well defined by the observed electron densities between the two domains. The buried surface area resulting from the contact is ∼632 Å2, much less than the value of 1600 ± 400 Å2 that is generally believed to be of physiological significance (27Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Thus, the small hydrophobic interface between these two TSPN-1 domains seems to be insufficient to lead to dimer formation. The two TSPN-1 domains are orientated in such a way that their major heparin binding sites are aligned to form an extended positively charged patch of ∼20 × 60 Å2 (Fig. 1B). The electric dipole of the two TSPN-1 domains is located between two molecules, along the pseudo-2-fold axis and perpendicular to the positively charged patch. The dipole moment is calculated to be 235.6 Angstrom electron charge units (28Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The potential distribution and dipole moment orientation could help guide the approaching and eventual binding of negatively charged heparin molecules onto the extended heparin binding site (29De Pascalis A.R. Jelesarov I. Ackermann F. Koppenol W.H. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Bosshard H.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Koppenol W.H. Biophys. J. 1980; 29: 493-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). From TSPN-1 packing in the crystal, the space next to its positively charged patch has enough room to accommodate a heparin molecule, such as dp10. Extra electron densities, mostly in the form of large globular shapes, are observed around the positively charged patch, especially associated with the residue Arg-42, but also with Arg-29 and Arg-77 from both TSPN-1 domains (Fig. 1C). A sole continuing density is found around the Arg-42 of one of the domains, designated as TSPN-1A in Fig. 1A. These densities can't be interpreted as solvent molecules. Some bulky electron densities are located in the positions marked with yellow crosses in Fig. 1B. These uncharacterized densities are very similar to those observed in the TSPN-1·Arixtra complex crystal structure where they are interpreted to be sulfate groups from the partially disordered pentameric oligosaccharide, Arixtra (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both Arg-42 and Arg-29 seem to play an important role in the interaction of TSPN-1 with dp10 or Arixtra. In the TSPN-1·Arixtra complex, there are three bulky electron densities associated with Arg-42 that were interpreted to be from the sulfate groups of Arixtra (15Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. Structure. 2006; 14: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the TSPN-1·dp10 complex, there are only two of these bulky electron densities associated with Arg-42. The association of these bulky densities with the arginines within the heparin-binding sites of both of the TSPN-1 domains suggests that each domain is interacting with dp10. Because two TSPN-1s bind the heparin on the same side, we call this binding mode the cis-dimer binding mode. The lack of well defined electron densities for dp10, especially the heparin backbone of dp10, could be due to the presence of multiple heparin binding modes, partial disordering, and/or chemical heterogeneity of the heparin species being studied. Like the TSPN-1·Arixtra complex structure, the flexibility of the carbohydrate backbone causes partial disorder that results in the presence of only “gluing atoms” (i.e. sulfate groups) within the densities. Moreover, because dp10 is almost twice as long as the positively charged patch of TSPN-1, it is likely that two TSPN-1 domains within a cis-dimer bind one heparin (a molar ratio of 2:1) with the heparin having two possible orientations that are anti-parallel to one another. These two orientations of the heparin may further explain why there is no continuous electron density for the heparin molecule's backbone. The proposal that a single dp10 binds two TSPN-1 molecules is further supported by the fact that the hydrophobic interface between the two TSPN-1 molecules is too small to support dimer formation, as discussed above. In this proposed 2-to-1 binding model, it is the protein (two TSPN-1 domains) binding to heparin (one dp10) that provides the major “gluing” force of the TSPN-1 dimerization. Two TSPN-1 domains properly align themselves so that they (1Bornstein P. Agah A. Kyriakides T.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) create a small hydrophobic interface to provide additional binding energy, (2Chen H. Herndon M.E. Lawler J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 597-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) maximize the interface for their binding to dp10, and (3Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Krutzsch H.C. Yurchenco P.D. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40679-40687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) create a combined dipole perpendicular to the extended positively charged patch to facilitate heparin binding. We have used size exclusion chromatography to determine whether or not dimerization of TSPN-1 occurs in solution. In the absence of dp10, TSPN-1 is eluted as a single sharp peak with an apparent molecular weight of 17,690 (in comparison to 23,630 predicted from the sequence). Preincubation of TSPN-1 with dp10 results in a shift in the apparent molecular weight of the peak to 26,600 (data not shown). Because the molecular weight of dp10 (excluding sodium ions) is ∼2,870, the shift of the elution volume of the TSPN-1 in the presence of dp10 can't be simply attributed to the addition of the heparin to monomeric TSPN-1. The mixture TSPN-1 with the pentameric heparin Arixtra did not cause any significant shift of elution peak. 5K. Tan, J.-H. Wang, and J. Lawler, unpublished data. The protein peak eluted in the presence of dp10 is significantly broader than the one that is observed in its absence, suggesting a stat"
https://openalex.org/W2001213207,"Changes in near UV circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectra of site-specifically placed pairs of 2-aminopurine residues have been used to probe the roles of the RNA hairpin and the RNA-DNA hybrid in controlling intrinsic termination of transcription. Functional transcription complexes were assembled directly by mixing preformed nucleic acid scaffolds of defined sequence with T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP). Scaffolds containing RNA hairpins immediately upstream of a GC-rich hybrid formed complexes of reduced stability, whereas the same hairpins adjacent to a hybrid of rU-dA base pairs triggered complex dissociation and transcript release. 2-Aminopurine probes at the upstream ends of the hairpin stems show that the hairpins open on RNAP binding and that stem re-formation begins after one or two RNA bases on the downstream side of the stem have emerged from the RNAP exit tunnel. Hairpins directly adjacent to the RNA-DNA hybrid weaken RNAP binding, decrease elongation efficiency, and disrupt the upstream end of the hybrid as well as interfere with the movement of the template base at the RNAP active site. Probing the edges of the DNA transcription bubble demonstrates that termination hairpins prevent translocation of the RNAP, suggesting that they transiently ""lock"" the polymerase to the nucleic acid scaffold and, thus, hold the RNA-DNA hybrid ""in frame."" At intrinsic terminators the weak rU-dA hybrid and the adjacent termination hairpin combine to destabilize the elongation complex sufficiently to permit significant transcript release, whereas hairpin-dependent pausing provides time for the process to go to completion."

We recently demonstrated that MTHFR can be up-regulated by NF-κB, an important mediator of cell survival that is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This observation, coupled with the reports that homocysteine can induce ER stress, prompted us to examine the possible regulation of MTHFR by ER stress.

The induction of MTHFR was also observed after overexpression of inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of IRE1. Because IRE1 triggers c-Jun signaling, we examined the possible involvement of c-Jun in up-regulation of MTHFR. Transfection of c-Jun and two activators of c-Jun (LiCl and sodium valproate) increased MTHFR expression, whereas a reported inhibitor of c-Jun (SP600125) and a dominant-negative derivative of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 reduced MTHFR activation. We conclude that ER stress increases MTHFR expression and that IRE1 and c-Jun mediate this activation.

Numerous xenotoxic agents and adverse metabolic conditions interfere with protein folding in the ER leading to cellular stresses, known collectively as ER stress. For example, tunicamycin blocks N-glycosylation and leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Thapsigargin inhibits the ER Ca2+-ATPase and is also a very potent ER stress inducer. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 influences stress through depletion of Ca2+ stores in the ER. These chemicals, the most widely used agents to experimentally induce ER stress, activate a complex signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR represents a set of signaling cascades by which conditions within the ER are communicated to the protein translation machinery (to decrease ribosome activity and promote degradation of mRNAs for ER proteins) and to the nucleus (through transcription factors) to balance the folding capacity of the ER with the protein processing demand (1Boyce M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2Hollien J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2006; 313: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Three ER-resident trans-membrane proteins, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), pancreatic ER stress kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) have been identified as proximal sensors of ER stress (1Boyce M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Activation of these transducers/transcription factors results in the up-regulation of genes encoding ER chaperone proteins such as GRP78 that facilitate protein folding and reduce protein aggregation. The UPR also affects proteins that are not directly involved in ER function but have a role in cell survival after exposure to ER stress.

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a thiol-containing amino acid generated by demethylation of methionine. Hcy can inhibit the biosynthesis of proteins normally secreted by some cells; this has been attributed to ER retention of proteins (3Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The molecular targeting hypothesis for Hcy-induced damage (4Jacobsen D.W. Catanescu O. Dibello P.M. Barbato J.C. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2005; 43: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggests that Hcy can form stable disulfide bonds with cysteine residues in proteins, thereby altering specific cellular processes and pathways. In vitro studies have provided experimental evidence for the effect of Hcy on expression of ER stress response genes (5Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J. Weitz J.I.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a critical enzyme in Hcy metabolism. MTHFR catalyzes the reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This reaction is the only source of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which serves as the methyl donor in the remethylation of Hcy to methionine. MTHFR first received medical recognition in reports of patients with homocystinuria (OMIM number 236250), an inborn error of metabolism that can be caused by deleterious mutations in the MTHFR gene (7Leclerc D. Rozen R. Ueland P.M. Rozen R.R. MTHFR Polymorphisms and Disease. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 1-20Google Scholar). However, considerably greater interest has been generated in MTHFR through our identification of a common variant, 677Cys → Thr (A222V) (8Frosst P. Blom H.J. Milos R. Goyette P. Sheppard C.A.

This variant may also increase risk for certain neoplasias, although it lowers the risk of colorectal cancer when folate status is adequate. MTHFR may influence disease through elevation of plasma homocysteine, disruption in methionine or S-adenosylmethionine synthesis or altered distribution of folate metabolites with consequent effects on nucleotide synthesis (9Ueland P.M. Rozen R.R. Ueland P.M. Rozen R.R. MTHFR Polymorphisms and Disease. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005Google Scholar). Mthfr knock-out mice have an elevation of plasma Hcy, a decrease of S-adenosylmethionine and DNA methylation, and altered folate distributions (10Chen Z. Karaplis A.C. Ackerman S.L. Pogribny I.P. Melnyk S. Lussier-Cacan S. Chen M.F. Pai A. John S.W. Smith R.S. Bottiglieri T. Bagley P. Selhub J. Rudnicki M.A. James S.J. Rozen R. Hum. Mol.

The cerebellar pathology in Mthfr–/– mice is associated with increased apoptosis (12Chen Z. Schwahn B.C. Wu Q. He X. Rozen R. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2005; 23: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Studies on MTHFR regulation are few in number. S-Adenosylmethionine is an allosteric regulator of MTHFR and the post-translational modification of MTHFR by phosphorylation leads to decreased activity and increased sensitivity of the enzyme to S-adenosylmethionine (13Yamada K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MTHFR has been demonstrated for the smaller MTHFR iso-form (70 kDa); phosphorylation of the larger isoform (77 kDa) has not been examined (13Yamada K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We recently characterized 2 promoters for MTHFR, each of which may direct the synthesis of one of the two isoforms through different transcriptional start site clusters and alternative splicing (14Pickell L. Tran P. Leclerc D. Hiscott J. Rozen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that MTHFR expression was enhanced by NF-κB through an effect on the downstream promoter (14Pickell L. Tran P. Leclerc D. Hiscott J. Rozen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because NF-κBisan important modulator of cell survival that is activated by ER stress and because MTHFR is involved in several critical cellular pathways, we examined the possibility that MTHFR could also participate in the response to ER stress. Our findings suggest that MTHFR is up-regulated by ER stress and that this effect is mediated by IRE1 and c-Jun. This link between the ER stress pathway and a new regulatory mechanism for MTHFR supports an important role for this enzyme in cellular homeostasis or survival. Cell Culture Conditions and TransfectionNeuro-2a neuroblastoma cells and RAW264.7 macrophages were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum at 37 °C. For ER stress induction, the cells were grown to 70% confluence and treated with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, A23187, or dl-Hcy (all from Sigma) for the time and concentrations indicated under “Results.” LiCl was from Fisher Scientific (Nepean, Ontario) and valproic acid, pyrrolidinethiocarbamate (PDTC), Bay11-7082, lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli K-235, SP600125, dl-cysteine, and dl-methionine were from Sigma. Transfections were performed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All transfections were performed three times, in independent experiments, using different preparations of every tested plasmid. Overexpression of MTHFR IsoformsOverexpression of DNA constructs harboring the short or long isoforms of MTHFR was performed in E. coli, as previously described (15Tran P. Leclerc D. Chan M. Pai A. Hiou-Tim F. Wu Q. Goyette P. Artigas C. Milos R. Rozen R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The inserts were transferred into the pCMV vector and transiently expressed in Neuro-2a cells after transfection. Other PlasmidsVarious plasmids were kindly provided by investigators as indicated: mPERKWT9E10, mIRE1B, mIRE1B9E10, and mIRE1BdelC9E10 by Dr. David Ron, New York University School of Medicine, New York; pCGN-ATF6-(1–373) by Dr. Ron Prywes, Columbia University, New York; pcDNA3-Flag-JNK1(APF) by Dr. Roger J. Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; pRJB/CJUN by Dr. Jawed Alam, Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA; and pCMV-CJUN by Dr. Michael J. Birrer, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. RNA Purification and Real Time RT-PCRTotal RNA extraction from cultured cells and real-time RT-PCR were performed as previously described (14Pickell L. Tran P. Leclerc D. Hiscott J. Rozen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Supermix-UDG was from Invitrogen. Generation of single amplicons of the expected sizes was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and denaturation curves also confirmed amplification of unique products. Specificity of amplifications was verified by cloning and sequencing representative products. No significant amplification was observed with the use of “minus RT controls” (reverse transcriptase omitted during RT) as well as in “no template controls” (omission of cDNA). The amplicon signal for each target cDNA strongly correlated with serial dilution of template (r > 0.95). Oligonucleotides for quantitation of Mthfr, Nos2, and Gapdh were described in Pickell et al. (14Pickell L. Tran P. Leclerc D. Hiscott J. Rozen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For detection of Grp78, the PCR primers 5′-GGTTCTCACTAAAATGAAGGAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTACAGTAACAACTGCATGGGTAA-3′(antisense) were employed for amplification of a 74-bp specific segment. Data analysis and calculations were performed according to the Relative Quantitative Analysis method, using Gapdh as the normalizer target. The internal reference dye was ROX. All analyses were standard procedures of the MX4000 QPCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Analysis of Xbp1 mRNA ProcessingAn RT-PCR assay was designed for visualization of Xbp1 splicing, using primers 5′-AGTAAGGCTGGTGGCCGGGTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAGATGTTCTGGGGAGGTGACA-3′ (antisense), that span the relevant Xbp1 splice site. Products were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels. The unspliced form generated an amplicon of 100 bp and a fragment of 74 bp was observed for the processed mRNA. Heteroduplexes were also observed, as seen in a similar experimental design (16Back S.H. Schroder M. Lee K. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Methods. 2005; 35: 395-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Western BlottingCells were collected by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysis was performed in a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) in the presence of Complete Mini (pro-tease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science, Laval, Quebec). After incubation on ice for 30 min, lysates were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations assessed. Unless otherwise indicated, 50 μg of protein from each lysate was diluted with loading buffer, boiled, and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were electrophoresed and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. Relevant antigens were visualized after incubation with rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detection as previously described (15Tran P. Leclerc D. Chan M. Pai A. Hiou-Tim F. Wu Q. Goyette P. Artigas C. Milos R. Rozen R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To ensure reproducibility of observations, all Western blot experiments were performed at least twice, using extracts from independent experiments. Antibodies against GRP78, FLAG, and β-actin were from Sigma. Antibodies against eIF2α and phospho-eIF2α were kindly provided by Dr. Nahum Sonenberg, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec. Polyclonal antibody against MTHFR was previously described (15Tran P. Leclerc D. Chan M. Pai A. Hiou-Tim F. Wu Q. Goyette P. Artigas C. Milos R. Rozen R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). MTHFR Enzyme AssayCytosolic extracts and enzymatic assays were performed as in Tran et al. (15Tran P. Leclerc D. Chan M. Pai A. Hiou-Tim F. Wu Q. Goyette P. Artigas C. Milos R. Rozen R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Activities were measured in duplicate and less than 6% variation was observed between repeats. Up-regulation of Mthfr mRNA by ER StressTo determine whether several well documented ER stress inducers could alter expression of MTHFR, we treated Neuro-2a cells with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and A23187 (Fig. 1A). As positive controls, we assessed Grp78 (Fig. 1B) and Nos2 (Fig. 1C) mRNA levels. GRP78 is a chaperone protein that is a standard marker of the ER stress response, whereas Nos2 activation can be attributed to activation of NF-κB signaling, because it is abolished when BAY11-7082 (Fig. 1C) or PDTC (data not shown) are administered with tunicamycin. Mthfr, Grp78, and Nos2 mRNA levels were all increased following treatment by the 3 stressors. Bay11-7082 (or PDTC, not shown) did not inhibit the up-regulation of Grp78 and Mthfr mRNAs by tunicamycin (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that these 2 genes are activated by ER stress independently of NF-κB. Similar results were obtained when NF-κB inhibitors were combined with thapsigargin or A23187 instead of tunicamycin (data not shown). We performed the same types of experiments with RAW264.7 cells and reached the same conclusions (data not shown). In addition to Grp78 induction, Xbp1 mRNA processing confirmed the effectiveness of the ER stressors in our experimental system (Fig. 1D). Hcy Induces ER Stress and Increases Mthfr mRNA LevelsBecause Hcy adversely affects ER function (5Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 959-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29659-29665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of Hcy on ER stress and on Mthfr mRNA levels. Treatment of Neuro-2a cells with Hcy rapidly increased Grp78 mRNA (Fig. 2B), confirming the induction of ER stress by Hcy in this model system. Mthfr mRNA induction was also observed in response to Hcy treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The pattern of up-regulation was similar for both Mthfr and Grp78, supporting their coordinate activation by Hcy-induced ER stress. Similar results were obtained with the Raw264.7 cell line (data not shown). We had observed in an earlier study that Mthfr expression can be induced by NF-κB (14Pickell L. Tran P. Leclerc D. Hiscott J. Rozen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cross-talk occurs between ER stress and NF-κB signaling (18Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), through mechanisms that involve IRE1 and PERK (19Leonardi A. Vito P. Mauro C. Pacifico F. Ulianich L. Consiglio E. Formisano S. Di Jeso B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). We looked for evidence/absence of involvement of NF-κBin the response of Mthfr to Hcy treatment. Nos2, a gene that is activated by NF-κB (14Pickell L. Tran P. Leclerc D. Hiscott J. Rozen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Wang W.W. Jenkinson C.P. Griscavage J.M. Kern R.M. Arabolos N.S. Byrns R.E. Cederbaum S.D. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), was not affected by Hcy in these experiments (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Hcy-induced ER stress is not mediated through NF-κB. We verified that Nos2 mRNA levels were increased after lipopolysaccharide treatment of RAW264.7 cells, and that this increase was abolished by PDTC or Bay11-7082, two inhibitors of NF-κB (data not shown, see also Ref. 14Pickell L. Tran P. Leclerc D. Hiscott J. Rozen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, because the up-regulation of Mthfr and Grp78 by Hcy was not affected by the NF-κB inhibitors (data not shown) and Hcy did not alter expression of Nos2, we conclude that the Hcy-induced increase of ER stress and Mthfr is not mediated by NF-κB. Up-regulation of MTHFR Protein by ER StressBecause Mthfr mRNA levels were increased by ER stress, we questioned whether MTHFR protein levels were also affected. We used tunicamycin or thapsigargin to study the effect of ER stress on MTHFR protein levels, in Neuro-2a and RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3A). ER stress is significantly induced in these 2 cell lines in the presence of tunicamycin and thapsigargin, as verified by increased levels of GRP78 (Fig. 3A) and processing of Xpb1 (Fig. 3B). As expected, we obtained complex Western blot patterns for MTHFR because there are two possible protein isoforms (with apparent mass of 70 or 77 kDa (15Tran P. Leclerc D. Chan M. Pai A. Hiou-Tim F. Wu Q. Goyette P. Artigas C. Milos R. Rozen R. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) and the shorter MTHFR isoform has been shown to undergo phosphorylation (13Yamada K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The stress inducers clearly increased the amount of GRP78 as well as the intensity of the MTHFR protein (short isoform of 70 kDa, phosphorylated (SP) and non-phosphorylated (S) forms). The identity in Fig. 3A of the short MTHFR subunit, with or without phosphorylation, was deduced by overexpression of the short and long isoforms in Neuro-2A cells, or by mixing bacterial extracts containing the overex-pressed short and long isoforms with the Neuro-2A cells (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 1 A). We observed that overexpression of the short isoform after transfection into Neuro-2a cells generates mainly the phosphorylated form (Fig. 3C, Mock+S, and supplemental Fig. 1 A), with smaller amounts of the nonphosphorylated protein. Transfection of Neuro-2a cells with a construct expressing the long MTHFR isoform (Fig. 3C, Mock+L) demonstrated that the long isoform of 77 kDa migrates slightly above the phosphorylated form of the short isoform (Fig. 3C, Mock+S) and that this long isoform does not appear to be efficiently expressed in Neuro-2a cells. We also confirmed, as initially reported (13Yamada K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the identity of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated 70-kDa isoforms by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 3D). Mixing protein extracts from Neuro-2a cells with bacterial extracts containing the overexpressed short and long isoforms of MTHFR (supplemental Fig. 1 B) supported our conclusions on the banding pattern of the 2 isoforms and confirmed that the long MTHFR isoform was not expressed in the cell lines used in the present study. Occasionally we observed a band that migrated slower than the long isoform (labeled with an asterisk in Fig. 3D). It is possible that this faint band represents the phosphorylated form of the long isoform but phosphorylation of the long isoform has not been examined by any group thus far. We also occasionally detected a band that migrated faster than the non-phosphorylated small isoform (labeled with 2 asterisks in Fig. 3D). This unidentified band is likely to be a degradation product of MTHFR, because a band of similar size was observed in Yamada et al. (13Yamada K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and, in our studies, this protein appeared to increase in intensity under circumstances that increased the amount of the 70-kDa MTHFR protein (as shown in Fig. 3A). Effect of Individual ER Stress Transducers/Transcription FactorsTo determine which branch of ER stress, PERK, ATF6, or IRE1, was involved in MTHFR activation, we used plasmids that overexpressed the relevant transducers/transcription factors. Cells overexpressing PERK or IRE1 accumulate large quantities of these proteins, which then dimerize and are activated, even in the absence of ER stress (22Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar, 23Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We used a N-terminal derivative of ATF6, which lacks the transmembrane and C-terminal regions of the original protein. This truncated and activated form of ATF6 (amino acids 1–373) results in a protein that localizes entirely in the nucleus, even in the absence of ER stress (24Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). We did not observe an increase in MTHFR expression after transfection of PERK and ATF6 constructs (Figs. 4A and B, respectively); confirmation of overexpression of the plasmids was performed by immunoblotting for the c-Myc and hemagglutinin tags for PERK and ATF6, respectively. Furthermore, the induction of eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) and the increased levels of GRP78 (Fig. 4B) confirmed the functionality of the expression plasmids for PERK (1Boyce M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and ATF6 (25Kaneko M. Takahashi T. Niinuma Y. Nomura Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively. In contrast, MTHFR protein levels increased when Neuro-2a cells were transfected with plasmids overexpressing IRE1 (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained whether native IRE1 or a c-Myc-tagged IRE1 were transfected; overexpression of the latter plasmid was confirmed using a c-Myc antibody (Fig. 4C). The overexpression of IRE1 also increased levels of GRP78 and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun, its active form; Fig. 4C), as previously reported (23Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 26Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). The degree of increase in GRP78 and c-Jun expression varied depending on transfection conditions (Fig. 4D, +, ++, or +++ lanes). The optimal transfection conditions for c-Jun were also associated with higher levels of MTHFR expression. A vector expressing a dominant-negative form of IRE1 (IRE1delC) partially abolished the effect of tunicamycin (Fig. 4E), as well as the effect of Hcy (Fig. 4F) on MTHFR protein levels. IRE1delC also attenuated the basal expression of MTHFR (Fig. 4, E and F). Our assay for Xbp1 processing showed detectable levels of ER stress in our basal conditions (particularly visible in the top panels of Figs. 3B and 4G); this is likely to contribute to the decrease in basal MTHFR expression by IRE1delC. The dominant-negative IRE1 mutant efficiently eradicated the tunicamycin- and Hcy-induced increases of p-c-Jun (Fig. 4, E and F, respectively). Evaluation of Xpb1 processing after Hcy treatment (Fig. 4G) demonstrated increased splicing in the presence of Hcy; this finding is consistent with the proposed IRE1 activation by Hcy because Xpb1 is downstream of IRE1 in ER signaling (1Boyce M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Hcy appeared to inhibit the phosphorylation of the short MTHFR isoform (Fig. 4F) because the Hcy-induced increase in MTHFR protein was largely limited to an increase in the nonphosphorylated band; this pattern is distinct from that seen with the other stress inducers or IRE1, which did not restrict activation to the non-phosphorylated short isoform (as shown in Figs. 3A and 4, C and D). The Hcy-dependent decrease in MTHFR phosphorylation is consistent with the findings of Yamada et al. (13Yamada K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) who suggested that the phosphorylation of MTHFR is decreased by a low S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio. Effect of Other Regulators of p-c-JunTo further address the involvement of c-Jun in the up-regulation of MTHFR, we investigated the effects of LiCl and valproate, whi"
