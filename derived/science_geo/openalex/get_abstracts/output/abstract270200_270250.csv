https://openalex.org/W2085937563,"A solitary layer of shattered crustal rock fragments has been traced over a distance of 260 kilometers within folded 600-million-year-old Precambrian marine shales of the Adelaide Geosyncline, South Australia. The fragments consist entirely of acid to intermediate volcanics (approximately 1575 million years old) displaying shattered mineral grains, shock lamellae in quartz, and small shatter cones. Fragments reach 30 centimeters in diameter and show evidence of vertical fall emplacement. Available evidence points to derivation of the rock fragments from a distant hypervelocity impact into the Gawler Range Volcanics at Lake Acraman, approximately 300 kilometers west of the Adelaide Geosyncline."
https://openalex.org/W2165078442,"A major probable impact structure occurs in middle Proterozoic dacitic volcanics in the Gawler Ranges, central South Australia. The structure has an inner depressed area about 30 kilometers in diameter that contains the Lake Acraman salina, an intermediate depression or ring about 90 kilometers in diameter, and a possible outer ring approximately 160 kilometers in diameter. Outcrops of dacite in Lake Acraman are intensely shattered and contain shatter cones and multiple sets of shock lamellac in quartz grains. The Acraman structure is the largest probable impact structure known in Australia and is the likely source of dacitic ejecta found in late Precambrian marine shales some 300 kilometers to the east."
https://openalex.org/W1986255067,"The electron density function rho(r) in a crystal determines its difaction pattern, that is, both the magnitudes and phases of its x-ray diffraction maxima, and conversely. If, however, as is always the case, only magnitudes are available from the diffraction experiment, then the density function rho(r) cannot be recovered. If one invokes prior structural knowledge, usually that the crystal is composed of discrete atoms of known atomic numbers, then the observed magnitudes are, in general, sufficient to determine the positions of the atoms, that is, the crystal structure."
https://openalex.org/W2003877046,"Semiclassical theory finds use in chemical physics both as a computational method and as a conceptual framework for interpreting quantum features in experiments and in numerical quantum calculations. The semiclassical description of one-dimensional dynamical systems is essentially a solved problem for eigenvalue and scattering situations and for general topologies of potential functions (simple potential wells, multiple wells, multiple barriers, and so forth). Considerable progress has also been made in generalizing semiclassical theory to multidimensional dynamical systems (such as inelastic and reactive scattering of atoms and molecules and vibrational energy levels of polyatomic molecules), and here, too, it provides a useful picture of quantum features (interference in product state distribution, generalized tunneling phenomena, and others) in these more complex systems."
https://openalex.org/W2065010175,"The Colorado beetle is protected against predators by the secretions of defensive glands located on the pronotum and the elytra. The single major compound of the secretion was identified as gamma-L-glutamyl-L-2-amino-3(Z),5-hexadienoic acid by spectroscopic and chemical methods. This compound, which contains a nonprotein beta,gamma- unsaturated amino acid, is toxic to ants (Myrmica rubra) at a concentration 10(-2) molar, which is less than its estimated concentration in the secretion (1.8 x 10(-1) molar)."
