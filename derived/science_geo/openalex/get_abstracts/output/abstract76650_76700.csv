https://openalex.org/W1502525852,"ALTHOUGH an association between β-aminopropionitrile derivatives and osteolathyrism of experimental animals seems well established1, there is less certainty concerning the nature of toxic substances present in Lathyrus species responsible for human neurolathyrism2. Acute neurological manifestations are produced in some laboratory animals by L-α,γ-diaminobutyric acid (present in numerous Lathyrus species, but not in L. sativus)3,4, by β-cyano-L-alanine (present in Vicia sativa and V. angustifolia, possible contaminants of L. sativus)5 and by (β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (recently isolated from L. sativus)6. The degree of susceptibility to these toxic agents varies between different animal species, and it has yet to be demonstrated whether these substances do, in fact, produce human lathyrism. Nevertheless, in view of the potent effects of many relatively simple amino-acids on mammalian central neurones7, these lathyrus factors are of considerable interest. Consequently an investigation has been made of the action of these and related compounds on single nerve cells of cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone."

https://openalex.org/W2024004754,"PECTIC enzymes have been shown to be produced in vitro by many plant pathogenic fungi, and evidence has been presented which suggests that they may play a part in the mechanisms of infection of the host plant1. Most work has been concerned with relatively non-specialized facultative parasites. Little is known about obligate parasites, for which the only record is of polygalacturonase production by germinating uredospores of Puccinia graminis tritici2, and the difficulty of obtaining uredospore suspensions in axenic culture makes this work somewhat suspect. Phytophthora infestans shares certain features in common with obligate parasites, showing a high degree of host specificity3, has much more exacting nutritional requirements in vitro than most facultative parasites4,5, and forms haustoria6. The processes of germination in vitro appear similar to that of many obligate parasites, as zoospores readily germinate on a wide range of natural and synthetic media but do not readily continue growth to form actively growing colonies7. Thus the following observations on the ability of Phytophthora infestans to produce pectic enzymes may be of some interest."

https://openalex.org/W2052545643,"THE terms group selection and intergroup selection1,2 have been used in referring to a variety of phenomena including recently the evolution of behavioural social systems involved in population control3,4. Since the phenomenon of group selection promises to receive greater attention from students of evolution in the future, I feel that a clarification of terms at this time will help to prevent confusion. The “groups” under consideration may be quite different from each other and the action of natural selection on them will depend on the nature of the group."

https://openalex.org/W1977209607,"AT the anterior end of the free-living marine nematode Enoplus communis are situated two pigment spots, dark red-brown in life. Their superficial appearance is very reminiscent of eye-spots. Schultz1 suggested that these pigment spots were excretory granules and were not in any way associated with photoreception."

Histological investigations of the cuticle in three species of the Palpatores revealed a marked difference between the cuticle of the dyspnoic Nemastoma lugubre (Mull) and the two eupnoic species Leiobunum rotundum (Lat.) and Phalangium opilio Lin."

https://openalex.org/W1995688112,"THE discussion of the effect of narcotics on the permeability of erythrocytes which appears in some text-books1–3 is based on a report by Jacobs and Parpart4. These authors showed that n-butyl alcohol decreased the permeability of erythrocytes of Certain species to glycerol and increased the permeability to glycerol in the erythrocytes of other species. In all cases reported, butanol increased the permeability to thiourea. Davson suggests in several of his writings (for example, ref. 2) that narcotics decrease the permeability “in certain special cases of erythrocyte permeability…[of]…those substances that apparently show an unusually rapid rate of penetration”. Similar results were reported by Hunter et al.5, and it was suggested that a carrier mechanism, or facilitated diffusion, was involved in these “special cases”."

https://openalex.org/W2017042542,"THE reaction of an animal to cold stress varies with the species and with the degree of stress imposed on the animal. Shields, Platner and Neubeiser1 have shown that the albino laboratory rat reacts to a cold stress (4.0° ± 2° C for 20 days) with a marked decrease in serum albumin. They regarded catabolism of albumin as the prime factor responsible for its fall in serum."
https://openalex.org/W2050252177,"IT has been reported1 that, provided threshold bombarding energies and current densities are achieved, it is possible to transfer metallic films deposited on an anode to a cathode in vacuo by electron bombardment (a thin film thermionic emitter was used as a detector). The mechanism of release can be considered to arise from (a) an energy conversion yielding thermal evaporation over areas of atomic dimensions of the surface layer, or (b) an indirect one involving ionization in situ and the breaking of metallic bonds of a fraction of the surface atoms."
