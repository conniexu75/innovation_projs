This does not mean that the operation of the vocal system is free from constraints. The characteristics of its innervation (7), musculature (8), membranes and resonators (9) impose a limit on what can be done, and its functioning must incorporate the prior' ity of respiratory needs. Also, vocal patterns may be programmed by properties of the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2056877395,"A thermophilic photosynthetic purple bacterium was isolated from the waters of a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The organism differs from all known purple bacteria in that it grows optimally at a temperature of about 50 degrees C. The isolate contains bacteriochlorophyll a and grows autotrophically, oxidizing sulfide to elemental sulfur which is then stored as globules inside the cell. These properties indicate that the phototroph is a member of the Chromatiaceae (purple sulfur bacteria)."
https://openalex.org/W2025257832,"An assemblage of endemic cavernicolous marine invertebrates, including taxa found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean of great phylogenetic age or with affinities to deep sea organisms, inhabits the Jameos del Agua cave, a sea waterflooded Holocene lava tube cave on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. This marine cave contains both relicts from Tethyan times, such as an apparently new crustacean family belonging to what had been the monotypic class Remipedia, and relicts of groups that are now common only in the deep sea as well as species that occur outside the cave."

https://openalex.org/W1993882947,"On the basis of x-ray diffraction and electron microprobe data, spherical and ellipsoidal particles extracted from manganese nodules were divided into three groups. Group 1 particles are believed to be derived from iron meteorites, and Group 11 particles from stony meteorites. Group III particles are believed to be volcanic in origin."
https://openalex.org/W1965079780,"During the winter of 1979, the solar ultraviolet irradiance varied with a period of 13.5 days and an amplitude of 1 percent. The zonal mean ozone values in the tropics varied with the solar irradiance, with an amplitude of 0.25 to 0.60 percent. This observation agrees with earlier calculations, although the response may be overestimated. These results imply changes in ozone at an altitude of 48 kilometers of up to 12 percent over an 11-year solar cycle. Interpretation of ozone changes in the upper stratosphere will require measurements of solar ultraviolet radiation at wavelengths near 200 nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W1978338038,"Detailed analysis of evolutionary changes in a 10-million-year long Late Neogene lineage of planktonic foraminifera has revealed a pattern that is not consistent with either the gradualistic or the punctuational model of evolution. The lineage was in stasis over a considerable part of its total duration but underwent relatively rapid, but not geologically instantaneous, gradual morphologic change that did not lead to lineage splitting. The term punctuated gradualism is suggested for this evolutionary modality."

https://openalex.org/W2023382233,"Mechanically wounding giant cells of Boergesenia forbesii induces the formation of bristle-coated, plasma-membrane invaginations (coated pits) and coated vesicles, easily providing a plentiful source of coated membranes in a clean cellular system unencumbered by other tissues. Contractions evoked by wounding partition the cytoplasm into hundreds of spherical protoplasts with approximately 40 percent less total plasma-membrane surface area than the original cell. Ferritin labeling and the appearance of numerous large coated pits and vesicles at the peak period of contraction indicate that these organelles play a role in extensive endocytosis of the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2066704045,"Marsupials have been shown to have basal metabolic rates below those of eutherian mammals. Now metabolic rates below thermoneutrality are found to be equivalent in both taxa. Two models are proposed to explain the observed metabolic patterns: in one, marsupials differ only in having reduced basal metabolic rates; in the other, the reduced marsupial basal metabolic rates combined with a reduced body temperature and elevated conductance. The metabolic costs of existence below thermoneutrality appear to be similar for both taxa. The difference in basal metabolic rate may be of energetic significance or merely a phylogenetic coincidence."

https://openalex.org/W1999812192,"Root tip cells of hexaploid oats Avena sativa L. were examined at mitotic metaphase, and distances between homologous as well as between non-homologous chromosomes were measured and their frequency distributions compared. Nonhomologous chromosomes were scattered at random in the cells studied. In contrast, the mean distance between homologous chromosomes was significantly shorter. There is a tendency this species. for somatic association of homologs in this species."
