https://openalex.org/W2029741085,Atmospheric oxygen has been found to be enriched in oxygen-18 by 23.5 +/- 0.3 per mil relative to average ocean water (SMOW). Oxygen dissolved in seawater is further enriched in oxygen-18 by 0.85 per mil at 0 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the solubility enrichment is given by epsilon (per mil) = 0.85- 0.010 t ( degrees C). This result is in good agreement with earlier measurements of the solubility effect in distilled water.

These lunar chondrules are believed to have formed during a large impact event, perhaps the one that formed the Imbrian Basin. This suggests that some meteoritic chondrules are also formed by impact processes such as crystallization after shock melting and abrasion and diffusion in base-surge and fall-back deposits generated by impacts on planetary surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1974016085,"Natural pyrrhotites, when studied by high resolution electron microscopy, yield crystallographic information on a unit cell scale. Structural heterogeneity is prominent. The many reported superstructures are interpretable through an antiphase model. The 5C pyrrhotite superstructure results from an ordered sequence of antiphase domains while the higher temperature NC type results from a disordered sequence."

These sediments were probably formed when the basement was at the crest of this rise and have moved to their present location as a result of sea-floor spreading."

https://openalex.org/W2001365302,"Soils from the Apollo 14 site contain nearly three times as much meteoritic material as soils from the Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Luna 16 sites. Part of this material consists of the ubiquitous micrometeorite component, of primitive (carbonaceous-chondrite-like) composition. The remainder, seen most conspicuously in coarse glass and norite fragments, has a decidedly fractionated composition, with volatile elements less than one-tenth as abundant as siderophiles. This material seems to be debris of the Cyprus-sized planetesimal that produced the Imbrian basin. Compositionally this planetesimal has no exact counterpart among known meteorite classes, though group IVA irons come close. It also resembles the initial composition of the earth as postulated by the two-component model. Apparently the Imbrian planetesimal was an Earth satellite swept up by the moon during tidal recession or capture, or an asteroid deflected by Mars into terrestrial space."
https://openalex.org/W2075239202,"Short-wavelength anomalies in sea surface topography, caused by the gravitational effects of major ocean bottom topographic features, have been detected by the radar altimeter aboard Skylab. Some features, such as deep ocean trenches, seamounts, and escarpments, displace the ocean surface by as much as 15 meters over 100-kilometer wavelengths. This experiment demonstrates the potential of satellite altimetry for determining the ocean geoid and for mapping major features of the ocean bottom."
