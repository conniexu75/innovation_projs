https://openalex.org/W2054177883,"Two potent heat-stable protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor proteins designated I1PP2A and I2PP2A have been purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of bovine kidney (Li, M., Guo, H., and Damuni, Z.(1995) Biochemistry 34, 1988-1996). N-terminal and internal amino acid sequencing indicated that I2PP2A was a truncated form of SET, a largely nuclear protein that is fused to nucleoporin Nup214 in acute non-lymphocytic myeloid leukemia. Experiments using purified preparations of recombinant human SET confirmed that this protein inhibited PP2A. Half-maximal inhibition of the phosphatase occurred at about 2 nM SET. By contrast, SET (up to 20 nM) did not affect the activities of purified preparations of protein phosphatases 1, 2B, and 2C. The results indicate that SET is a potent and specific inhibitor of PP2A and suggest that impaired regulation of PP2A may contribute to acute myeloid leukemogenesis.

A number of defined chromosomal translocations occur in specific subtypes of myeloid leukemia indicating that these translocations play an important role in the process of leukemogenesis(1.Mitelman F.

As a result of translocation, nearby oncogenes and other genes involved in the control of proliferation or differentiation can be activated through alterations in regulatory DNA sequences that leave the encoded protein intact (e.g. Myc) or through formation of fusion genes that encode chimeric proteins (e.g. Bcr-Abl, E2A-Pbx, and Pml-RAPα)(1.Mitelman F.

However, although several of the chromosomal translocations and the resulting fusion genes that occur in leukemia have been identified, often the function of the individual proteins encoded by the fusion transcripts has not been determined(1.Mitelman F.

In cells, PP2A is thought to exist as heterotrimeric forms termed PP2A1 and PP2A0 and composed of a catalytic C subunit and A and B (B, B′, or B″) subunits (3.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 4.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Mumby M.C.

A dimeric form of PP2A, termed PP2A2, has also been isolated from numerous sources and is composed of the A and C subunits (3.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 4.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Mumby M.C.

However, this enzyme is thought not to exist in vivo because the missing B subunit may have been lost during the isolation procedures(3.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 4.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Mumby M.C.

Two forms of the A and C subunits exhibiting apparent Mr values of ~65,000 and 36,000 and 86% (7.Hemmings B.A. Adams-Pearson C. Maurer F. Muller P. Goris J. Merlevede W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R.

In addition, several distinct B subunits of apparent Mr ~54,000, 55,000, 56,000, 72,000, and 130,000 have also been identified (e.g. see Refs. 7 and 14-17). Although the significance of the different A, B, and C subunits is not well understood, the distinct substrate specificities of the various trimeric PP2A forms appear to be conferred, at least in part, by the variable B subunit(3.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 4.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv.

However, despite progress on the structure of PP2A, little information is available on the regulation of this enzyme. Nonetheless, evidence has emerged that PP2A is inactivated by phosphorylation (18.Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 19.Guo H. Damuni Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of its C subunit. In addition, we recently purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of bovine kidney two heat-stable and PP2A-specific inhibitor proteins designated I1PP2A and I2PP2A(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These inhibitor proteins act noncompetitively and exhibit apparent Ki values in the nanomolar range(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The inhibitor proteins appear to be PP2A-specific because, in contrast to PP2A, they do not affect the activities of PP1C, PP2B, and PP2C(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the other major mammalian protein serine threonine phosphatases(3.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 4.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Mumby M.C.

Furthermore, I1PP2A and I2PP2A did not affect the activities of 11 different protein kinases(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because the purified preparations exhibited distinct peptide patterns following cleavage with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, I1PP2A and I2PP2A may be the products of distinct genes(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for this possibility was not provided. This study was undertaken to determine the identity of I2PP2A on a firm basis. In this communication, we show that the purified bovine kidney preparations of I2PP2A represent a truncated form of SET (22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), a largely nuclear protein also termed PHAP-II (putative class II human histocompatibility leukocyte-associated protein II) (23.Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gotz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmerman B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 357: 113-126Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and TAF (template-activating factor)(24.Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In acute non-lymphocytic myeloid leukemia, the SET gene, which is located on chromosome 9q34 centromeric to c-abl and nup214, is fused to nup214 (also termed can) apparently as a result of translocation(22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This SET-Nup214 fusion gene encodes a 5-kilobase transcript that contains a single open reading frame predicting a chimeric SET-Nup214 protein of apparent Mr ~150,000(2.Von Lindern M. Fornerod M.

The results suggest that fusion of SET with Nup214 in acute myeloid leukemia may impair the normal regulation of PP2A and contribute to leukemogenesis. Bovine brain MBP(25.Deibler G.E. Boyd L.F.

Synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized at Life Technologies, Inc. Other materials are given elsewhere(27.Damuni Z. Amick G.D. Sneed T.R. J. Biol.

Sneed T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6412-6416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exactly as described(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Assay of PP2A1, PP2A2, PP2AC, PP1C, PP2B, and PP2C was performed as reported(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26.Amick G.D. Reddy S.A.G. Damuni Z. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One unit of phosphatase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 nmol of phosphoryl groups/min from 32P-labeled MBP. To ensure linearity, the extent of phosphoryl group release was limited to <10%. Inhibitor protein activity was measured as described(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). One unit of inhibitor protein activity was defined as the amount of protein that inhibited 1 unit of PP2A2 by 50% in the standard assay. SDS-PAGE was performed in slab gels (12% acrylamide) with 0.1% SDS and Tris/glycine buffer, pH 8.3(32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (202763) Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein was determined as described (33.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205570) Google Scholar). Aliquots (2 μg) of purified bovine kidney I2PP2A were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto ImmobilonTM P membranes. After staining with Ponceau S, bands corresponding to I2PP2A were cut out and subjected to overnight incubation at 37°C with N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (0.5 mg) as described(34.Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were then resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography reversed-phase chromatography on an Aquapore RP-300 column (1 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. After washing with this solution, the column was developed, at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min, with a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid containing 38.5% (v/v) acetonitrile in 30 min, followed by a linear gradient from 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid containing 38.5% acetonitrile (v/v) to 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid containing 59.5% (v/v) acetonitrile in 10 min. Fractions (0.045 ml) were collected, and the absorbance at 214 nm was determined. The amino acid sequences of peptides eluting at about 38% (peptide I) and 48% (peptide II) acetonitrile and the N terminus of I2PP2A were determined using standard reagents for gas phase chemistry on an automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with an on-line UV detector to identify phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. First strand SET cDNA was generated at 42°C for 30 min in 0.02 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 1 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 μg of human kidney polyadenylated RNA (Clontech), 50 pmol of the 3′ SET-based oligonucleotide (GGATCCTAGTCATCTTCTCCTTC), and 2.5 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Perkin-Elmer). After heat denaturation at 99°C for 5 min, a 0.005-ml aliquot of the mixture was subjected to amplification by polymerase chain reaction in 0.1 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 pmol of the 3′ and 5′ (CCGCGGAGCAGCCATATGTCGGC) SET-based oligonucleotides, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 5 units of recombinant pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After heat denaturation for 5 min at 94°C, polymerase chain reaction amplification for 30 cycles was performed as follows: 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 2.5 min at 72°C except that, in the last cycle, extension was carried out for 7 min. The amplified cDNA (854 base pairs) was subcloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 and used to transform Escherichia coli ONE SHOTTM as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After growth at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, the pUC18 containing SET cDNA was purified from the cells by the alkaline lysis method(35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The identity of the purified cDNA with the coding region of SET (22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession no. M93651) was confirmed by sequencing both strands using M13 sequencing primers and the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (U. S. Biochemical Corp. TAquence sequencing kit and DuPont NEN [α-35S] dATP). SET cDNA was excised from pUC18 by incubation with BamHI and NdeI and then isolated with GLASSMILK® (Geneclean II, BIO 101, Inc.) from low melting agarose following gel electrophoresis. pET-21a DNA (50 ng) (Novagen) was linearized with BamHI and NdeI and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. This DNA was then incubated overnight at 16°C with 10 ng of the purified cDNA in 0.01 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4 units of T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) as recommended (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The mixture was then used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). A 5-ml overnight culture of these cells was then inoculated into 500 ml of Terrific Broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After growth at 37°C to log phase, IPTG was added (final concentration, 0.5 mM), and the cells were grown for an additional 2 h. Unless indicated otherwise, all subsequent operations were performed at 4°C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000 × g in a Beckman JA-10 rotor, cells were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 14 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed at 1200 p.s.i. with a French® press. After centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor, pellets were discarded, and to the supernatant was added 30 volumes of buffer B (buffer A containing 1 mM instead of 4 mM EDTA). The mixture was applied onto a column (2.5 × 8.5 cm) of poly-L-lysine-agarose equilibrated with buffer B. After washing with 500 ml of buffer B, the column was developed with a 600-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl. Inhibitor activity was recovered at about 0.65 M NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and mixed at room temperature with 2 volumes of a 99% ethanol solution. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman JA-14 rotor, pellets were resuspended in buffer B and subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a calibrated column (2.5 × 95 cm) of Sephacryl S-200 equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.01% Brij 35. A major peak of inhibitor protein activity emerged at V0 (~220 ml) from Sephacryl S-200. This activity peak was not detected following chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 of extracts from mock-transformed or transformed cells that had been incubated in the absence of IPTG. Fractions containing this inhibitory activity were pooled, and 20 g/liter trichloroacetic acid was added with stirring for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and pellets were resuspended in a solution of 70% ethanol. The mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. This procedure was repeated three times. The final pellets were resuspended in buffer C (buffer A containing 0.1 mM instead of 4 mM EDTA) and dialyzed, with three changes, against 20 volumes of this buffer in 16 h. The preparations were aliquoted and stored at −70°C. A second peak of unidentified inhibitor activity emerged from Sephacryl S-200 with apparent Mr ~50,000. This inhibitor activity was detected following gel permeation chromatography of extracts from transformed and mock-transformed cells that had been incubated in the absence or presence of IPTG and was therefore discarded. To establish the identity of I2PP2A, we set out to determine the amino acid sequence of this protein. Initially, the amino acid sequences of two tryptic peptides (LNEQASEEILK, peptide I) and (QHEEPESFFTWFTDH, peptide II), generated and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were determined. Comparison with amino acid sequences available at the PIR, SwissProt, and GenBank data bases indicated that peptides I and II were identical to residues 45-55 and 182-196 predicted for human SET, respectively(22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Earlier, we reported (21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of I2PP2A (SDGADATSTK) showed 70% identity (differences are underlined) with residues 17-26 of SET(22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Because the purified preparations of bovine kidney I2PP2A exhibit an apparent Mr ~20,000(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), whereas SET exhibits an apparent Mr ~39,000 as estimated by SDS-PAGE (23.Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gotz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmerman B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 357: 113-126Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24.Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the results suggested that I2PP2A may have been derived from SET by proteolysis possibly during the purification procedure and that the three amino acid differences noted in the N terminus may be species and/or tissue related. In this connection, it is pertinent that the human SET gene encodes two transcripts of 2.0 and 2.7 kilobases that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. However, both transcripts contain identical open reading frames(2.Von Lindern M. Fornerod M. Soekarman N. van Baal S. Jaegle M. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Grosveld G. Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1992; 5: 857-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To test whether SET inhibits PP2A in a manner corresponding to I2PP2A, a cDNA coding for human SET was generated and placed into a pET-21a vector under the control of the T7lac promotor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Consistent with the possibility that SET inhibits PP2A, IPTG-induced expression of this cDNA in bacteria resulted in about a 10-fold increase in PP2A inhibitor activity as determined following poly-L-lysine-agarose chromatography (Fig. 1). Because of interference from an unidentified endogenous inhibitor(s), differences in PP2A inhibitor activity in bacterial extracts from control and IPTG-treated cells could not be distinguished. This (these) endogenous inhibitor(s) was (were) not a product(s) of the introduced cDNA because similar activity was detected in extracts of bacteria that had been mock-transformed or transformed with the vector alone. To more directly test the possibility that SET inhibits PP2A, a procedure was developed to purify the IPTG-induced PP2A inhibitor to apparent homogeneity from the bacterial extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This procedure was based on the one employed previously in the purification of I2PP2A from extracts of bovine kidney (21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and included chromatography of the extracts on poly-L-lysine-agarose, precipitation with ethanol, and gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, followed by trichloroacetic acid and ethanol precipitation. The purified preparations of the recombinant protein consisted of a single Coomassie Blue staining polypeptide of apparent Mr ~39,000 as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of these preparations (to the 10th residue) confirmed that the purified protein was SET. Typically, about 3 mg of this protein was obtained from a 500-ml culture of transformed cells. The effect of the purified recombinant SET preparations on PP2A activity was examined next. These preparations inhibited PP2A potently (Fig. 3). Half-maximal inhibition of the phosphatase occurred at about 2 nM (Fig. 3), similar to the potent inhibition obtained with purified preparations of bovine kidney I2PP2A(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that, by contrast to PP2A, purified preparations of PP1C, PP2B, and PP2C were unaffected by I2PP2A(21.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Similar experiments revealed that recombinant human SET also exhibited little or no effect on the activities of PP1C, PP2B, and PP2C (Fig. 3). Together, these results indicate that SET is a potent and specific inhibitor of PP2A. Because the recombinant SET preparations inhibited PP2A1 (Fig. 3) PP2A2 (not shown), and PP2AC (not shown), SET is analogous to I2PP2A in that it appears to act by binding to the C subunit of the phosphatase. Earlier studies suggested a role for SET as a transcriptional activator because it enhanced adenovirus core DNA replication in HeLa cell extracts(24.Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this effect was not determined, although our results raise the possibility that it may have been a consequence of PP2A inhibition. A role for SET in antigen-mediated responses was also suggested because this protein appeared to bind to a peptide (CFIIKGLRKSNAAERRGPL) patterned on an amino acid sequence present in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the DR2α chain of human histocompatibility class II receptor(23.Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gotz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmerman B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 357: 113-126Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of this interaction and whether it occurs with the intact receptor were not determined. Based on the results presented herein, we recommend that SET be renamed I2PP2A to indicate its function and to distinguish it from I1PP2A, which is the product of a distinct gene. 2M. Li, A. Makkinje, and Z. Damuni, manuscript in preparation. This revised nomenclature is used in the remaining discussion. The results presented in this communication provide a firm basis for further characterization of the physiological role of I2PP2A. Tissue and species distribution studies indicate that, by analogy with PP2A(3.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 4.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 6.Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 311: 17-29Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar), I2PP2A is ubiquitous(36.Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting its potential importance for controlling the activity of the phosphatase in diverse cells and tissues. Interestingly, I2PP2A undergoes phosphorylation on unidentified serines in intact cells(36.Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, how this phosphorylation affects I2PP2A activity and whether or not this regulation responds to extracellular stimuli is unknown. Further studies are also needed on the mechanism of action of I2PP2A. In this connection, the C terminus of I2PP2A(22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (and that of I1PP2A2) is highly acidic (22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and deletion of this acidic tail (residues 224-277) abolished the stimulation by I2PP2A of adenovirus core DNA replication in HeLa cell extracts(24.Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, whether deletion of the acidic tail abolishes the inhibition of PP2A by I2PP2A (and/or I1PP2A) remains to be determined. In this regard, it is pertinent that, based on the apparent Mr (~20,000) as estimated by SDS-PAGE and that only 16 amino acids are missing at the N terminus, the bovine kidney I2PP2A preparations appear to be proteolyzed largely at the acidic C terminus. Thus, it would appear that the acidic tail may not be important for inhibition. However, how removal of the 16 N-terminal amino acid residues affects the mobility of I2PP2A on SDS-PAGE is unknown. In this context, it is pertinent that, although the calculated molecular mass of I2PP2A is 32,100, this inhibitor protein exhibits an anomalous apparent Mr (~39,000) as determined by SDS-PAGE. Previous studies have indicated a role for PP2A in tumorigenesis and the viral transformation of cells(3.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 4.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Mumby M.C.

Thus, PP2A is inhibited potently in vitro(37.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar, 38.Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L.

Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) by the tumor promotor okadaic acid. In addition, the SV40 small tumor t antigen of several DNA tumor viruses replaces the B subunit and inhibits the phosphatase in transformed cells(40.Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Mumby M.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The results presented in this communication suggest that the I2PP2A-Nup214 gene fusion, which occurs in acute non-lymphocytic myeloid leukemia(22.Von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), may also lead to altered regulation of PP2A and thus contribute to leukemogenesis. The chimeric protein predicted by this gene fusion contains residues 1-270 of the 277 amino acid residues of native I2PP2A and residues 813-2090 of the 2090 amino acid residues of Nup214. However, although Nup214 appears to be asymmetrically located on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope in normal cells(41.Kraemer D. Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, it will be important to determine how, relative to normal cells, the activity of nuclear PP2A is affected in leukemic cells that express the I2PP2A-Nup214 fusion protein.

The lack of sequence similarity in the cleavage sites suggests the involvement of many proteases of diverse specificity in this process. However, a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line recently isolated for being defective in PMA-activated shedding of the membrane-anchored growth factor transforming growth factor α precursor (proTGF-α) is concomitantly defective in the shedding of many other unrelated membrane proteins. Here we show that independent mutagenesis and selection experiments yield shedding mutants having the same recessive phenotype and belonging to the same genetic complementation group. Furthermore, two structurally distinct agents, TAPI-2 and 1,10-phenanthroline, which are known to inhibit metalloproteases, block PMA-activated shedding of proTGF-α, cell adhesion receptor L-selectin, interleukin 6 receptor α subunit, β-amyloid precursor protein, and an entire set of anonymous Chinese hamster ovary cell surface proteins. Certain serine protease inhibitors prevent release of these proteins by interfering with their maturation and transport to the cell surface but do not inhibit ectodomain shedding from the cell surface.

INTRODUCTIONThe extracellular domain of a large number of transmembrane proteins can be proteolytically released into the medium. This shedding process regulates the fate and physical location of membrane-anchored growth factors(1.Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), growth factor receptors(2.Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem.

(4.Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins are of practical importance. For example, βAPP is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease(5.Sisodia S. Price D.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), angiotensin converting enzyme plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure(6.Skeggs Jr., L.T.D. Kahn J.R. Shumway N.P. J. Exp. Med. 1956; 103: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and the homing receptor L-selectin are implicated in inflammatory responses(7.Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 8.Gearing A.J.H. Newman W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 506-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Ectodomain shedding can convert membrane-anchored growth factors into diffusible factors, membrane receptors into soluble competitors of their own ligand (9.Fernández-Botran R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) or accessories to ligand binding(2.Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem.

Newman W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 506-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Membrane protein ectodomain shedding is now recognized as an important aspect of cell regulation and cell-cell interaction.Despite its broad interest, this shedding mechanism involves molecular components of unknown identity. Shedding appears to occur at or near the cell surface and does not require cytosolic factors that are essential for many forms of membrane traffic(10.Bosenberg M.W. Pandiella A. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Shedding is often stimulated by protein kinase C activators and other agents(11.Pandiella A. Massagué J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, the proteins that are shed are not the targets of phosphorylation in this process. The nature of the proteases involved is of great interest because they might constitute ideal targets for therapy in various disease conditions. Given the diversity of amino acid sequences that are cleaved, many different proteases could be involved in this process, each endowed with a specific substrate recognition capacity. This notion has been reinforced by recent reports that the shedding of different ectodomains appears to be inhibited by different proteinase inhibitors(19.Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I.

We recently isolated a mutant cell line that is defective in the shedding of at least two unrelated molecules, βAPP and proTGF-α, thus providing evidence that the shedding mechanisms of these two molecules share a common component(29.Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present report, we show that independent selection of cell mutants defective in proTGF-α shedding yields cell lines that have identical phenotypes and belong to the same genetic complementation group, indicating a repeated isolation of mutations in the same gene. The defect in these cells prevents shedding of all membrane proteins tested. Furthermore, recently described compounds that inhibit certain metalloproteases and prevent shedding of TNF-α (25.Mohler K. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarma K. Kronhein S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A.

Previously observed differences in protease inhibitor sensitivity of these various molecules are shown here to result from effects of the inhibitors on membrane protein maturation and transport.

Stable transfectants were selected in 700 μg/ml of hygromicin and subcloned. Clones expressing L-selectin or IL-6 Rα at high levels were used for subsequent experiments. CHO cell mutants defective in TGF-α cleavage were isolated as described previously(29.Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).For cell fusions, 2 × 106 cells of a hygromicin-resistant clone and 2 × 106 cells of a histidinol-resistant clone were plated in 60-mm dishes. 16 h later, the cultures were briefly covered with 3 ml of 45% polyethylene glycol (Mr 1300-1600, American Type Culture Collection) in MEM, 10 mM Hepes with a final pH of 7.3. The polyethylene glycol/MEM solution was immediately aspirated, leaving only the minimum amount needed to cover the cells, and the cultures were incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were washed three times with MEM and twice with MEM containing nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum using warm medium. After 10 h of incubation in the latter medium, the cultures were trypsinized and plated into 150-mm dishes. Hybrid cell clones were selected in histidine-free MEM containing nonessential amino acids, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mM histidinol, and 800 μg/ml of hygromicin for 2 weeks.Flow Cytometry AnalysisCells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium for 1 h at 37°C and then treated with or without protease inhibitors for 5 min and treated with or without PMA and/or protease inhibitors cells for an additional 20 min. Cells were then incubated for 45 min at 4°C with 10 μg/ml of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Babco) or 25 μg/ml anti-L-selectin DREG-200 monoclonal antibodies(19.Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F.

Flow cytometry was done on a FACscan instrument and software (Becton Dickinson).Metabolic Labeling, Biotinylation, and Immunoprecipitation of Cell Surface ProteinsApproximately 106 exponentially growing CHO cells expressing TGF-α, L-selectin, or IL-6 Rα were labeled for 30 min with 250 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and 250 μCi/ml translabel (DuPont NEN) in methionine- and cysteine-free medium at 37°C. The label was chased in complete medium for the indicated times in the presence or the absence of protease inhibitors and/or 1 μM PMA as indicated. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 5 mM EDTA (lysis buffer). Aliquots from the medium and from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain or the cytoplasmic domain of TGF-α(35.Ignotz R.A.

For immunoprecipitation of cell surface of HA-tagged proTGF-α or L-selectin, metabolically labeled cells were chased for the indicate times in complete medium, shifted to 4°C, and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml of anti-HA antibody or a 1:100 dilution of antiserum against the L-selectin ectodomain. Cells were washed with PBS and directly lysed in lysis buffer or further incubated for 5 min with or without the addition of the indicated protease inhibitors and for an additional 15 min with or without addition of 1 μM PMA. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 5 μg/ml of HA peptide in order to block any unbound anti-HA antibody. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Immune complexes were collected by incubation of cell lysates and medium samples with protein A-Sepharose for 45 min at 4°C, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.For biotinylation of cell surface proteins, cells were labeled with 250 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine and 250 μCi/ml of [35S]cysteine for 2 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium, chased for 30 min in complete medium, shifted to 4°C, and incubated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 1 h at 4°C. Unreacted biotinylating agent was quenched by washing the cells with PBS containing 50 mM Tris. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37°C in complete medium, 5 min with or without 200 μM TAPI-2, and an additional 20 min with or without 1 μM PMA and/or 200 μM TAPI-2. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer. Medium samples and cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads, and the beads were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS and analyzed on 12-18% gradient polyacrylamide gels.RESULTSRecessive Loss of Ectodomain Shedding Activity in Independently Isolated Cell MutantsRegulated shedding of membrane protein ectodomains was studied using two independently isolated mutant CHO cell clones. One of these clones, M1, was previously isolated from CHO cells expressing a transfected proTGF-α tagged with the HA epitope (HA-proTGF-α)(29.Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). M1 was isolated by treating these transfectants with the single base mutagen ethyl methane sulfonate and then sorting by FACS those cells that retain cell surface anti-HA staining after treatment with the phorbol ester PMA, a known inducer of proTGF-α cleavage. After four consecutive rounds of sorting, the mutagenized population yielded cells that are defective in TGF-α shedding. A control nonmutagenized cell population run in parallel did not yield shedding defective cells. Interestingly, the M1 line and other cell lines clonally propagated from the mutant pool are also defective in βAPP shedding activity. Activation of shedding by protein kinase C-independent mechanisms is also defective in these cells. However, these cells are normal with respect to membrane protein biosynthesis and transport(29.Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Although M1 and other cell lines established from the original mutant pool have the same phenotype, the entire mutant pool could be derived from a single mutant clone enriched during the consecutive rounds of sorting. In order to determine the frequency of isolation of a shedding defective phenotype by mutation of the same gene, we isolated an independent cell line, M2, by repeating the mutagenesis and sorting protocol with a fresh batch of CHO cells. Like M1 cells, M2 cells were unable to shed cell surface proTGF-α (Fig. 1A) or βAPP (data not shown) in response to PMA. Furthermore, hybrids generated by fusion of M1 or M2 with parental CHO cells had wild type shedding activity (Fig. 1A). M1 × M2 cell hybrids lacked shedding activity, showing that they belong to the same genetic complementation group (Fig. 1A). Thus, the M1 and M2 cell lines have the same recessive phenotype and belong to the same complementation group. These results argue that the defect in membrane protein ectodomain cleavage in these independent cell lines is caused by recessive mutations in the same gene.General Loss of Ectodomain Shedding ActivityPrevious results showed that the defect in the M1 mutant cell line inhibited PMA-dependent shedding of various CHO cell surface proteins of unknown identity(29.Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To better establish the shedding defect, the M1 and M2 cell lines and parental CHO cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding L-selectin or IL-6 Rα, two proteins that undergo PMA-induced ectodomain cleavage and are structurally and functionally unrelated to each other and to proTGF-α or βAPP(19.Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28.Müllberg J. Oberthür W. Lottspeich F. Mehl E. Dittrich E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4958-4968PubMed Google Scholar). The cell-bound and released forms of these proteins and of TGF-α as a control were immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled cells treated with or without PMA. As described previously(29.Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), PMA induced a loss of the two cell surface proTGF-α forms (17 and 20-22 kDa) with a concomitant increase in soluble TGF-α in parental CHO cells but had no effect in the mutants (Fig. 1B, bottom).Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled L-selectin transfectants with antibodies against the L-selectin intracellular domain yielded products of 50 and 74 kDa (Fig. 1B). Based on previous characterization, these products correspond to the biosynthetic precursor of L-selectin and the fully glycosilated cell surface form, respectively (19.Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 3B). Upon cell treatment with PMA, the cell surface form is converted into a soluble form (Fig. 1B), leaving a cell-associated 6-kDa transmembrane/cytoplasmic fragment(19.Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast to parental CHO cells, M1 and M2 cells showed a lack of basal or activated L-selectin shedding activity (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Likewise, IL-6 Rα, which is expressed in transfected CHO cells as an 80-kDa cell surface protein and shed as a 57-kDa soluble ectodomain in response to PMA(28.Müllberg J. Oberthür W. Lottspeich F. Mehl E. Dittrich E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4958-4968PubMed Google Scholar), was not shed in the mutants (Fig. 1B, middle panel). The results obtained with M1 and M2 transfectants were identical, and only one of the mutants (M2) is shown here for simplicity. These results indicate that the gene affected in these mutants is essential not only for proTGF-α and βAPP shedding but also for the shedding of L-selectin and IL-6 Rα.Figure 33,4-DCI does not prevent shedding of L-selectin or proTGF-α. A, flow cytometry analysis of CHO cells expressing L-selectin and HA/proTGF-α treated with or without PMA and/or 100 μM 3,4-DCI for 20 min. Cells were immunostained with antibodies against the L-selectin ectodomain or the HA epitope and analyzed by flow cytometry. B, metabolically labeled CHO cells expressing HA/proTGF-α and L-selectin were chased for 25 min in complete medium and then incubated with anti HA monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of L-selectin at 4°C.

Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and references therein) is not sensitive to such inhibitors. These results could be interpreted as evidence for the involvement of different proteolytic activities. However, these results were obtained using different methods and cell lines. For example, 3,4-DCI inhibited the release of TGF-α from CHO cells as determined by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins (27.Pandiella A. Bosenberg M.W. Huang E.J. Besmer P. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24028-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but did not inhibit the shedding of L-selectin as determined by FACS analysis of immunostained human granulocytes(21.Bazil V. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1314-1322PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to test the effect of 3,4-DCI on the shedding of L-selectin, IL-6 Rα, TGF-α, and βAPP under the same experimental conditions. As in previous studies on proTGF-α cleavage(27.Pandiella A. Bosenberg M.W. Huang E.J. Besmer P. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24028-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), metabolically labeled cells were treated with 3,4-DCI for 30 min prior to PMA addition. Under these conditions, 3,4-DCI inhibited the release of L-selectin and IL-6 Rα as well as TGF-α (Fig. 2). Two other serine protease inhibitors, TPCK and DFP, previously shown to prevent TGF-α release under these conditions (27.Pandiella A. Bosenberg M.W. Huang E.J. Besmer P. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24028-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prevented the PMA-induced release of L-selectin and IL-6 Rα as well as endogenous βAPP (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of 3,4-DCI on the release of L-selectin, IL-6 Rα, and proTGF-α ectodomains. CHO cells transfected with L-selectin, IL-6 Rα, or HA/proTGF-α were metabolically labeled and chased for 45 min in the presence or the absence of 100 μM 3,4-DCI. Where indicated, PMA was added during the last 30 min of the chase period. Aliquots from medium samples were immunoprecipitated with antiserum against the corresponding protein ectodomains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The current availability of a HA-tagged proTGF-α construct that can be recognized on the cell surface by anti-HA antibody allowed us to assess the effect of these protease inhibitors on the shedding of cell surface proTGF-α using FACS analysis. In marked contrast with the results obtained by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled products, FACS analysis of CHO transfectants surface-stained with anti-HA antibody showed that 3,4-DCI did not inhibit the PMA-induced shedding of cell surface proTGF-α (Fig. 3A). As described previously(21.Bazil V. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1314-1322PubMed Google Scholar), 3,4-DCI did not prevent the PMA-induced loss of cell surface L-selectin as determined by FACS analysis. The same results were obtained when TPCK or DFP were analyzed in this type of assay (data not shown).To confirm the inability of 3,4-DCI to prevent ectodomain cleavage at the cell surface, a protocol was designed to specifically follow the fate of proteins that are present on the cell surface at the time of PMA addition. Cells were metabolically labeled and then chased long enough to allow labeled membrane proteins to reach the cell surface. Cells were then incubated with antibodies against proteins of interest and treated with PMA and/or 3,4-DCI. The immune complexes formed on the cell surface were recovered by precipitation from cell lysates and medium samples and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When tested in this manner, 3,4-DCI did not inhibit PMA-induced loss of either proTGF-α or L-selectin from the cell surface (Fig. 3B, left panels) and did not inhibit the release of soluble L-selectin and TGF-α into the medium (Fig. 3B, right panels).These results suggested that 3,4-DCI and related protease inhibitors prevented the release of newly synthesized membrane proteins but not the shedding of these proteins once they have reached the cell surface. To determine whether these protease inhibitors interfered with transport of membrane proteins to the cell surface, a proTGF-α pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiment was done in the presence or the absence of the inhibitors. ProTGF-α is synthesized as an 18-kDa precursor that matures into forms of 20-22 kDa that reach the cell surface and are converted to a 17-kDa product by remov"

Differential expression and regulation of a family of three NO synthase (NOS) gene products help achieve this diversity of action. Previous studies identify post-translational modification and interaction of NOS with specific protein targets as tissue-specific modes of regulation. Here, we show that alternative splicing specifically regulates neuronal NOS (nNOS, type I) in striated muscle. nNOS in skeletal muscle is slightly more massive than nNOS from brain owing to a 102-base pair (34-amino acid) alternatively spliced segment between exons 16 and 17. Following purification, this novel nNOS mu isoform has similar catalytic activity to that of nNOS expressed in cerebellum. nNOS mu appears to function exclusively in differentiated muscle as its expression occurs coincidentally with myotube fusion in culture. An isoform-specific antibody detects nNOS mu protein only in skeletal muscle and heart. This study identifies alternative splicing as a means for tissue-specific regulation of nNOS and reports the first additional protein sequence for a mammalian NOS since the original cloning of the gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1564633285,"The very late activation antigens (VLA) or beta 1 integrins mediate cell attachment to different extracellular matrix proteins and intercellular adhesions. The ligand binding activity of these adhesion receptors is not constitutive and can be regulated by temperature, presence of extracellular divalent cations, stimulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and cellular activation. We have generated three novel mAbs, HUTS-4, HUTS-7, and HUTS-21, recognizing specific epitopes on the common beta 1 subunit (CD29) of VLA integrins whose expression correlates with the ligand binding activity of these heterodimeric glycoproteins. This correlation has been demonstrated for several integrin heterodimers in different cell systems using a variety of extracellular and intracellular stimuli for integrin activation. Thus, the presence of micromolar concentrations of extracellular Mn2+, preincubation with the activating anti-beta 1 mAb TS2/16, and cell treatment with phorbol esters or calcium ionophores, induced the expression of the HUTS beta 1 epitopes on T lymphoblasts. Using a panel of human-mouse beta 1 chimeric molecules, we have mapped these epitopes to the 355-425 sequence of the beta 1 polypeptide. This segment represents therefore a novel regulatory region of beta 1 that is exposed upon integrin activation. Interestingly, binding of HUTS mAbs to partially activated VLA integrins results in maximal activation of these adhesion receptors and enhancement of cell adhesion to beta 1 integrin ligands collagen, laminin, and fibronectin."

In addition, this drug induces on insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation, concomitantly with an increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation. The present work was aimed at the identification of the serine/threonine residues that, upon phosphorylation, might be involved in modulating insulin signaling. To this end, we studied double-point mutants of IRS-1, in which serines 612/632 and 662/731 were replaced with alanine. These are four plausible sites of phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases and are in the immediate proximity of tyrosine residues, which are potential sites of interaction with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Src homology 2 domains. Using transient expression in 293 EBNA cells, we demonstrate that serines 612, 632, 662, and 731 and mitogen-activated protein kinases are not involved in the okadaic acid effect on IRS-1. Rather, these serines appear to play a role in modulating basal and insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, association of IRS-1 with p85, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in the IRS-1•p85 immune complex, since mutation of these sites enhances these events.

Intensive studies of various Hsp70 and DnaJ-like proteins over the past decade have led to the suggestion that interactions between specific pairs of these two types of proteins permit them to serve as molecular chaperones in a diverse array of protein metabolic events, including protein folding, protein trafficking, and assembly and disassembly of multisubunit protein complexes. To further our understanding of the nature of Hsp70-DnaJ interactions, we have sought to define the minimal sequence elements of DnaJ required for stimulation of the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaK. As judged by proteolysis sensitivity, DnaJ is composed of three separate regions, a 9-kDa NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain, a 30-kDa COOH-terminal domain, and a protease-sensitive glycine- and phenylalanine-rich (G/F-rich) segment of 30 amino acids that serves as a flexible linker between the two domains. The stable 9-kDa proteolytic fragment was identified as the highly conserved J-region found in all DnaJ homologues. Using this structural information as a guide, we constructed, expressed, purified, and characterized several mutant DnaJ proteins that contained either NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal or COOH-terminal deletions. At variance with current models of DnaJ action, DnaJ1-75, a polypeptide containing an intact J-region, was found to be incapable of stimulating ATP hydrolysis by DnaK protein. We found, instead, that two sequence elements of DnaJ, the J-region and the G/F-rich linker segment, are each required for activation of DnaK-mediated ATP hydrolysis and for minimal DnaJ function in the initiation of bacteriophage λ DNA replication. Further analysis indicated that maximal activation of ATP hydrolysis by DnaK requires two independent but simultaneous protein-protein interactions: (i) interaction of DnaK with the J-region of DnaJ and (ii) binding of a peptide or polypeptide to the polypeptide-binding site associated with the COOH-terminal domain of DnaK. This dual signaling process required for activation of DnaK function has mechanistic implications for those protein metabolic events, such as polypeptide translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells, that are dependent on interactions between Hsp70-like and DnaJ-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2120860614,"PreS2-S′-β-galactosidase, a three-domain fusion protein that aggregates extensively in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, was used to systematically investigate the effects of heat-shock protein (hsp) overproduction on protein misfolding and inclusion body formation. While the co-overexpression of the DnaK and DnaJ molecular chaperones led to a 3-6-fold increase in the recovery of enzymatically active preS2-S′-β-galactosidase over a wide range of growth temperatures (30-42°C), an increase in the concentration of the GroEL and GroES chaperonins had a significant effect at 30°C only. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that preS2-S′-β-galactosidase formed a stable complex with DnaK, but not with GroEL, at 42°C. When the intracellular concentration of chromosomal heat-shock proteins was increased by overproduction of the heat-shock transcription factor σ32, or by addition of 3% ethanol (v/v) to the growth medium, a 2-3-fold higher recovery of active enzyme was observed at 30 and 42°C, but not at 37°C. The overexpression of all heat-shock proteins or specific chaperone operons did not significantly affect the synthesis rates or stability of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase and did not lead to the disaggregation of preformed inclusion bodies. Rather, the improvements in the recovery of soluble and active fusion protein resulted primarily from facilitated folding and assembly.

Our findings suggest that titration of the DnaK-DnaJ early folding factors leads to the formation of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase inclusion bodies. It is well established that the high level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli can result in the formation of insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies. Since inclusion bodies consist mainly of the protein of interest and are easily isolated by centrifugation, their formation has often been exploited to simplify purification schemes(1.Georgiou G. Bowden G.A. Ho C. Prokop A. Dajpai A. Recombinant DNA Technology and Applications. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 333-356Google Scholar). The recovery of biologically active products from the aggregated state is typically accomplished by unfolding with chaotropic agents or acids, followed by dilution or dialysis into optimized refolding buffers. However, many polypeptides (e.g. structurally complex oligomeric proteins and those containing multiple disulfide bonds) do not easily adopt an active conformation following chemical denaturation(1.Georgiou G. Bowden G.A. Ho C. Prokop A. Dajpai A. Recombinant DNA Technology and Applications. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 333-356Google Scholar). In such cases, maximizing the yields of recombinant proteins in a soluble and active form in vivo becomes an attractive alternative to in vitro refolding. Molecular chaperones are a ubiquitous class of proteins that play an essential role in protein folding by helping other polypeptides reach a proper conformation or cellular location without becoming part of the final structure(2.Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M.

In E. coli, two molecular chaperone “machines,” DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES, have been studied extensively.

However, higher intracellular concentrations of molecular chaperones had little effect on the proper folding or localization of other recombinant polypeptides(8.Blum P. Velligan M. Lin N. Matin A.

To date, the mechanisms by which molecular chaperones favor the proper folding of specific proteins remain unclear. In this work, we used the preS2-S′-β-galactosidase fusion protein (19.Lee S.C. Choi Y.C. Yu M.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as a model to systematically examine the effects of hsp overexpression on the synthesis and folding/assembly of a highly aggregation-prone protein in E. coli. One direct approach to increase the intracellular concentration of molecular chaperones, overproduction of plasmid-encoded DnaK-DnaJ or GroEL-GroES, and two indirect approaches, overproduction of plasmid-encoded σ32 or addition of ethanol to the growth medium, were investigated. Our results indicate that increased levels of DnaK and DnaJ lead to higher yields of active preS2-S′-β-galactosidase by facilitating the proper folding and assembly of the tetrameric fusion protein. E. coli strain JM105 (20.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) was used as a host strain in all experiments since it carries the Δ(lacZ)M15 deletion (no residual β-galactosidase activity) and lacIq mutation (increased synthesis of the LacI repressor protein). Plasmid pTBG(H+), which encodes the preS2-S′-β-galactosidase fusion protein, has been described previously(19.Lee S.C. Choi Y.C. Yu M.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTG10 is a pACYC184 derived cloning vector(17.Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), and pGroESL (17.Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and pDnaK/J (A. A. Gatenby, E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co.) are pTG10 derivatives encoding the groE and dnaKJ operons, respectively, under control of both their native and lac promoters. Plasmid pσ32, a pTG10 derivative that encodes the rpoH gene under control of the lac promoter only, was constructed by inserting a 1.3-kilobase pair EcoRV fragment from pFN97 (21.Grossman A.D. Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of pTG10. All transformants were obtained by the RbCl2 method and selected at 30°C. LB medium was supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. M9 minimal salts were supplemented with 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM MgSO4, 0.2% glucose, 1% methionine labeling medium (Difco), and the above concentrations of antibiotics. For protein labeling experiments, cells were grown at 30°C to mid-exponential phase (A600 ≈ 0.4) in supplemented M9 labeling medium, induced with 1 mM IPTG, 1The abbreviations used are: IPTGisopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and transferred to 30, 37, or 42°C water baths. Thirty minutes post-induction, 0.8 ml of each culture were transferred to prewarmed Eppendorf tubes containing 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.). After a 2-min labeling period, the proteins were precipitated by addition of 0.8 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in reducing 1 × SDS loading buffer, and approximately 25,000 cpm/lane were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels. The gels were treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont) and exposed to x-ray film. Lightly developed fluorograms were scanned using a Sharp JX-325 high resolution color scanner with transparency attachment. Densitometry analysis was performed using the NIH Image 1.56 software. The intensities of the preS2-S′-β-galactosidase, DnaK and GroEL bands were normalized to an unknown protein that remained essentially constant in all experiments. The choice of other normalization bands had little effect on the results. isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Overnight cultures grown at 30°C in LB medium were used to inoculate triplicate shake flasks (1 to 50 dilution) containing 25 ml of supplemented LB medium. The cells were grown at 30°C to mid-exponential phase (A600 ≈ 0.4), induced with 1 mM IPTG, and returned to 30°C or transferred to water baths at 37 or 42°C. Immediately before addition of IPTG, and 1 and 2 h following induction, 3-ml samples were withdrawn and the absorbance at 600 nm was recorded. For the experiments of Fig. 4B, ethanol was added to the medium prior to inoculation at a 3% (v/v) final concentration. For the experiments of Figure 5, Figure 6, the cultures were shifted to 42°C following IPTG induction. After 1-h incubation at this temperature, neomycin was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, the cultures were returned to 30°C, and 3-ml aliquots were collected at the indicated times. In all cases, the cells were pelleted at 8,000 × g for 8 min, resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate monobasic, pH 6.5, and disrupted using a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. Soluble fractions were immediately clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. β-Galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate on clarified soluble extracts using the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside as described by Miller(22.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Springs Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities are reported in Miller units (1,000 × ΔA420/A600 of culture/ml of culture/min of reaction)(22.Miller J.H.

Mid-exponential phase cells growing at 30°C were induced with 1 mM IPTG, shifted to 42°C for 1 h, and treated with 200 μg/ml neomycin to stop translation before being returned to 30°C. Corresponding whole cell (B), soluble (C), and insoluble (D) fractions from pDnaK/J transformants are shown.

Following IPTG induction, 10-ml aliquots were transferred to fresh flasks and incubated at either 30, 37, or 42°C. After 1 h, 1-ml aliquots of whole cells were pelleted and resuspended in reducing 1 × SDS loading buffer, and 3-ml samples were collected and fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions as described above. The soluble cell extracts were concentrated by a highly efficient methanol-chloroform extraction technique (23.Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) before resuspension, while the insoluble fractions were resuspended directly in reducing 1 × SDS loading buffer. Aliquots corresponding to identical amounts of culture from whole cells and soluble and insoluble fractions were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For the experiments of Fig. 3, 25-ml cultures grown in LB medium were induced as described above, shifted to 42°C, and two 1.6-ml aliquots were collected into siliconized Eppendorf tubes (Marsh) after 1 h. The cells were lysed as described (24.Baneyx F. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11637-11644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the resuspension buffer was 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 20% sucrose, 1 mg/ml lysozyme and the cell lysis buffer was 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20. Clarified soluble extracts were incubated with gentle shaking for one hour at 4°C with either 5 μg of murine monoclonal anti-DnaK (StressGen) or 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-GroEL (Epicentre) antibodies. The samples were treated with 5 mg of swollen protein A-agarose (Sigma) and mixed at 4°C for an additional hour. The Immunobeads were washed(24.Baneyx F. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11637-11644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in 50 μl of reducing 2 × SDS loading buffer, and heated at 95°C for 3 min. Supernatants (10 μl for Fig. 3; 5 μl for Fig. 6) were resolved on duplicate 8% SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. One membrane was probed with either anti-DnaK or anti-GroEL, while the other was probed with murine polyclonal anti-β-galactosidase (Sigma). The immunoreactive bands were detected by colorimetric reaction following incubation with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Plasmid pTBG(H+) encodes preS2-S′-β-galactosidase, a tripartite fusion protein consisting of the 55-residue preS2 domain and the 30-residue hydrophobic S′ domain of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) followed by the E. coli enzyme β-galactosidase(19.Lee S.C. Choi Y.C. Yu M.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this construct, the preS2-S′-β-galactosidase gene is under control of the IPTG-inducible tac promoter. The β-galactosidase activity present in JM109 cells harboring pTBG(H+) has been shown to decrease with increasing growth temperature due to the formation of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase inclusion bodies(19.Lee S.C. Choi Y.C. Yu M.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This relationship between enzymatic activity and aggregation makes this fusion protein a useful model for the study of chaperone-assisted folding pathways in E. coli. To investigate the influence of an increase in the cellular concentration of well characterized molecular chaperones on the expression of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase, E. coli JM105 was co-transformed with pTBG(H+) and either pTG10 (control vector), pDnaK/J (which encodes the dnaKJ operon), or pGroESL (which carries the groE operon). These constructs place the chaperone operons under control of both their native and the IPTG-inducible lac promoters. Pulse labeling experiments followed by normalized videodensitometric scanning of the fluorograms (Fig. 1, Table 1) showed that cells harboring pDnaK/J synthesized 3-4-fold more DnaK than the control strain, but lower amounts of chromosomal GroEL, particularly as the growth temperature was raised. Similarly, the presence of pGroESL led to a 4-fold increase in the relative synthesis rates of GroEL and some variation in the expression of chromosomally-encoded DnaK, although no temperature-dependent trend was detected. However, the overproduction of plasmid-encoded molecular chaperones did not significantly affect the synthesis rates of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase relative to the control cells under the conditions examined (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The effect of molecular chaperone overproduction on the folding and assembly of the tetrameric fusion protein was investigated by enzymatic assays and fractionation experiments as follows. JM105 cells containing various plasmid combinations were grown to mid-exponential phase in LB medium at 30°C, induced with 1 mM IPTG, and either returned to 30°C or shifted to 37 or 42°C. Soluble extracts were prepared 1 and 2 h post-induction and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. In the pTG10 control strain grown at 42°C (Fig. 2F, lane 4), almost all of the recombinant protein was found in an inclusion body form, and less than 800 Miller units of enzymatic activity were present in samples collected two hours post-induction (Fig. 2C, •). In agreement with previous results(19.Lee S.C. Choi Y.C. Yu M.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the activity levels increased 2-3-fold when the growth temperature was lowered to 37°C, and 7-12-fold when the cells were grown at 30°C (Fig. 2, A and B, •). A concomitant increase in the intensity of the soluble preS2-S′-β-galactosidase band was detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, D and E, lanes 3), confirming that aggregation was reduced at lower growth temperatures. The co-overexpression of plasmid-encoded DnaK and DnaJ significantly enhanced the yield of active preS2-S′-β-galactosidase at all temperatures (Fig. 2, A-C, □). At both 37 and 42°C, the enzymatic activity in JM105 cells harboring pDnaK/J was 4-6-fold higher relative to the control strain, while the increase in activity was approximately 3-fold at 30°C. The synergistic effects of reduced growth temperature and overexpression of the dnaKJ operon led to enzymatic activity of 28,000 Miller units 2 h post-induction at 30°C, compared with 10,000 Miller units in the control strain (Fig. 2A). Fractionation experiments (Fig. 2, D-F, lanes 5-7) showed that the increase in activity was accompanied by the partitioning of larger amounts of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase into the soluble fraction of the cells. In contrast, the co-overproduction of the GroEL and GroES chaperonins (Fig. 2, A-C, ▵) had little effect at 37 and 42°C relative to control cultures, but led to a 1.5-fold increase in activity at 30°C. Since the overexpression of DnaK, but not that of GroEL, strongly favored the proper folding of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase, we investigated the ability of the fusion protein to form a stable complex with these chaperones by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. One hour post-induction samples collected from cultures grown at 42°C were immunoprecipitated with a fixed amount of either anti-DnaK or anti-GroEL antibodies, resolved on duplicate SDS gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. One of the membranes was probed with antibodies against β-galactosidase, while the duplicate was treated with either anti-DnaK or anti-GroEL antibodies. Fig. 3A shows that the fusion protein could be readily detected in all samples immunoprecipitated with anti-DnaK antibodies. The fraction of DnaK-bound preS2-S′-β-galactosidase was slightly lower in the strain overexpressing the dnaKJ operon compared with the others, as judged by videodensitometric analysis of the blots (see Fig. 3). However, since the concentration of DnaK is approximately 3-4-fold higher in pDnaK/J transformants (Figure 1, Figure 2F), 2.5-3.5-fold more preS2-S′-β-galactosidase is complexed with DnaK in these cells relative to those harboring pTG10 or pGroESL. We were unable to detect stable complexes between preS2-S′-β-galactosidase and GroEL, even in the strain overproducing the groE operon (data not shown). Thus, preS2-S′-β-galactosidase appears to interact strongly with DnaK, but has little affinity for GroEL under our experimental conditions. Since the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES hsps are believed to act sequentially in the folding of many newly synthesized polypeptides(2.Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev.

In E. coli, the high level transcription of hsps is performed by Eσ32 complexes between the RNA polymerase core enzyme and the heat-shock transcription factor, σ32(21.Grossman A.D. Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27.Tilly K. Spence J. Georgopolous C. J.

We therefore overexpressed σ32 in order to raise the intracellular concentration of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES chaperones, as well as that of other chromosomally encoded heat-shock molecular chaperones. Although certain proteases (e.g. Lon and Clp) are also transcribed by Eσ32, preS2-S′-β-galactosidase is not a target for rapid degradation in the cell (19; see below). Plasmid pσ32, a pTG10 derivative encoding the rpoH gene under control of the lac promoter, was constructed for this analysis. Co-transformation of pσ32 and pTBG(H+) in JM105 cells resulted in a 1.5-2-fold increase in the relative synthesis rates of DnaK, GroEL, and other hsps, but did not significantly affect the expression of the fusion protein as judged by pulse labeling experiments (Table 1). At 30 and 42°C, the presence of pσ32 led to a 2-3-fold increase in the recovery of active preS2-S′-β-galactosidase relative to control cells (Fig. 4A), a level intermediate between that obtained upon overexpression of the dnaKJ or groE operons (see Fig. 2, A and C). At 37°C, however, the enzymatic activity in cells harboring pσ32 was only slightly higher than that measured in the control strain or cells overexpressing the groE operon (Fig. 4A and 2B). Thus, σ32 overproduction facilitates the proper folding of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase at certain temperatures, but remains less efficient than the direct co-overexpression of the dnaKJ operon. In addition to high temperatures, a variety of external stimuli can induce the heat-shock response in E. coli. These include bacteriophage infection, UV irradiation, and the presence of amino acid analogs, heavy metals, or organic solvents in the growth medium(29.Neidhardt F.C. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaecter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

To determine if a stress response elicited by growth in the presence of ethanol could improve the recovery of active preS2-S′-β-galactosidase, JM105 cells harboring pTG10 and pTBG(H+) were grown in LB medium supplemented with various amounts of ethanol and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. An ethanol concentration of 3% (v/v) was selected, since lower concentrations had little effect on the recovery of enzymatic activity, 2J. G. Thomas and F. Baneyx, manuscripts in preparation. and higher concentrations significantly reduce the growth rate of E. coli(30.VanBogelen R.A. Kelley P.M. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 26-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a 2- to 3-fold increase in the recovery of enzymatically active preS2-S′-β-galactosidase was observed at 30 and 42°C, but little improvement was detected at 37°C (Fig. 4B). This pattern is almost identical to that observed upon overproduction of plasmid-encoded σ32 (Fig. 4A). When ethanol was added at the time of IPTG induction, the overall yields of enzymatic activity were reproducibly 10-20% lower than when addition was performed prior to inoculation (data not shown). Whether this slight reduction in yields resulted from the delay necessary to reach a new basal level of hsps (30.VanBogelen R.A. Kelley P.M. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 26-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was not investigated. The improved solubilization of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase associated with the overproduction of molecular chaperones can be explained by two different, but not necessarily exclusive, mechanisms. The first possibility is that the high level expression of preS2-S′-β-galactosidase in the control strain results in a partial titration of the available pool of chaperones, leading to the misfolding and subsequent aggregation of the unchaperoned fraction of the recombinant protein. Under these conditions, chaperone co-overproduction would restore adequate levels of folding factors and thereby promote proper folding. The second possibility is that at high intracellular concentrations certain molecular chaperones (most notably DnaK and DnaJ) are able to disaggregate preS2-S′-β-galactosidase inclusion bodies. In an effort to distinguish between the above mechanisms, the following experiment was performed. JM105 cells harboring various plasmid combinations, and control cell"

Stably transfected C2 muscle cell lines were established in which a mouse IGF-II cDNA was expressed in the antisense orientation relative to the constitutively active Moloney sarcoma virus promoter. IGF-II antisense cells proliferated normally in growth medium containing 20% serum but underwent rapid death when placed in low serum differentiation medium. Death was accompanied by characteristic markers of apoptosis with more than 90% of cells showing DNA fragmentation within 12-16 h.

For lung cancer cells, this approach was initially supported by work from several groups who reported small (milliunits/milliliter) amounts of “IGF-I-like immunoreactivity” in conditioned growth medium from lung cancer cell lines(11.Reeve J.G.

However, these original studies are now recognized to be confused by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP), by IGF-II cross-reactivity with the antibodies used for the IGF-I measurements(13.Blum W.F. Breier B.H. Growth Reg. 1994; 4: 11-19PubMed Google Scholar), and have been contradicted by later analysis of a small number of lung cancer cell lines from one of these groups(11.Reeve J.G. Payne J.A. Bleehen N.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1990; 61: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which suggests low and infrequent expression of IGF-I mRNA and a higher level of IGF-II mRNA expression. Comparing the data in these and other papers, it is apparent that IGF-R is frequently expressed(7.Schardt C. Rotsch M. Erbil C. Goke R. Richter G. Havemann K. Exp.

Elucidation of the identity of the critical IGF-R ligand is necessary for potential early tumor detection and therapeutic interventions in a wide range of human malignancies. In order to determine the identity of the secreted IGF involved in cancer cell autocrine growth, we have carried out an extensive characterization of the expression of IGF mRNA, and the synthesis, processing, and release of IGF peptides by human lung and breast epithelial cancer cell lines. For these studies we used both Northern analysis and reverse transcription of mRNA followed by PCR (RT-PCR) to examine gene expression. We also purified to homogeneity several differentially processed and glycosylated IGF peptides secreted by human cancer cell lines, and we have definitively identified the peptides by amino-terminal Edman sequence analysis. There are six main histologies of lung cancer: the neuroendocrine small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and the non-SCLC (NSCLC), which comprise squamous, adenocarcinoma, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, carcinoid, and large cell tumors. For these studies we analyzed 14 SCLC of classic and variant subtypes, 12 NSCLC cell lines, and 2 breast cancer cell lines obtained from the NCI-Navy Medical Oncology Branch, Bethesda, MD (listed in Table 1). Reagents for cell culture, unless otherwise indicated, were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, or under serum- and hormone-free conditions (R0 medium: phenol red-free RPMI 1640 with 5 mML-glutamine and 5 × 10-8M sodium selenite (Sigma)). Cells and conditioned medium (R0CM) were harvested for analysis after the cells were adapted to the R0 medium and proliferated independently of serum components. Once adapted, the cell lines continue to grow in R0 medium and can undergo multiple passages(16.Siegfried J.M. Han Y. DeMichele M.A. Hunt J.D. Gaither A.L. Cuttitta F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8596-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Cells from one 175-cm2 tissue culture flask (approximately 5 × 106 to 107 cells) were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated directly from cells using a Micro-Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. IGF gene expression was initially analyzed by Northern blot, carried out according to standard procedures (17.Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript(™) kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The single IGF-I gene comprises five exons, which are alternatively spliced to generate two mRNA transcripts(18.Rotwein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The two translation products, the IGF-IA and IGF-IB prohormones, differ in the region that encodes the carboxyl-terminal extension peptide (E-peptide), which is cleaved from pro-IGF-I during biosynthesis(18.Rotwein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Reactions for amplification of IGF-I cDNA were primed with an oligonucleotide complementary to the common mRNA region, which encodes the IGF-I NH2 terminus, and antisense primers were complementary to sequences in the IGF-IA and IGF-IB splice variants. The primers had the following sequences: IGF-I sense, 5′-GGACCGGAGACGCTCTGCGG-3′; IGF-IA antisense, 5′-TCTACTTGCGTTCTTCAAAT-3′; IGF-IB antisense, 5′-TTTGCCTCTGCATTCAGCAT-3′. The IGF-II gene encodes a single prepro-IGF-II, from which the mature 67 amino acid IGF-II is cleaved during biosynthesis(19.Nielson F.C. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 257-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Primers for the amplification of IGF-II cDNA sequences were as follows: IGF-II sense, 5′-AGTCGATGCTGGTGCTTCTCA-3′; IGF-II antisense, 5′-GTGGGCGGGGTCTTGGGTGGGTAG-3′. The integrity of the RNA and the efficiency of RT-PCR were monitored by amplifying the cDNA with primers specific for human type I IGF-R, which is ubiquitously expressed by human lung cancer cell lines. The primers for amplification of IGF-R were as follows: IGF-R sense, 5′-ATTGAGGAGGTCACAGAGAAC-3′; IGF-R antisense, 5′-TTCATATCCTGTTTTGGCCTG-3′. PCR reaction mixes consisted of 2 μl of cDNA, 100 ng each of 3′ and 5′ primer, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Ampli-Taq, Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer) in 100 μl of PCR buffer (1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3). For amplification of IGF-I sequences, 35 cycles of PCR was programmed as follows: 94°C, 15 s/50°C, 15 s/72°C, 15 s; followed by a final 5-min extension at 72°C. For PCR with IGF-II and IGF-R primers, the annealing temperature was raised to 60°C. Gels were Southern blotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schull) in 20 × SSC, baked at 80°C for 2 h, and hybridized overnight at 42°C with 106 cpm/ml oligonucleotide probe complementary to sequences found between the PCR primers. The sequence of the antisense oligonucleotide probes were as follows: IGF-IA probe, 5′GCGCTCGGCACGGACAGAGCG; IGF-IB probe, 5′-TCCAATCTCCCTCCTCTGCT-3′; IGF-II probe, 5′AGGCGCTGGGTGGACTGC-3′; IGF-R probe, 5′-GTACTCTGTCTCCAGCTCTTC-3′. The probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and diluted in hybridization buffer-N(17.Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). After hybridization the blots were washed at room temperature twice in 2 × SSC and once in 0.5 × SSC. Autoradiography was performed at −70°C on Kodak X-AR film with an intensifying screen. PCR product derived from cell line H1385 was cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using the dsCycle sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot studies investigating the secretion of IGF peptides from cultured cell lines, a commercial monoclonal anti-IGF-I (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), reported to show 50% cross-reactivity with IGF-II, was used. An IGF-I-specific antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with a peptide antigen comprising amino acids 26-41 of the mature IGF-I peptide. The peptide was amidated at the carboxyl terminus to enhance stability in vivo, and a tyrosine residue was included to allow iodination of the synthetic peptide. The sequence of the peptide IGFY26-41 was H2N-YNKPTGYGSSSRRAPQT-CONH2. Of this sequence only three amino acids (Ser35-Arg37) are shared with IGF-II. Sera from rabbits immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide and the anti-IGF mAb were evaluated for specificity of IGF-I and IGF-II detection by Western immunoblot. Samples were separated electrophoretically on a 10-20% polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) using the Tricine buffer system(20.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10468) Google Scholar), electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Millipore-Waters, Bedford, MA), blots were blocked at 37°C for 2 h in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4°C in 1 μg/ml anti-IGF monoclonal antibody or 1/1000 dilution rabbit anti-IGFY26-41. For detection of bound antibody with 125I-protein A, blots probed with anti-IGF mAb were incubated with a secondary antibody (1/1000 rabbit anti-mouse antibody; DakoPatts, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. Washed blots were incubated with 106 cpm 125I-protein A (1 h, room temperature), washed, and autoradiographed. The specificity of the immunodetection was established by presaturating the diluted antibodies with 1 μM rhIGF. For quantitation, blots were scanned using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Initially, both whole cell lysates and conditioned medium from cultured cell lines were screened for IGFs by immunoblot analysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing 106 cells directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without mercaptoethanol or bromphenol blue). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 g, and protein was estimated using the BCA assay (Pierce). Up to 100 μg of total cellular protein was electrophoresed for immunoblot assay of intracellular IGFs. For analysis of IGF peptides secreted into R0CM, the CM was collected and IGF peptides were concentrated by HPLC. Cell lines were initially screened for the secretion of IGF peptides by collection of 7-day conditioned medium from cells grown with R0 medium. The R0CM was clarified by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4°C and stored at −20°C in the presence of the protease inhibitors bacitracin (1 μM; Bachem, Torrance, CA), phosphoramidon (1 μM, Sigma), and Pefabloc (1 mM) added to the R0CM after collection. Five hundred milliliters of R0CM was adjusted to pH 2.5 with trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce), mixed at 4°C overnight, centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min, and filtered through a 0.45 μM filter. The R0CM was adjusted to 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and pumped at 15 ml/min onto a C4 reverse phase column (30 mm × 30 cm DeltaPak 300R, Millipore-Waters) equilibrated in 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The column was washed with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), and a biphasic gradient was applied with acetonitrile increased from 10% to 35% (v/v) over 15 min and to 45% (v/v) over the next 30 min. Fractions (0.48 min; 12 ml) were collected, freeze-dried and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Before each R0CM was chromatographed, a blank gradient was run and screened for residual immunoreactivity from the previous run. IGF-I and IGF-II standards were chromatographed under identical conditions after all the R0CM samples were processed. R0CM (500 ml) from the cell line NCI-H2087 was supplemented with 5 μg of rhIGF-I (final concentration 1.2 nM) and fractionated by C4 HPLC as described above. Fractions were collected, freeze-dried, and analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of IGF-I and IGF-II. The IGF-positive fractions were pooled and treated in an identical fashion for the purification and NH2-terminal sequencing of the IGF peptides (see below) as those isolated from unsupplemented R0CM. For isolation of anti-IGF immunoreactivity, R0CM (up to 10 liters) was fractionated by preparative scale HPLC on a C4 column. Fractions positive for IGF immunoreactivity were applied to a phenyl reverse-phase HPLC column (5 μ; 2.1 mm × 25 cm, Vydac, The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (v/v) (HFBA, Pierce), and eluted with a gradient to 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% HFBA (v/v) over 150 min at 1 ml/min. One-minute fractions were collected. For amino acid sequencing, fractions containing the 6- and 14-kDa immunoreactive species were freeze-dried and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer and separated on 15-cm 16% Tricine-PAGE gels(20.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10468) Google Scholar). On the 16% gel, the IGF standards migrated close to 7.5 kDa. The fractions containing the 23-kDa immunoreactive IGF species were rechromatographed on an analytical C4 column with a gradient from 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) to 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over 60 min. Thirty-second (0.5 ml) fractions were collected. The positive fractions were electrophoresed on a 15-cm 12% Tricine SDS-PAGE gel. Samples for sequencing were electroblotted onto PVDF in 10 mM CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% (v/v) methanol for 2 h at 100 V at 4°C. The blots were stained with 0.125% Coomassie Blue R250, 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol (w/v/v). Bands of the appropriate electrophoretic mobility were excised and sequenced by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 494 Procise Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer). Both IGF-I and IGF-II were co-expressed by the majority of cell lines tested, and all cell lines expressed mRNA for the IGF-R (summarized in Table 1). Corroborating an earlier report on a small number of cell lines, the level of IGF-II mRNA in some lung cancer cell lines appeared higher than that of IGF-I(10.Zia, F., Jacobs, S., Kull, F., Jr., Cuttitta, F., Mulshine, J., Moody, T. (1996) J. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar), i.e. IGF-I mRNA was not detectable by Northern blot for any cell line. However, IGF-II mRNA was detectable for three of the 23 lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H820, -H69C, and -H2087) and for the breast cancer cell line H2380 (data not shown). The pattern of IGF and IGF-R gene expression by RT-PCR in a subset of the cancer cell lines is shown in Fig. 1(A and B). The majority of lung cancer cell lines (21/26) co-expressed both the IGF-IA and IGF-IB splice variants. Both breast cancer cell lines H2380 and MCF-7 expressed IGF-II, whereas MCF-7 was negative for both IGF-I mRNA forms and H2380 expressed both variants (Fig. 1B). After this current study was completed, a third IGF-I splice variant, also differing in the region that encodes the E-peptide, was described (21.Chew S. Lavender P. Clark A. Ross R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date we have not characterized its expression in these human cancer cell lines. There was no change in the overall pattern of IGF gene expression when cells were adapted to growth under R0 conditions, with the exception of three cell lines, NCI-H720, -H1092, and -H146, which began to express low levels of the IGF-IB splice variant. Although the pattern of IGF gene expression by the cell lines appeared to be largely unchanged after adaptation to R0 conditions, there may be quantitative differences in the mRNA levels that were not detected using the current techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of the anti-IGF antibodies used to screen Western blots is shown in Fig. 2. No specific IGF immunoreactivity was detected in whole cell lysates of the cancer cell lines with either of the anti-IGF antibodies. As the commercial anti-IGF mAb proved to be sensitive for the detection of both IGF-I and -II, this antibody was used for the initial screening of HPLC-fractionated R0CM. In the initial screening of 500 ml of R0CM, immunoreactivity was detected in medium conditioned by only 3/10 cell lines: NCI-H820, NCI-H2087, and NCI-H2380. Fig. 3A shows the chromatogram obtained when R0CM from the cell line NCI-H2087 was fractionated on a C4 column. IGF immunoreactivity (Fig. 3B) was in present as three bands of 23, 14, and 6-kDa and eluted in fractions 34-36. When IGF-I and IGF-II standards were chromatographed on the preparative C4 column, they had the same retention time as the immunoreactivity from R0CM and they co-migrated with Mr 6000 species on the mini-gels used for the immunoblotting (data not shown). The relative intensity and distribution of the three immunoreactive species varied between these cell lines (Fig. 3C). Electrophoresis under reducing conditions did not alter the apparent size of the three immunoreactive species, suggesting that they are monomeric species. When larger volumes of R0CM (3-7.5 liters) from the cell lines NCI-H345 and NCI-N417 were concentrated on the C4 column, weak immunoreactive bands corresponding to Mr 6000 were detected after extended exposure of Western blots (data not shown). R0CM from the cell lines NCI-H187 (2 liters), NCI-H1385 (1.5 liters), NCI-H510 (3 liters), MCF-7 (2 liters), and NCI-H460 (3 liters) tested negative for IGF immunoreactivity. The specificity of the immunoreactivity detected by the IGF mAb in concentrated R0CM is shown in Fig. 4(top panel). When the anti-IGF mAb was preincubated with 1 μM IGF-I, the immunoreactive material was no longer recognized, indicating that it is specific and IGF-related (Fig. 4, lanes B). The polyclonal anti-IGF-IY26-41 did not detect any immunoreactive material in the NCI-H2087 R0CM shown or in R0CM from any of the other cell lines investigated (Fig. 4, top panel, lane C). This antibody is highly specific for rhIGF-I and did not recognize 100 ng IGF-II on Western blot (Fig. 2, lower panel), although it is approximately as sensitive as the less specific commercial mAb for IGF-I. The Mr 6000 immunoreactive species co-migrates with rhIGF on SDS-PAGE and presumably represents mature IGF. The failure of the anti-IGF-IY26-41 to recognize this band suggested that it was IGF-II. The larger molecular size immunoreactive species presumably represent unprocessed or partially processed IGF prohormones. The ability of the anti-IGF-IY26-41 to recognize incompletely processed IGF-I prohormone is not known, and the failure of this antibody to recognize the 14- and 23-kDa immunoreactive species did not eliminate the possibility that these forms were unprocessed or partially processed IGF-I prohormones. The failure of the anti-IGF-IY26-41 antibody to detect fully processed 7.5-kDa IGF-I in the fractionated R0CM samples raised the possibility that it may have become degraded or was inefficiently recovered by the isolation procedures. To address this concern, rhIGF-I was added in a physiologically relevant concentration (2.5 μg/liter; 1.2 nM) into H2087 R0CM after collection, stored as usual, and fractionated on the C4 column in a process identical to the other R0CMs. The second panel of Fig. 4 demonstrates that the exogenous IGF-I was recovered and could be detected by the anti-IGFY26-41 anti-serum. We also used Edman degradation to confirm that IGF-I sequence, at the level of 10 pmol, coul"

https://openalex.org/W1631803278,"Initiation of lipid peroxidation by Cu(II) requires reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) as a first step. It is unclear, however, whether this reaction occurs in the course of lipoprotein oxidation. It is also unknown which reductant, if any, can drive the reduction of Cu(II) in this case. We found that Cu(II) was rapidly reduced to Cu(I) by all major human lipoproteins (high, low, and very low density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and VLDL), and chylomicrons). Cu(II)-reducing activity was associated with a lipid moiety of the lipoproteins. The rates of Cu(II) reduction by different lipoproteins were similar when the lipoproteins were adjusted to similar α-tocopherol concentrations. Enriching lipoproteins with α-tocopherol considerably increased the rate of Cu(II) reduction. Cu(II) reduction by α-tocopherol-deficient LDL isolated from a patient with familial inherited vitamin E deficiency was found to occur much slower in comparison with LDL isolated from a donor with a normal plasma level of α-tocopherol. Initial rate of Cu(II) reduction by α-tocopherol-deficient LDL was found to be zero. Enriching LDL with ubiquinol-10 to concentrations close to those of α-tocopherol did not influence the reaction rate.

Microsequence analysis revealed that this 55-kDa protein was p54nrb (nuclear RNA-binding protein, 54 kDa) a RNA-binding protein highly similar to the splicing factor PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor). In this paper, we show that Spi-1/PU.1 impedes the binding of p54nrb to RNA and alters the splicing process in vitro. Moreover, we present evidence that the transcriptional factor Spi-1/PU.1, unlike other Ets proteins, is able to bind RNA. Altogether, these results raise the intriguing possibility that the functional interference observed between Spi-1/PU.1 and RNA-binding proteins might represent a novel mechanism in malignant erythropoiesis. In the Friend spleen focus forming virus-induced erythroleukemia, the insertional mutagenesis of the spi-1 gene appears to be related to the emergence of a clonal population of tumorigenic erythroid cells arrested in their differentiation at the proerythroblast stage. Such activation of spi-1 results in an overexpression of the normal Spi-1/PU.1 protein in the Friend tumor cells(1.Moreau-Gachelin F. Tavitian A. Tambourin P. Nature. 1988; 331: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). spi-1 encodes the PU.1 protein, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors(2.Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Its DNA binding domain targets specific sequences around a central core 5′-GGAA-3′ in transcriptional promoters and enhancers of some myelomonocytic, mastocytic, and B lymphoid genes(3.Moreau-Gachelin F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 149-163PubMed Google Scholar). Spi-1/PU.1 contains also an amino-terminal transactivator domain and a central PEST region that could be involved in interactions with proteins like the retinoblastoma protein(4.Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the transcription factor TFIID(4.Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J.

The down-regulation of spi-1 during the chemically induced differentiation of the Friend tumor cells (7.Delgado M.D. Hallier M. Meneceur P. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1723-1727PubMed Google Scholar) and the severe anemia developed by the Spi-1/PU.1 transgenic mice (8.Moreau-Gachelin F. Wendling F. Molina T. Denis N. Titeux M. Grimber G. Briand P. Vainchenker W. Tavitian A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) suggest that spi-1 plays a role in the transformation of the proerythroblast by blocking its differentiation. The oncogenic potential of Spi-1/PU.1 may result from targeting of inappropriate regulatory elements of some erythroid genes and/or an abnormal association with erythroid partners. In order to determine whether Spi-1/PU.1 interacts specifically with nuclear proteins from Friend cells, a glutathione S-transferase-Spi-1/PU.1 fusion protein was used as affinity chromatographic reagent. We report here that the RNA-binding protein p54nrb(9.Dong B. Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was identified by this procedure as a putative partner of Spi-1/PU.1. In addition, this study reveals the ability of Spi-1/PU.1 to bind RNA and to interfere in vitro with splicing process. This novel property of Spi-1/PU.1, characterized as a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator, provides new insights into the molecular mechanism involved in malignant hematopoiesis.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1723-1727PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proteins were produced by TNT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems according to the Promega Protocols. In vitro translated Spi-1/PU.1, Spi-B, Fli-1, and Ets-2 proteins were incubated for 1 h in HN buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100) with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, extensively washed, eluted, and fractionated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The pEXV-Spi-1 and pJ3-tag-Myc-p54nrb expression vectors were transfected into COS1 cells by electroporation(7.Delgado M.D. Hallier M. Meneceur P. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1723-1727PubMed Google Scholar). COS1 nuclear extracts (11.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) were adjusted to a final concentration of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, precleared 30 min with protein G-Sepharose at 4°C, and immunoprecipitated overnight with 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (12.Roth M. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) bound to protein G-Sepharose. After three washes in HN buffer, immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell). Western blot analysis was performed according to the ECL protocol (Amersham Corp.), using the anti-Myc antibody (9E10) or an affinity-purified anti-Spi-1/PU.1 antibody(7.Delgado M.D. Hallier M. Meneceur P. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1723-1727PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translated Spi-1/PU.1 protein was incubated with 32P-5′-end-labeled κE3′ DNA probe (5.Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Mol. Cell.

Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 15 min. For competitive experiments, the κE3′probe was incubated with Spi-1/PU.1 before addition of 250 ng of homoribopolymers (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). RNA were transcribed in vitro using [α-32P]UTP and SP6 polymerase following the recommendations of the supplier (Promega). The gel mobility shift assay was carried out with 32P-labeled RNA polypyrimidine tract of the β-tropomyosin intron probe (13.Clouet d'Orval B. d'Aubenton Carafa Y. Sirand-Pugnet P. Gallego M. Brody E. Marie J. Science. 1991; 252: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and GST fusion proteins. The reaction mixture for binding was 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of yeast transfer RNA. Northwestern blotting was carried out according to Crozat et al.(14). RNA binding studies were carried out as described by Ohno et al.(15.Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar) in the binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). A human β-globin minigene from exon 1 to exon 2 was transcribed and 32P-labeled in vitro from the plasmid pSP64(16.Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Splicing reactions (25 μl) were carried out with 10 μl of HeLa nuclear extracts in a buffer containing 3.2 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 0.5 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 1% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, and 4 ng of 32P-labeled β-globin pre-mRNA. After 3 h of incubation at 30°C the RNA was purified and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel in 8 M urea, as described elsewhere(16.Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). GST and GST-fusion proteins were incubated for 10 min with HeLa cell nuclear extracts (11.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) before addition of 32P-labeled β-globin mRNA. For preclearing assay, 50 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 20 μl of Sepharose-GST or Sepharose-GST-Spi-1 proteins equilibrated in buffer D(11.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, 15 μl of precleared extracts were used in the splicing assay. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the murine Spi-1/PU.1 protein (GST-Spi-1) bound to glutathione-Sepharose was used as affinity chromatographic reagent to search for putative partners of Spi-1/PU.1. GST-Spi-1 was incubated with nuclear extracts from the murine Friend erythroleukemia cell line 745A. The proteins recovered on GST-Spi-1-glutathione-Sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. One protein, with apparent molecular mass around 55 kDa, was retained specifically by the GST-Spi-1 fusion protein (data not shown). This 55-kDa protein was purified on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 2M. Hallier, A. Tavitian, and F. Moreau-Gachelin, manuscript in preparation. A 15-amino acid internal peptide was subjected to amino acid sequence determination. A data base search revealed that this sequence (LEMEMEAARHEHQVM) perfectly matched to the nuclear RNA-binding protein p54nrb (54 kDa)(9.Dong B. Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). p54nrb is highly related to the human splicing factor PSF (PTB-associated splicing factor) (17.Patton J.G. Porro E.B. Galceran J. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) in a 320-amino acid region containing a RNA binding domain with two RNA recognition motifs (RRM/RBD/RNP-CS) (Fig. 1A). Spi-1/PU.1 and its related protein Spi-B(18.Ray D. Bosselut R. Ghysdael J. Mattei M.G. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4297-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), are the most phylogenetically divergent members of the Ets family. Their Ets domains are 70% homologous and present only 35-40% sequence identity with that of Fli-1 (19.Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Cell. 1991; 66: 831-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and Ets-2(20.Bosselut R. Duvall J.F. Gegonne A. Bailly M. Hemar A. Brady J. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3137-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The specificity of binding of p54nrb to Spi-1/PU.1 was approached by investigating whether other Ets proteins: Fli-1, Ets-2, and Spi-B, were able to interact with p54nrb. GST-p54nrb fusion protein was incubated in the presence of 35S-labeled Spi-1/PU.1, Spi-B, Ets-2, and Fli-1 proteins translated in reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 1B). Only Spi-1/PU.1 and Spi-B bound GST-p54nrb, revealing that in vitro association of p54nrb with Spi proteins is not a general property of the Ets proteins. Spi-1/PU.1 contains three domains: the transactivation domain (amino acids 1-111), the PEST domain (amino acids 111-158), and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) including the Ets motif (amino acids 158-266). The Spi-1/PU.1 domain (Fig. 1A) involved in the association of Spi-1/PU.1 with p54nrb was mapped by testing interactions of 35S-labeled in vitro translated p54nrb with various deleted forms of GST-Spi-1 (Fig. 1A). Data in Fig. 1C showed that only the entire Spi-1/PU.1 (GST-Spi-1) and its DNA-binding domain (GST-DBD-Spi-1) interacted with p54nrb protein. The same results were obtained for Spi-B (data not shown). In contrast, the DBD of Fli-1 fused to GST did not interact with p54nrb. In these experiments, we ascertained that the DNA binding domains of Spi-1/PU.1 and Fli-1 fused to GST were able to bind their respective responsive element in band shift assay (data not shown). p54nrb, like PSF(17.Patton J.G. Porro E.B. Galceran J. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), contains a central RNA binding domain with two RNA recognition motifs (RRM). Different truncated GST-p54nrb fusion proteins (Fig. 1A) were tested for their abilities to bind in vitro35S-translated Spi-1/PU.1 protein. Interactions occurred only between the entire GST-p54nrb protein or the GST-RBD-p54nrb, suggesting that p54nrb bound Spi-1/PU.1 by its RNA binding domain. The RNA binding activities of GST-p54nrb and GST-RBD-p54nrb were controlled on a Northwestern blot probed with 32P-labeled poly(A)+ mRNAs from 745A cells (Fig. 4A). Altogether, these data suggested that the interaction of the transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 with the RNA-binding protein p54nrb involved their respective DNA- and RNA-binding domains. Then, we searched whether p54nrb and Spi-1/PU.1 could be coimmunoprecipitated when coexpressed in COS cells (Fig. 2). Nuclear extracts from transfected COS cells were immunoprecipitated under low stringency conditions with the antibody against 9E10 Myc epitope (12.Roth M. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) used to tag p54nrb (tag-Myc-p54nrb). The presence of Spi-1/PU.1 in Myc immunoprecipitates was assessed by immunoblotting with an antibody against Spi-1/PU.1 (7.Delgado M.D. Hallier M. Meneceur P. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1723-1727PubMed Google Scholar) and was detected only in COS cells transfected with both Spi-1/PU.1 and p54nrb expression vectors. This provided evidence that Spi-1/PU.1 was associated with p54nrbin vivo. The interaction between the DBD of Spi-1/PU.1 and the RBD of p54nrb suggested that it could alter the function of each partner. p54nrb altered neither the binding of Spi-1/PU.1 on various DNA-responsive elements nor the transcriptional activity of Spi-1/PU.1 in CAT assay (data not shown). We sought to discover whether Spi-1/PU.1 might change the behavior of the RNA-binding protein p54nrb. The pyrimidine-rich sequence of the branchpoint/polypyrimidine tract RNA, which is part of most 3′ splice sites in mammalian introns, is targeted by PSF(17.Patton J.G. Porro E.B. Galceran J. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Since p54nrb presents 70% identity with PSF in its RRM, we tested whether p54nrb could bind such RNA sequence. We observed (Fig. 3) that, like PSF, p54nrb binds the pyrimidine-rich sequence of the 3′ splice site in the intron of the β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA(13.Clouet d'Orval B. d'Aubenton Carafa Y. Sirand-Pugnet P. Gallego M. Brody E. Marie J. Science. 1991; 252: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, this RNA sequence was used as probe in EMSA (Fig. 3). Increasing amounts of GST-Spi-1 mixed with an equal input of GST-p54nrb reduced the formation of the GST-p54nrb-RNA complex in a dose-dependent manner, revealing that Spi-1/PU.1 impedes the binding of p54nrb to RNA. The binding of Spi-1/PU.1 to the RNA-binding protein p54nrb prompted us to check whether Spi-1/PU.1 binds RNA. Various deletion mutants of Spi-1/PU.1 and p54nrb fused to GST were analyzed by Northwestern blot using the labeled poly(A)+ mRNAs from 745A cell line as a probe. Fig. 4A revealed that Spi-1/PU.1, by its DNA binding domain, was able to interact with RNAs as the RNA-binding domain of p54nrb. To further investigate the interaction of Spi-1/PU.1 with RNA, we tested its ability to bind homoribonucleotide polymers fixed to agarose beads. Spi-1/PU.1 (and Spi-B not shown) bound preferentially the homoribopoly(G) (Fig. 4B). This affinity of Spi-1/PU.1 for poly(G) appeared functionally relevant since in EMSA performed with the Spi-1/PU.1 DNA-responsive element κE3′(5.Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), an excess of poly(G) competed the binding of Spi-1/PU.1 to DNA sequence (Fig. 4C). Elsewhere, in competitive experiments (Fig. 3), p54nrb exhibited affinity for poly(G) and poly(U) revealing that Spi-1/PU.1 and p54nrb display a similar ability to bind poly(G). In agreement with the absence of in vitro-interaction between p54nrb and Fli-1 or Ets-2, we observed that the DNA binding activity of Fli-1 fused to GST was not affected by an excess of homoribopolymers (data not shown) and that Fli-1 and Ets-2 did not bind any homoribopolymers (Fig. 4B). These data brought a first evidence that the transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 was able to bind RNA. Due to the extensive homology between p54nrb and PSF, a factor involved in RNA splicing, we asked whether Spi-1/PU.1 might interfere with the splicing process. In vitro splicing reactions were performed with HeLa cell nuclear extracts and a pre-mRNA transcribed from a minigene containing human β-globin exons 1 and 2. The addition of GST-Spi-1/PU.1 inhibited the formation of the spliced transcript, whereas addition of another Ets protein, like GST-Fli-1 protein, did not (Fig. 5). This suggests that alteration of splicing process did not result from an excess of an Ets protein in splicing extracts. Moreover, the DNA-binding domain of Spi-1/PU.1 that contains the RNA binding activity appeared sufficient to inhibit the formation of the spliced transcript (Fig. 5). Noteworthily, when the HeLa cell nuclear extracts were precleared on GST-Spi-1 column before splicing reactions, their splicing activity was lost (Fig. 5). This suggests that the alteration of β-globin splicing by Spi-1/PU.1 occurred through a direct trapping of proteins involved in the splicing process. Altogether, these data suggest that Spi-1/PU.1 could interfere with splicing events. The molecular mechanism by which the transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 blocks the differentiation of proerythroblast and promotes their malignant transformation in the Friend erythroleukemia is not understood. Until now Spi-1/PU.1 was considered as a transcriptional regulator, targeting purine-rich DNA sequences in promoters and enhancers of some hematopoietic genes. The finding that Spi-1/PU.1 interacts with RNA-binding proteins and binds RNAs raises the possibility that in vivo, an elevated level of Spi-1/PU.1 may lead Spi-1/PU.1 to change the activities of RNA-binding proteins, like p54nrb. Interestingly, some human sarcoma (21.Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. De Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2865-2868PubMed Google Scholar) are associated with chromosomal translocations that lead to the fusion of the two highly similar RNA-binding proteins TLS (14.Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 24.Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat.

Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), deleted in their RRM, with proteins that either mediate DNA binding like Fli-1 and Erg. Only the fusion proteins that exhibit altered RNA binding and transcriptional activities as compared to the native proteins (15.Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar) are oncogenic. It can be speculated that Spi-1/PU.1 normally binds DNA and regulates transcription of some hematopoietic genes through its cooperation with the transcriptional machinery. Unphysiological high concentration of Spi-1/PU.1, consecutive to insertional mutagenesis, may promote its interaction with proteins involved in premRNA splicing. Although the function of p54 is unknown, its high homology with PSF and its ability to bind polypyrimidine sequences are indicative of a putative role in post-transcriptional modifications of RNA. Thus, Spi-1/PU.1 might disturb the post-transcriptional gene regulation by sequestering some RNA-binding proteins like p54nrb. This alteration in alternative splicing, by preventing normal or promoting abnormal splicing complex formation, could be a mechanism involved in leukemogenesis. We thank J. Marie for providing the cDNA encoding the β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA, A. Bernstein for the gift of Fli-1 cDNA, and D. Ray-Gallet for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2014085191,"Mitogenic stimulation of T-lymphocytes causes a rapid activation or protein synthesis, which reflects in part increased expression of many translation components. Their levels, however, rise more slowly than the rate of protein synthesis, indicating an enhancement of the efficiency of their utilization. Initiation factor eIF2B catalyzes a key regulatory step in the initiation of translation, and we have therefore studied its activity following T-cell activation. eIF2B activity rises quickly, increasing as early as 5 min after cell stimulation. This initial phase is followed by an additional slow but substantial increase in eIF2B activity. The level of eIF2B subunits did not change over the initial rapid phase but did increase at later time points. Northern analysis revealed that levels of eIF2B mRNA only rose during the later phase. The rapid activation of EIF2B following mitogenic stimulation of T-cells is therefore mediated by factors other than its own concentration. The largest (epsilon) subunit of eIF2B is a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), the activity of which rapidly decreases following T-cell activation. Since phosphorylation of eIF2B by GSK-3 appears to inhibit nucleotide exchange in vitro, this provides a potential mechanism by which eIF2B may be activated."

We have utilized the catalytic activity of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex to report the effect of phospholipid membranes on binding of factor IXa to factor VIIIa and on enzymatic cleavage of the product. The apparent affinity of factor IXa for factor VIIIa was 10-fold lower in the absence of phospholipid membranes with a KD of 46 nMversus 4.3 nM with phospholipid membranes. The Kmfor activation of factor X by the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex was 1700 nM in solution, 70-fold higher than the value of 28 nM when bound to membranes containing phosphatidyl-L-serine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine at a ratio of 4:20:76. The largest effect of phosphatidyl-L-serine-containing membranes on the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex was the accelerated rate of peptide bond cleavage, with the kcat increased by 1,500-fold from 0.022 to 33 min-1. Membranes in which phosphatidyl-L-serine was replaced by phosphatidyl-D-serine, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylglycerol were at least 10-fold less effective for enhancing the kcat. Thus, while membranes containing phosphatidyl-L-serine enhance condensation of the enzyme with its cofactor and substrate, their largest effect is activation of the assembled factor VIIIa-factor IXa enzyme complex. Factor IXa, a serine protease of blood coagulation, functions at least 100,000 times more efficiently when bound to factor VIIIa on a phospholipid membrane than when free in solution. We have utilized the catalytic activity of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex to report the effect of phospholipid membranes on binding of factor IXa to factor VIIIa and on enzymatic cleavage of the product. The apparent affinity of factor IXa for factor VIIIa was 10-fold lower in the absence of phospholipid membranes with a KD of 46 nMversus 4.3 nM with phospholipid membranes. The Kmfor activation of factor X by the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex was 1700 nM in solution, 70-fold higher than the value of 28 nM when bound to membranes containing phosphatidyl-L-serine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine at a ratio of 4:20:76.

This study examines the relationship between cytokine-stimulated NO production and L-arginine transport in cultured VSMC. Cultured VSMC from rat aorta were stimulated with interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and/or angiotensin II (Ang II); and the accumulation of nitrite, a stable product of NO metabolism, in the culture media and the rates of net L-arginine uptake were measured. Interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, alone or in combination, stimulated both the uptake of L-arginine and the accumulation of nitrite in the culture media in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of NOS activity by substituted analogues of L-arginine had no effect on cytokine-stimulated L-arginine transport. Ang II in the presence of cytokines up-regulated L-arginine transport while inhibiting nitrite accumulation. Two forms of the L-arginine transporter, cat-1b and cat-2, are expressed in VSMC. Northern analysis revealed that the cytokine-stimulated increase in L-arginine transport coincided with increased levels of cat-2 mRNA. In contrast, cat-1b does not appear to be regulated by cytokines at the mRNA level, although significant increases in response to Ang II were observed. These results show that, while cytokines can stimulate both NOS activity and L-arginine uptake, NO production is not required to signal the increase in L-arginine transport. Furthermore, Ang II and cytokine stimulation of L-arginine uptake involves the differential regulation of the cationic amino acid transporter (cat) genes.

Vanhoutte P.M. Eur. Heart J. 1993; 14: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar), and several studies have shown that excess production of NO may contribute to the hypotension and vascular hyporesponsiveness observed in septic shock. The activation of inflammatory cells during infection leads to the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and γ-interferon. These cytokines, along with bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), can stimulate the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in most vascular cells, including tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)(2.Schini V.B.

Expression of iNOS leads to the sustained production of NO as measured by the accumulation of its stable end product, nitrite. Recently, treatment of sepsis patients with NOS inhibitors was shown to produce a widespread increase in vascular tone and a rise in blood pressure(6.Petros A. Lamb G. Leone A. Moncada S. Bennett D. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This observation, along with the finding that mice lacking a functional inos gene have an increased survival rate over wild-type animals during LPS-induced septic shock(7.Wei X. Charles I.G. Smith A.

Because NO production requires free L-arginine as a substrate, the availability of L-arginine provides a potential regulatory site for NO production. Cationic amino acids are transported across mammalian cell membranes by a small number of well defined transport systems (y+, bo,+ y+L)(8.White M.F. Biochim. Biophys.

The first was detected and cloned from a rat hepatoma genomic library (20.Wu J.Y. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have reported the partial cloning of a cDNA for a second gene (cat-1b) from VSMC(12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These cells also express a cat-2 homologue. In murine macrophages LPS- and γ-interferon-induced NO production is absolutely dependent on the availability of extracellular L-arginine. When murine macrophages were treated with LPS, System y+ transport activity was shown to be increased more than 10-fold(21.Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. Bannai S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Bogle R.G. Baydoun A.R. Pearson J.D. Moncada S. Mann G.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The induction of L-arginine transport was sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, implying that the LPS-stimulated activity of System y+ in these cells requires the de novo protein synthesis(23.Baydoun A.R. Bogle R.G. Pearson J.D. Mann G.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work was to determine whether the cytokine stimulation of NO production in VSMC was associated with changes in the System y+ transport activity and with specific changes in the expression of cat genes. Cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells were established and maintained as described previously (24.Harris E.L. Grigor M.R. Millar J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cells were isolated from aortae of 15-20-week-old rats by enzymatic digestion (24.Harris E.L. Grigor M.R. Millar J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plastic dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, made quiescent by removal of serum for 48 h, and then exposed to cytokines or hormones for periods of up to 24 h. Nitrite accumulation in the media was measured (27.Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E. Chadhuri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

L-Arginine uptake was determined as described by Low and Grigor (12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in cells that had previously been depleted of intracellular free amino acids by incubation for 3 h in 0.5 ml of Na/HEPES buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mMD-glucose, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Buffer was removed by aspiration, and L-arginine uptake was measured by incubating the cells for 1 min at 37°C with 250 μl of prewarmed Na/HEPES buffer containing L-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (50 μM, 2 μCi/ml). To terminate the uptake, the medium was aspirated, and cell layers were rapidly rinsed twice with ice-cold Na/HEPES buffer and lysed in 0.5 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and total radioactivity was determined. To correct for nonspecific uptake and binding, cells were incubated in parallel wells with buffer containing L-[3H]arginine (100 mM, 2 μCi/ml), the fraction of the radioactivity associated with the cells was determined, and this fraction was then subtracted from each data point. L-Arginine uptake was linear over the time period used. Cells washed with the Na/HEPES buffer were solubilized with 0.2 M NaOH at 37°C for 3 h, and aliquots were used for the determination of protein content using the bicinchoninic acid method (29.Smith P.K. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal.

Total RNA was prepared from VSMC cultures using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62774) Google Scholar) as modified (25.Low B.C. Ross I.K. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20740-20745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified spectrophotometrically. Electrophoresis and transfer of RNA to Hybond-N+ membranes were performed as described previously (12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out for at least 12 h with cDNA probes for rat cat-1b or mouse cat-2(14.Wang H. Kanavaugh M.P. North R.A. Kabat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) that had been prepared as described earlier (12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or a 4.5-kilobase pair full-length murine macrophage inos (31). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate using the random prime method and purified through Nick™ columns. Membranes were washed at 65°C for the rat cat-1b cDNA and at 60°C for the cat-2 and inos cDNAs and were exposed to Cronex x-ray films at −80°C with double intensifying screens for different periods of time. Cell culture media, amino acids (L-isomers) and analogues, angiotensin II, cycloheximide, lipopolysaccharide, and recombinant human cytokines were all obtained from Sigma. Culture dishes were supplied by Becton Dickinson Labware, and fetal calf serum was supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. Nucleotides were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. DNA purification kits, all radioisotopes, Hybond-N+ membranes, and labeling kits were supplied by Amersham International plc, United Kingdom. The results were expressed as the means ± S.D. of multiple determinations. Where appropriate, statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls multiple range test(32.Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1974: 151-162Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between cytokine-stimulated NO production and L-arginine transport in VSMC, cells were incubated for 24 h with IL-1β and TNF-α alone, or in combination. Both cytokines stimulated nitric oxide synthase activity as determined by the recovery of nitrite in the media and by the initial rates of uptake of L-arginine into the cells (Fig. 1). The cytokines in combination produced results that appeared to be additive with respect to the effects observed when used alone. In contrast, while LPS and γ-interferon both stimulated nitrite production, no changes in the L-arginine uptake rates could be detected (data not shown). Dose-response curves showed that IL-1β stimulated both processes with an EC—50 of between 1 and 3 ng/ml (data not shown), suggesting that the same receptor population was controlling the induction in each case. When the time courses of IL-1β stimulation of nitrite accumulation and L-arginine uptake activity were determined, detectable increases in nitrite concentration were observed from 6 h increasing linearly through to 48 h. In contrast, while the L-arginine uptake activity was enhanced from 6 h and increased through to 24 h, no further increase could be detected (data not shown). Both lysine and ornithine inhibited the cytokine-stimulated component of the L-arginine transport (data not shown), confirming that the System y+ activity was being stimulated. While investigating whether NO production was required for the stimulation of L-arginine transport, inhibitors, or nitric oxide synthase, NG-methyl-L-arginine and N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester were both shown to largely block the IL-1β/TNF-α stimulation of nitrite production without affecting the changes in L-arginine transport (Fig. 2). In a parallel experiment, dexamethasone treatment (1 mM for 24 h) was shown to reduce the cytokine-stimulated nitrite accumulation by over 70%, whereas there was no change in the cytokine stimulation of L-arginine uptake (data not shown). There was, however, a decrease in the basal L-arginine uptake rate in the absence of cytokines suggesting that dexamethasone inhibited the synthesis of some component in the L-arginine transport pathway. Further evidence for the requirement of new protein synthesis was obtained when cells were exposed to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which completely blocked the cytokine-stimulated nitrite accumulation and the increased L-arginine uptake rate. However, cycloheximide caused a significant decrease in the L-arginine uptake rate in the absence of cytokines (Fig. 3). These results suggest that new protein synthesis is required not only for the cytokine-stimulated nitrite production and increases in L-arginine uptake but is also necessary for the maintenance of the basal L-arginine uptake.Figure 3Cytokine-stimulated increases in nitrite accumulation and L-arginine uptake require de novo protein synthesis. Quiescent VSMC were treated for 24 h with the inhibitor of protein translation cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, hatched bars) or without cycloheximide (open bars) in the absence (Control) or presence of a combination of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) and TNF-α (100 ng/ml). The amount of nitrite accumulated in the culture media (a) and the initial rate of L-arginine uptake (b) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the means ± S.D. of three replicate determinations. Differences between values not sharing the same letter are statistically significant (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recently we reported that the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) could stimulate L-arginine transport in VSMC(12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When tested in combination with the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, Ang II was shown to partially inhibit the cytokine-induced accumulation of nitrite in the media while stimulating the L-arginine transport in a manner that was additive compared with that produced by the cytokines alone (Fig. 4). Ang II alone did not affect the control levels of nitrite production, and it appeared to delay the cytokine stimulation of nitrite production by about 6 h with the rates of nitrite production over the final 12 h of the experiment being similar in both the presence and absence of Ang II. These data confirm the observation of Nakayama et al.(33.Nakayama I. Kawahara Y. Tsuda T. Okuda M. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11628-11633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Ang II suppresses NOS activity in these cells and further indicate that Ang II is likely to stimulate L-arginine uptake by a mechanism that is independent of that of the cytokines. Previous studies have shown that cultured VSMC express two different genes of the L-arginine transporter, cat-1b and cat-2 (12). To examine the induction of the cat and inos genes, cells were exposed to either Ang II or the cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β for periods up to 24 h before harvesting and extraction of total RNA for Northern analysis. The cytokines in combination led to parallel increases in the abundance of inos and cat-2 transcripts without any effect on the level of cat-1b mRNA (Fig. 5). In contrast, Ang II was able to enhance cat-1b mRNA concentrations at early time points, 3 and 6 h, but not at longer time points, which was consistent with our previous results(12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This work has clearly demonstrated that the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α stimulate both NO production and the rate at which L-arginine is transported into VSMC. The increase in L-arginine transport is due to up-regulation of the System y+ family of cationic amino acid transporters, a result which is consistent with this family being the only transporter of L-arginine expressed in these cells(11.Low B.C. Ross I.K. Grigor M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol.

The finding that the cytokine-stimulated increase in L-arginine transport in VSMC was inhibited by cycloheximide, and therefore required de novo protein synthesis suggested that regulation of L-arginine transport possibly required protein synthesis of the L-arginine transporter itself. However, the observation that cycloheximide caused a decrease in the non-stimulated rate of L-arginine transport suggests either that the transporter has a rapid turnover rate or that some other component was required for the regulation of the transporter activity. The presence of messenger RNA for two cat genes has been demonstrated in VSMC(12.Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that the CAT-1 and CAT-2 isoforms have identical kinetic properties and are indistinguishable at the cellular level(10.MacLeod C.L. Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 109-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M.

MacLeod C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our study using transcript-specific probes has clearly demonstrated that IL-1β and TNF-α not only regulate the expression of inos mRNA but specifically up-regulate the expression of the cat-2 mRNA transcript. The cytokine-stimulated expression of iNOS is at least partially mediated in other cells through the nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic transcription factor, nuclear factor κB(35.Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the murine cat-2 gene has demonstrated the presence of multiple promoters, suggesting a complex regulation of this gene(36.Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. Barrieux A. Kleeman J. Huynh P.D. MacLeod C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9378-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our observation that Ang II inhibits the cytokine stimulation of NO production in VSMC is consistent with that of Nakayama et al.(33.Nakayama I. Kawahara Y. Tsuda T. Okuda M. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11628-11633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiment, this appears to be a result of the Ang II delaying the cytokine effect rather than blocking it completely. In contrast, Ang II stimulates the System y+ activity over and above that observed for the cytokines, suggesting that there are multiple signaling pathways regulating the expression of the cat genes. The inos and cat genes are not the only genes involved in L-arginine metabolism that are regulated by cytokines(35.Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Both the activity and the mRNA level of argininosuccinate synthetase are coinduced with inos in VSMC in response to cytokines(37.Hattori Y. Campbell E.B. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9405-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the type II arginase activity in macrophages has been shown to be induced by LPS but not by γ-interferon(18.Wang W.W. Jenkinson C.P. Griscavage J.M. Kern R.M. Arabolos N.S. Byrns R.E. Cederbaum S.D. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there is a complex regulation of genes encoding proteins required for L-arginine metabolism that may ultimately affect the ability of cells to sustain NO production following chronic stimulation by cytokines.

Traverse of the G1/S phase boundary and the initiation of DNA replication require functional cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes; however, the mechanisms by which PDGF and PPP regulate Cdk2 activation are not known. Density-arrested fibroblasts contain low levels of cyclins E and A, and high levels of the Cdk inhibitor p27kip1. Exposure to PDGF, which stimulates cell cycle entry but not progression through G1, induces the formation of cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes that bind p27kip1 and titrate the pool of Kip1 available to inhibit Cdk2. In addition, PDGF stimulates a moderate transient reduction in the abundance of p27kip1 protein. However, limited expression of cyclin E and cyclin A is observed after PDGF treatment, and in the absence of PPP, p27 levels are sufficient to bind and inactivate existing cyclin-Cdk complexes. Although plasma does not significantly increase the proportion of Kip1 bound to cyclin D1-Cdk4, stimulation of PDGF-treated cells with plasma does overcome the threshold inhibition of p27kip1 by further increasing the expression of cyclins E and A and decreasing the amount of Kip1 over a prolonged time period. Our results indicate that the distinct mitogenic activities of PDGF and PPP differentially influence the activation of cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated kinases that ultimately regulate entry into S phase.

INTRODUCTIONThe growth of nontransformed eukaryotic cells is controlled by environmental cues which govern the transition from G1 into S phase. In mammalian cells, growth regulatory signals from serum-derived growth factors are integrated during a late G1 event called the restriction point(1.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Successful execution of this event commits cells to another round of DNA replication, at which time cell cycle progression becomes independent of extracellular mitogens.Growth factor-stimulated proliferation is achieved, at least in part, by a modulation of the cell cycle machinery consisting of the cylin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdkcycline-dependent kinaseTGFtransforming growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPPPplatelet-poor plasma. and their regulatory cyclin subunits(2.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 3.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). While a single kinase, p34cdc2, is sufficient to drive progression through the major cell cycle regulatory points at the G1/S and G2/M phase transitions in yeast(4.Reed S.I. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1992; 8: 529-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), multiple distinct Cdc2-related kinases have been identified in higher eukaryotes(5.Elledge S.J. Spottswood M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6.Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The involvement of many of these kinases in cell cycle regulation has yet to be established. However, Cdk4 becomes active as a retinoblastoma protein kinase during mid G1(8.Matsushime H. Quelle D. Shurtleff S. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Cdk4 in epithelial cells reduces the requirement for serum-derived growth factors and confers resistance to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition(9.Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdk2 rescues the growth-arrested phenotype of Cdc2-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast mutants (5.Elledge S.J. Spottswood M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and ablation of Cdk2 activity prevents the onset of DNA replication in mammalian cells(10.Pagano M. Pepperkok P. Lukas J. Baldin V. Ansorge W. Bartek J. Draetta G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 11.Tsai L.-H. Lees E. Faha B. Harlow E. Riabowol K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1593-1602PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, growth stimulatory pathways initiated by extracellular signals must ultimately engage and activate one or more of the G1-specific Cdk proteins.Cdk activation is positively regulated by periodic association with cyclin subunits(2.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 3.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). Cdk4 complexes with the D-type cyclins, while Cdk2 primarily associates with cyclin E and cyclin A. Ectopic overexpression of either cyclin D1 or cyclin E accelerates progression through G1 and reduces the proliferative requirement for serum-derived growth factors(12.Ohtsubo M. Roberts J. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 13.Quelle D. Ashmun R. Shurtleff S. Kato J. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M. Sherr C.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Conversely, abolition of cyclin D1 or cyclin E activity through the use of neutralizing antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides effectively blocks entry into S phase(15.Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 16.Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A. Schumacher J. Roberts J. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Ablation of cyclin A function also prevents DNA replication (17.Girard F. Stausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 18.Pagano M. Pepperkok P. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G.

Maller J. Nature. 1991; 354: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it appears that the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex may function at a point distal to restriction point traverse. Although the mitogen-dependent expression of cyclin D genes is well defined in mammalian cells(20.Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J. Griffin J. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar, 21.Winston J. Pledger W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22.Won K. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9910-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), growth factor regulation of cyclin E and cyclin A is incompletely understood.Cyclin interaction with its catalytic partner is necessary but not sufficient for kinase activation. Nonfunctional cyclin-Cdk complexes have been shown to accumulate in serum-stimulated senescent fibroblasts (23.Dulic V. Drullinger L. Lees E. Reed S. Stein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) as well as cells that have been growth inhibited by exposure to TGF-β(24.Koff A. Ohtsuki M. Polyak K. Roaberts J. Massague J. Science. 1993; 260: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), δ radiation(25.Dulic V. Kaufmann W. Wilson S. Tisty T. Lees E. Harper J. Elledge S. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar), or agents which elevate intracellular levels of cAMP(26.Kato, J., Matsuoka, M., Polyak, K., Massague, J., Sherr, C. (1994)Google Scholar). Activation of assembled cyclin/Cdk holoenzymes is negatively regulated by direct interaction with Cdk inhibitory proteins, termed CKIs(27.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Several of these inhibitors function as intracellular effectors of antiproliferative environmental signals. In S. cerevisiae, cell cycle arrest in response to mating phermone α is mediated by FAR1, a protein which inactivates the yeast Cdc2 kinase(28.Peter M. Herskowitz I. Science. 1994; 265: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, DNA damaging agents such as δ radiation induce the expression of p53, which transactivates the promoter of the Cdk inhibitor, p21cip1(29.El-Deiry, W., Tokino, T., Velculescu, V., Levy, D., Parsons, R., Trent, J., Lin, D., Mercer, E., Kinzler, K., Vogelstein, B. (1993)Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGF-β-dependent inhibition of Cdk2 activation and S phase entry is mediated by the inhibitor, p27kip1(30.Polyak K. Kato J. Solomon M. Sherr C. Massague J. Roberts J. Koff A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that p27 expression is down-regulated after interleukin 2 stimulation of T lymphocytes(31.Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M. Massague J. Crabtree G. Roberts J. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), suggesting that Kip1 may serve as a common target of both positive and negative growth regulatory pathways.Kip1 activity may also be regulated through association with cellular proteins such as Cdk4. p27kip1 associates with the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex in a cell cycle-dependent manner (32.Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and treatment of human keratinocytes with the antiproliferative agent TGF-β leads to a redistribution of p27kip1 from Cdk4 to Cdk2, correlating with an inhibition of Cdk2 activity and cell cycle arrest(33.Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Gene & Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-produced cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes can facilitate activation of Cdk2 in vitro(34.Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), suggesting that a sequestering of Kip1 by Cdk4 may also be an important component of the mitogenic response to environmental proliferative signals. However, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested in vivo.Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts are a nontransformed mouse cell line that has been extensively characterized with regard to the proliferative requirements for specific serum-derived growth factors(34.Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) acts early in the cell cycle to stimulate the G0 to G1 transition and render cells competent to respond to progression factors contained in platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Sequential exposure of quiescent fibroblasts to PDGF and PPP is sufficient to stimulate traverse of the restriction point and initiate commitment to DNA synthesis. Using the Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast system, we have examined the molecular mechanisms by which growth regulatory signals such as PDGF and plasma factors cooperatively activate the Cdk2 kinase during late G1. Our results suggest that both a PDGF-dependent association of Kip1 with Cdk4 and a plasma-dependent reduction in Kip1 levels are essential for the activation of cyclin E- and cyclin A-dependent kinases.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureBalb/c 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts (clone A31) were cultured in a water-jacketed incubator with a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air) maintained at 37°C. Experimental cultures were grown to confluency in 100-mm Petri dishes using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Colorado Serum Company), 4 mML-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were used 3-4 days after density arrest. PDGF (BB) was purchased from Biosource International, Camarillo, CA, and plasma was obtained fropm the Southwest Florida Blood Bank, Tampa, FL.ImmunoblotsCultures were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate). Whole cell extracts were sonicated twice, 10 s each, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. Lysates were stored 1-14 days at −70°C. For Western analysis, extracts were thawed on ice, and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. 100 μg of protein/sample were boiled 3 min in Laemmli buffer (20% glycerol, 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM EDTA; 0.05% bromphenol blue) and separated on a 7-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and blots were probed with the following rabbit polyclonal antibodies: cyclin D1 (G. Peters, Imperial Cancer Research Fund), cyclin A (E. Leof, 5o Clinic), cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), Cdk4 (S. Hanks, Vanderbilt University), or Kip1 (Pharmingen). Proteins were detected using the electrochemiluminescence system per instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.).Immunoprecipitations and Kinase AssaysBalb/c 3T3 cell lysates were prepared exactly as described for the preparation of immunoblots. Kinase activities were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of extract using rabbit polyclonal antisera (approximately 4 h at 4°C). Immunoprecipitates were brought down with protein A-agarose (30 min at 4°C), and pellets were washed twice in immunoblot lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). Pellets were incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μM ATP, 100 μg/ml histone H1, and 0.1 μC1/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by boiling 3 min in 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer, and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Histone phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography (0.5-3 h at −70°C with intensifying screens) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).Inhibition experiments were performed by mixing extracts of proliferating cells containing active cyclin A-kinase complexes with inhibitor-containing extracts for 1 h at 37°C prior to immunoprecipitation of cyclin A. Density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml PDGF with 10% calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h then harvested for proliferating cell extracts. Unless noted otherwise, extracts were mixed in a 1:1 ratio of protein (100 μg:100 μg).RESULTSInduction of Cyclin E- and Cyclin A-associated Kinase Activities in Balb/c 3T3 FibroblastsTo examine the expression of cyclin E and cyclin A after mitogenic stimulation, density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with PDGF, PPP, or both. Whole cell extracts were harvested after 16 h (for cyclin E) or 21 h (for cyclin A) and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells contained undetectable amounts of cyclin A protein, while low levels of cyclin E were typically observed in unstimulated fibroblasts. A weak induction of both cyclin A and cyclin E expression was observed after exposure to PDGF, a factor which stimulates cell cycle entry from quiescence but does not support traverse of the late G1 restriction point or subsequent entry into S phase. Although plasma by itself did not affect cyclin expression, the abundance of both cyclin A and cyclin E was increased to maximal levels in fibroblasts stimulated with a combination of PDGF and PPP. In contrast to the cyclins, Cdk2, the catalytic subunit of cyclins A and E, was relatively abundant in quiescent cells and underwent only a modest increase after growth factor stimulation (data not shown).Although exposure to PDGF stimulated limited expression of cyclin A protein in nonproliferating cells, it was not sufficient to induce cyclin A-associated kinase activity (Fig. 1). Similarly, cyclin E-Cdk complexes immunoprecipitated from PDGF- or plasma-treated cells failed to phosphorylate histone H1 above basal levels. Identical results were also observed when Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated from fibroblasts treated with PDGF or plasma alone (data not shown). However, cyclin A- and cyclin E-associated kinase activities were dramatically increased in cells receiving both PDGF and PPP. Induction of kinase activity under these conditions was greater than that predicted for an additive response, indicating that plasma-derived progression factors can act synergistically with PDGF to regulate the activation of cyclins A and E associated Cdk2.Growth Factor Modulation of the Cdk Inhibitor Kip1Mixing of extracts from quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells with an equal amount of lysate from growth-stimulated fibroblasts containing active cyclin-Cdk complexes caused an inhibition of kinase activities associated with cyclin A, cyclin E, Cdk2, and to a lesser extent Cdc2 (Fig. 2A). Thus, failure to stimulate cyclin A- and cyclin E-dependent kinases in PDGF-treated cells could in principle reflect an inability to down-regulate one or more of the Cdk inhibitory factors present in quiescent fibroblasts. As the predominant cyclin-dependent kinase activity is associated with cyclin A in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, we have used cyclin A-Cdk complexes to measure inhibition in the following experiments.Figure 2Growth factor-stimulated down-regulation of Cdk inhibitory activity. A, density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells were stimulated with 10% serum and 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. After 18 h, extracts containing active cyclin-Cdk complexes were isolated and mixed with inhibitor-containing extracts of quiescent cells. 100 μg of stimulated cell extract were incubated with 100 μg of quiescent cell lysate for 1 h at 37°C. Cyclin A, cyclin E, Cdk2, and Cdc2 were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies, and histone H1 kinase activity was determined. Phosphorylated proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and kinase activity was quantitated on a PhosphorImager. 100% activity is the activity without inhibitor-containing extracts added. B, density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the presence and absence of PPP. At the times (hrs) indicated, cells were harvested and whole cell extracts were prepared. Nontreated extracts and extracts heated 5 min at 100°C were mixed with proliferating cell lysates for 1 h at 37°C. Cyclin A was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody, and histone H1 kinase activity was determined. The (+) is without inhibitory extracts added. C, cyclin A-dependent kinase activity shown in B was quantitated using a PhosphorImager, and the percentage of inhibition was graphed. Data points represent the average of three separate experiments. 100% activity is the inhibition produced by quiescent extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although exposure of quiescent fibroblasts to plasma alone had no effect on inhibitor levels, stimulation of density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells with either PDGF or a combination of PDGF and PPP resulted in a nearly identical reduction of free cyclin A/Cdk inhibitory activity that was biphasic in nature (Fig. 2B). Activity of the Cdk inhibitor(s) was rapidly and dramatically reduced by approximately 75% between 2 and 6 h after treatment with PDGF or PDGF/PPP (Fig. 2C). After this time, free inhibitor activity continued to decline at a more gradual rate until it was completely abolished by 12-15 h poststimulation, a point coincident with S phase entry and normal cyclin A activation in those cells exposed to a full complement of growth factors. Down-regulation of free inhibitory activity persisted for at least 24 h after initial mitogen stimulation.The majority of Cdk inhibitory activity could be restored to growth factor-treated cell lysates when samples were heat-treated prior to incubation with proliferating cell extracts (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that a Cdk inhibitor present in both quiescent and stimulated Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts was reversibly masked by interaction with a heat-labile factor after exposure to PDGF: p27kip1 had previously been shown by others to be heat-stable in other cells(30.Polyak K. Kato J. Solomon M. Sherr C. Massague J. Roberts J. Koff A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). However, boiled extracts of stimulated cells were less effective in inhibiting the cyclin A-Cdk complex than identically treated extracts of quiescent cells. Therefore, a decrease in the abundance of inhibitory factors may also contribute to the apparent down-regulation of inhibitory activity after growth factor treatment. Inhibition from boiled extracts decreased slowly starting 6-9 h after stimulation (Fig. 2C). However, in boiled extracts from cells treated with PDGF alone, decline in activity was transient, and the ability to inhibit cyclin A-Cdk complexes returned to basal levels at later time points. In contrast, total cellular inhibitory activity continued to decline over the time course of the experiment when cells were exposed to both PDGF and PPP.In order to identify the factor responsible for cyclin A/Cdk inactivation, boiled lysates from quiescent and stimulated Balb/c 3T3 cells were precleared with antibodies to p27kip1 prior to use in mixing experiments. Immunodepletion of Kip1 from extracts of both nonstimulated cells and cells treated with PDGF and PPP for 24 h eliminated essentially all inhibitory activity toward the cyclin A-Cdk complex (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation of [S35]methionine-labeled cells and Western blot analysis using the anti-p27 antibody indicated that this antibody did not recognize p21cip1 or p57kip2 (data not shown). These data suggest that Kip1 is the primary negative regulator of cyclin A-dependent kinase activity in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts.Figure 3Growth factor regulation of Kip1 expression. A, Kip1 protein was immunodepleted from boiled extracts of quiescent and stimulated Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts (cells were stimulated 21 h in 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB and 10% PPP). Depleted (+) and nondepleted(-) extracts were then mixed with lysates of proliferating cells, and cyclin A-associated histone H1 kinase activity was determined after immunoprecipitation. Control extracts of proliferating cells (lane 1) were mixed with lysis buffer. B, density-arrested cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the presence and absence of 10% PPP. At the time indicated, extracts were isolated, immunoblotted, and probed with a polyclonal antibody to Kip1. C, Kip1 protein was detected as in B, and levels in cells stimulated 24 h with PDGF or PDGF + PPP were quantitated by laser densitometry. Data points represent the average of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunoblotting of whole cell extracts demonstrated that Kip1 expression was influenced by both PDGF and plasma factors (Fig. 3B). The p27 protein was relatively abundant in quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells but was moderately reduced in response to treatment with PDGF. The PDGF-mediated reduction in Kip levels reached a nadir 12-18 h after stimulation; however, Kip1 expression increased by 24 h, correlating temporally with a return of total cellular inhibitory activity to the maximal basal level observed in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF in the presence of plasma displayed a more dramatic and prolonged reduction in Kip1 expression. By 24 h after stimulation, cells treated with PDGF and PPP contained less than 50% of the p27 expressed in cells receiving PDGF alone (Fig. 3C). Kinetics of the plasma-dependent decline in Kip1 levels at later time points closely paralleled the reduction of inhibitory activity detected in boiled cell lysates. These data show that p27 expression is differentially modulated by PDGF and PPP, and indicate that plasma-derived growth factors are required for a full down-regulation of Kip1 protein.Although Kip1 levels were dramatically reduced after stimulation with PDGF and PPP, under no condition was Kip1 expression completely abolished. The data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that the low level of Kip1 protein present in cells exposed to PDGF and PPP is sufficient to inhibit the majority of cyclin A-dependent kinase activity when released from a masking factor by heat treatment. These results imply that the PDGF-mediated association of p27 with a heat labile silencing factor is likely to be essential for the removal of Kip1 inhibitory activity.Requirement for Protein Synthesis during Down-regulation of Free Inhibitory ActivityTo further examine the mechanism by which growth factors decreased the level of free inhibitory activity in Balb/c 3T3 cells, density-arrested fibroblasts were stimulated with PDGF and PPP in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 4A). Whole cell extracts of cells exposed to growth factors or cycloheximide or a combination of both were harvested 12 h after stimulation and used without heat pretreatment in mixing experiments. Addition of cycloheximide at 10 μg/ml blocked greater than 95% of serum-stimulated protein synthesis, but did not by itself affect levels of inhibitory activity in unstimulated cells. Thus, termination of new Kip1 synthesis is not sufficient to rapidly eliminate the Cdk inhibitory activity present in quiescent Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. Furthermore, the normal removal of free inhibitory activity after treatment with PDGF or PDGF/PPP was effectively blocked when cells were stimulated in the presence of cycloheximide. Treatment of fibroblasts with the RNA synthesis inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside also antagonized the growth factor-dependent reduction in Cdk inhibition, although not to the extent observed after exposure to cycloheximide.Figure 4Effect of cycloheximide on regulation of Kip1. A, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) or 100 μM 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB) were added to density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the presence and absence of 10% PPP. After 12 h, whole cell extracts were isolated and mixed with proliferating cell lysates. Cyclin A was immunoprecipitated from mixed extracts, and histone H1 kinase activity was determined. Control extracts of proliferating cells were mixed with lysis buffer (+, lane 1) or nontreated quiescent cell extract (Q, lane 2). B, density-arrested cells were treated with PDGF and PPP as above. At the indicated times after stimulation, cycloheximide was added to culture medium. Cells represented in lane 8 received no cycloheximide. 12 h after initial exposure to mitogens, extracts were prepared and mixed with proliferating cell lysates. Control extracts of proliferating cells were mixed with lysis buffer (lane 1) or nontreated quiescent cell extract (Q, lane 2).

https://openalex.org/W1977745370,"Several cell surface receptors including the T cell receptor (TCR) are phosphorylated and down-regulated following activation of protein kinases. We have recently shown that both phosphorylation of Ser-126 and the presence of the di-leucine sequence Leu-131 and Leu-132 in CD3γ are required for protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated TCR down-regulation. To identify additional residues required for PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CD3γ and for TCR down-regulation, an alanine scanning of CD3γ was done. Mutations of Arg-124, Ser-126, Lys-128, and Gln-129 inhibited both phosphorylation and TCR down-regulation, whereas mutation of Asp-127 only inhibited down-regulation. Further analyses demonstrated a discrepancy between the ability to be phosphorylated on CD3γ and to down-regulate the TCR in several transfectants. Phosphorylation was not as strictly dependent on the nature and position of the phosphoacceptor group and basic residues as were the subsequent steps involved in TCR down-regulation. Our results suggest that PKC-mediated TCR down-regulation may be regarded as a two-step process. 1) Recognition and phosphorylation of CD3γ by PKC. In this process Arg-124, Ser-126, Lys-128, and Gln-129 are important. 2) Recognition of phosphorylated CD3γ by molecules involved in receptor internalization.

A sequence motif on apoB mRNA (“mooring sequence,” nucleotides 6671-6681) is obligatory for the editing of cytidine 666 (C6666), the only cytidine on apoB mRNA converted to uridine in normal animals. Transgenic animals with hepatic overexpression of APOBEC-1 develop liver tumors, and other non-apoB mRNAs are edited, suggesting a loss of the normally precise specificity. In this study, we examined apoB mRNA from these transgenic animals to determine if cytidines aside from C6666 are edited. Multiple cytidines downstream from C6666 in apoB mRNA were edited extensively by the overexpressed APOBEC-1. This pathophysiological “hyperediting” could be mimicked in vitro by incubating a synthetic apoB RNA substrate with the transgenic mouse liver extracts. Multiple cytidines in the synthetic apoB RNA were edited by recombinant APOBEC-1 but only with supplementation of the auxiliary protein(s). Mutations in the mooring sequence markedly decreased the normal editing of C6666 but, surprisingly, increased the hyperediting of downstream cytidines. Furthermore, cytidines in an apoB RNA substrate lacking the mooring sequence were also edited in vitro. These results indicate that the hyperediting of apoB mRNA by overexpressed APOBEC-1 depends upon auxiliary protein(s) but is independent of the mooring sequence motif.

https://openalex.org/W1971857285,"Abstract The binding site for batrachotoxin, a lipid-soluble neurotoxin acting at Na channel receptor site 2, was localized using a photoreactive, radiolabeled batrachotoxin derivative to covalently label purified and reconstituted rat brain Na channels. In the presence of the brevetoxin 1 from Ptychodiscus brevis and the pyrethroid RU51049, positive allosteric enhancers of batrachotoxin binding, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa corresponding to the Na channel α subunit was specifically covalently labeled. The region of the α subunit specifically photolabeled by the photoreactive batrachotoxin derivative was identified by antibody mapping of proteolytic fragments. Even after extensive trypsinization, an anti-peptide antibody recognizing an amino acid sequence adjacent to Na channel transmembrane segment IS6 was able to immunoprecipitate up to 70% of the labeled peptides. Analysis of a more complete digestion with trypsin or V8 protease indicated that the batrachotoxin receptor site is formed in part by a portion of domain I. The identification of a specifically immunoprecipitated photolabeled 7.3-kDa peptide containing transmembrane segment S6 from domain I restricted the site of labeling to residues Asn-388 to Glu-429 if V8 protease digestion was complete or Leu-380 to Glu-429 if digestion was incomplete. These results implicate the S6 transmembrane region of domain I of the Na channel α subunit as an important component of the batrachotoxin receptor site."

While mutations in the 62-69 region blocked upstream activation of Ras, they did not disrupt Ras effector functions, including transcriptional activation and transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Biochemical analysis indicated that the loss of GEF responsiveness of a Ras(69N) mutant was due to a loss of GEF binding, with no change in intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity. Furthermore, structural analysis of Ras(69N) using NMR spectroscopy indicated that mutation of residue 69 had a very localized effect on Ras structure that was limited to α-helix 2 of the switch 2 domain.

https://openalex.org/W2046288669,"Heparin is a functional and structural analog of the Chlamydia trachomatis heparan sulfate-like attachment ligand that mediates infectivity by bridging chlamydiae to eukaryotic cells. The binding of heparin to the Chlamydia organism's surface was characterized by a direct binding assay. Although for two C. trachomatis biovars the binding by heparin was saturable, trachoma biovar organisms bound twice the amount of heparin than lymphogranuloma venereum biovar organisms. To prove the structural nature of the heparan sulfate-like ligand interactions, a range of heparin-derived oligosaccharides and sulfation-modified species of heparin were compared for their ability to compete with [3H]heparin for binding to chlamydial organisms and for inhibition of chlamydial attachment and infection of eukaryotic host cells. The assays revealed that a decasaccharide was the minimal chain length required to effectively bind C. trachomatis organisms, compete with the host cell receptor and rescue infectivity. In addition, a moderately sulfated adhesin analog, N-desulfated, N-acetylated heparin, was able to compete with chlamydial organisms for host cell receptors, whereas this derivative could not compete with [3H]heparin for binding to chlamydial organisms. These results indicate that the specificity of the eukaryotic cell receptor and the chlamydial surface acceptor differ in their fine-structure requirements of ligand binding, and that the size and sulfation density of the heparan sulfate-like ligand each contribute to its ability to bind and bridge chlamydiae to eukaryotic cells."

The results of labeling experiments with S. cerevisiae mutants expressing different levels of the PKC1 gene indicated that phosphorylation of CTP synthetase was mediated by Pkc1p in vivo. In vitro, Pkc1p phosphorylated purified CTP synthetase on serine and threonine residues, which resulted in the activation (3-fold) of enzyme activity. The mechanism of this activation involved an increase in the apparent Vmax of the reaction and an increase in the enzyme's affinity for ATP. In vitro phosphorylated CTP synthetase also exhibited a decrease in its positive cooperative kinetic behavior with respect to UTP and ATP. Phosphorylation of CTP synthetase did not have a significant effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme with respect to glutamine and GTP.

PKCγ is not found in these cells, so the major modulation was in PKCβ. PKCβ transfectant cells exhibited blocked differentiation, increased growth rate in athymic mice, and restoration of the basic fibroblast growth factor response pathway. In this study, we have extended the analysis of these PKCβ transfectants to the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK3. Analysis of cell lysates on the mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate myelin basic protein by in gel kinase assay showed increased activity at 63 kDa, the size of ERK3, in each of two PKCβ1 and each of two PKCβ2 transfectants compared with the vector control transfectant. ERK3 was expressed at equal abundance in PKCβ1, PKCβ2, and control transfectant cells as demonstrated by Western blotting and by immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK3 monoclonal antibody. However, a >10-fold increase in ERK3 activity in each PKCβ transfectant was shown by immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK3 monoclonal antibody followed by either immune complex kinase assay or by in gel kinase assay. Thus, while overexpression of transfected PKCβ does not lead to overexpression of ERK3, it does lead to constitutive activation of ERK3. A causal link between PKCβ overexpression and ERK3 activation was established because 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment down-regulated both PKC and ERK3 activities in both PKCβ1 transfectants.

Sphingosine increased the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of around 8 μM. Sphingosine and OKT3, a CD3 monoclonal antibody, transiently increased [Ca2+]i, which declined to the resting level in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under the same conditions, pretreatment with sphingosine inhibited but did not abolish an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the subsequent addition of OKT3 and vice versa. However, pretreatment with sphingosine did not affect an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by OKT3 in the presence of Ca2+. OKT3 increased IP3 formation, but sphingosine did not affect the level of IP3 by itself nor did it cause IP3 formation induced by OKT3. In permeabilized Jurkat cells, the addition of IP3 released Ca2+ from nonmitochondrial intracellular stores, but the addition of sphingosine did not. Sphingosine, stearylamine, and psychosine increased [Ca2+]i and diacylglycerol (DG) kinase activation; however, ceramide did not, whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate slightly activated DG kinase without elevation of [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment with R59022, a DG kinase inhibitor, abolished the peak but did not affect the sustained response of [Ca2+]i to sphingosine. Phosphatidic acid (PA) elevated [Ca2+]i, after which it declined to a resting level even in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. In accordance with this, PA did not stimulate 45Ca2+ uptake into cells, but sphingosine and OKT3 did.

We have identified a class of TFIIA mutants that stimulate TBP-DNA binding (T-A complex) but fail to support transcriptional activation by several different activators, suggesting that these mutants are defective in their ability to facilitate an activation step subsequent to TBP promoter binding. Point mutations of the hydrophobic core of conserved residues from 65 to 74 resulted in various activation-defective phenotypes. These residues were found to be important for TFIIA γ-γ interactions, suggesting that γ-γ interactions are critical for TFIIA function as a coactivator. A subset of these TFIIA-γ mutations disrupted transcriptional activation by all activators tested, except for the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded Zta protein.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether ITI binding to tumor cell surface is mediated by urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) receptor or cell-associated hyaluronic acid (HA). We demonstrated specific complex formation of the heavy (H) chains of ITI with HA. Binding of the H-chains of ITI to immobilized HA was detected and quantified using colorimetric immunoassays. Binding was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent. However, UTI and HI-8 (the carboxyl terminus of UTI) failed to bind to immobilized HA. ITI bound to HA remained functional protease inhibiting activity. After incubation of SMT-cc1 cells with purified biotinylated ITI, biotinylated ITI is bound to the cells, dissociated, and gives rise to the H-chains and UTI on the cell surface. The cell surface receptor-bound UTI derived from ITI may be the result of the limited proteolysis on the cell surface. In the cells treated with hyaluronidase, bound H-chains disappeared from the surface of the cells, while most of the cell surface ITI derivatives was present in deglycosylated UTI (28 kDa). It is suggested that the binding of ITI to the cell surface is mediated by HA on the cells. This was confirmed by the fact that the hyaluronidase-treated cells can abolish the ITI binding. The cell surface UTI formation was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and eglin C, suggesting that elastase-like enzyme(s) may be responsible for the UTI formation. Preincubation of the cells with UTI did not decrease in exogenously added ITI on the cell surface. A model for cell surface UTI formation is proposed in which ITI binding to cells from serum used for the culture is followed by the limited proteolysis by trace amounts of active serine proteases, to form cell-surface receptor-bound UTI and the H-chains intercalated into cell surface HA.

A model for cell surface UTI formation is proposed in which ITI binding to cells from serum used for the culture is followed by the limited proteolysis by trace amounts of active serine proteases, to form cell-surface receptor-bound UTI and the H-chains intercalated into cell surface HA. This process is subject to regulation of cell-associated UTI and of stabilization of pericellular matrix.

ITI was found to act as a stabilizer of pericellular matrix. The serum factor, identified as an ITI, is a structural component of the matrix. ITI is required to stabilize the fully expanded cumulus cell-oocyte complexes matrix, thus supporting the process of ovulation (5.Chen L. Mao S.J. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Huang et al.(6.Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesized by cultured fibroblasts firmly bound 85-kDa proteins, which were derived from serum used for the culture and appeared to be covalently linked to HA. The serum-derived HA-associated protein was confirmed to be the heavy (H)-chains of ITI, suggesting that cooperative binding to HA of the H-chains of ITI is required to stabilize the pericellular matrix(7.Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix in most mammalian tissues. It consists of a linear polysaccharide chain with repeating glucuronic acid-(β1-3)-N-acetylglucosamine-(β1-4) structure. It is bound by cell surface receptors and extracellular matrix proteins (8.Fenderson B.A. Stamenkovic L. Aruffo A. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HA is also believed to play an important role in controlling tumor cell growth, migration, invasion, and differentiation. Synthesis and degradation of HA are significantly related to these cellular functions such as cell proliferation. Yoneda et al.(9.Yoneda M. Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yoneda M. Shimizu S. Nishi Yoshimi Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 275-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that HA added exogenously or supplied endogenously by increased synthesis may act as a modulator of fibroblast proliferation.We showed previously that highly purified human UTI efficiently inhibits soluble and tumor cell-associated plasmin and subsequently prevents tumor cell invasion and metastasis(11.Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Takeuchi K. Itoh M. Fujie M. Saitoh M. Terao T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 844-849PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell-bound plasmin by UTI is associated with significantly reduced tumor cell invasiveness in vitro and a decreased number of metastasis in vivo(11.Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Takeuchi K. Itoh M. Fujie M. Saitoh M. Terao T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 844-849PubMed Google Scholar).Recently we found that some tumor cells have specific binding sites for UTI on the cell surface(12.Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20642-20647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenously applied UTI may be bound to specific binding sites on the surface of tumor cells. This potentially leads to the build up of a substantial amount of UTI at the surface of the tumor cells(12.Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20642-20647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is good evidence that UTI may play an important role in prevention of tumor cell invasion and metastasis(13.Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Ohi H. Sugimura M. Terao T. Fujie M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1994; 12: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14.Kobayashi H. Fujie M. Shinohara H. Ohi H. Sugimura M. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 284-378Google Scholar).In the present study, we investigated whether ITI binding to tumor cell surface is mediated by UTI receptors or by cell-associated HA. Available information on the interaction of ITI derivatives with cells or with immobilized HA is mainly based on the use of biotinylated compounds as ligands. We show that binding of ITI to the cell-associated HA, but not to the UTI receptor, may be essential to the formation of the aggregates comprising the H-chains of ITI and HA which constitutes pericellular matrix.MATERIALS AND METHODSPolyclonal Antibody against ITIRabbits were immunized with 2 mg of purified ITI in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by booster injections in incomplete Freund's adjuvant every 3 weeks. The serum was purified by protein A chromatography according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Polyclonal antibody against ITI (anti-ITI antibody) reacts with native ITI and all of its derivatives including H-chains, UTI, and HI-8. This antibody was used in saturating concentrations.Cells and CulturesPromyeloid leukemia U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (15.Kobayashi H. Schmitt M. Goretzki L. Chucholowski N. Calvete J. Kramer M. Gunzler W.A. Janicke F. Graeff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5147-5152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The choriocarcinoma cell line SMT-cc1 was established from a pulmonary metastatic region of human gestational choriocarcinoma(16.Maeda M. Fujii T. Terao T. Acta Obstet. Gynecol. Jpn. 1987; 39: 256-262Google Scholar). These cells were maintained under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Nissui, Tokyo) medium supplemented with 10% FCS. SMT-cc1 cells were grown to confluency, removed from the flask by adding 4 mM EDTA and 0.01% DNase solution for 2 min at 23°C, followed by gentle tapping of the tray against the bench. Complete detachment was confirmed by direct visualization. Single-cell suspensions were made by repeated pipettings through a 0.4-mm-diameter canula. After this, the cells could be kept in suspension at 4°C by shaking. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion prior to use. SMT-cc1 cells were also used for binding studies.SMT-cc1 cell monolayers or U937 cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells/ml) were grown in the above medium, then in complete medium without serum for 16 h. The cells were then incubated with increasing concentrations of biotinylated ITI (0-2 μM) in RPMI 1640 medium containing ITI-depleted FCS for 16 h at 37°C. Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (washing buffer). The cells were homogenized in washing buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 μM each aprotinin, pepstatin, and cystatin. 50 μl of anti-ITI antibody-coupled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B were incubated with the supernatants of cell lysates (16 h, 4°C) to detect the cell-associated ITI and its derivatives. The samples were washed several times with 50 mM PBS, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and the final pellet (immobilized immunocomplex) was resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, heated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using avidin-peroxidase.Preparation of Inter-α-trypsin Inhibitor (ITI) and Its DerivativesHuman ITI was isolated from serum according to Salier et al.(17.Salier J.P. Martin J.P. Lambin P. McPhee H. Hochstrasser K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 272-283Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18.Salier J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A highly purified preparation of human UTI with an activity of 2330 units/mg of protein and a molecular mass of 40 kDa (by SDS-PAGE) was kindly supplied by Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan. The covalent structure of the polypeptide chain of the physiological inhibitor UTI has been already determined(2.Wachter E. Hochstrasser K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4.Vetr H. Gebhard W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A trypsin-Sepharose affinity column was used in order to obtain purified HI-8 (domain II of UTI). UTI bound to a trypsin-Sepharose column was treated with 80 mg/ml trypsin (37°C, overnight). After washing the column with PBS, trypsin-digested UTI bound to the column was eluted with 10 mM HCl containing 0.2 M NaCl. The major active fractions from a trypsin-Sepharose affinity column chromatography were applied to a Sephadex G-100 gel chromatography. Each fraction was pooled and amino-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out to obtain purified HI-8. A purified preparation of HI-8 with a molecular mass of 8 kDa was supplied by Dr. Dan Sugino (Nissin Food Products Co., Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan).ITI was biotinylated according to the method of Guesdon et al.(19.Guesdon J.L. Ternynck T. Avrameas S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar), using N-hydroxysuccinimidylbiotinamide caproate (Sigma). ITI purified from human serum was treated with hyaluronidase (hyaluronidase/ITI = 1/100 molar ratio; 37°C, 6 h). Hyaluronidase-treated ITI was subjected to preparative gel electrophoresis. Eluted materials were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) for analysis on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The C18 silica columns were packed for high performance and equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before loading. Fractions containing H-chains were pooled.Hyaluronidase TreatmentSMT-cc1 cell monolayers or U937 cell suspensions were incubated with biotinylated ITI (2 μM) for 16 h at 37°C as described above. Hyaluronidase digestion in the cells saturated with biotinylated ITI was performed. The cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) or cell monolayers were treated with 20 μg/ml testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) in RPMI with 1% BSA containing the protease inhibitors 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM EDTA, at 37°C for 60 min. Thereafter, the suspensions or the monolayers were rinsed twice with PBS, 0.1% BSA. The control cells were incubated similarly but without hyaluronidase.Protease Inhibiting Activity of ITI Bound to HAThe chromogenic substrates S-2222, S-2251, and S-2484 (Kabi Vitrum) were used to determine trypsin, plasmin, and leukocyte elastase activity, respectively. 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated at 4°C overnight with 0.1 mg/ml HA that subsequently blocked with 2% BSA. ITI (10 μg/ml) was applied into 96-well plates coated with HA and incubated for 2 h at 23°C. To investigate the inhibiting effects of ITI bound to immobilized HA on trypsin (plasmin or elastase), wells were incubated with 10 nM trypsin (plasmin or elastase) for varying periods of time at 23°C, followed by the addition of S-2222 (S-2251 or S-2484) in PBS, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 20% acetic acid. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured with an EIA reader (Model 2550, Bio-Rad).Ki was calculated using the experimentally determined association (k1) and dissociation (k-1) rate constants. k1 was monitored by allowing proteases and ITI bound to immobilized HA to react for given periods of time before addition of substrate which stopped the association process and then measuring the remaining enzyme activity. Final concentrations: trypsin, plasmin, and elastase, 10 nM; Substrates, S-2222 (1 mM), S-2251 (200 μM), and S2484 (200 μM). k-1 was monitored by adding α2-macroglobulin to a mixture of enzyme and inhibitor. The α2-macroglobulin-protease complexes are enzymatically active on synthetic substrates. Dissociation kinetics could be monitored by measuring the time-dependent appearance of hydrolytic activity. Final concentrations: enzymes, 10 nM at time 0; α2-macroglobulin, 3 μM; substrate, S-2222 (1 mM), S-2251 (200 μM), and S-2484 (200 μM). The inhibition equilibrium constant (Ki; nM) was calculated(20.Aubry M. Bieth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21.Pratt C.W. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2855-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Binding of ITI Derivatives to HA-coated Wells96-well microtiter plates were coated at 4°C overnight with 0.1 mg/ml HA that subsequently was blocked with 2% BSA. ITI and its derivatives (H-chains (a mixture of H-chain 1, H-chain 2, and H-chain3), UTI, and HI-8) were applied into the 96-well plates coated either with HA or BSA (as a control) and incubated for 2 h at 23°C. Wells were allowed to react with anti-ITI antibody (1 μg/ml, 1 h, 23°C). Antibody specifically bound to ITI derivatives was detected with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1.5 μg/ml, Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark; 1 h, 23°C), followed by the addition of avidin-peroxidase (1.0 μg/ml, Dako, 1 h, 23°C). The reactions with tetramethylbenzidine were terminated, and the A450 of each well was measured in an EIA reader.In addition, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with ITI or its derivatives (2 μg/ml, 16 h, 4°C) that subsequently was blocked with 2% BSA. HA (0-0.1 mg/ml) was applied into the 96-well plates coated either with ITI derivatives or BSA (as a control) and incubated (2 h, 23°C). HA specifically bound to ITI derivatives was detected with peroxidase-conjugated hyaluronic acid-binding protein (HRP-HABP, 0.5 μg/ml; this compound was kindly supplied by Dr. Takashi Kondo (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan))(22.Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 23.Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys.

Wells were allowed to react with tetramethylbenzidine as described above.We made an additional experiment to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant of ITI and HA. ITI was radioiodinated using the chloramine-T method(25.Chapman H.A. Bertozzi P. Sailor L.Z. Nusrat A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L432-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity was adjusted to 1.5 × 104 cpm/μg ITI by adding unlabeled ITI. HA was conjugated to AH-Sepharose 4B using the carbodiimide method(25.Chapman H.A. Bertozzi P. Sailor L.Z. Nusrat A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L432-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various amounts of 125I-labeled ITI were added to HA-Sepharose and incubated (16 h, 23°C). Bound and free 125I-labeled ITI were separated by centrifugation and counted with a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled ITI. The data were analyzed by a Scatchard plot.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (Cell ELISA)SMT-cc1 cells were grown to semiconfluence in 96-well microtiter plates, washed with PBS, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and then allowed to react with anti-ITI antibody (1:100 dilution, 2 h, 23°C). Nonspecific binding was ascertained using reactions with rabbit immunoglobulins as a control. Specifically bound anti-ITI antibody was detected with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1.5 μg/ml; 1 h, 23°C), followed by the addition of avidin-peroxidase (0.4 μg/ml; 1 h, 23°C). Peroxidase activity was detected using a tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution. The reactions were terminated after 10 min at 23°C, and the A450 (absorbance at 450 nm) of each well was measured in an automated EIA reader.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western BlotSDS-PAGE (nonreducing conditions) and Western blot were carried out as described elsewhere(15.Kobayashi H. Schmitt M. Goretzki L. Chucholowski N. Calvete J. Kramer M. Gunzler W.A. Janicke F. Graeff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5147-5152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSImmunoprecipitation of ITI Bound to Tumor CellsAfter addition of purified biotinylated preparations of human ITI to cultures of SMT-cc1 cells growing in a medium containing ITI-depleted serum, biotinylated ITI could be recovered as a bound fraction from the cells by an immunoprecipitation method (Fig. 1, lane 1). Some ITI derivatives, which may correspond to the H-chains of ITI and UTI, were also detected after a 12-h incubation with biotinylated ITI at 37°C (Fig. 1, lane 2). Membrane-associated ITI was dissociated and gave rise to the H-chains and UTI after a 16-h incubation (Fig. 1, lane 3).SMT-cc1 cell monolayers were treated with ITI-depleted serum containing 2 μM biotinylated ITI and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. After the cells were washed twice with washing buffer, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of hyaluronidase (20 μg/ml, 30 min, 37°C). After washing, the cells were homogenized. Anti-ITI antibody coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B were incubated with the supernatant of SMT-cc1 cell lysate (16 h, 4°C). Immobilized immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot. Fig. 2 shows that in the absence of hyaluronidase, sharp bands of >200 kDa, 120 kDa, 90-100 kDa, and 80 kDa as well as a polydisperse one of 40 kDa were obtained in the cell lysate sample. In the hyaluronidase-treated samples, the staining intensity of >200-kDa, 120-kDa, 90-100-kDa and 80-kDa bands disappeared, and a new band (deglycosylated UTI, molecular mass = 28 kDa) appeared. It has been reported that the 28-kDa form is the deglycosylated UTI. UTI contains a low-sulfated chondroitin 4-sulfate chain, and its apparent molecular mass upon SDS-PAGE shifts from 40 kDa to 28 kDa upon chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase treatment(26.Sjoberg E.M. Fries E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of UTI yields a molecular mass of 40 kDa, whereas the amino acid sequences yield values of 15-16 kDa. The discrepancy between these value is due to the chondroitin sulfate chain, whose removal results in a shift of the UTI band to 28 kDa. Hyaluronidase will not digest the whole glycosaminoglycan chain but will leave the innermost disaccharide repeat and the linkage region intact.Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of ITI in cells saturated with biotinylated ITI in the presence or absence of hyaluronidase. SMT-cc1 cell monolayers were treated with 2 μM biotinylated ITI and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. The cells were washed twice with washing buffer and were incubated in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 4) of hyaluronidase (20 μg/ml, 30 min, 37°C). Cell-associated biotinylated compounds (from 1 × 106 cells) were immunoprecipitated with anti-ITI antibody coupled to Sepharose and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot using avidin-peroxidase. Lane 1, ITI (a); lane 2, UTI (c); lane 3, H-chains (b); lane 4, deglycosylated UTI (d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although deglycosylated UTI could be recovered from the cell lysate, the H-chains of ITI could not be detected in the immunoprecipitable proteins (Fig. 2). It is likely that the serum-derived HA-associated proteins may be the H-chains of ITI, but without the light chain.After being treated with hyaluronidase, cell-associated ITI and the H-chains disappeared. This means that H-chains were released into the medium by hyaluronidase treatment. In a parallel experiment, soluble ITI purified from human serum was incubated with hyaluronidase at the same conditions as described above (20 μg/ml, 30 min, 37°C). This treatment did not cause the complete disappearance of the 240-kDa band and the appearance of several new bands, major ones of 80 kDa and 28 kDa as well as minor bands of 70 kDa, 60 kDa, and 50 kDa (Fig. 3). In addition, soluble UTI purified from human urine was incubated with hyaluronidase at the same conditions. This treatment caused the incomplete disappearance of the 40-kDa band and the appearance of new bands (molecular mass of 60 kDa and 28 kDa). Broad staining with several bands shown in Fig. 3(lane 2, d) may represent the difference in the extent of deglycosylation.Figure 3Specific cleavage of ITI or UTI by hyaluronidase. ITI (1 μg) purified from human serum was incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of hyaluronidase (ITI/hyaluronidase molar ratio = 10/1) (10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-ITI antibody).

It was confirmed by Western blot analysis that biotinylated ITI does not contain UTI fragments. In a parallel experiment, the cells were treated with the biotinylated ITI (0.2 μM) in the presence of an excess of unlabeled ITI (2 μM). Under this condition, H-chains and UTI could not be detected in the immunoprecipitable proteins (Fig. 4).Figure 4Immunoprecipitation of ITI in cells saturated with biotinylated ITI in the presence of an excess of unlabeled ITI. The experiment was performed as described in the legends to Figure 1, Figure 2. SMT-cc1 cell monolayers were incubated with biotinylated ITI (0.2 μM) in the presence of unlabeled ITI (0, 0.5, and 2.0 μM) in RPMI 1640 medium containing ITI-depleted FCS for 16 h at 37°C. Anti-ITI antibody-coupled Sepharose 4B was incubated with the supernatants of cell lysates (16 h, 4°C) and immunoprecipitated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test which enzymes were responsible for the cell surface ITI cleavage, we added biotinylated ITI to the serum-free culture medium of SMT-cc1 cells in the presence or absence of several protease inhibitors including diisopropyl fluorophosphate, PMSF, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, cystatin, eglin C, and E64. Several ITI derivatives were found even in the presence of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, cystatin, and E64. However, virtually no UTI was detected on the cell surface when PMSF or eglin C was added to the medium, while there was a considerable dose-dependent and time-dependent UTI formation in the absence of PMSF or eglin C (Fig. 5). These findings indicated that the cell-bound UTI was formed by cleavage of ITI on the surface of the cells. In a parallel experiment, soluble ITI was incubated with elastase. This treatment caused the complete disappearance of ITI and the appearance of H-chains and UTI. Cell-associated elastase-like enzyme(s) may be responsible for the cell-bound UTI formation (Fig. 6).Figure 5Immunoprecipitation of ITI in SMT-cc1 cell layers saturated with biotinylated ITI in the presence of protease inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2080153858,"After T4 bacteriophage infection of Escherichia coli, the enzymes of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate biosynthesis form a multienzyme complex that we call T4 deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) synthetase. At least eight phage-coded enzymes and two enzymes of host origin are found in this 1.5-mDa complex. The complex may shuttle dNTPs to DNA replication sites, because replication draws from small pools, which are probably highly localized. Several specific protein-protein contacts within the complex are described in this paper. We have studied protein-protein interactions in the complex by immobilizing individual enzymes and identifying radiolabeled T4 proteins that are retained by columns of these respective affinity ligands. Elsewhere we have described interactions involving three T4 enzymes found in the complex. In this paper we describe similar analysis of five more proteins: dihydrofolate reductase, dCTPase-dUTPase, deoxyribonucleoside monophosphokinase, ribonucleotide reductase, and E. coli nucleoside diphosphokinase,. All eight proteins analyzed to date retain single-strand DNA-binding protein (gp32), the product of T4 gene 32. At least one T4 protein, thymidylate synthase, binds directly to gp32, as shown by affinity chromatographic analysis of the two purified proteins. Among its several roles, gp32 stabilizes single-strand template DNA ahead of a replicating DNA polymerase. Our data suggest a model in which dNTP synthetase complexes, probably more than one per growing DNA chain, are drawn to replication forks via their affinity for gp32 and hence are localized so as to produce dNTPs at their sites of utilization, immediately ahead of growing DNA 3' termini."

Each of the exon products 7 (Lys236-Gln292), 8 (Val293-Gly328), and 9 (Gln329-Met357), and their combinations were evaluated for the ability to inhibit thrombin induced platelet aggregation. Only products containing exon 7 inhibited platelet aggregation induced by thrombin with an IC50 of >20 μM.

Knowledge of the critical sequence of kininogen should allow design of compounds that can modulate thrombin activation of platelets. INTRODUCTIONPlatelets are critical cells in physiological hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. Platelet activation can be defined by distinct cellular events initiated by thrombin, as well as other agonists such as collagen, ADP, and thromboxane A2. Stimulation of platelets results in a orderly process consisting of shape change, followed by aggregation and/or secretion, finally resulting in the formation of a platelet plug (Holmsen, 1994). Thrombin has been shown to bind to two receptors on the platelet surface: platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX complex (Takamatsu et al., 1986) and a seven-membered transmembrane receptor coupled to G proteins. The latter polypeptide is cleaved to expose a new NH2-terminal sequence SFLLRN (Vu et al., 1991), which can bind to distal sequences in the receptor to initiate signal transduction. Glycoprotein Ib-IX complex modulates thrombin action since, in its absence in Bernard-Soulier disease, 10 times as much thrombin is required for aggregation of platelets (Jamieson and Okumura, 1978).The multifunctional protein high molecular weight kininogen (HK) 1The abbreviations used are: HKhigh molecular mass kininogenLKlow molecular mass kininogenPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGSTglutathione S-transferaseBSAbovine serum albuminFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateD3domain 3 of kininogensPCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered saline. serves as the procofactor of the kallikrein-kinin system (also known as the contact system), a surface-mediated defense system (Colman, 1984). HK binds to platelets (Gustafson et al., 1986), neutrophils (Gustafson et al., 1989), and endothelial cells (Schmaier et al., 1988) and serves as a source of bradykinin after cleavage by a number of plasma proteases (Scott et al., 1984, 1985). HK and low molecular weight kininogen (LK) are derived from the same gene by alternate splicing of the primary transcript and have identical heavy chains, which consist of three segments (domains 1, 2, and 3), each highly homologous to cystatin (Salvesen et al., 1986; Ishiguro et al., 1987). The sequence HK diverges from LK at a position on their light chains 12 residues COOH-terminal of the bradykinin moiety. Each molecule then exhibits a unique sequence (Takagaki et al., 1985). Kininogens can inhibit papain and cathepsins B, H and L, and are the most potent plasma inhibitors of the calcium-activated cellular protease, calpain (Schmaier et al., 1986). The concentration of the kininogens in plasma is 3.95 μM (Kerbiriou-Nabias et al., 1984) comprising HK (0.67 μM) and LK (3.28 μM).HK (Puri et al., 1991) and LK (Meloni and Schmaier, 1991) both inhibit the aggregation of human gel-filtered and washed platelets by thrombin. The primary determinants for thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are present on the heavy chain, which is shared in both HK and LK. Unlike calpain, which exclusively requires domain 2 of kininogens (Bradford et al., 1990), and papain, which can be inhibited by ether domain 2 or 3, the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation is uniquely found in domain 3 of kininogens (Jiang et al., 1992).In the present study, we have expressed kininogen domain 3 and several fragments of D3, in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and then tested each polypeptide for its ability to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Recombinant fragments that demonstrated inhibition were further dissected for critical regions by deletion mutagenesis. Smaller peptides were synthesized and tested for functional inhibition of platelet aggregation. Identification of the inhibitory sequences of kininogen should yield new insights into the structural requirements for the modulation of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by kininogens.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurified ProteinsHuman fibrinogen (20.7 mg/ml) and HK (1 mg/ml) was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN. HK was supplied as a single chain and migrates as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of 120,000 daltons. Human α-thrombin was a generous gift of Dr. John W. Fenton II (Division of Laboratories and Research, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY) and had an activity of 2393 NIH units/mg containing 99.24% α-thrombin. Hirudin (9230 units/mg) was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest purity available.Construction of Various D3 Deletion Mutant Expression PlasmidsThe primary structure of D3 is illustrated (Fig. 1). The details of bacterial expression and purification of D3 (Gly235-Met357) are described earlier (Wachtfogel et al., 1994). We have utilized similar methodology using LK cDNA (pHKG36) (Kitamura et al., 1994), kindly provided by Dr. S. Nakanishi, as template to express various D3 fragments in bacteria. The DNA coding for various fragments was separately amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific sets of primers and inserted in-frame into pGEX2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) by the procedures described earlier (Wachtfogel et al., 1994; Kunapuli et al., 1993). This construct expresses the protein products as fusion proteins with GST as the NH2-terminal region (Fig. 2). All the sense primers contained a BamHI recognition site, and the antisense primers contained the EcoRI recognition site. The nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers used for these constructions are given in Table 1. Products of exons 7, 8, and 9 (Gly235-Gln292, Gln292-Gly328, and G1n329-Met357 respectively) were constructed using SPK-82A/B, SPK-82C/D, and SPK-82E/F primers, respectively. G1y235-Gly328 (exon products 7 and 8) and Gln299-Met357 (exon products 8 and 9) were constructed using SPK-82A/D and SPK-82C/F, respectively. Thr255-Gln292 (exon 7B product) was constructed using SPK-89 and SPK-82B primers.Figure 2Recombinant fragments of kininogen domain 3. The schematic representation of the 10 recombinant HK D3 GST-linked constructs. The corresponding amino acid sequence location for each construct is appropriately indicated. The resulting recombinant protein product identification is listed for each exon product construct. The position of the thrombin cleavage site located between GST and the NH2 terminus of each construct is indicated with an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Construction of Δ311-346 D3 Expression PlasmidDeletion of residues 293-328 in D3 was accomplished by construction of D3 expression plasmid lacking the coding region for Val293-Gly328 by overlapping PCR strategy similar to the one described earlier for Δ493-520 HK LC (Kunapuli et al., 1993). The first PCR was carried out using SPK-82A as a sense primer and SPK-83B (complementary to nucleotides 912-930 and 1039-1050) as an antisense primer. The second PCR was carried out using SPK-83A (corresponding to nucleotides 916-930 and 1039-1053) as a sense primer and SPK-82F as an antisense primer. The products of PCR 1 and 2 were used as a template in a third PCR with SPK-82A and SPK-82F as primers. The product of the third PCR was cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into BamHI- and EcoRI-cut pGEX2T as described earlier (Kunapuli et al., 1993). This plasmid is capable of expressing D3 lacking residues 293-328 (exon 8 product) and represents a fusion of exons 7 and 9 products.Construction of Gly235-Leu271 Fragment Expression PlasmidThe plasmid DNA capable of expressing G1y235-Gln292 (exon 7A product) was digested with HindIII and EcoRI, filled in with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the presence of four dNTPs, and religated. The unique HindIII site at nucleotide 862 thus eliminates the coding segment of Asn272-Gln292.Construction of Lys270-Gln292 Fragment Expression PlasmidThe expression plasmid capable of expressing Lys270-Gln292 (exon 7C product) was constructed by phosphorylated synthetic oligonucleotides SPK-84 (A-F). These oligonucleotides were annealed to form a fragment with BamHI- and EcoRI-compatible sites, which was ligated into BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pGEX2T. All of these plasmids were checked for the authenticity of coding sequences and junction sequences by DNA sequence analysis (Sanger et al., 1977). Fig. 2 summarizes the protein sequences coded by the recombinant fragments of D3.Purification of Recombinant ProteinsThe recombinant proteins were purified by the procedure of Smith and Johnson(1988) as described earlier (Kunapuli et al., 1993). Briefly, E. coli harboring the expression plasmid of interest were grown overnight in 100 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C. This culture was then added to 1 liter of fresh LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (1:10) and the culture grown for 2-5 h to an A600 of 0.6. Then, 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added and grown for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20-30 min at 4°C. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of PBS (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl) containing 1 mMp-mercuribenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5 μM pepstatin. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and 0.1 volume of 10% Triton X-100 was added. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The clear supernatant was then passed through a glutathione-Sepharose column (Pharmacia), pre-equilibrated in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. The breakthrough was passed through the column once more, and the column was washed thoroughly with PBS containing Triton X-100, followed by wash with PBS alone. The recombinant fusion protein was eluted with 5 mM reduced glutathione in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and fractions (1 ml) were collected. The fractions containing the protein were identified by A280 and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by Coomassie staining.Cleavage and Purification of Fusion ProductsThe proteins were concentrated, exchanged into Tyrode's buffer, and incubated with thrombin at 1/100 of the molar concentration of the recombinant polypeptide exon product for 1 h at 37°C, D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone was then added at a 10-fold molar excess to thrombin to inactivate any remaining active thrombin. After verification by SDS-PAGE that the fusion peptide had been cleaved, reverse phase HPLC using a linear gradient from 0-80% acetonitrile in a trifluoroacetic acid buffer on a C-18 column was utilized to purify the expressed polypeptide from GST and thrombin. The recovered polypeptides were lyophilized, and their purity and molecular weights were verified using mass spectroscopy.ElectrophoresisSDS-PAGE (10%) was used to monitor protein purification and cleavage was performed by the method of Laemmli(1970).Peptide SynthesisThe peptides were synthesized using a modified standard t-butoxycarbonyl solid phase chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 430 fully automated synthesizer and purified on HPLC as described previously (Bradford et al., 1993). The average yield of peptide was 40 mg, and the purity by HPLC analysis was 90-95%.Platelet PreparationFresh human blood was collected into acid citrate dextrose and centrifuged for 18 min at 990 × g to separate the red cells from the platelet rich plasma component used in the following step. Five ml of platelet rich plasma is applied onto a 50-ml packed Sepharose 2-B CL-300 column equilibrated in calcium-free Tyrode's solution buffered at pH 7.3 (Parker, 1962) containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Platelet fractions were collected, pooled and counted on a model ZM Coulter counter, Coulter Scientific Instruments, Luton, Beds, United Kingdom, yielding an average platelet concentration of 250,000 cells/μl.Functional Platelet AssaysPlatelet aggregation was monitored on a Chrono-Log model 440 dual aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA). Aggregation was performed by using a 0.5-ml assay volume at 37°C containing 400 μl of the gel-filtered platelets and the volume made up with buffer or test inhibitors. A base line was generated for 2 min, followed by the addition of 0.2 units/ml (2 nM) α-thrombin, ADP (10 μM), or collagen (2 μg/ml) to initiate the platelet aggregation response. The rate of aggregation in the presence of recombinant polypeptides or synthetic peptides was compared with the rate in the absence of any inhibitor. As described previously (Wachtfogel et al., 1994), the fusion proteins contain a thrombin-cleavable sequence between GST and the kininogen sequence to allow removal of the GST portion of the recombinant fusion protein.Studies to Detect Thrombin-HK ComplexesChromogenic AssaysHydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate D-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroaniline (S-2238) (Chromogenix, Franklin, OH) at 0.1 mM at 37°C using 0.04 units/ml α-thrombin was performed to assess the ability of kininogen and its derivatives (2-500 μM) to inhibit the active site of thrombin. To determine whether thrombin binds to HK at a site other than the active site (without inhibiting enzymatic activity) we first coated HK (2 μg/ml) by incubating it overnight in a borate buffer, pH 8.5, blocked it for 1 h with 1 mg/ml BSA, washed with PBS-Tween 20 and then reacted with thrombin, washed again, and finally detected with the chromogenic substrate for thrombin S-2238; this technique has been modified from that used to detect kallikrein complexes with HK (Page et al., 1994).Fibrinogen Coagulation AssaysThe binding of HK (2 μM) to thrombin was also assessed by observing the ability of HK (2 μM) to inhibit thrombin's activity to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. Clotting was initiated by addition of thrombin (50 units/ml, 500 nM) to fibrinogen (0.125 mg/ml) in a 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4. After thrombin was added, the clotting time was monitored by a BBL Fibrometer (BBL, Cockeysville, MD) equipped with a 0.3-ml probe. The reciprocal of the clotting time is directly proportional to the thrombin concentration. We also tested whether HK could prevent the access of hirudin (25 units/ml, 330 nM) to the active site and/or exosite, both of which are occupied by the inhibitor. The concentration of hirudin was used at a value that resulted in a 50% inhibition of the reciprocal of the thrombin-fibrinogen clotting time. Kininogen or its derivatives were added to thrombin, followed by hirudin and fibrinogen.Binding of Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-Thrombin to HKThrombin was adjusted to pH 9.5 with 0.5 M sodium carbonate, after which 0.2 mg of FITC was added to 1 mg of thrombin and then incubated on ice for 2 h in total darkness. The unbound FITC was removed by gel filtration on a G-25 Sephadex column, equilibrated in PBS. The labeled thrombin present in the first colored band was collected from the column. The thrombin binding assay was performed by capturing HK on latex beads (Seradyne, Inc. (Division of Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.) Indianapolis, IN) with a monoclonal antibody, C1C11 (Schmaier et al., 1987), directed against the light chain of HK (domain 5), which was chosen to avoid interference with the D3 domain. Increasing amounts of FITC labeled thrombin (5-100 μg/ml) were then added and incubated for 60 min. The beads were then collected on a porous membrane microplate and washed with PBS. The fluorescence was measured in a fluorescent concentration analyzer (Idexx Laboratories, Westbrook, ME).Cross-linking of HK with ThrombinHK (3.8 μM) and thrombin were incubated in PBS for 10 min at 25°C. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce), in Me2SO was added to yield a concentration of 250 μM and incubated for 30 min, then quenched for 15 min with Tris-OH (5 mM). Samples were withdrawn and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reduced (10 mM dithiothreitol) and nonreduced conditions. HK and thrombin were each treated separately for comparison with the test samples.Complex Formation of HK with Radiolabeled ThrombinThrombin was labeled by the IODOGEN method with 125I (Fraker and Speck, 1978). 125I-thrombin (at 20 μg/ml, 13,000 cpm/μl) was incubated with HK at molar ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The mixture was electrophoresed on 10% PAGE (without SDS), and the gels were dried and autoradiographed on Cronex 4 film, DuPont Medical Products, Wilmington, DE.RESULTSGeneration and Purification of Recombinant Kininogen Domain 3 FragmentsUsing procedures described under “Methods and Materials,” we have generated various recombinant fragments of kininogen domain 3, and the structures of these fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 2. All the recombinant fragments contain GST at their amino terminus, unless otherwise stated. These recombinant fragments were purified using glutathione-Sepharose as affinity matrix in a single step. The purified recombinant fragments were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the GST fusion proteins show mainly single components at the predicted molecular size. Some heterogeneity was observed in the recombinant fragments for exons 7A and 8, both of which contained a second band (27 kDa) consistent with GST that apparently had leached from the glutathione-Sepharose affinity column along with each of the resulting fusion proteins. The resulting purified fragment for exon 7 showed three bands comprising exon 7, GST, and an undetermined component migrating between GST and exon 7.Figure 3SDS electrophoretic analysis of recombinant HK D3 exon products. Coomassie-stained 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the recombinant GST-linked HK D3 exon products are shown. The samples from left to right are molecular weight markers (STD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), recombinant HK domain 3 (D-3), exon 9 (E-9), exon (E-8), Lys270-Gln292 (7C), Thr255-Gln292 (7B), Gly235-Leu271 (7A), and exon 7 (E-7). All recombinant products migrate at a higher molecular mass than the 27-kDa GST marker prior to thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein. Some samples contain free GST that leaches from the column during the purification process.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Thrombin-induced Platelet Aggregation by Recombinant Kininogen D3 FragmentsVarious kininogen domain 3 recombinant fragments were evaluated for the ability to block the aggregation of gel-filtered platelets by (2 nM) thrombin. Initial screening of the seven initial recombinant fusion proteins showed that D3 (Gly235-Met357), coded for by exons 7, 8, and 9; exon 7 product (Gly235-Gln292); and products of exons 7 and 8 and exons 7 and 9, were capable of blocking thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 less than or equal to 20 μM (Table 2). These results suggest that only those polypeptides containing the sequence coded by exon 7 had inhibitory activity. The IC50 of the GST-free exon 7 product is 13.4 μM, only 3 times more than D3. These results indicate that the primary determinants for inhibition of thrombin-induced aggregation reside in the polypeptide coded by exon 7. In order to further define the sequence responsible for inhibition, three additional recombinant fragments were made from exon 7, namely 7A (Gly235-Leu270), 7B (Thr255-Gln292), and 7C (Lys270-Gln292). When these recombinant polypeptides were tested for their ability to inhibit thrombin-induced aggregation, 7B, containing the COOH-terminal half of exon 7 product, was the most effective inhibitor (25 μM). Since GST (27 kDa) could potentially modify the inhibitory activity of the much smaller kininogen polypeptides, the recombinant polypeptides were cleaved from fusion proteins, purified to homogeneity, and retested in the aggregation assay (Table 2). Several attempts were made to cleave and remove GST from exon 7A product, but this construct proved resistant to thrombin cleavage even at 10-fold higher thrombin concentrations and incubation times of up to 18 h; therefore, only the IC50 value for the GST-linked product is reported. However, the IC50 of the fusion protein exon product 7A was the least potent of the exon 7 products. When the cleaved polypeptides were repurified on HPLC (see “Materials and Methods” and Table 2), D3 was the most potent (IC50 = 4 μM, similar to native HK = 2 μM). Exon 7, 7B, and 7C products were highly active, only 3-5 times less potent than D3 (IC50 13.4-19 μM) (Table 2, Fig. 4). The shortest inhibitory sequence 7C was the 23-amino acid Lys270-Gln292 (exon 7C).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Inhibition of the thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by D3-derived peptide products. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was evaluated in the presence of three polypeptides derived from exon 7 of HK. Gel-filtered platelets were incubated for 2 min with increasing amounts of each polypeptide and then activated with 2 nM thrombin to determine the relative IC50 inhibitory potencies. The recombinant polypeptide 7C (Gly235-Gln292) resulted in an IC50 of 13.4 μM (■). The COOH-terminal half of the polypeptide coded for by exon 7, 7B (Lys270-Gln292), has an IC50 of 30 μM (▲), and the synthetic peptide LNAENNA (Leu271-Ala277) inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 of 65 μM (•).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Thrombin-induced Platelet Aggregation by Synthetic PeptidesIn order to further delineate the minimal structure responsible in Lys270-Gln292, we synthesized 4 overlapping peptides. Neither Ile283-Gln292 nor Phe279-Ile283 had any inhibitory activity at 500 μM and Asn275-Phe279 inhibited at 275 μM (Table 3). In contrast, Leu271-Ala277 showed an IC50 of 65 μM (about 15 times that of recombinant D3) (Fig. 4).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Molecular Model of Leu271-Ala277 within D3We restudied a homology model of D3 constructed as described previously (Bradford et al., 1993), based on the crystalline structure of egg white cystatin (Bode et al., 1988). The polypeptide L271NAENNA277 appears as a subdomain on the surface (Fig. 5). An α carbon trace (data not shown) indicates that it is in a helix-turn conformation.Figure 5Thrombin inhibitory sequence of HK. Figure is a three-dimensional homology model of D3 based on cystatin with the position of the peptide sequence LNAENNA highlighted and displayed as a hydrated region.

Leu271-Ala277 (LNAENNA) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by thrombin (1 nM) and partially inhibited aggregation by thrombin (2 nM) (Fig. 6). In contrast, platelet aggregation induced by ADP (10 μM), collagen (2 μg/ml) (Fig. 6), or SFLLRN (10 μM, the thrombin receptor tethered peptide) (data not shown) were unaffected.Figure 6Specificity of LNAENNA on platelet agonists. Panels 1-4 demonstrate the specificity of 26 μM LNAENNA on three platelet agonists. Panel 1 shows the inhibition by LNAENNA of gel-filtered platelets stimulated by the addition of 2 nM thrombin. Panel 2 shows an apparent increase in inhibitory potency with the same concentration of inhibitor but using thrombin at 1 nM instead, suggesting that both inhibitor and agonists compete for the same site on the platelet surface. Panel 3 indicates that LNAENNA has no effect on ADP-stimulated platelets (10 mM). Panel 4 shows that the aggregation by collagen (2 mg/ml) was unaffected by this peptide sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thrombin Binding to KininogenHK was evaluated to determine if the observed inhibition of platelet aggregation by HK could be due to direct complexing of thrombin to HK by four different methods. The ability of HK to inhibit the thrombin conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin was first evaluated and compared with hirudin. Hirudin could completely block thrombin clotting of fibrinogen, while HK showed no effect up to a 50-fold molar excess to thrombin. Second, when HK (2 μg/ml) or a control BSA (2 μg/ml) was coated onto an Immobilon plate overnight, washed, reacted with increasing amounts of thrombin, washed, and probed for bound thrombin with S-2238, modest amounts of thrombin activity could be detected bound to both HK and BSA, but no specific binding of thrombin to HK was observed when the amount of thrombin bound to the BSA control was subtracted. Similar results were observed when HK bound to a C1C11 monoclonal antibody (directed to HK domain 5) linked to latex beads (see “Materials and Methods”) were used and reacted with increasing concentrations of FITC-labeled thrombin. Fluorescence concentration analyzer detection of FITC-labeled thrombin bound to HK immobilized to latex beads yielded negative results.125I-Thrombin was reacted with kininogen at 1/0.5, 1/1, and 1/2 molar ratios and run on 10% native gels (no SDS), then autoradiographed to determined if a mobility shift could be observed or the presence of a new band could be seen. No difference could be found between the thrombin control and the lanes containing thrombin and kininogen mixtures (data not shown). These experiments provide further evidence against the formation of a thrombin-HK complex to explain the ability of HK to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.Kininogen Peptide Effects on the Amidolytic Activity of ThrombinSelected synthetic peptide was evaluated for the ability to block the thrombin cleavage of the chromogenic substrate"

Inhibition of the enzyme activity by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue was also investigated. The enzyme has been crystallized from methoxypolyethylene glycol. The crystals are of the orthorhombic space group P21212 and diffract to 2.6 Å. The unit cell dimensions are a = 66.1 Å, b = 87.6 Å, and c = 78.6 Å, with one monomer in the asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.77 Å3/Da). This is the first member of the DNA ligase family of enzymes to be crystallized. INTRODUCTIONDNA ligases catalyze the formation of phosphodiester bonds at single-strand breaks between adjacent 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate termini in double-stranded DNA (for reviews see (1.Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2.Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 3-29Google Scholar, 3.Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 251-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)). Polynucleotide ligases are ubiquitous cell proteins that are required for a number of important cellular processes, including replication of DNA, and the repair of damaged DNA, as evidenced by the number of viruses that have genes encoding there own ligases. Despite their occurrence in all organisms, DNA ligases show a wide diversity of molecular sizes, amino acid sequences, and properties. DNA ligases can be divided into two broad classes: those requiring NAD+ as a cofactor and those requiring ATP. The eucaryotic and virally encoded enzymes all require ATP. The ligases in this class range in size from 103 kDa for the human type I enzyme (4.Barnes D.E. Johnson L.H. Kodama K. Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6679-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to 41 kDa for bacteriophage T7 DNA(5.Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 303-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The NAD+ requiring DNA ligases have only been found in prokaryotic organisms to date. The amino acid sequences for a number of bacterial DNA ligases are now available(6.Ishino Y. Shinagawa H. Makino K. Tsunasawa S. Sakiyama F. Nakata A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7.Barany F. Gelfand D.H. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8.Lauer G. Rudd E.A. McKay D.L. Ally A. Ally D. Backman K.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These NAD+-dependent enzymes are highly homologous and are monomeric proteins of 70-80 kDa but show little homology with ATP-dependent ligases.It is now widely accepted that all ligases catalyze the synthesis of phosphodiester bonds in a very similar manner, by esterification of a 5′-phosphoryl to a 3′-hydroxyl group. The reaction mechanism can be split into three distinct catalytic events (Fig. 1). The first involves activation of the ligase through the formation of a covalent protein-AMP intermediate. The nucleotide has been shown to be linked to the enzyme through a phosphoramidate bond to the ϵ-amino group of a conserved active site lysine(9.Tomkinson A.E. Totty N.F. Ginsburg M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10.Kodama K. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6093-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the second step of the reaction, the AMP moiety is transferred from the ligase to the 5′-phosphate group at the single-strand break site. Finally, DNA ligase catalyzes the DNA ligation step with the loss of free AMP. In spite of these similarities between the two classes of enzyme the manner by which the bacterial and eucaryotic proteins become activated is rather different. For eucaryotic ligases, the enzyme-AMP complex is formed after reaction of the enzyme and ATP with the release of free pyrophosphate. The bacterial ligases become adenylated in an unusual reaction, which involves the cleavage of NAD+ and the release of nicotinamide mononucleotide(2.Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 3-29Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the bacterial enzymes, unlike the ATP-dependent enzymes, are stimulated up to 20-fold by monovalent cations, particularly ammonium ions(11.Modrich P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7502-7511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The ATP-dependent DNA ligases contain only a few areas of sequence homology, the most conserved of these is the KXDGXR motif, which has been shown to contain the active site lysine for a number of nucleotidyl transfer enzymes including DNA and RNA ligases (9.Tomkinson A.E. Totty N.F. Ginsburg M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12.Heaphy S. Singh M. Gait M.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and RNA guanylyltransferases (13.Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The second most conserved motif (SLRFPRFIRIR) is located in the extreme C termini of the proteins, but its function is currently unknown. Greater homology can be shown if the sequence alignments are limited to more restricted sets(14.Kletzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5389-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The most highly conserved sequences are located primarily in the C-terminal region of the protein, with the majority of inserts occurring in the N-terminal end.Bacteriophage T7 encodes a DNA ligase of molecular mass 41,133 Da based on the gene sequence(5.Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 303-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The enzyme can utilize either ATP or, to a lesser extent, dATP as a cofactor, and catalyzes an exchange reaction between pyrophosphate and either ATP or dATP. The optimal pH range for the enzyme is 7.2-7.7(2.Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 3-29Google Scholar). In common with other DNA ligases, the enzyme also requires a divalent cation for activity. This appears to be fulfilled by Mg2+ ions in vivo, although other ions, such as Ca2+, can substitute to give reduced activity. While the 60-kDa DNA ligase from bacteriophage T4 has been well characterized biochemically and genetically(2.Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 3-29Google Scholar), an extensive study of the smaller T7 enzyme has not been reported. Previous work has revealed that both T4 and T7 DNA ligases are able to join DNA annealed to RNA and, to a slight extent, even RNA annealed to its complementary RNA strand(15.Fareed G.C. Wilt E.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 925-932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither enzyme appears to be capable of ligating single-stranded DNA.We describe the cloning and overexpression of the T7 DNA ligase gene in Escherichia coli. The gene was placed under the control of a T7 promoter, which allowed us to tightly control the level of gene expression. Strains harboring this plasmid expressed the protein at >15% of soluble cell protein. The enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity, and the physical and biochemical properties of the protein have been evaluated. We have also crystallized the protein using vapor diffusion methods, and these crystals diffract to 2.6 Å.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Cloning VectorsThe following strains of E. coli were used as hosts for pET21d (Novagen) constructs: XL1-Blue (supE44, hsdR17, recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-,relA, [F′proAB, lacIqZΔM15, Tn10 (etr)]) (16.Bullock W.O.

E. coli strains were grown aerobically in Luria broth or on Luria broth agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics.General TechniquesAll restriction endonucleases and modification enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's protocols. All the transformations, DNA isolations, and manipulations were performed essentially as described previously unless otherwise stated(20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer. The oligonucleotides were desalted on NAP G200 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionF-ara-ATP9-β-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine triphosphateDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPEGpolyethylene glycolAMPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionF-ara-ATP9-β-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine triphosphateDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPEGpolyethylene glycolAMPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. of the T7 Ligase GeneTwo oligonucleotides based on the T7 genomic sequence were designed: a 5′-primer containing an NcoI site, 5′-GA TAT ACC ATG GTG AAC ATT AAG ACT AAC-3′ and a 3′-primer containing a HindIII site, 5′-GGG TTT TAA GCT TAC ATT TTC TCT TGA GGG-3′. PCR was performed with these primers and genomic bacteriophage T7 DNA (Sigma) using Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer) in 100 μl of PCR buffer and cycled as described(21.Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13401) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction was electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the 1-kilobase product was excised from the gel and purified using a Qiaex DNA extraction kit (Qiagen).Cloning and Overexpression of the T7 lig GeneThe PCR product was purified as described above and cleaved with NcoI and HindIII, ligated into dephosphorylated NcoI/HindIII-cut pET21d (Novagen), and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue. Positive clones containing the ligase gene (pT7lig) were isolated by restriction analysis and screened for expression by transforming into B834 (DE3). Selected colonies were grown at 37°C in 5 ml of Luria broth, containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol, to an A600 of 0.6, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and grown for a further 3 h. The level of induction was monitored using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.DNA SequencingThe dideoxy method (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52363) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the complete nucleotide sequence of the T7 lig gene. Single-stranded template DNA was produced in E. coli XL1-Blue using helper phage M13KO7 (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Purification of T7 LigaseTwo 1-liter cultures of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol were inoculated with a 5-ml culture of B834(DE3)[pLysS] (pT7lig) and grown at 37°C until the A600 reached 0.6-0.7. The cultures were induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Growth was continued for a further 3 h before harvest of the cells by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The cell pellets were stored at −20°C until required. The pellets were lysed by sonication of a 10% (w/v) cell suspension in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removal of the cell debris, by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of a saturated ammonium sulfate solution. The precipitate was harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in a volume of buffer A, which resulted in a solution whose conductivity was less than that of a 100 mM solution of sodium chloride. This was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (20 ml) equilibrated with 90% buffer A and 10% buffer B (buffer A containing 2 M sodium chloride). After washing the column with a further 2 column volumes of this mixture, the ligase was step-eluted by washing with 40% buffer B. SDS-PAGE confirmed that this peak contained the semi-purified enzyme at high concentrations. The protein was diluted with buffer to reduce the effective salt concentration to 100 mM NaCl, and this was loaded onto a blue-Sepharose column, which had been pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The protein was step-eluted with 50% buffer B. The concentration of NaCl in the peak fractions was reduced to less than 50 mM by dilution with buffer A. This was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (40 ml) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was then washed with 80 ml of buffer A before elution of the protein with 30% buffer B. Purity was again monitored by electrophoresing samples on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Trace contaminants were removed by gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column.DNA Ligase AssaysLigation of DNA fragments with cohesive ends was performed in a final volume of 10 μl containing 0.3 μg of EcoRI/HindIII-digested λ phage DNA, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and added nucleotide cofactors as indicated. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and stopped by the addition of 50 mM EDTA followed by incubation at 65°C for 10 min. Samples were electrophoresed in 1% agarose, and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide.DNA ligase assay substrate (22-mer) was radiolabeled by incubating 20 μg of the oligonucleotide with 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) and 50 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase for 45 min at 37°C followed by 10 min at 70°C. The unincorporated label was removed by centrifugation through a S-200 microspin column (Pharmacia). The DNA ligase assay was performed essentially as described previously(23.Yang S-W. Chan J.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complementary 18- and 22-mer oligonucleotides were annealed to single-stranded M13mp19 by incubation at 70°C for 2 min and allowed to cool for 1 h. The annealed DNA was incubated with ligase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT) unless otherwise stated, in the presence of enzyme and nucleotide cofactors as indicated, in a total volume of 10 μl for 15 min at 25°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of sequencing stopping buffer (Sequenase kit, U.S. Biochemical Corp.) followed by heating at 95°C for 5 min. The ligation products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide urea gel and to autoradiography with Fugi RX x-ray film.Ligation of blunt-ended DNA fragments was performed in ligase buffer plus 1 mM ATP, with 200 ng of HaeIII-digested ϕX174 DNA, polyethylene glycol 8000 and 2 units of ligase. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25°C, and products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels.DNA Ligase LabelingT7 DNA ligase (1 mg/ml) was incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothretol and 25 mCi of [α-32P] ATP in a total volume of 20 μl for 15 min at 25°C. The reactions were stopped by boiling in SDS-buffer for 5 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS gel(24.Laemmli U.K Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). The gels were dried before being autoradiographed on Fuji RX x-ray film.CrystallizationThe protein was concentrated to between 15 and 20 mg/ml using Centricon concentrators (Amicon). The protein was exchanged into 50 mM Bis Tris-HCl buffer pH 6.9, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT during this process. Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at 20°C on a small scale in hanging drops (4 μl) over a 1-ml well solution of 100 mM Bis Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 100 mM NaCl and methoxypolyethylene glycol of molecular weight 5000 at a concentration of 12% (w/v).X-ray Data CollectionX-ray data have been collected to 2.6 Å using synchrotron radiation (Daresbury, UK; EMBL, Hamburg, Germany; and Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) and an image plate detector. The data were processed using DENZO (25.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaccs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar) and scaled together with SCALEPACK.RESULTSCloning, Overproduction, and Purification of T7 LigaseTo produce the enzyme in large quantities, it was necessary to amplify by PCR the T7 lig gene from bacteriophage T7 genomic DNA and subclone it into a T7 promoter-based expression vector. The 5′-PCR primer contained an NcoI site, allowing the PCR product to be cloned into pET21d. The Met-2 codon was changed to Val-2 (GTG) to prevent secondary translation occurring at this position. The 3′-primer contained a HindIII site after the stop codon. The PCR product was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the 1-kilobase DNA fragment was excised and purified. The DNA was digested with NcoI and HindIII and further gel-purified. This fragment was ligated into dephosphorylated, HindIII-cleaved pET21d, transformed into E. coli XL1-blue and plated onto LB agar plates containing ampicillin. A large number of colonies were found to have the correct DNA insert size upon digestion with NcoI and HindIII. Surprisingly, a majority of the clones were able to complement E. coli GR501, a conditional-lethal DNA ligase mutant that is not viable at 42°C, despite the fact that the T7 ligase gene is under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, which should not be recognized in this cell line. A low level of basal expression of the T7 ligase gene must be occurring that is sufficient to complement the lig-deficient strain, possibly as a result of read-through from the β-lactamase promoter on the plasmid, which is on the same DNA strand as the coding sequence of the ligase gene.The T7 DNA ligase gene was fully sequenced, and the sequence agreed with that published previously(5.Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 303-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The resulting active clone was screened for overexpression of the T7 ligase gene by transforming into B834(DE3)[pLysS], inoculating single colonies into 5-ml cultures of LB containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol and growing for several hours. The cells were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and grown for 3 h. Samples were taken and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In all cases a large amount of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa accumulated in the induced cells but was absent from uninduced cultures. The crude sonicated cell extract supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The protein was then purified using a heparin-Sepharose column followed by blue-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and finally gel filtration using a Superdex S-200 column. The protein was greater than 99% pure at this stage as determined by 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The final yield of enzyme was typically 60-70 mg/liter using the host strain B834(DE3) compared with 10-15 mg/liter when BL21(DE3) was used as the expression host(26.Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2074-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Figure 2Purification of T7 DNA ligase.

However, during the purification it was observed that the protein eluted in the void volume of a Superdex S-75 gel filtration column, suggesting either that the protein was running anomalously or that it was aggregating to form higher order complexes. To investigate this finding, native T7 ligase was loaded onto a Superdex S-200 column that had been standardized with proteins of known molecular weight. These gel filtration studies were performed in the absence of any ligands in the standard elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl). The protein eluted from the column with an apparent molecular mass of 85-90 kDa (Fig. 3). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that this peak had the expected molecular mass for T7 ligase (41 kDa). We examined the effects of a number of metal ions on the protein. Zinc, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and the majority of other heavy metals caused the protein to aggregate (data not shown). In the case of nickel and the other heavy metals this effect occurs very rapidly (minutes) at stoichiometric levels of the compounds. This phenomenon was observed first in crystallization trials, the addition of various metals to solutions containing high concentrations of protein (5-15 mg/ml) caused instant visible precipitation that was not reversible by dialysis. The mechanism by which this aggregation occurs is unclear but should be better understood when the structure of the enzyme has been determined.Figure 3Analytical gel filtration of T7 ligase. The elution profile of T7 ligase from a Superdex S-200 gel filtration column. The column was calibrated by monitoring the elution of standard proteins at 280 nm. A 100-μl sample of purified T7 ligase (2 mg/ml) was loaded onto the column (pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mass spectroscopy and equilibrium sedimentation were employed to determine whether the enzyme exists as a monomer or dimer. According to equilibrium sedimentation, the protein appears to be monomeric with a calculated molecular weight of 40,645 ± 300 (Fig. 4). The molecular mass of native T7 ligase was determined to be 41,132 Da using electrospray mass spectroscopy (Fig. 4), with the adenylated form having a mass of 41,460 Da. Approximately one-third of the purified protein exists in the adenylated form.Figure 4Physical properties of T7 ligase. A, analytical equilibrium centrification. Sedimentation equilibrium of T7 ligase at 15,000 rpm and a constant temperature of 20°C. The data are consistent with a protein of molecular weight 40,625 ± 262. Mass spectroscopy. Electrospray mass spectroscopy reveals that the purified T7 DNA ligase is composed of two major species, the native enzyme with a molecular mass of 41,132 Da and the adenylated enzyme with a molecular mass of 41,460 Da.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The isoelectric point (pI) of T7 ligase has been calculated to be 5.2 based on the amino acid sequence. The isoelectric point of purified T7 ligase was determined using a PhastGel (Pharmacia). The pI was shown to be close to 5.8 (data not shown), but the protein is insoluble below its pI.DNA Substrate Specificity and Catalytic Properties of T7 LigaseThe substrate specificity of purified T7 ligase was tested on a series of natural and synthetic DNA substrates. It was shown previously that T7 DNA ligase, assayed in crude extracts, can ligate oligo(dT)•oligo(A) and oligo(A)•oligo(dT)(15.Fareed G.C. Wilt E.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 925-932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme is very efficient at ligating DNA containing cohesive ends and nicked sites (Fig. 5). However, it is incapable of performing single-strand DNA ligations in common with both the T4 and E. coli ligases (Fig. 5). T4 DNA ligase has the ability to join blunt-ended DNA fragments(27.Sgaramella V. van de Sande J.H. Korana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1468-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and this activity is greatly enhanced by the addition of macromolecular crowding agents such as polyethylene glycol(28.Pheiffer B.H. Zimmerman S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7853-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The addition of such agents allows other ligases, such as those from E. coli, rat liver, and Thermus thermophilus, to perform blunt-end ligations(29.Zimmerman S.B. Pheiffer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5852-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). T7 ligase can ligate blunt-ended DNA fragments efficiently in the presence of a wide range of polyethylene glycols but is inactive in the absence of such crowding agents. This activity is optimal at between 20 and 30% of PEG 6000 and the efficiency of the reaction under these conditions is comparable with that of the T4 enzyme (Fig. 6).Figure 5DNA ligase assay. The synthetic nicked substrate consists of a complementary and 5′-32P-labeled 22-mer and an adjacent 18-mer annealed with single-stranded M13 DNA.

We have examined the effects of transiently overexpressing syntaxin 1A on protein secretion in constitutively secreting cell lines that do not normally express the protein. Syntaxin 1A slowed the constitutive release of marker proteins human growth hormone (hGH) and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein from COS-1 cells, increasing the intracellular half-life of human growth hormone from 90 min to 18 h. A similar effect was observed in HEK 293 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that these secretory proteins were concentrated in the periphery of the cell. The effect was specific for the full-length neuronal protein. Neither a syntaxin 1A variant which lacks a membrane attachment domain nor syntaxin 2 caused the cells to retain human growth hormone. The effect of syntaxin 1A was partially reversed by incubating the cells with botulinum type C1 neurotoxin, which specifically cleaves syntaxin 1A. Release of human growth hormone from syntaxin 1A-expressing cells was maintained during a blockade of protein synthesis, suggesting that the hormone was being released from a pool of stored vesicles which accumulated before the addition of cycloheximide. The existence of a post-Golgi storage compartment in syntaxin 1A-expressing cells was confirmed using brefeldin A to collapse the Golgi stacks in both HEK 293 and COS-1 cells. Brefeldin A rapidly blocked growth hormone release in control cultures while having no effect on release in cells expressing syntaxin 1A. Reducing the temperature to 19°C, which inhibits transport from the trans-Golgi network, also inhibited hGH secretion from cells without syntaxin 1A but had little effect on hGH secretion from cells with syntaxin 1A. The present experiments indicate that syntaxin 1A enables the storage of vesicles which would otherwise be immediately released.

We have coupled this observation with a two-step purification method that allows efficient purification and stabilization of transcriptionally active glucocorticoid receptor. For this procedure, the GR first undergoes a major purification by anion exchange chromatography following hormone binding and on-column receptor transformation. Second, the GR is resolved to homogeneity utilizing a hydrophobic interaction chromatography step which consists of a 2.5 M to 0 M NaCl gradient elution of contaminating proteins followed by displacement of GR by CHAPS.

https://openalex.org/W1963577254,"Recent studies have shown that substitution of Ala for one or more Phe residues in calmodulin (CaM) imparts a temperature-sensitive phenotype to yeast (Ohya, Y., and Botstein, D. (1994) Science 263, 963-966). The Phe residue immediately preceding the first Ca2+ ligand in site III of CaM (Phe-92) was found to be of particular importance because the mutation at this position alone was sufficient to induce this phenotype. In the present work we have studied the functional and structural consequences of the Phe-92 → Ala mutation in human liver calmodulin. We found that the mutant (CaMF92A) is incapable of activating phosphodiesterase, and the maximal activation of calcineurin is reduced by 40% as compared with the wild type CaM. Impaired regulatory properties of CaMF92A are accompanied by an increase in affinity for Ca2+ at the C-terminal domain. To investigate the structural consequences of the F92A mutation, we constructed four recombinant C-terminal domain fragments (C-CaM) of calmodulin (residues 78-148): 1) wild type (C-CaMW); 2) Ala substituted for Phe-92 (C-CaMF92A); 3) cysteine residues introduced at position 85 and 112 to lock the domain with a disulfide bond in the Ca2+-free (closed) conformation (C-CaM85/112); and 4) mutations 2 and 3 combined (C-CaM85/112F92A). The Cys-containing mutants readily form intramolecular disulfide bonds regardless whether Phe or Ala is present at position 92. The F92A mutation causes a decrease in stability of the domain in the absence of Ca2+ as indicated by an 11.8°C shift in the far UV circular dichroism thermal unfolding curve. This effect is reversed by the disulfide bond in the C-CaM85/112F92A mutant. The C-CaMW peptide shows a characteristic Ca2+-dependent increase in solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface which was monitored by an increase in the fluorescence of the hydrophobic probe 1,1′-bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid. The fluorescence increase induced by C-CaMF92A is ~45% lower than that induced by C-CaMW suggesting that the F92A mutation causes a decrease in the accessibility of several hydrophobic side chains in the C-terminal domain of CaM in the presence of Ca2+. The Cys-85-Cys-112 disulfide bond causes a 10- or 5.9-fold decrease in Ca2+ affinity depending on whether Phe or Ala is present at position 92, respectively, suggesting that coupling between Ca2+ binding and the conformational transition is weaker in the absence of the phenyl ring at position 92. Our results indicate that Phe-92 makes an important contribution to the Ca2+-induced transition in the C-terminal domain of CaM.

In this study, the refolding pathway of reduced rhSCF is examined by monitoring the distribution of HPLC-separable disulfide-bonded intermediates during refolding and by characterizing physicochemical and biological properties of the isolated intermediates. The folding of rhSCF involves intermediates containing native and non-native disulfides, thermodynamically stable and unstable intermediates, as well as disulfide-bonded dimers. These studies allow us better to understand the contribution of native and mispaired disulfide-containing intermediates to the in vitro folding pathway of rhSCF. human stem cell factor recombinant hSCF Chinese hamster ovary dithiothreitol oxdized DTT reduced DTT trifluoroacetic acid iodoacetic acid reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis S-carboxymethylated Cys guanidine HCl full width at half emission maximum fully oxidized rhSCF fully reduced rhSCF SDS-nondissociable but DTT-reducible rhSCF dimer.

Ultrapure DTTred was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim, while DTTox was from Sigma. These two reagents were verified to be highly pure by reverse-phase HPLC using a C4 column. Expression, isolation and some characterization of rhSCF C43,138A analog have been described previously(19.Langley K.E. Mendiaz E.A. Liu N. Narhi L.O. Zeni L. Perseghian C. Clogston C.L. Leslie I.

HPLC solvents and water were purchased from Burdick and Jackson. Sequencing reagents and solvents were supplied by Applied Biosystems and Hewlett Packard. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. rhSCF (3 mg/ml) was reduced with a 100-fold molar excess of DTTred in 0.3 M Tris containing 6 M GdnHCl (pH 8.5) for 4 h at 25°C. The sample was quickly buffer-exchanged into refolding buffer using an HR10/10 desalting column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) run in a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The refolding buffer is 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 2.5 M urea, 2 mM EDTA, and 60 mM NaCl (pH 8.5). Oxygen in the buffer was completely removed by a continuous nitrogen flushing of the buffer before use. Urea is introduced in the buffer to keep denatured and reduced rhSCF soluble. The concentration of protein was spectrophotometrically determined at 280 nm (absorbance = 0.62 for rhSCF at 1 mg/ml)(17.Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.M. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J.

Refolding studies were carried out immediately after buffer exchange. Fully reduced and denatured rhSCF was diluted to 0.25-1.0 mg/ml in oxygen-free refolding buffer as described. Samples were allowed to refold in the presence of DTTox at 66.6 mM concentration. At various time intervals, aliquots of folding mixtures were taken, which were then reacted immediately with iodoacetic acid (IAA) or acidified with TFA (see below). The refolding rhSCF mixtures, after IAA or acid treatment, were injected onto C-4 reverse phase columns (Syn-Chro Pak, 0.46 × 25 cm, 300 Å). Solvent A is 0.1% TFA and solvent B is 0.1% TFA in 90% acetonitrile. The column was initially equilibrated with 55% B and eluted by linear gradients from 55 to 65% B over 80 min and from 65 to 95% B over 5 min on an HP-1090 liquid chromatograph equipped with an autosampler and a photodiode array detector. Elution of protein peaks was detected at 215 nm, and protein fractions obtained from HPLC were collected for further analysis. Aliquots of folding mixture were removed at selected time intervals and unreacted thiols blocked by the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 M iodoacetic acid in 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 min at room temperature. Samples were then immediately analyzed by HPLC or desalted as described above. TFA-quenched samples were prepared by adding a 0.1 volume of 25% TFA into the folding mixture. Native rhSCF at 1 mg/ml was incubated in the folding buffer (see above) containing 4 mM DTTred at 25°C. Aliquots were removed at various times and acidified by the addition of 0.1 volume of 25% TFA for subsequent RP-HPLC analysis. Intermediate forms obtained from acid-quenching of the folding samples or from partial reduction of native rhSCF as described can be prepared by RP-HPLC (see “Results”). The samples obtained were partially dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted in 100 μl of 10 mM HCl containing 2.5 M urea (pH 2.0). Folding of each isolated intermediate was resumed by adding 5 volumes of the above-mentioned folding buffer containing DTTox. IAA-alkylated intermediates isolated from HPLC were dried and reconstituted in 50 mM Tris buffer containing 2.5 M urea, 2 mM EDTA, and 60 mM NaCl (pH 8.5) for endoproteinase Glu-C digestion. Peptide mapping was performed as described previously(20.Jones M.D. Merewether L.A. Clogston C.L. Lu H.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples prepared for Asp-N peptide mapping were reconstituted using the same buffer described above but without addition of 2 mM EDTA, and detailed procedures were also as reported previously(16.Langley K.E. Wypych J. Mendiaz E.A. Clogston C.L. Parker V.P. Farrar D.H. Brothers M.O. Satygal V.N. Leslie I. Birkett N.C. Smith K.A. Baltera Jr., R.J. Lyons D.E. Hogan J.M. Crandall C. Boone T.C. Pope J.A.

Sequence analysis of peptides was performed on an automatic protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems models 477A or 470 or Hewlett Packard G1000A). Mass spectroscopic analysis of peptides was performed on a Sciex API III electrospray mass spectrometer as described elsewhere(20.Jones M.D. Merewether L.A. Clogston C.L. Lu H.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter and cuvettes with a 0.02 cm (for far UV CD) or a 1 cm (for near UV CD) path length. Protein samples were clarified through sterile filtration using a 0.2- μm membrane, and concentrations were determined by their absorbance at 280 nm. All proteins were analyzed in 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 2.5 M urea, 2 mM EDTA, and 60 mM NaCl (pH 8.5). The α-helical content of proteins was estimated according to Greenfield and Fasman(21.Greenfield M. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). The thermal stability was measured by the temperature-induced change in ellipticity at 222 nm, using a JTC-345 Peltier thermal control unit, and a rectangular cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. The proteins were heated at 20°C/h, and the spectra from 240 to 200 nm were collected every 2 ± 0.5°C. The ellipticity at 222 nm alone was simultaneously monitored every 0.5°C. The curve of ellipticity at 222 nm versus temperature was fitted by a computer program which fits the base lines before and after heating individually, and then fits the transition region compensating for the base lines. The fluorescence spectra were determined at ambient temperature on an SLM Aminco 500C spectrofluorimeter, using a cuvette with a path length of 0.5 cm and protein concentrations of 0.22 mg/ml. The solutions were excited at 280 nm, and the fluorescence spectra from 280 to 420 nm were recorded, using slit widths of 5 nm. [3H]Thymidine incorporation by the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line UT-7 was monitored in cell proliferation assays as described previously(22.Smith K.A. Zsebo K.M. Coligan J.E.

Nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE using 16% precast gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) was performed using a Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) gel system. Gel filtration was performed in Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia) preequilibrated with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 M NaCl. Samples were analyzed by an HP-1050 Ti system (Hewlett Packard) equipped with an autosampler, a diode array detector, and a ChemStation PC-based software package for data acquisition and analysis using conditions as described elsewhere (17.Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.M. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L. Zsebo K.M. Mendiaz E.A. Wypych J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18942-18948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular weights were determined using two detectors in series: an on-line laser light-scattering detector (Mini-Dawn, Wyatt Technologies) and a refractive index detector (Hewlett Packard HP1047A). Chromatograms were collected and analyzed on the Hewlett Packard ChemStation. Molecular weights were obtained from the ratio of light-scattering and refractive index signals, using procedures similar to those described previously(24.Takagi T. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 280: 409-416Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25.Kato A. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), after calibration using ribonuclease, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin monomer/dimer. The molecular weight of samples determined by this procedure is independent of their respective elution times. In its native state, folded and disulfide-bonded rhSCF forms a noncovalently linked dimer in solution(17.Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.M. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L. Zsebo K.M. Mendiaz E.A. Wypych J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18942-18948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In RP-HPLC, native rhSCF has been dissociated into monomers under acidic elution conditions and behaved as a sharp symmetrical peak. Under conditions using a shallow acetonitrile gradient elution in TFA, the reduced rhSCF form was well separated from the oxidized form and eluted approximately 10 min later. As shown in Fig. 1A, this HPLC procedure allows the separation of various folding intermediates for studying oxidative folding of denatured and reduced rhSCF. Fig. 1A shows RP-HPLC analysis of IAA-treated sample aliquots taken at different time intervals. Folding after TFA acidification also exhibited a similar HPLC profile containing the same relative distribution of intermediate forms. RP-HPLC can resolve several IAA-trapped intermediates in addition to the native(N) and fully reduced (R) forms in rhSCF folding mixtures. In the initial stages of the reaction (<2 h), R and N species were readily identified along with five intermediate forms, designated as I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, and I-5. I-4 and I-5 seemed to form very early (<20 min) and decreased to a very low level later. Intermediate I-1, I-2, and I-3 still remain to some extent throughout the whole folding process. At later stages in the folding (>20 h) a particular form P that elutes more hydrophobically than R also appeared. P was identified to be an SDS-nondissociable but DTT-reducible rhSCF dimer as described in a companion study(26.Lu H.S. Jones M.D. Shieh J.-H. Mendiaz E. Feng D. Watler P. Narhi L.O. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11309-11316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The folding kinetics were investigated further by plotting folding times versus rate of generation for each intermediate estimated from HPLC peak integration. Fig. 1B shows the kinetic profiles for the five intermediate forms as well as R and N, while Fig. 1C depicts generation rates for intermediates within the first 20 min of folding. Initially R disappeared rapidly with concomitant formation of various intermediate forms and the finally folded form N. The data clearly show that the I-1 concentration increased rapidly and persisted for a longer period of time during folding. After 48 h of folding, 72.9% of the total protein has completely folded into N, with 12.1% remaining in I-1 and 12.9% in P. Only 1.3% of the protein remained fully reduced. The initial first order folding rates for conversion of R into each of the intermediates and the time required to reach maximal concentration derived from the results shown in Fig. 1 are listed in Table 1. Initial rates of I-1, I-2, and I-3 formation are similar. However, the time required for I-1 to reach its higher maximal concentration is much longer than those for I-2 and I-3. I-4 and I-5 reached maximal concentration by two min after which their rates of formation decreased. As a result, their initial rate constants could not be determined. In separate folding experiments, decreasing rhSCF concentration (i.e. 0.43 mg/ml) has dramatically reduced the initial folding rate and increased the times for intermediates to reach their maximal concentrations (Table 1). For, example, the initial folding rate has decreased 5 to 10-fold for I-1, I-2, and I-3. In the folding at lower rhSCF concentrations (0.2-0.5 mg/ml), the disulfide linked dimer, I-4, and I-5, have diminished.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Different rhSCF intermediates were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE. As listed in Table 2, R migrates as an extended, larger molecule than the native (18 and 15 kDa, respectively). IAA-trapped I-1 and I-3 also have expanded molecular sizes between N and R. Both I-4 and I-5 migrated as a dimer having a molecular mass of 38 kDa. Upon reduction, their molecular masses reduced to 18 kDa.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For structural characterization, the above-mentioned IAA-modified R and intermediates were isolated by RP-HPLC as described (Fig. 1A) and subjected to peptide mapping after endoproteinase Glu-C digestion. Fig. 2 compares peptide maps derived from the digestion of IAA-trapped I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-5, as well as Cys(Cm)-rhSCF. The obtained peptides were characterized by sequence analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. R after IAA modification had a profile identical to that of Cys(Cm)-rhSCF (chromatogram 1). I-1 contains a single Cys4-Cys89 disulfide bond with Cys43 and Cys138 remaining unpaired, and I-2 has a Cys43-Cys138 disulfide bond with unpaired Cys4 and Cys89 as well (chromatograms 3 and 4, respectively). I-3 forms a non-native Cys43-Cys89 disulfide bond and leaves Cys4 and Cys138 unpaired (chromatogram 2). Both I-4 and I-5 also form an incorrect disulfide bond, i.e. Cys43-Cys43 and Cys89-Cys89, respectively, to become disulfide-linked dimers (chromatograms 6 and 7). I-4 and I-5 have three free cysteines as seen in their respective peptide maps. The disulfide structures of form N was confirmed to be identical to rhSCF standard by direct comparison of peptide maps obtained from Asp-N endoproteinase digestion (data not shown, also see (16.Langley K.E. Wypych J. Mendiaz E.A. Clogston C.L. Parker V.P. Farrar D.H. Brothers M.O. Satygal V.N. Leslie I. Birkett N.C. Smith K.A. Baltera Jr., R.J. Lyons D.E. Hogan J.M. Crandall C. Boone T.C. Pope J.A. Karkare S.B. Zsebo K.M. Sachdev R.K. Lu H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). Following HPLC isolation of TFA-trapped intermediates, folding of individual intermediates was subsequently investigated. Fig. 3, A and B, shows the folding of I-1 and I-2 by HPLC analysis. Folding of I-1 appears to generate only N. In contrast, I-2 folds into I-1 and I-3, which then convert to N. A small amount of R and an uncharacterized form X near I-1 were detected as well. Both rhSCF C43,138A analog and alkylated I-2 were isolated, denatured, reduced, and refolded. Fig. 4A and Table 1 shows that the initial rates for formation of the Cys4-Cys89 disulfide for reduced rhSCF C43,138A analog and wild type rhSCF are similar. Their overall folding rates over 20 h are also similar. This observation appears to indicate that I-1 may directly fold into N in reduced rhSCF. Fig. 4B compares the folding kinetics between alkylated I-2 and reduced rhSCF after denaturation and reduction. The initial oxidation rate for Cys43-Cys138 from the reduced form of IAA-trapped I-2 was also similar to that of the formation of the same disulfide in the wild type protein. However, the overall folding rate for formation of I-2 in the wild type rhSCF is significantly slower. Fig. 5A shows the far UV CD spectra of various folding intermediates. Both N and rhSCF standard in 2.5 M urea have approximately identical spectra. Both samples contain about 45%α-helix, consistent with results observed in the absence of urea(17.Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.M. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L. Zsebo K.M. Mendiaz E.A. Wypych J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18942-18948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced rhSCF has a spectrum reflecting primarily a random-coiled structure that contains only 3-5%α-helix. Secondary structures of I-1 and I-2 are similar, and both contain approximately 18%α-helix. I-3 appears to have very little structure, containing only trace amounts of α-helix (<5%). Fig. 5B shows the near UV CD spectra. N also has a spectrum identical in shape to that of standard rhSCF, with a slight decrease in magnitude. The spectrum of R indicates that the reduced protein is structurally disordered. I-1 and I-2 have identical spectra that are also similar in shape to that of N, but with signals reduced at levels between N and R. Both of the single disulfide intermediates appear to partially display a native-like tertiary structure. The changes in ellipticity at 222 nm versus temperature for various rhSCF forms are depicted in Fig. 5C. Increase of temperature causes loss of α-helical structure as a result of thermal denaturation. Table 2 lists the transition midpoint of thermal denaturation of various rhSCF intermediates and analog. SCF standard and fully refolded rhSCF(N) are very stable molecules, with identical transition temperature of 60°C. I-1 and C43,138A analog with a temperature of 48°C are of intermediate stability. I-2 with a temperature of 36°C is the least stable, consistent with increased flexibility as indicated by its fluorescence spectrum (described below). The fluorescence spectra of rhSCF species are shown in Fig. 5D. The spectra for both refolded rhSCF and rhSCF standard consist of a single peak at 322 nm, consistent with the single Trp (at position 44) being in a hydrophobic environment. The FWHM is about 50 nm. As is usually the case for Trp-containing proteins, there is no Tyr signal, indicating energy transfer is occurring between Tyr and Trp. R has a single peak at 350 nm with a wider FWHM of 56 nm, typical of a Trp spectrum in solution; and its Tyr fluorescence is not apparent. I-1 has a spectrum slightly red shifted to 329 nm, indicating that the Trp is more exposed to the solvent than N. However, Trp in I-1 appears to be in a native-like environment. I-2 has a fluorescence maximum at 333 nm with a FWHM of 57 nm, indicating that the Trp in this molecule is slightly more exposed to solvent than I-1. Like R, the spectrum of I-3 has a maximum at 350 nm, apparently due to Trp being fully exposed. I-3 also contains a clear shoulder representing the presence of substantial Tyr fluorescence, indicating that the Tyr is no longer transferring energy to the Trp. This suggests that the distance between the Tyr and Trp has increased. C43,138A analog lacking the Cys43-Cys138 disulfide bond, exhibits both CD and fluorescence spectra identical to those for the rhSCF standard. Its thermostability, however, is similar to I-1 (see above). Hydrodynamic properties of several intermediates and analog were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography in conjunction with light-scattering detection. As expected, the determined molecular weights for rhSCF standard, N and intermediates are all around 33,000-35,000, indicative of being a dimer in solution (Table 2). Fig. 6A illustrates a typical chromatographic separation profile for I-2 detected by UV absorption, refractive index, and light scattering. Fig. 6B shows the calibration plot for the molecular weight determination of various species. N was determined to have a molecular weight close to that of the rhSCF standard. IAA-trapped I-1, I-3, and I-2 are also dimeric molecules. With the exception of standard rhSCF and N, every isolated intermediate and R contain small amounts of high molecular weight aggregates (only detectable by light scattering; see Fig. 6A for I-2), indicating that intermediates and R are less stable in solution (in an order of N ≪ I-1 < I-2, I-3 < R). Table 3 summarizes the data obtained from the cell proliferation and radioreceptor binding assays. N, as expected, elicits full mitogenic activity on UT-7 assay but is about half active in radioreceptor assay. The lower activity in radioreceptor assay may be due to loss of activity during sample handling in HPLC step as rhSCF standard proceeded through an HPLC step also yielded a reduced affinity to the receptor. In contrast to N, iodoacetate-modified R, I-2, and I-3 show no or very low rhSCF biological activity and receptor binding affinity. Iodoacetate-modified I-1 and the C43,138A analog (see (19.Langley K.E. Mendiaz E.A. Liu N. Narhi L.O. Zeni L. Perseghian C. Clogston C.L. Leslie I. Pope J.A. Lu H.S. Zsebo K.M. Boone T.C. Arch.

There are five partially oxidized intermediates together with reduced rhSCF. At the completion, the folding mixture contained a major folded and oxidized form N along with small fractions of I-1 and P. I-1, I-2, and I-3 appear to reach steady state equilibrium during folding (Fig. 1), implying that they are important intermediates in the rhSCF folding pathway. From refolding studies of the isolated intermediates and analog (Figure 3, Figure 4), it appears that I-1 is an essential intermediate directly folding into N, while the majority of I-2 needs to reconvert to I-1 via I-3 by S-S rearrangement. By estimation of equilibrium concentrations detected by HPLC (Table 1), I-1 is the most stable intermediate while I-2 and I-3 are less stable. Several observations indicated that the conformation of I-1 is mostly native-like. For example, I-1 is the only intermediate still retaining residual biological activity (5%) (Table 3). Upon SV-8 proteolytic digestion, an appreciable amount of I-1 remains as large, undigested fragments, whereas other intermediates can be easily digested (Fig. 2). By fluorescence spectroscopic analysis, Trp44 in I-1 or I-2 appears to be in a hydrophobic environment similar to that found for rhSCF standard(17.Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.M. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L. Zsebo K.M. Mendiaz E.A. Wypych J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18942-18948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By partial reduction of native rhSCF, I-2 is the major species accumulated; and therefore stability of Cys43-Cys138 bond is higher than Cys4-Cys89 bond (see (26.Lu H.S. Jones M.D. Shieh J.-H. Mendiaz E. Feng D. Watler P. Narhi L.O. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11309-11316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for details). Taken together with the single Trp being in a hydrophobic core structure, it is highly possible that Cys43-Cys138 is stabilized by being in this environment. This hydrophobic environment should also stabilize I-1 by sequestering the free Cys43 and Cys138 away from the aqueous surrounding needed for the formation of Cys43-Cys138 bond. As a result, I-1 appears to be stable and remains as the major intermediate form. Our data indicated that the disulfide-mispaired I-3 may serve as an intermediate for the conversion between I-1 and I-2. This is supported by refolding of isolated I-2 which converts to I-1 through I-3 by disulfide rearrangement (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4). Formation of Cys4-Cys89 disulfide bond does not necessarily require the rearrangement since rhSCF C43,138A analog, a homolog of I-1, forms Cys4-Cys89 bond at the same rate as that in the wild type molecule. However, during folding of the reduced rhSCF, disulfide rearrangement between I-1 and I-2 via I-3 actually decreased the folding rate for I-2 (Fig. 4B). The folding of isolated I-2 produced I-1 and I-3 before N, indicating that the formation of N from I-2 is preferentially directed to I-1 via disulfide rearrangement (Fig. 3B). Since a small fraction of N was detected in addition to I-1 and I-3 at the early folding stage of isolated I-2, direct folding of I-2 into N may also occur at a slow rate. The generation of intermolecular disulfide bonds found in I-4 and I-5 is interesting. They are relatively unstable as they only transiently exist at an early stage of folding. In the refolding of I-4 and I-5, it appears that both intermediates refold back into R which then fold into N via I-1, I-2, and I-3. Since dimerization of either I-4 or I-5 uses the same cysteine residue (Cys43 or Cys89, respectively), their structures may be different from any of the isolated intermediates as well as product P found at the end of folding (see subsequent paper, ref. 26). These observations suggest that I-4 and I-5 may not be as important as other intermediates in rhSCF folding. In summary, properties of all characterized intermediates appear to indicate that I-1, I-2, and I-3 are on-pathway folding intermediates important in the folding of rhSCF, while I-4 and I-5 may be off-pathway intermediates. In comparison with native rhSCF, each trapped intermediate and R appears to be unstable in solution as they form a large amount of high molecular weight aggregates detectable in gel permeation chromatography using light-scattering detection. This observation implies that rhSCF disulfide bonds and/or the fully folded conformation play a role in the stability of rhSCF molecule. Characterization of partially oxidized intermediates seems to indicate that each of the two rhSCF disulfide bonds may contribute equally in maintaining proper tertiary structural folding of rhSCF. All rhSCF folding species exist as noncovalently linked dimers (Table 3). We observe that the completely reduced rhSCF (R) is also dimeric. However, the completely denatured and reduced R requires 1-2 h to become dimeric in oxygen-free folding conditions, and R prepared from partial reduction experiments in the absence of 6 M GdnHCl is present in dimeric form as well. 2M. D. Jones, L. O. Narhi, W.-C. Chang, and H. S. Lu, unpublished data. Refolding rate of this reduced rhSCF preparation is similar to that for the reduced rhSCF prepared in 6 M GdnHCl. Therefore, the formation of dimer may occur at an earlier folding time preceding oxidation of disulfide bonds and may not affect the overall folding. To elicit its full biological function, rhSCF has to be fully oxidized and folded. None of the isolated intermediates and analog show significant biological activity, indicating that they do not have native rhSCF conformations. Cys4-Cys89 and Cys43-Cys138 are essential to maintain a proper structural folding of rhSCF for binding to its receptor, c-kit, and exerting full biological functions. Although the completely folded and purified C43,138A analog has a gross conformation indistinguishable from the wild type rhSCF and displays significant receptor binding activity, this molecule is biologically less active (Table 3). In summary, a putative in vitro folding pathway was postulated. I-1 is identified as an important and productive intermediate for formation of fully oxidized and folded rhSCF. I-2 seems to favor rearrangment through I-3 to I-1 and N. I-2 may also directly fold into N at a much slower rate. Our preliminary data indicated that the folding of rhSCF can be affected by protein disulfide isomerase.2 It would be interesting to further study the effect of the isomerase or chaperone proteins (2.Creighton T.E.

I-4 and I-5, which are disulfide-linked dimers, are in equilibrium with other intermediates including R. These off-pathway intermediates are kinetically identifiable and play less important roles in the in vitro folding of rhSCF. The observation that R, I-1, I-2, and I-3 exist as dimeric molecules appears to indicate that dimer formation together with a small extent of secondary and tertiary structural folding occur at a very earlier folding stage.

The existing evidence from various studies using truncation, substitution, synthetic hormone peptides, and hCG crystals suggests that the C-terminal region of the α subunit contacts the luteinizing hormone/choriogonoadotropin (LH/CG) receptor and is involved in receptor activation. Despite a deluge of the speculation and the important role of the αC-terminal region, direct evidence for its interaction with the receptor has been elusive. Because of the significant biological activity, it is imperative to prove the interaction of the αC-terminal region. For this purpose, decamer peptides corresponding to the α subunit sequence from His83 to Ser92 (α83-92) were derivatized with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 4-azidobenzoylglycine (ABG) and radioiodinated.

It is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family which includes LH, FSH, TSH and equine choriogonadotropin. These hormones consist of a common α subunit and a distinct β subunit which are noncovalently associated(1.Morgan F. Birken S. Canfield R. J. Biol.

The truncation or substitution of hCGα C-terminal amino acid residues reduces the receptor-binding affinity and abolishes cAMP induction(3.Chang K.-W. Glazer A.N. Pierce J.G. J. Biol.

This is consistent with the observation that a dodecamer peptide corresponding to the hCGα C-terminal region, α81-92, inhibited 125I-hCG binding to the receptor (7.Charlesworth M. McCormick D. Madden B. Ryan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 270: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and that a decamer peptide, α83-92, was capable of binding to cells possessing the LH/CG receptor and inducing cAMP synthesis(6.Yoo J. Zeng H. Ji I. Murdoch W.J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13034-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the crystal structure of HF treated hCG suggests the αC-terminal region as part of the potential receptor binding site(8.Lapthorn J.P. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E.

Structure. 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Recently, a study using a set of reciprocal mutants of hCG and the LH/CG receptor, hCGLys91→Aspand LH/CGRAsp397→Lys,indicated that the two amino acids were complementary in receptor activation (10). These results predict that the C-terminal region of hCGγ interacts with the receptor and is crucial for receptor-activation to induce cAMP synthesis. Despite the continuing increase in speculation, direct proof has been elusive for the crucial interaction of the C-terminal region of hCGγ with the receptor. For this reason, it is necessary to demonstrate the direct interaction of the C-terminal region of hCGγ with the receptor. In this communication, we present the first unequivocal evidence for this interaction. Furthermore, evidence is presented that γLys91 of hCG is near to a carboxyl group of the receptor and that this ion pair is susceptible to cross-linking with EDC to form an amide bond. hCG CR127 was supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Peptides were synthesized by Multiple Peptide System (San Diego, CA) and purified as described previously(7.Charlesworth M. McCormick D. Madden B. Ryan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 270: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 4-azidobenzoylglycine (NHS-ABG) was synthesized, α83-92 was derivatized with NHS-ABG, and it was radioiodinated as described previously(11.Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The resulting ABG-125I-α83-92 was fractionated on a Sephadex G-10 column. It is important to carefully monoiodinate the peptide and preserve its biological activity during the harsh iodination reaction steps. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with the LH/CG receptor construct as described previously(10.Ji I. Zeng H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22971-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transiently expressing the LH/CG receptor (293+) were incubated with 125I-α83-92, ABG-125I-α83-92 or 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 in the presence of increasing concentrations of α83-92. After washing cells three times until nonspecific binding was insignificant, the radioactivity of bound 125I-α83-92, ABG-125I-α83-92 or 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92, was determined. Heat denatured fetal calf serum and bovine serum albumin, 15 and 3%, respectively, were used to reduce nonspecific binding. For cAMP assay, 293+ cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of α83-92, ABG-α83-92 or NAc/CONH2-α83-92 and intracellular cAMP was determined as described previously(10.Ji I. Zeng H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22971-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For photoaffinity labeling, 293+ cells were incubated with ABG-125I-α83-92 and washed three times. The cells were irradiated with an ACME-LITE model 228A xenon flash lamp (12.Kiehm D. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8524-8531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UV light from the flashes are capable of activating UV sensitive groups such as the arylazide of ABG. Each flash lasts ~0.2 ms and minimizes random collisional crosslinks and heating of cells(12.Kiehm D. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8524-8531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The irradiated cells were solubilized in 3% sodium dodecylsulfate and 100 mM dithiothreitol. The samples were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels which were dried on filter paper and exposed to x-ray film. Transiently transfected 293+ cells were incubated with 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92, and washed to remove nonspecifically bound and unbound peptide as described above. The cells were incubated with 1 mM EDC at room temperature for 20 min for cross-linking, washed, and solubilized for gel electrophoresis. To examine the reaction specificity of EDC, the cells were pretreated with the N-hydroxysuccinimde ester of caproic acid (13.Ji I. Bock J. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12815-12821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min or 100 mM of sodium acetate and treated with EDC. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. LH/CG receptors on 293+ cells were photoaffinity labeled with ABG-125I-α83-92 as described above. They were washed three times on ice with ice cold 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were scraped in ice cold 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), containing protease inhibitors 30 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptin, and 1 mM EDTA. After pelleting cells by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 10 min, pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of the buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 30% glycerol and the protease inhibitors, incubated on ice for 45 min, and diluted with 1.5 ml of the buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 30% glycerol and the protease inhibitors. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was incubated with normal rabbit sera overnight at 4°C. The incubation mixture was further incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibody-Sepharose for 2 h and centrifuged 300 × g for 3 min. This precleared supernatant was incubated with rabbit anti-LH/CG receptor antiserum and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-rabbit antibody-Sepharose. The Sepharose was washed several times and boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate under the reducing condition for 5 min and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min. The solubilized supernatant was electrophoresed and the gel was processed for autoradiography. In a control sample, the precleared pellet of goat antirabbit antibody-Sepharose was boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate for 5 min and centrifuged 300 × g for 3 min. The solubilized supernatant was electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 1, 125I-α83-92, ABG-125I-α83-92 and 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 bound to the LH/CG receptor on 293+ cells with Kd values of 126 μM (p < 0.05), 264 μM (p < 0.05) and 253 μM (p < 0.05), respectively. They were capable of inducing cAMP synthesis with EC50 values of 86 μM (p < 0.05), 135 μM (p < 0.05) and 100 μM, respectively. These results demonstrate the bioactivity of the peptide and its derivatives. To determine the identity of their binding molecule, increasing numbers of 293+ cells were incubated with 125I-ABG-α83-92, irradiated with xenon flashes, and electrophoresed. The autoradiogram in Fig. 2 shows free 125I-ABG-α83-92 which was originally bound to 293+ cells but dissociated from them during solubilization in sodium dodecylsulfate. In addition to the free 125I-ABG-α83-92 band, a ~86-kDa band was labeled by 125I-ABG-α83-92. The intensity of bound 125I-ABG-α83-92 and the labeled ~86-kDa band increased in parallel with increasing numbers of 293+ cells. In contrast, the band was absent in the sample lacking 293+ cells. In addition to this 293+ cell dependence, the formation of the ~86-kDa band requires photolysis as it is dependent on the number of xenon flashes and 125I-ABG-α83-92 bound to 293+ cells failed to produce the ~86-kDa band when the sample was not photolyzed. These results suggest that the radioactive ~86-kDa band was generated by the photoactivation of 125I-ABG-α83-92 and photoaffinity labeling of a ~86-kDa molecule. The band was not produced by nonspecific association of 125I-ABG-α83-92 with a ~86-kDa molecule. Furthermore, the data indicate that 125I-ABG-α83-92 exclusively labeled a ~86-kDa molecule on 293 cells expressing the LH/CG receptor. As expected, the size of the ~86-kDa band material corresponds to the mature 85-86-kDa LH/CG receptor(13.Ji I. Bock J. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12815-12821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Zhu H. Wang H. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 141-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Photoaffinity labeling. Increasing concentrations of 293+ cells were incubated with 125I-ABG-α83-92 and irradiated with xenon flashes. Cells were solubilized and electrophoresed. The gel was exposed to x-ray film. The lower band represents 125I-ABG-α83-92 which was originally bound to 293+ cells but dissociated during solubilization in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The ~86-kDa band represents the photoaffinity labeled band material.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 demonstrates the specificity of the photoaffinity labeling. 125I-ABG-α83-92 did not bind to mock transfected (293-) cells lacking the LH/CG receptor and did not form the ~86-kDa band even after UV photolysis. This result indicates the requirement of the LH/CG receptor for 125I-ABG-α83-92 binding and labeling the ~86-kDa band. Unlabeled hCG or α83-92, but not FSH or TSH, blocked 125I-ABG-α83-92 binding to 293+ cells, another indication of the specificity of 125I-ABG-α83-92 binding to the LH/CG receptor. Furthermore, α26-46 or β38-57 failed to block 125I-ABG-α83-92 binding to 293+ cells. Since α26-46(7.Charlesworth M. McCormick D. Madden B. Ryan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 270: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and β38-57(15.Keutmann H.T. Mason K.A. Kitzmann K. Ryan R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) inhibit 125I-hCG binding to the LH/CG receptor, this result suggests that there is an exclusive and specific binding site for 125I-ABG-α83-92 in the LH/CG receptor. Taken together these results clearly indicate 125I-ABG-α83-92 binding to the LH/CG receptor. Therefore, they suggest that the ~86-kDa band represents photoaffinity labeled LH/CG receptors. To obtain more direct evidence for this conclusion, the photoaffinity labeled band material was immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-LH/CG receptor antiserum (Fig. 4). When 293+ cells were incubated with 125I-ABG-α83-92, photolyzed, solubilized in Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitated with anti-LH/CG receptor antiserum, the ~86-kDa-band was precipitated (Fig. 4). However, it was not precipitated when normal rabbit sera was used, when 293+ cells were processed in the absence of 125I-ABG-α83-92, or when 293- cells were used instead of 293+ cells. These results, along with the photoaffinity labeling data in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, positively identify the photoaffinity-labeled ~86-kDa band as the LH/CG receptor. 125I-ABG-α83-92 has two amino groups which could have been derivatized with ABG. They are the amino group of Lys91 and the N-terminal amine. Our data cannot specify whether or not the amino group of Lys91 was involved in the photoaffinity labeling of the receptor. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the chemical group(s) of the receptor which was labeled as the phenyl nitrene reacts nonspecifically with a variety of functionalities (16.Ji T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since this information is necessary to define the cross-linked point of the peptide and the receptor, we have synthesized 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 of which the N-terminal amine of α83-92 was acetylated and the C-terminal carboxylate was amidated. This modified peptide was used for affinity labeling the receptor. Transiently transfected 293+ cells were incubated with 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 and washed to remove unbound peptide. The cells complexed with 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 were treated with EDC and solubilized for gel electrophoresis. The sample treated with EDC showed the ~86-kDa band of the receptor which was labeled with 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 (Fig. 5). FSH or TSH did not prevent binding and cross-linking of 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92. On the other hand, hCG or unlabeled α83-92 blocked binding of 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 to the cells. Also 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 did not bind to 293- (data not shown). These results indicate the specificity of 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 binding to the LH/CG receptor. Carbodiimides including EDC react with carboxyl groups to produce O-acylisoureas which in turn react with amino groups to produce amide bonds(16.Ji T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, the primary reactive group of 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 with EDC is the amino group of Lys91. To verify this reaction specificity the cells complexed with 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 were treated with the N-hydroxysuccinimde ester of caproic acid which monofunctionally reacts with amino group(13.Ji I. Bock J. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12815-12821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, it prevented cross-linking of 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 to the receptor as did acetate. These data indicate that the cross-linking reaction of EDC involves both amino and carboxyl groups, consistent with the reaction specificity of carbodiimides(16.Ji T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Carbodiimides may also react with phenolic groups of Tyr and sulfhydryls of Cys. These reactions are, however, monofunctional and therefore, do not produce cross-linked products(17.Means G. Feeney R. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, San Francisco1971: 144-148Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the amino group of 125I-NAc/CONH2-α83-92 is cross-linked to a carboxyl group to form an amide. They suggest that the amino group and side chain of hCG αLys91 is in the proximity of a carboxyl group of the receptor in the hormone receptor complex. EDC induced a zero length cross-link between these two counter ions suggests the existence of a salt bridge between them. This conclusion is consistent with the complementarity of hCG αLys91 and LH/CG receptor's Asp397(10.Ji I. Zeng H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22971-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding and labeling site of 125I-ABG-α83-92 appears to be specific since it was blocked by α83-92, but not by two other peptides, α26-46 and β38-57 which are known to inhibit 125I-hCG binding to the receptor. This is consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of HF treated hCG(8.Lapthorn J.P. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W.

Structure. 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In the crystal, the αC terminus shows a structure up to αTyr89. The last three residues of the αC terminus, His90-Lys91-Ser92 does not show a structure, despite their presence in an open ~5 nm solvent channel. This result suggests that αHis90-Lys91-Ser92 are flexible. It is interesting to speculate the αC-terminal positions up to αTyr89, in relationship with α26-46 and β38-57. α26-46 is part of a loop in the hCG crystal and αMet47, the residue closest to αTyr89 and the αC-terminal peptide backbone, is 16.5 Å away from αTyr89. Therefore, it is not expected for α26-46 to compete with 125I-ABG-α83-92 for receptor binding, consistent with the data in Fig. 3. On the other hand, β38-57 is closer to αTyr89, βGln54 being 8.6 Å away from αTyr89. Therefore, it may be possible for β38-57 to weakly interfere with, although may not completely block, binding of 125I-ABG-α83-92 to the receptor. In fact, the intensity of the photoaffinity labeled ~86-kDa-band is somewhat reduced in the presence of β38-57 in Fig. 3. In this study we demonstrate that the α83-92 specifically interacts with the LH/CG receptor. In this complex of α83-92 and the receptor, the amino group of hCG αLys91 is near to a carboxyl group of the receptor to form an ion pair. This interaction between the peptide and the receptor is sufficient to activate the receptor to induce cAMP synthesis as does the hormone itself."

In human platelet lysates prepared by freeze-thawing or by the addition of nonionic detergent, the Vn antigen content was drastically reduced in comparison with lysates prepared in the presence of SDS, suggesting that Vn is hydrolyzed by platelet-associated enzymes. Exogenously added purified human Vn and Vn present in plasma were also cleaved by these enzyme systems. Degradation was mediated by a nonsecreted or membrane-associated protease system that was inhibited by E-64, EDTA, and leupeptin but not inhibitors of serine and aspartic proteases, suggesting an involvement of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Consistently, calpastatin inhibited the hydrolysis of Vn, suggesting that Vn is a substrate for calpain. This was confirmed in a purified system. Vn was cleaved by calpains I and II in a dose- and time-dependent manner, resulting in defined Vn fragments with similar electrophoretic mobility in comparison with those detected in platelet lysates. Functional characterization of the calpain-hydrolyzed Vn revealed that while the type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor binding activity was unchanged, the heparin and cell binding functions were destroyed. These results suggest that calpains released upon platelet membrane damage or upon tissue injury and necrosis differentially regulate functional domains of the Vn molecule."

For example, dissociation rate analyses demonstrated that the off-rate of the hapten from the metatype is decreased in the metatype•anti-Met complex(18.Weidner K.M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D2O/fluorescein fluorescence enhancement studies showed that delay in ligand dissociation involves a decrease in rate of conformational fluctuations in the metatype antibody variable domains when part of the metatype•anti-Met complex(19.Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10281-10288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solid- and solution-phase studies of anti-Met antibody binding to the single chain derivative scFv 4-4-20(20.Denzin L.K. Whitlow M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 5879-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar), yielded similar results. This indicated that metatopes (or anti-Met-binding site) on the metatype that affected hapten dissociation are specific to the variable domains(18.Weidner K.M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, it is clear that anti-Met antibodies bound to a metatype variable domain have a significant damping effect on metatype dynamics, which prolongs the residence time of the hapten in the metatype active site. An assessment of the contributions of various metatype structural components to the metatype/anti-Met interaction remains to be addressed: 1) the role of constant domains of the metatype antibody and 2) the role of intervariable domain interactions. mAb 4-4-20•anti-Met complexes were previously noted to have an identical fluorescence intensity quenching maximum (Qmax) and steady-state polarization (18.Weidner K.M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the native liganded mAb 4-4-20. In contrast, scFv 4-4-20•anti-Met complexes showed decreased fluorescein fluorescence Qmax and polarization values (24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with regard to the parent immunoglobulin. This indicated that anti-Met antibodies caused an additional disturbance at the active-site level of the anti-hapten antibody in the scFv 4-4-20•anti-Met complex that did not occur in the mAb 4-4-20•anti-Met complex. A process that would have resulted in the decrease of fluorescein Qmax and polarization in liganded scFv 4-4-20 was interdomain dissociation. Another process was the dissociation of fluorescein from the metatype active site. In total, these observations inferred that constant domains influenced the steady-state metatype•anti-Met complex equilibrium by stabilizing the metatype against the effects of binding an external reagent such as the anti-Met antibodies. To investigate this further, hydrostatic pressure measurements, in conjunction with fluorescence spectroscopy, were performed with the recombinant Fv derivative (Fv 4-4-20) (25.Mallender W.D. Carrero J. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 5338-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of the high affinity mAb 4-4-20 complexed to anti-Met antibodies (Fv 4-4-20•anti-Met complex) to study the effect of the absence of metatype constant domain and intervariable domain interactions on the stabilizing influence of anti-Met antibodies. Fv 4-4-20 was an ideal system for this study. Fv fragments are composed of heavy (VH) and light chain (VL) variable domains bound by noncovalent interactions, thus allowing investigation of variable domain interactions in the absence of the constant domains of mAb or the polypeptide linker of scFv. The recombinant Fv 4-4-20 derivative was recently constructed, expressed, and characterized using solid- and solution-phase assays and was found to be identical to scFv 4-4-20 in all respects(25.Mallender W.D. Carrero J. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 5338-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this investigation, similar to scFv 4-4-20(24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fv 4-4-20•anti-Met complexes showed decreased fluorescein fluorescence Qmax and steady-state polarization compared with mAb 4-4-20. These spectral properties were shown to be correlated with dissociation of the variable domains of the metatype in response to interaction with the anti-Met antibody. Although anti-Met antibodies caused a decrease in Fv 4-4-20 variable domain association, hydrostatic pressure measurements demonstrated that when the hapten was locked into the Fv 4-4-20•anti-Met complex, it was stabilized against dissociation relative to the native liganded Fv 4-4-20. Dissociation of the variable domains observed with Fv 4-4-20 when bound by anti-Met antibodies did not occur with immunoglobulins or Fab fragments because the constant domains play a significant role in stabilizing intervariable domain interactions. In vivo, dissociation of Fv domains by autologous anti-Met antibodies may explain the enhanced degradation of Fv compared with other immunoglobulin proteins stabilized by covalent bonds(26.Cumber A.J.

Hamster monoclonal anti-Met antibody 4A6 was obtained and purified from tissue culture medium (30.Kim M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol.

Recognit. 1995; 8: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as described previously. Xenogenic polyclonal anti-Met antibodies were produced in rabbit by multiple immunization with affinity-labeled mAb 4-4-20 emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. The γ-globulin fraction was isolated as described by Weidner and Voss (18.Weidner K.M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All fluorescence data were collected on an ISS GREG PC photon-counting spectrofluorometer, and all polarization experiments were performed at 25°C using excitation at 480 nm and emission at 525 nm with slit widths of 4 and 8 nm, respectively. Polarization-based measurements were then analyzed in terms of degree dimer dissociation (α) as calculated by, α=(1+Q(r−rF)(rB−/))−1(Eq. 1) where Q is the ratio of the fluorescence quantum yields of free and bound forms of fluorescein, r is the anisotropy at each pressure, and rF and rB are anisotropies for free and bound states of fluorescein, respectively, and are calculated from polarization as r = 2P/(3 - P), where P is the polarization. Hydrostatic pressure in the range of 1 bar to 2.4 kilobars was achieved using the pressure cell described by Paladini and Weber(33.Paladini A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The sample was excited at 480 nm with a slit width of 8 nm. Emission spectra were recorded in the wavelength region spanning 500 to 600 nm with a slit width of 8 nm. Temperature was regulated with a circulating water bath. All stock solutions were prepared in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fluorescein fluorescence intensity from each protein sample was allowed to stabilize (4 min) after each pressure change before emission spectra were taken. Fluorescence intensity at each pressure was acquired by integrating the area under the emission spectrum. For the liganded anti-Met antibody titration measurements (see Fig. 1), fluorescein polarizations were obtained as a function of anti-Met antibody concentration at constant Fv 4-4-20 concentration. Seven samples were prepared with the Fv 4-4-20/Fl ratio kept constant at 0.125 μM Fv 4-4-20 and 0.02 μM Fl and the monoclonal and polyclonal antibody concentrations increased 1:2 starting at 0.015 and 0.062 μM, respectively. For the Fv 4-4-20 affinity-labeled interdomain binding curves (see Fig. 2), fluorescein polarizations were obtained as a function of affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 concentration at constant anti-Met antibody concentration. Affinity-labeled protein was serially diluted (1:2) over the concentration range of 23.5 μM to 4 nM. The domain dissociation was calculated using and was plotted as a function of Fv 4-4-20 protein concentration. Fv 4-4-20 concentrations used in Fig. 2 were corrected for the R value or the amount of affinity-labeled protein of Fv affinity labeling. The concentration of fluorescein was determined on a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer using absorbance at 492 nm and an extinction coefficient (õ492) of 72,000 cm-1M-1. The R value or the amount of affinity-labeled protein was calculated as the ratio of fluorescein to Fv 4-4-20 protein concentration. The concentrations for the polyclonal and monoclonal 4A6 anti-Met antibodies were constant at 200 and 118 μM, respectively. Fluorescein was covalently coupled in the Fv 4-4-20 active site using the isothiocyanate derivative (isomer I) of fluorescein (Sigma). A 1.1 molar excess of fluorescein isothiocyanate was incubated with Fv 4-4-20 for 4-5 h with agitation at 37°C. Protein samples were extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline to remove free fluorescein isothiocyanate. Fig. 1 shows the effect of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Met antibodies on the fluorescein anisotropy of a constant concentration of liganded Fv 4-4-20. The concentration of liganded Fv 4-4-20 with an initial anisotropy value of 0.355 ensured that all the fluorescein was bound. Increasing concentrations of monoclonal anti-Met antibody decreased the anisotropy of fluorescein to a value known to be indicative of free fluorescein. Polyclonal anti-Met antibodies also decreased the anisotropy of fluorescein from its initial value to a value that leveled off significantly above that obtained with equal monoclonal antibody. In Fig. 2, affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 was used to monitor the effect of increasing anti-Met antibody concentrations on the intervariable domains by observing its effect on the Fv dimer dissociation concentration. Both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Met antibodies caused a decrease in fluorescein anisotropy in affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 compared with that in the absence of anti-Met antibodies, indicating that domain-domain dissociation had occurred. As in Fig. 1, the monoclonal antibody had a greater effect on the fluorescein fluorescence anisotropy compared with the polyclonal antibody. The effects of the anti-Met antibody on liganded Fv 4-4-20 variable domains were also monitored using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy in conjunction with hydrostatic pressure. To ensure that the change in intensity of the fluorescein fluorescence was not due to a first-order effect for liganded Fv 4-4-20, high pressure steady-state measurements were performed as a function of liganded Fv 4-4-20 concentration. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of fluorescein fluorescence recovery for two ratios of Fv 4-4-20 to a constant concentration of fluorescein. The protein concentration dependence of hydrostatic pressure-induced fluorescein intensity recovery indicated that the intensity increase was at least a bimolecular event(34.Weber G. van Eldik R. Jonas J. High Pressure Chemistry and Biochemistry. D. Reidel Publishing Co., Norwell, MA1987: 401Crossref Google Scholar). Pressure-induced dissociation of fluorescein from the active site of liganded scFv 4-4-20 had previously been confirmed by Coelho-Sampaio and Voss(14.Coelho-Sampaio T. Voss Jr., E.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10929-10935Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In that study, it was shown that when hydrostatic pressures were applied to liganded scFv 4-4-20, the increase in fluorescein fluorescence intensity below 1.6 kilobars was solely due to fluorescein dissociation. Fig. 4 shows comparative pressure-induced dissociation curves for liganded Fv 4-4-20 and liganded scFv 4-4-20 at the same concentrations of active site and fluorescein. The identity of these two curves indicated that dissociation of fluorescein from the active site of Fv 4-4-20 was not due to the variable domain dissociation that would have been expected to occur in liganded Fv 4-4-20 because it was devoid of linker. On the other hand, pressure-induced dissociation experiments performed on affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 as a function of protein concentration confirmed that the fluorescein fluorescence increase was due to a first-order reaction (data not shown). This was an expected result since the fluorescein covalently binds to the active site and cannot dissociate. Pressure was applied to affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 at an equal protein concentration to compare the role of the linker in pressure-induced fluorescein fluorescence recovery on affinity-labeled derivative antibodies. The intensity recovery for equal concentrations of affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 and affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 active sites demonstrated more intensity recovery for affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 (Fig. 5). The smaller fluorescence recovery for affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 compared with affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 indicated that the first-order reaction may be restricted by the linker. It was therefore concluded that the first-order reaction involved rearrangement of the fluorescein microenvironment, which was more restricted in affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20. Anti-Met antibodies were added to liganded Fv 4-4-20 to observe the effect on fluorescein dissociation as a function of pressure (Fig. 6). Comparison of the fluorescein dissociation of liganded Fv 4-4-20 with and without polyclonal anti-Met antibodies demonstrated that anti-Met antibodies hindered dissociation of fluorescein from the active site, as previously observed with liganded scFv 4-4-20 by Coelho-Sampaio and Voss(24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the effect of pressure on fluorescein fluorescence enhancement of affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 and affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 with polyclonal anti-Met antibodies. Anti-Met antibodies stabilized affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 and affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 against fluorescein fluorescence enhancement in the two samples equally.Figure 7A, comparison of percent fluorescein fluorescence recovery for affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 in the absence (□) and presence (□) of polyclonal anti-Met antibodies.

Immunol. 1988; 25: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) interactions between the two VL and VH domains for association. Hydrostatic pressure had previously been shown to be a means of separating dimer subunits without changing solvent parameters (33.Paladini A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) or causing substantial alterations of protein tertiary conformations at pressures below 5 kilobars(34.Weber G. van Eldik R. Jonas J. High Pressure Chemistry and Biochemistry. D. Reidel Publishing Co., Norwell, MA1987: 401Crossref Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 4 are in agreement with conclusions made by Mallender et al.(25.Mallender W.D. Carrero J. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 5338-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that Fv 4-4-20 antigen binding characteristics are identical to those of scFv 4-4-20. At low concentrations, the linker in scFv 4-4-20 minimizes dissociation of the variable domains compared with Fv 4-4-20. However, at antibody concentrations above the Kd, the interdomain interactions composed of the previously mentioned van der Waals, hydrogen bond, and ionic pair interactions appear sufficient to stabilize the domains against interdomain dissociation as evidenced by the lack of discernible difference between the derivative antibodies under application of hydrostatic pressure. The addition of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Met antibodies to liganded Fv 4-4-20 caused a decrease in fluorescein fluorescence Qmax and polarization similar to that previously observed by Coelho-Sampaio and Voss (24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with liganded scFv 4-4-20. In this study, the decrease in liganded Fv 4-4-20 fluorescence Qmax and polarization when bound by anti-Met antibodies was examined more fully. Coelho-Sampaio and Voss (24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) attributed variation in fluorescence Qmax and polarization to idiotype antibodies in the polyclonal anti-Met reagent. Anti-Met antibodies were elicited against a specific primary liganded antibody by immunization of a host with the affinity-labeled antibodies(18.Weidner K.M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10281-10288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-idiotype antibodies were specific for unliganded antibodies and were generated in a similar manner. Anti-idiotype antibodies present in the anti-Met reagent would bind to the unliganded antibody, shifting the equilibrium between the liganded and unliganded anti-fluorescein antibodies. The decrease in Qmax would result from a greater amount of free fluorescein than that present in the absence of anti-Met antibodies. This explanation for the change in fluorescein fluorescence parameters upon addition of anti-Met antibodies was not entirely satisfactory because the same anti-Met reagent caused no appreciable effect on the Qmax and λmax shift of liganded mAb 4-4-20. The absence of any variation in fluorescein fluorescence Qmax and polarization upon addition of anti-Met antibodies to liganded mAb 4-4-20 showed that the delay on the off-rate by anti-Met antibodies was not a consequence of new bonds formed between antigen and the active site. Conversely, the effect on the Qmax and polarization of liganded scFv 4-4-20 bound by anti-Met antibodies demonstrated that constant domains played an important role. To examine the mode of the effect of anti-Met on the fluorescein fluorescence of liganded Fv 4-4-20, increasing concentrations of anti-Met antibodies were added to liganded Fv 4-4-20 (Fig. 1). Monoclonal anti-Met antibodies, when present in large excess, decreased the fluorescence polarization of liganded Fv 4-4-20 to a value that correlated with free fluorescein. Polyclonal anti-Met antibodies decreased both Qmax and polarization, but not as efficiently as monoclonal antibodies. The decrease in polarization observed with the monoclonal antibody ensured that the changes in Qmax and polarization were not due to anti-idiotype antibodies. To probe the effect of anti-Met antibodies on the intervariable domain binding affinity, a constant concentration of anti-Met antibodies was added to increasing amounts of affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20, and the fluorescein fluorescence anisotropy was plotted in the form of a binding curve (Fig. 2). In affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20, fluorescein was covalently bound to a lysine in the Fv 4-4-20 active site. A decrease in fluorescein fluorescence Qmax or polarization upon addition of anti-Met was possible only if the domains dissociated. At concentrations of Fv 4-4-20 below the Kd, the interdomain dissociation was relatively the same for affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20, affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 with monoclonal antibody 4A6, and affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 with polyclonal anti-Met antibodies. At concentrations of affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 above the Kd(25.Mallender W.D. Carrero J. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 5338-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar), both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Met antibodies provoked domain dissociation. The affinity-labeled interdomain binding curves (Fig. 2) indicated that polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Met antibodies caused an instability between the two variable domains that resulted in the subsequent decrease in fluorescein polarization, which was in agreement with Fig. 1. In conjunction, the results of Figure 1, Figure 2 demonstrate that the effect of the monoclonal antibody on the interdomain affinity was greater than that of the polyclonal antibodies, and both provoked variable domain dissociation. Hydrostatic pressure was used to examine the effect of anti-Met antibodies on antibody active-site dynamics by using the affinity-labeled antibody. Application of hydrostatic pressure in affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 and affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 demonstrated an increase in fluorescein fluorescence intensity that was the result of a first-order effect. The independence of fluorescein fluorescence recovery as a function of protein concentration allowed a comparison between affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 and affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 at the same protein concentrations. The greater increase in fluorescence intensity observed in affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 compared with affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 demonstrated that the first-order reaction was restricted by the linker. Fluorophore fluorescence intensity is known to be a sensitive measure of the fluorophore microenvironment(7.Watt R.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Immunochemistry. 1977; 14: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38.Kranz D.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Voss Jr., E.W. Fluorescein Hapten: An Immunological Probe. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 121-130Google Scholar). The difference in the results between affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 and affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 implied that the first-order reaction was most likely a molecular rearrangement of the fluorescein active site. Fluorescein is 93% buried in the 4-4-20 active site across the interdomain interface(38.Kranz D.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Voss Jr., E.W. Fluorescein Hapten: An Immunological Probe. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 121-130Google Scholar). The difference in behavior between affinity-labeled scFv 4-4-20 and affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 is probably a reflection of the increased flexibility of the active site in Fv 4-4-20 due to the lack of a linker. Polyclonal anti-Met antibodies, added to each of these affinity-labeled antibodies, were found to stabilize against a pressure-induced fluorescein fluorescence increase. This was interpreted as stabilization of the dynamic fluctuations of the microenvironment of the fluorescein, and therefore the active site, and was in agreement with D2O enhancement studies (19.Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10281-10288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that showed anti-Met to stabilize conformational dynamics. Pressure-induced ligand dissociation was performed on liganded Fv 4-4-20 to examine the efficiency of anti-Met antibody stabilization of fluorescein in an antibody active site devoid of interdomain polypeptide linker or constant domains (Fig. 6). Polyclonal anti-Met antibodies were found to stabilize fluorescein in the active site of liganded Fv 4-4-20 against dissociation with the same efficiency as for liganded scFv 4-4-20. The effect of polyclonal anti-Met antibodies on anti-fluorescein antibody ligand off-rate delay was antibody concentration-dependent, in agreement with results obtained with liganded scFv 4-4-20(24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration dependence was most likely because higher concentrations of anti-Met antibodies ensured that more Fv 4-4-20 variable domain metatopes were bound. In summary, polyclonal anti-Met antibodies had caused both the fluorescein release and stabilization in the Fv 4-4-20 active site. This apparent paradox is resolved in the following model proposed to explain general metatype/anti-Met interaction (Fig. 8). In this model, a concentration-dependent five-stage equilibrium exists between the individual variable domains (VH and VL), fluorescein, and anti-Met antibodies. Individual domains are known not to bind fluorescein(25.Mallender W.D. Carrero J. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 5338-5346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At variable domain concentrations below the Kd, the domains are not associated with each other or with fluorescein (stage 1). At concentrations above the Kd, Fv dimer is formed (stage 2). Upon formation of Fv dimer, fluorescein is quickly bound (stage 3). Liganded Fv in the presence of anti-Met antibodies will form a liganded Fv•anti-Met encounter complex (stage 4), which will either go on to stage 5, the stabilized liganded Fv•anti-Met complex, or back to stage 1, the basic components. The course of the reaction from stage 4 to either stage 5 or 1 depends on the variety and concentration of anti-Met antibodies. Dimer destabilization observed with monoclonal anti-Met antibodies is believed to be similar, but not identical, to a phenomenon with the βa-subunit of tryptophan synthetase observed by Silva et al.(39.Silva J.L. Miles E.W. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5780-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and bovine lactate dehydrogenase by King and Weber(40.King L. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3637-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both groups found that pressure-induced dissociation of the dimer caused the reassociated species to have decreased subunit affinity. Bovine lactate dehydrogenase showed reduced enzymatic activity upon removal of pressure, although subunit reassociation occurred immediately. It was concluded that upon dissociation of the aggregate, the subunits had undergone a change in conformation that resulted in a loss in affinity for each other(34.Weber G. van Eldik R. Jonas J. High Pressure Chemistry and Biochemistry. D. Reidel Publishing Co., Norwell, MA1987: 401Crossref Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Met antibodies were shown previously (31.Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Kim M.L. Mallender W.D. Miklasz S.D. Voss Jr., E.W. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in this study with the pressure experiments to have an effect on the antibody active-site dynamics. The affinity-labeled anti-Met titration curve utilizing the monoclonal anti-Met antibody, which by definition bound to one metatope on the VL domain, showed the monoclonal antibody to have the effect of destabilizing the dimer. Although only bound to one domain, monoclonal anti-Met antibodies were previously shown to be capable of stabilizing scFv 4-4-20 variable domain dynamics(30.Kim M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8695-8700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stabilization of one domain in the dimer by a monoclonal anti-Met antibody would make the two domains dynamically incompatible, causing dissociation to occur readily if no additional stabilizing element such as constant domains or a linker is present. Therefore, for anti-Met antibodies to stabilize ligand in an anti-antigen antibody-antigen complex as observed in this and previous studies(24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Kim M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8695-8700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Kim M.L. Mallender W.D. Miklasz S.D. Voss Jr., E.W. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the binding of an anti-Met antibody to one domain on the metatype has to be balanced by binding to the other domain. Indeed, this was observed when polyclonal anti-Met antibodies were added to affinity-labeled and liganded Fv 4-4-20, where the decrease in Qmax and polarization was much less than for monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1, Figure 2). Once the complex was formed, the metatype•anti-Met complex was more resistant to hapten dissociation, as observed in Figure 6, Figure 7. In addition, this would explain the lack of cooperativity observed by Coelho-Sampaio and Voss (24.Coelho-Sampaio & Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8146-8152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when trying to stabilize liganded scFv 4-4-20 by using different combinations of monoclonal anti-Met antibodies. All the monoclonal anti-Met antibodies used in that investigation were specific for the VL domain(30.Kim M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8695-8700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To observe cooperativity by combining different monoclonal antibodies, an important requisite is that monoclonal antibodies specific for both domains be combined. The combination of monoclonal antibodies specific for both domains may create the balance of the domain dynamics needed for metatype/anti-Met stabilization. The small decrease in Qmax and polarization observed with liganded Fv 4-4-20 when bound by polyclonal antibodies in Fig. 1 was probably due to a population of Fv dimers that were not bound on both domains. Anti-Met antibodies were shown to affect the interdomain interactions. The decrease in fluorescence Qmax and polarization observed with affinity-labeled Fv 4-4-20 upon addition of both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Met antibodies indicated that some incompatibility was initiated between the Fv 4-4-20 domains. When only one domain was bound, as in the case of a monoclonal anti-Met antibody(30.Kim M. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8695-8700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Fv interdomain associative interaction was particularly weakened. Polyclonal anti-Met antibodies caused fluorescein to dissociate from one fraction of the Fv 4-4-20 population while further stabilizing fluorescein in the other fraction. The degree of stabilization of the variable domains was believed to depend on whether both variable domains were bound by anti-Met antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1967567566,"This study shows that aggregation of U937 cell high affinity IgG Fc receptor (FcγRI) results in the transient tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRI γ-chain but not the phosphorylation of γ-chains associated with nonaggregated IgA Fc receptors (FcαR) on the same cells. Thus, normally, tyrosine phosphorylation of γ-chains is limited to FcR in aggregates. In contrast, aggregation of FcγRI in the presence of vanadate induced the sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRI γ-chains and the rapid and extensive phosphorylation of nonaggregated FcαR γ-chains and low affinity IgG Fc receptors (FcγRII). This global phosphorylation of motifs on nonaggregated FcR was also detected upon aggregation of FcαR or FcγRII, which induced the phosphorylation of nonaggregated FcγRI γ-chains. Vanadate prevented dephosphorylation of proteins and increased kinase activity in stimulated cells. Evidence failed to support alternative explanations such as acquisition of phospho-γ through subunit exchange or a coalescence of nonaggregated with aggregated FcR. It is likely, therefore, that activated kinases interacted with nonaggregated FcR in stimulated cells. Pervanadate induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of γ-chains in the absence of FcR cross-linking, indicating that the kinases could be activated by phosphatase inhibition and could react with nonaggregated substrates. We conclude that under normal conditions there is a vanadate-sensitive mechanism that prevents tyrosine phosphorylation of nonaggregated FcR γ-chain motifs in activated cells, restricting their phosphorylation to aggregates."
