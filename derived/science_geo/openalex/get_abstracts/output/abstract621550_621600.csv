https://openalex.org/W2900334515,"Pollution of the marine environment by large and microscopic plastic fragments and their potential impacts on organisms has stimulated considerable research interest and has received widespread publicity. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the fate and effects of microplastic particles that are fibrous in shape, also referred as microfibres, which are mostly shed from synthetic textiles during production or washing. Here we assess composition and abundance of microfibres in seafloor sediments in southern European seas, filling gaps in the limited understanding of the long-range transport and magnitude of this type of microplastic pollution. We report abundances of 10–70 microfibres in 50 ml of sediment, including both natural and regenerated cellulose, and synthetic plastic (polyester, acrylic, polyamide, polyethylene, and polypropylene) fibres. Following a shelf-slope-deep basin continuum approach, based on the relative abundance of fibres it would appear that coastal seas retain around 33% of the sea floor microfibres, but greater quantities of the fibres are exported to the open sea, where they accumulate in sediments. Submarine canyons act as preferential conduits for downslope transport of microfibres, with 29% of the seafloor microfibres compared to 18% found on the open slope. Around 20% of the microfibres found had accumulated in the deep open sea beyond 2000m of water depth. The remoteness of the deep sea does not prevent the accumulation of microfibres, being available to become integrated into deep sea organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2899763971,"Epidemiological studies have established an association between air pollution particulate matter exposure (PM2.5) and neurocognitive decline. Experimental data suggest that microglia play an essential role in air pollution PM-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. This study examined the effect of nano-sized particulate matter (nPM) on complement C5 deposition and microglial activation in the corpus callosum of mice (C57BL/6J males). nPM was collected in an urban Los Angeles region impacted by traffic emissions. Mice were exposed to 10 weeks of re-aerosolized nPM or filtered air for a cumulative 150 hours. nPM-exposed mice exhibited reactive microglia and 2-fold increased local deposition of complement C5/ C5α proteins and complement component C5a receptor 1 (CD88) in the corpus callosum. However, serum C5 levels did not differ between nPM and filtered air cohorts. These findings demonstrate white matter C5 deposition and microglial activation secondary to nPM exposure. The C5 upregulation appears to be localized to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2900173196,"Significance Protocols for testing and reporting emissions of Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents (HPHCs) from electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are lacking. The premise of this study is that multi-path relationships may be developed to describe interactions between product characteristics, use behavior and emissions to develop appropriate protocols for tobacco product regulatory compliance testing. Methods This study proposes a framework consisting of three component terms: HPHC mass concentration, HPHC mass ratio and total particulate mass (TPM) concentration. The framework informs experiments to investigate dependence of aerosol emissions from five electronic cigarettes spanning several design generations and three e-liquids for six repeated trials at each of ten flow conditions. Results Results are reported for TPM concentration as a function of flow conditions spanning the range of natural environment topography observed in prior studies. An empirical correlation describing TPM concentration as a function of flow conditions and coil power setting (6, 7.5 and 10 watts) for the Innokin iTaste MVP 2.0 vaporizer with Innokin iClear 30 dual coil tank is presented. Additional results document the impact of flow conditions and wick and coil design on TPM concentration through comparison of the Innokin iClear 30 (upper coil, capillary action wick) and the Innokin iClear X.I (lower coil, gravity fed wick) operated at 7.5 watts. The impact of e-liquid on TPM concentration is illustrated by comparing emissions from an NJOY Vape Pen filled with AVAIL Arctic Blast, Tobacco Row, and Mardi Gras e-liquids. TPM concentration is shown to depend upon flow conditions across a range of e-cigarette product designs including cig-a-like, pen-style, box-mod and emergent disposable-cartridge style devices. Conclusions A framework provides a foundation for reporting emissions across a variety of e-cigs, e-liquids and research laboratories. The study demonstrates TPM concentration is a function of topography behavior (i.e. puff flow rate and puff duration) for varying device operating power and product characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2900040440,"Decentralization is promoted as a strategy to improve health system performance by bringing decision-making closer to service delivery. Some studies have investigated if decentralization actually improves the health system. However, few have explored the conditions that enable it to be effective. To determine these conditions, we have analyzed the perspectives of decision-makers in the Philippines where devolution, one form of decentralization, was introduced 25 years ago.Drawing from the ""decision space"" approach, we interviewed 27 decision-makers with an average of 23.6 years of working across different levels of the Philippine government health sector and representing various local settings. Qualitative analysis followed the ""Framework Method."" Conditions that either enable or hinder the effectiveness of decentralization were identified by exploring decision-making in five health sector functions.These conditions include: for planning, having a multi-stakeholder approach and monitoring implementation; for financing and budget allocation, capacities to raise revenues at local levels and pooling of funds at central level; for resource management, having a central level capable of augmenting resource needs at local levels and a good working relationship between the local health officer and the elected local official; for program implementation and service delivery, promoting innovation at local levels while maintaining fidelity to national objectives; and for monitoring and data management, a central level capable of ensuring that data collection from local levels is performed in a timely and accurate manner.The Philippine experience suggests that decentralization is a long and complex journey and not an automatic solution for enhancing service delivery. The role of the central decision-maker (e.g. Ministry of Health) remains important to assist local levels unable to perform their functions well. It is policy-relevant to analyze the conditions that make decentralization work and the optimal combination of decentralized and centralized functions that enhance the health system."
https://openalex.org/W2900394787,"The common experimental use of B16-F10 melanoma cells focuses on exploring their metastatic potential following intravenous injection into mice. In this study, B16-F10 cells are used to develop a primary tumor model by implanting them directly into the ears of C57BL/6J mice. The model represents a reproducible and easily traceable tool for local tumor growth and for making additional in vivo observations, due to the localization of the tumors. This model is relatively simple and involves (i) surgical opening of the ear skin, (ii) removal of a square-piece of cartilage followed by (iii) the implantation of tumor cells with fibrin gel. The remodeling of the fibrin gel within the cartilage chamber, accompanying tumor proliferation, results in the formation of blood vessels, lymphatics and tissue matrix that can be readily distinguished from the pre-existing skin structures. Moreover, this method avoids the injection-enforced artificial spread of cells into the pre-existing lymphatic vessels. The tumors have a highly reproducible exponential growth pattern with a tumor doubling time of around 1.8 days, reaching an average volume of 85mm3 16 days after implantation. The melanomas are densely cellular with proliferative indices of between 60 and 80%. The induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis resulted in the development of well-vascularized tumors. Different populations of immunologically active cells were also present in the tumor; the population of macrophages decreases with time while the population of T cells remained quasi constant. The B16-F10 tumors in the ear frequently metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes, reaching an incidence of 75% by day 16. This newly introduced B16-F10 melanoma model in the ear is a powerful tool that provides a new opportunity to study the local tumor growth and metastasis, the associated angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and tumor immune responses. It could potentially be used to test different treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2899537723,"Musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) in the military reduce soldier capability and impose substantial costs. Characterizing biomechanical surrogates of MSI during commonly performed military tasks (e.g., load carriage) is necessary for evaluating the effectiveness of possible interventions to reduce MSI risk. This study determined the effects of body-borne load distribution, load magnitude, and walking speed on tibiofemoral contact forces. Twenty-one Australian Army Reserve soldiers completed a treadmill walking protocol in an unloaded condition and wearing four armor types (standard-issue and three prototypes) with two load configurations (15 and 30 kg) for a total of 8 armor x load ensembles. In each ensemble, participants completed a 5-minute warm-up, and then walked for 10 minutes at both moderate (1.53 m⋅s-1) and fast (1.81 m⋅s-1) speeds. During treadmill walking, three-dimensional kinematics, ground reaction forces, and muscle activity from nine lower-limb muscles were collected in the final minute of each speed. These data were used as inputs into a neuromusculoskeletal model, which estimated medial, lateral and total tibiofemoral contact forces. Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed no differences for any variables between armor types, but peak medial compartment contact forces increased when progressing from moderate to fast walking and with increased load (p<0.001). Acute exposure to load carriage increased estimated tibiofemoral contact forces 10.1 and 19.9% with 15 and 30kg of carried load, respectively, compared to unloaded walking. These results suggest that soldiers carrying loads in excess of 15 kg for prolonged periods could be at greater risk of knee MSI than those with less exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2899638706,"Dendrites function as the primary sites for synaptic input and integration with impairments in dendritic arborization being associated with dysfunctional neuronal circuitry. Post-mitotic neurons require high levels of basal autophagy to clear cytotoxic materials and autophagic dysfunction under native or cellular stress conditions has been linked to neuronal cell death as well as axo-dendritic degeneration. However, relatively little is known regarding the developmental role of basal autophagy in directing aspects of dendritic arborization or the mechanisms by which the autophagic machinery may be transcriptionally regulated to promote dendritic diversification. We demonstrate that autophagy-related (Atg) genes are positively regulated by the homeodomain transcription factor Cut, and that basal autophagy functions as a downstream effector pathway for Cut-mediated dendritic terminal branching in Drosophila multidendritic (md) sensory neurons. Further, loss of function analyses implicate Atg genes in promoting cell type-specific dendritic arborization and terminal branching, while gain of function studies suggest that excessive autophagy leads to dramatic reductions in dendritic complexity. We demonstrate that the Atg1 initiator kinase interacts with the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) pathway by negatively regulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase Highwire and positively regulating the MAPKKK Wallenda. Finally, autophagic induction partially rescues dendritic atrophy defects observed in a model of polyglutamine toxicity. Collectively, these studies implicate transcriptional control of basal autophagy in directing dendritic terminal branching and demonstrate the importance of homeostatic control of autophagic levels for dendritic arbor complexity under native or cellular stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2900180089,"The potent antimalarial drug pyronaridine (PND) was tested for its potential as an anticancer drug. After exposing cancerous (17) and non-cancerous (2) cells to PND for 72 hr, PND was found to exhibit consistent and potent cytotoxic activity at low micromolar (μM) concentrations that ranged from 1.6 μM to 9.4 μM. Moreover, PND exerted a significant selective cytotoxicity index (SCI) on five out of seven breast cancer cell lines tested, with favorable values of 2.5 to 4.4, as compared with the non-cancerous breast MCF-10A cell line. By using the same comparison, PND exhibited a significant SCI on three out of four leukemia/lymphoma cell lines with promising values of 3.3 to 3.5. One breast cancer and one leukemia cell line were tested further in order to determine the likely mode of action of PND. PND was found to consistently elicit phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization, and DNA fragmentation, in both the triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and HL-60 leukemia cell lines. In addition, PND treatment altered cell cycle progression in both cancer cells. Subsequent DNA mobility-shift assays, UV-Visible spectroscopic titrations, and circular dichroism (CD) experiments revealed that PND intercalates with DNA. The findings presented in this study indicates that PND induces apoptosis and interfered with cell cycle progression of cancer cell lines and these results indicate that this drug has the potential as a repurposed drug for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2899556523,"Introduction Despite the use of a multidisciplinary treatment approach, the mortality rate of hemodynamic instability due to severe pelvic fracture remains 40–60%. Several recent studies have shown that preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP) was useful for achieving hemostasis in these patients in the acute phase. However, few studies have examined postoperative complications. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate clinical outcomes and wound infections of PPP in these patients. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 62 patients with hemorrhagic shock due to pelvic fracture between March 2011 and May 2017. Excluding four patients (two with other major hemorrhage sites and two who experienced cardiac arrest in the emergency room), the patients were divided into PPP (n = 30) and non-PPP (n = 28) groups according to PPP application. Clinical outcomes including early-stage mortality, transfusion amount, and surgical site infection (SSI) were compared between the two groups. Results The overall mortality rate was 48.3% and the mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 39 ± 9. The 30 patients in the PPP group had a significantly lower hemorrhage-induced mortality rate than the 28 patients in the non-PPP group (16.7% vs 50%, p = 0.019), although both groups had similar patient characteristics (age, ISS, and initial serum lactate level). Independent factors associated with hemorrhage-induced mortality were PPP and the requirement of packed red blood cells for 4 h. In the PPP group, SSI occurred in 5 of 25 (20%) patients. Conclusions PPP may be considered as a hemostatic modality for hemodynamic instability due to pelvic fracture because it reduces the hemorrhage-induced mortality rate. However, wound infections after the procedure should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2900276438,"Glucosinolates, a group of sulfur-rich thioglucosides found in plants of the order Brassicales, have attracted a lot of interest as chemical defenses of plants and health promoting substances in human diet. They are accumulated separately from their hydrolyzing enzymes, myrosinases, within the intact plant, but undergo myrosinase-catalyzed hydrolysis upon tissue disruption. This results in various biologically active products, e.g. isothiocyanates, simple nitriles, epithionitriles, and organic thiocyanates. While formation of isothiocyanates proceeds by a spontaneous rearrangement of the glucosinolate aglucone, aglucone conversion to the other products involves specifier proteins under physiological conditions. Specifier proteins appear to act with high specificity, but their exact roles and the structural bases of their specificity are presently unknown. Previous research identified the motif EXXXDXXXH as potential iron binding site required for activity, but crystal structures of recombinant specifier proteins lacked the iron cofactor. Here, we provide experimental evidence for the presence of iron (most likely Fe2+) in purified recombinant thiocyanate-forming protein from Thlaspi arvense (TaTFP) using a Ferene S-based photometric assay as well as Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Iron binding and activity depend on E266, D270, and H274 suggesting a direct interaction of Fe2+ with these residues. Furthermore, we demonstrate presence of iron in epithiospecifier protein and nitrile-specifier protein 3 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtESP and AtNSP3). We also present a homology model of AtNSP3. In agreement with this model, iron binding and activity of AtNSP3 depend on E386, D390, and H394. The homology model further suggests that the active site of AtNSP3 imposes fewer restrictions to the glucosinolate aglucone conformation than that of TaTFP and AtESP due to its larger size. This may explain why AtNSP3 does not support epithionitrile or thiocyanate formation, which likely requires exact positioning of the aglucone thiolate relative to the side chain."
https://openalex.org/W2900152641,"There is a wide diversity of bioinformatic tools available for the assembly of next generation sequence and subsequence variant calling to identify genetic markers at scale. Integration of genomics tools such as genomic selection, association studies, pedigree analysis and analysis of genetic diversity, into operational breeding is a goal for New Zealand’s most widely planted exotic tree species, Pinus radiata. In the absence of full reference genomes for large megagenomes such as in conifers, RNA sequencing in a range of genotypes and tissue types, offers a rich source of genetic markers for downstream application. We compared nine different assembler and variant calling software combinations in a single transcriptomic library and found that Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) discovery could vary by as much as an order of magnitude (8,061 SNPs up to 86,815 SNPs). The assembler with the best realignment of the packages trialled, Trinity, in combination with several variant callers was then applied to a much larger multi-genotype, multi-tissue transcriptome and identified 683,135 in silico SNPs across a predicted 449,951 exons when mapped to the Pinus taeda ver 1.01e reference."
https://openalex.org/W2900422057,"Laccases of different biological origins have been widely investigated and these studies have elucidated fundamentals of the generic catalytic mechanism. However, other features such as surface properties and residues located away from the catalytic centres may also have impact on enzyme function. Here we present the crystal structure of laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) to a resolution of 1.62 Å together with a thorough structural comparison with other members of the CAZy family AA1_3 that comprises fungal laccases from ascomycetes. The recombinant protein produced in A. oryzae has a molecular mass of 75 kDa, a pI of 4.2 and carries 13.5 kDa N-linked glycans. In the crystal, MtL forms a dimer with the phenolic substrate binding pocket blocked, suggesting that the active form of the enzyme is monomeric. Overall, the MtL structure conforms with the canonical fold of fungal laccases as well as the features specific for the asco-laccases. However, the structural comparisons also reveal significant variations within this taxonomic subgroup. Notable differences in the T1-Cu active site topology and polar motifs imply molecular evolution to serve different functional roles. Very few surface residues are conserved and it is noticeable that they encompass residues that interact with the N-glycans and/or are located at domain interfaces. The N-glycosylation sites are surprisingly conserved among asco-laccases and in most cases the glycan displays extensive interactions with the protein. In particular, the glycans at Asn88 and Asn210 appear to have evolved as an integral part of the asco-laccase structure. An uneven distribution of the carbohydrates around the enzyme give unique properties to a distinct part of the surface of the asco-laccases which may have implication for laccase function–in particular towards large substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2900007852,"Objectives For electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also commonly called e-cigarettes, coil temperature is a factor in the potential production of toxic chemical constituents. However, data are lacking regarding the temperatures that are achieved in the latest generation of these devices. Fourth-generation ENDS are capable of producing heating coil temperatures well above e-liquid boiling points, and allow the user to monitor and set the heating coil temperature during a puff. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy and consistency of the temperature measurement and control settings for different brands of fourth-generation ENDS. Methods A study was performed using three commercially available, fourth-generation ENDS. The atomizer coil temperatures were obtained from the device (using the EScribe software) reading and from thermocouples attached to the coils during simulated puffing conditions. In addition, aerosol temperatures were measured inside the atomizer and at the mouthpiece. Results Measured temperatures varied widely across samples taken from the same brand. For example, thermocouple measurements for one unit were 40 Celsius (°C) below the 300 °C set point, while another unit of the same brand exceeded the set point by more than 100 °C. We observed a significant variation in temperature (approximately 100 °C) along the length of the coil in some cases. Conclusions The possibility of wide temperature variation across ENDS samples, as well as variations between maximum coil temperatures and internal temperature readings, may have implications for studies that seek to determine correlations between coil temperature and toxin generation."
https://openalex.org/W2898612878,"Objective To assess the value of in utero placental assessment in predicting adverse pregnancy outcome after reported reduced fetal movements (RFM). Method A non-interventional prospective cohort study of women (N = 300) with subjective RFM at ≥28 weeks’ gestation in singleton non-anomalous pregnancies at a UK tertiary maternity hospital. Clinical, sonographic (fetal weight, placental size and maternal, fetal and placental arterial Doppler) and biochemical (maternal serum hCG, hPL, progesterone, PlGF and sFlt-1) assessment was conducted. Multiple logistic regression identified combinations of measurements (models) most predictive of adverse pregnancy outcome (perinatal mortality, birth weight <10th centile, five minute Apgar score <7, umbilical arterial pH <7.1 or base excess <-10, neonatal intensive care admission). Models were compared by test performance characteristics (ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, positive/negative likelihood ratios) against baseline care (estimated fetal weight centile, amniotic fluid index and gestation at presentation). Results 61 (20.6%) pregnancies ended in adverse outcome. Models incorporating PlGF/sFlt-1 ratio and umbilical artery free loop Doppler impedance demonstrated modest improvement in ROC area for adverse outcome (baseline care 0.69 vs. proposed models 0.73–0.76, p<0.05). However, there was little improvement in other test characteristics (baseline vs. best proposed model: sensitivity 21.7% [95% confidence interval 13.1–33.6] vs. 35.8%% [24.4–49.3], specificity 96.6% [93.4–98.3] vs. 94.7% [90.7–97.0], PPV 61.9% [40.9–79.3] vs. 63.3% [45.5–78.1], NPV 82.8% [77.9–86.8] vs. 85.2% [80.0–89.2], positive LR 6.3 [2.8–14.6] vs. 6.7 [3.4–3.3], negative LR 0.81 [0.71–0.93] vs. 0.68 [0.55–0.83]) and wide confidence intervals. Negative post-test probability remained high (16.7% vs. 14.0%). Conclusion Antenatal placental assessment may improve identification of RFM pregnancies at highest risk of adverse pregnancy outcome but further work is required to understand and refine currently available outcome definitions and diagnostic techniques to improve clinical utility."
https://openalex.org/W2900291099,"Long term effects of subtotal gastrectomy on gut microbiota modifications with subsequent metabolic profiles are limited. We aimed to investigate and compare long-term effects of metabolic profiles and microbiota status in early gastric cancer patients post curative subtotal gastrectomy to the controls. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed type II diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome occurrence in two groups: 111 patients after curative subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II (BII) anastomosis and Roux-en-Y gastrojejuno (RYGJ) anastomosis and 344 age-sex matched controls. Fecal samples from those with BII, RYGJ, and controls were analyzed by next-generation sequencing method. Metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes mellitus occurrences were significantly lower in patients after subtotal gastrectomy with RYGJ than in controls over the long term (> 8 years) follow-up (P < 0.05). The richness and diversity of gut microbiota significantly increased after subtotal gastrectomy with RYGJ (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the principal component analysis revealed significant differences in bacterial genera abundance after subtotal gastrectomy with BII and RYGJ (P < 0.001). Genera of Oscillospira, Prevotella, Coprococcus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Anaerosinus, Slackia, Oxalobacter, Victivallis, Butyrivibrio, Sporobacter, and Campylobacter shared more abundant roles both in the RYGJ group and BII groups. Early gastric cancer patients after subtotal gastrectomy with RYGJ had a lower occurrence of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes mellitus than the controls during long term follow-up. In parallel with the metabolic improvements, gut microbial richness and diversity also significantly increased after subtotal gastrectomy with RYGJ."
https://openalex.org/W2899575096,"Objectives There is a gap between clinical practice guidelines for social anxiety disorder and clinical practice that needs to be addressed to ensure the delivery of evidence-based treatments. The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe mental health service utilization in a cohort of primary care patients with social anxiety disorder; 2) to examine treatment adequacy for pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy according to indicators based on clinical practice guidelines; and 3) to explore correlates of treatment adequacy. Method The “Dialogue” project (Quebec, Canada) is a large study conducted in 67 primary care clinics. After a mental health screening in primary care (n = 14 833), participants with anxiety or depressive symptoms took part in a telephone/web structured interview on mental health symptoms and service utilization (n = 1956). This study included 289 participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder. Results Overall, 86.2% of participants reported consulting for mental health reasons over the past 12 months. Only 23.6% of our sample reported the detection of social anxiety disorder by a healthcare professional in the past 12 months. Approximately 2 in 5 respondents with social anxiety disorder reported receiving pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy meeting our treatment adequacy indicators. Antidepressant medication was the most common treatment. Logistic regression models showed that the detection of major depression (OR = 4.651; 95% CI: 2.559–8.453) or other anxiety disorder(s) (OR = 2.957; 95% CI: 1.555–5.625) were associated with receiving any adequate treatment, but the detection of social anxiety disorder itself was not (OR = 1.420; 95% CI: 0.696–2.899). Conclusion Low rates of detection and treatment adequacy based on our indicators demonstrate that efforts must be made to ensure the quality of care for individuals with social anxiety disorder in primary care."

Trained observers with repeated exposure to different body types can estimate body fat (BF) of individuals compared to criterion methods with reasonable accuracy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a computer algorithm to provide a valid estimate %BF using digital photographs.Our sample included 97 children and 226 adults (age in years: 11.3±3.3; 38.1±11.6, respectively). Measured height and weight were used (BMI in kg/m2: 20.4±4.4; 28.7±6.6 for children and adults, respectively). Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was the criterion method. Body volume (BVPHOTO) and body shape (BSPHOTO) were derived from two digital images. Final support vector regression (SVR) models were trained using age, sex, race, BMI for % BFNOPHOTO, plus BVPHOTO and BSPHOTO for %BFPHOTO. Separate validation models were used to evaluate the learning algorithm in children and adults. The differences in correlations between %BFDXA, %BFNOPHOTO and %BFPHOTO were tested using the Fisher's Z-score transformation.Mean BFDXA and BFPHOTO were 27.0%±9.2 vs. 26.7%± 7.4 in children and 32.9± 10.4% vs. 32.8%±9.3 in adults. SVR models produced %BFPHOTO values strongly correlated with %BFDXA. Our final model produced correlations of rDP = 0.80 and rDP = 0.87 in children and adults, respectively for %BFPHOTO vs. %BFDXA. The correlation between %BFNOPHOTO and %BFDXA was moderate, yet statistically significant in both children rDB = 0.70; p <0.0001 and adults rDB = 0.86; p<0.0001. However, the correlations for rDP were statistically higher than rDB (%BFDXA vs. %BFNOPHOTO) in both children and adults (children: Z = 5.95, p<0.001; adults: Z = 3.27, p<0.0001).Our photographic method produced valid estimates of BF in both children and adults. Further research is needed to create norms for subgroups by sex, race/ethnicity, and mobility status."
https://openalex.org/W2899945210,"Tomato wilt disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) is a worldwide destructive disease of tomato. As exploring gene expression and function approaches constitute an initial point for investigating pathogen-host interaction, we performed RNA-seq and sRNA-seq analysis to investigate the transcriptome of tomato root under FOL infection. Differentially expressed (DE) protein-coding gene and miRNA gene profiles upon inoculation with FOL were presented at twenty-four hours post-inoculation in four treatments. A total of more than 182.6 million and 132.2 million high quality clean reads were obtained by RNA-seq and sRNA-seq, respectively. A large overlap was found in DE mRNAs between susceptible cultivar Moneymaker and resistant cultivar Motelle. Gene Ontology terms were mainly classified into catalytic activity, metabolic process and binding. Combining with qRT-PCR and Northern blot, we validated the transcriptional profile of five genes and five miRNAs conferred to FOL infection. Our work allowed comprehensive understanding of different transcriptional reaction of genes/miRNAs between the susceptible and resistant cultivars tomato to the FOL challenge, which could offer us with a future direction to generate models of mediated resistance responses."
https://openalex.org/W2899524230,"Background BRCA-1 associated protein (BAP1) is a de-ubiquitinating enzyme that regulates gene expression. Recently, the BAP1 mutation and its involvement in cancer survival have been reported in a range of tumor types, including uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, renal cancers, and biliary tract cancers. However, the frequency of BAP1 mutation and down-regulation varies among tumor types, and little is known about the function of BAP1 silencing in cancer cells. Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a type of biliary tract cancer with a poor prognosis. Few mutational studies have investigated the role of BAP1 in GBC, and no functional study in vitro-, or clinical studies about cancer survival have been done. Methods GBC cells were studied by following the small interfering RNA mediated silencing of BAP1 with regard to proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug sensitivity. We carried out genomic, epigenomic and immunohistochemical analyses to detect somatic BAP1 alterations in 47 GBC patients undergoing surgical resection. Results BAP1 depletion resulted in increased migration and invasion, but not proliferation, and also resulted in decreased sensitivity to bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. Suppressed expression of BAP1 occurred in 22 GBC cases (46.8%) and showed a strong trend toward a worse median survival time of 13.3 months (95% CI, 17.6–62.6) (p = 0.0034). Sanger sequencing revealed a loss-of-function mutation of BAP1 in 11 out of these 22 GBC cases (50%) with low BAP1 expression, whereas 2 out of 25 GBC cases (8%) were detected in cases with high BAP1 expression. Partial changes in methylation were observed in 6 out of 47 cases, but methylation did not show a strong relationship to BAP1 expression or to the prognosis. Conclusion Our findings showed that genetic mutations are involved in BAP1 down-regulation, leading to promotion of the invasive character of cancer cells and poor prognosis in GBC."
https://openalex.org/W2899640575,"Objective Although research on the physiological and psychological factors of endurance performance has been extensive, the factors related to dropping out of ultra-trail races have not been well documented. The aim of this study was to examine psychosocial factors as predictors of dropout in ultra-trail runners. Methods Two hundred and twenty-one volunteer athletes completed a survey that included measures of: (a) motivational variables (self-determined motivation, basic needs satisfaction, achievement goals), (b) theory of planned behavior constructs (attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy and intention to finish the race), and (c) coping strategies in sport. Results The results showed that finishers had higher scores for self-efficacy and intention to finish the race than withdrawers, whereas withdrawers had higher scores for avoidance coping. Multiple logistic regression showed that the number of started and finished ultra-trail races (OR, 0.44; 95% CI 0.22–0.88; p<0.02), self-efficacy (OR, 2.03; 95% CI 1.06–3.89; p<0.04), intention to finish the race (OR, 0.34; 95% CI 0.16–0.71; p<0.004), mastery-approach goals (OR, 0.56; 95% CI 0.31–1.00; p<0.05), and coping strategies of seeking social support (OR, 0.43; 95% CI 0.26–0.71; p<0.001) were associated with a lower risk of race dropout, whereas avoidance coping strategies (OR, 2.26; 95% CI 1.46–3.52; p<0.001) were associated with an increased dropout rate. Conclusion Interventions promoting self-efficacy constructs and specific coping strategies might contribute to preventing dropout in ultra-trailers."
https://openalex.org/W2899817126,"Respiratory tract infections and invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in high-risk groups are a major global health problem. Available human vaccines have reduced immunogenicity and low immunological memory in these populations, as well as high cost as a public health strategy in poor communities. In addition, no single pneumococcal protein antigen has been able to elicit protection comparable to that achieved using protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. In this context, chimeric pneumococcal proteins raise as potential good vaccine candidates because of their simplicity of production and reduced cost. The aim of this work was to study whether the nasal immunization of infant mice with the recombinant chimeric pneumococcal protein (PSFP) was able to improve resistance to S. pneumoniae, and whether the immunomodulatory strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 or its cell wall (CW1505) could be used as effective mucosal adjuvants. Our results showed that the nasal immunization with PSPF improved pneumococcal-specific IgA and IgG levels in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL), reduced lung bacterial counts, and avoided dissemination of pneumococci into the blood. Of interest, immunization with PSPF elicited cross-protective immunity against different pneumococcal serotypes. It was also observed that the nasal immunization of infant mice with PSPF+CW1505 significantly increased the production of pneumococcal-specific IgA and IgG in BAL, as well as IgM and IgG in serum when compared with PSPF alone. PSPF+CW1505 immunization also improved the reduction of pneumococcal lung colonization and its dissemination in to the bloodstream when compared to PSPF alone. Our results suggest that immunization with PSPF together with the cell wall of the immunomodulatory strain L. rhamnosus CRL1505 as a mucosal adjuvant could be an interesting alternative to improve protection against pneumococcal infection in children."

A target of 95% immunization coverage is necessary for the sustained control of VPDs. This study aims to determine the immunization status and its associated demo-graphic factors among children 12-59 months old in Akinyele Local Government area (LGA), Oyo State, Nigeria. A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in one urban and one rural ward of Akinyele LGA. Fourhundred and forty-four (449) Under-five children were selected by multistage sampling technique. Data were collected from caregivers using interviewer administered questionnaires. Odds ratios at 95% CIand Chi square at 5% significant level were computed to identify the factors associated with non or partial immunisation. Multiple logistics regression at 5% significance level was done to determine the socio-demographic determinants of immunisation status. Overall, 449 children aged 12-59 months were surveyed of which 213(47.4%) were males and 236(52.6%) were from urban area. Overall, 365(81.3%) was fully immunized, 75(16.7%) was partially immunized and 9(2.0%) had never been immunized. Predictors of a child being partially or un-immunised were being in the fourth wealth quintile (AOR 7.9; 95%CI: 2.7-18.0), poorest wealth quintile (AOR 14.5; 95%CI 4.2-20.5), having a mother with no education (AOR 6.4; 95%CI: 2.9-14.1) and a mother that practiced Islam (AOR: 2.2; 95%CI: 1.3-3.7). Immunisation coverage was somewhat high but still suboptimal among the study population. Strategies that improve female literacy and those that target religious institutions may be effective in improving immunisation uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2900042245,"Myocilin (MYOC) is the gene with mutations most common in glaucoma. In the eye, MYOC is in trabecular meshwork, ciliary body, and retina. Other tissues with high MYOC transcript levels are skeletal muscle and heart. To date, the function of wild-type MYOC remains unknown and how mutant MYOC causes high intraocular pressure and glaucoma is ambiguous. By investigating mutant MYOC in a non-ocular tissue we hoped to obtain novel insight into mutant MYOC pathology. For this study, we utilized a transgenic mouse expressing human mutant MYOC Y437H protein and we examined its skeletal (gastrocnemius) muscle phenotype. Electron micrographs showed that sarcomeres in the skeletal muscle of mutant CMV-MYOC-Y437H mice had multiple M-bands. Western blots of soluble muscle lysates from transgenics indicated a decrease in two M-band proteins, myomesin 1 (MYOM1) and muscle creatine kinase (CKM). Immunoprecipitation identified CKM as a MYOC binding partner. Our results suggest that binding of mutant MYOC to CKM is changing sarcomere ultrastructure and this may adversely impact muscle function. We speculate that a person carrying the mutant MYOC mutation will likely have a glaucoma phenotype and may also have undiagnosed muscle ailments or vice versa, both of which will have to be monitored and treated."
https://openalex.org/W2900426678,"Introduction Emerging data suggest that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) could reduce serious AIDS and non-AIDS events and deaths but could also increase costs. In January 2016, the Spanish guidelines were updated to recommend ART at any CD4 count. However, the epidemiologic and economic impacts of early ART initiation in Spain remain unclear. Methods The Johns Hopkins HIV Economic-Epidemiologic Mathematical Model (JHEEM) was utilized to estimate costs, transmissions, and outcomes in Spain over 20 years. We compared implementation of guidelines for early ART initiation to a counterfactual scenario deferring ART until CD4-counts fall below 350 cells/mm3. We additionally studied the impact of early ART initiation in combination with improvements to HIV screening, care linkage and engagement. Results Early ART initiation (irrespective of CD4-count) is expected to avert 20,100 [95% Uncertainty Range (UR) 11,100–83,000] new HIV cases over the next two decades compared to delayed ART (28% reduction), at an incremental health system cost of €1.05 billion [€0.66 – €1.63] billion, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €29,700 [€13,700 – €41,200] per QALY gained. Projected ICERs declined further over longer time horizon; e.g., an ICER of €12,691 over 30 years. Furthermore, the impact of early ART initiation was potentiated by improved HIV screening among high-risk individuals, averting an estimated 41,600 [23,200–172,200] HIV infections (a 58% decline) compared to delayed ART. Conclusions Recommendations for ART initiation irrespective of CD4-counts are cost-effective and could avert > 30% of new cases in Spain. Improving HIV diagnosis can amplify this impact."
https://openalex.org/W2899618341,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical routine. Left atrial (LA) electro-anatomical remodelling in AF patients indicates disease progression and is associated with poor therapeutic success. PR interval prolongation is associated with an increased risk for AF, however, the association between LA remodelling measured as low voltage areas (LVA) during catheter ablation and PR interval is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between PR interval prolongation and LVA in AF patients. Methods We studied 103 patients (62±12 years, 59% males, 34% persistent AF) undergoing first AF catheter ablation and presenting with sinus rhythm. PR interval prolongation was defined as PR >200ms and analysed in resting ECG before intervention. LVA were determined using high-density maps and defined as <0.5 mV. Results There were 24 patients (23%) with PR interval prolongation and 18 patients (17%) with LVA. There were significant correlations between PR prolongation with LVA, CHA2DS2-VASc score and eGFR (r2 = 0.230, 0.216, and 0.307, all p<0.05). PR interval prolongation (OR 3.450, p = 0.024), persistent AF (OR 5.391, p = 0.002), and LA size (OR 1.117, p = 0.018) were significant predictors for LVA, while age (OR 1.072, p = 0.005), LVA (OR 3.450 p = 0.024) and eGFR (OR 0.962, p = 0.004) were associated with PR interval prolongation. Conclusions Beside persistent AF and LA size, PR interval prolongation might be useful for the prediction of electro-anatomical substrate in AF patients. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results."
https://openalex.org/W2900188526,"Interspecific hybridization between bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 42) and related species allows the transfer of agronomic and quality traits, whereby subsequent generations comprise an improved genetic background and can be directly applied in wheat breeding programmes. While wild relatives are frequently used as sources of agronomically favourable traits, cultivated species can also improve wheat quality and stress resistance. A salt-tolerant 'Asakaze'/'Manas' 7H disomic addition line (2n = 44) with elevated β-glucan content, but with low fertility and an unstable genetic background was developed in an earlier wheat-barley prebreeding programme. The aim of the present study was to take this hybridization programme further and transfer the favourable barley traits into a more stable genetic background. Taking advantage of the breakage-fusion mechanism of univalent chromosomes, the 'Rannaya' winter wheat 7B monosomic line was used as female partner to the 7H addition line male, leading to the development of a compensating wheat/barley Robertsonian translocation line (7BS.7HL centric fusion, 2n = 42) exhibiting higher salt tolerance and elevated grain β-glucan content. Throughout the crossing programme, comprising the F1-F4 generations, genomic in situ hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromosome-specific molecular markers were used to trace and identify the wheat and barley chromatin. Investigations on salt tolerance during germination and on the (1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucan (mixed-linkage glucan [MLG]) content of the seeds confirmed the salt tolerance and elevated grain MLG content of the translocation line, which can be directly applied in current wheat breeding programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2900245009,"Rhodopsin mediates an essential step in image capture and is tightly associated with visual adaptations of aquatic organisms, especially species that live in dim light environments (e.g., the deep sea). The rh1 gene encoding rhodopsin was formerly considered a single-copy gene in genomes of vertebrates, but increasing exceptional cases have been found in teleost fish species. The main objective of this study was to determine to what extent the visual adaptation of teleosts might have been shaped by the duplication and loss of rh1 genes. For that purpose, homologous rh1/rh1-like sequences in genomes of ray-finned fishes from a wide taxonomic range were explored using a PCR-based method, data mining of public genetic/genomic databases, and subsequent phylogenomic analyses of the retrieved sequences. We show that a second copy of the fish-specific intron-less rh1 is present in the genomes of most anguillids (Elopomorpha), Hiodon alosoides (Osteoglossomorpha), and several clupeocephalan lineages. The phylogenetic analysis and comparisons of alternative scenarios for putative events of gene duplication and loss suggested that fish rh1 was likely duplicated twice during the early evolutionary history of teleosts, with one event coinciding with the hypothesized fish-specific genome duplication and the other in the common ancestor of the Clupeocephala. After these gene duplication events, duplicated genes were maintained in several teleost lineages, whereas some were secondarily lost in specific lineages. Alternative evolutionary schemes of rh1 and comparison with previous studies of gene evolution are also reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2900098524,"Background Human adult adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) have become the most promising cell source for regenerative medicine. However the prolonged ex vivo expansion periods required to obtain the necessary therapeutic dose promotes progressive senescence, with the concomitant reduction of their therapeutic potential. Aim and scope A better understanding of the determinants of hADSC senescence is needed to improve biosafety while preserving therapeutic efficiency. Here, we investigated the association between deregulation of the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region and replicative senescence in hADSC cultures. Methods We compared hADSC cultures at short (PS) and prolonged (PL) passages, both in standard and low [O2] (21 and 3%, respectively), in relation to replicative senescence. hADSCs were evaluated for expression alterations in the DLK1-DIO3 region on chromosome 14q32, and particularly in its main miRNA cluster. Results Comparison of hADSCs cultured at PL or PS surprisingly showed a quite significant fraction (69%) of upregulated miRNAs in PL cultures mapping to the imprinted 14q32 locus, the largest miRNA cluster described in the genome. In agreement, expression of the lncRNA MEG3 (Maternally Expressed 3; Meg3/Gtl2), cultured at 21 and 3% [O2], was also significantly higher in PL than in PS passages. During hADSC replicative senescence the AcK16H4 activating mark was found to be significantly associated with the deregulation of the entire DLK1-DIO3 locus, with a secondary regulatory role for the methylation of DMR regions. Conclusion A direct relationship between DLK1-DIO3 deregulation and replicative senescence of hADSCs is reported, involving upregulation of a very significant fraction of its largest miRNA cluster (14q32.31), paralleled by the progressive overexpression of the lncRNA MEG3, which plays a central role in the regulation of Dlk1/Dio3 activation status in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2900278793,"Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and connective tissue disease -associated interstitial pneumonia (CTD-IP) are the two most common types of interstitial pneumonia. IIP and CTD-IP share common histological features, yet their clinical management is different. Separation of the two conditions based solely on histology can be challenging, and there are no established criteria.We selected 105 consecutive cases of IIP (79 usual interstitial pneumonia and 26 non-specific interstitial pneumonia) and 49 cases of CTD-IP for derivation and 32 cases of IIP and 10 cases of CTD-IP for validation. Fourteen histological parameters were evaluated independently by two pathologists for derivation group and graded into 0 to 3. The association between the score for each marker and a diagnosis of CTD was investigated using Fisher's exact test and stepwise logistic regression analysis. A formula for calculating the probability of IIP and CTD-IP was constructed by the markers identified in the regression test with coefficients for each finding. The formula was confirmed using validation case group.Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that plasmacytosis, lymphoid follicle with germinal center, and airspace fibrin were suggestive of CTD-IP and that fibroblastic foci, smooth muscle hyperplasia, cellular IP, dense perivascular collagen, and fat metaplasia were suggestive of IIP. The formula used to calculate the probabilities based on estimated values for each finding was created, and user-friendly web based app was composed at www.ctdip.com. On the validation study, 30 out of 32 IIP and eight out of 10 CTD-IPs were distinguished correctly by the app (Specificity: 93%, Sensitivity: 80%).We identified histological markers and derived a practical formula and user-friendly app to distinguish CTD-IPs from IIP."
https://openalex.org/W2900302534,"Malaria is one of the transfusion transmissible infections in malaria endemic countries such as Ghana. Healthy blood donors may harbour Plasmodium parasites without showing signs of malaria. Blood from such donors constitutes a risk to transfusion recipients and the recipients of this blood may go on to develop transfusion transmitted malaria (TTM). In many malaria endemic countries, blood donors are not screened for Plasmodium parasites. We investigated the prevalence of Plasmodium in blood donors in a hospital in Ghana as well as evaluate health workers knowledge, attitude and practices towards TTM. The study was carried out at the Kwadaso Seventh Day Adventist Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana from September 2016 to May 2017. Blood samples from 100 blood donors and 100 non-donors were examined for Plasmodium using microscopy and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). In addition the blood groups of participants were determined. To obtain information concerning knowledge, attitude and practices of transfusion transmitted malaria, questionnaires were administered to 100 health workers including doctors, nurses and laboratory technicians. The prevalence rate of Plasmodium parasitaemia in blood donors by RDT and microscopy was 8% and 3% respectively, compared to non-donors who had a prevalence of 5% and 2% by RDT and microscopy respectively. Out of 100 health workers surveyed, 26% (26/100) had never heard of transfusion transmitted malaria. In an emergency situation, 41% health workers were willing to transfuse malaria positive blood but only 2%, 4% and 8% were willing to transfuse blood that was positive for HIV, Hepatitis B and Syphilis respectively. Regular training workshops may help improve the knowledge of health workers as a quarter of workers had not heard about transfusion transmitted malaria and 6.8% did not know that malaria was transmissible by transfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2900444042,"The permanent implantation of a stent has become the most common method for ameliorating coronary artery narrowing arising from atherosclerosis. Following the procedure, optimal arterial wall healing is characterised by the complete regrowth of an Endothelial Cell monolayer over the exposed stent surface and surrounding tissue, thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis. However, excessive proliferation of Smooth Muscle Cells, within the artery wall can lead to unwanted renarrowing of the vessel lumen. Current imaging techniques are unable to adequately identify re-endothelialisation, and it has previously been reported that the stent itself could be used as an electrode in combination with electrical impedance spectroscopic techniques to monitor the post-stenting recovery phase. The utility of such a device will be determined by its ability to characterise between vascular cell types. Here we present in-vitro impedance spectroscopy measurements of pulmonary artery porcine Endothelial Cells, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells and coronary artery porcine Smooth Muscle Cells grown to confluence over platinum black electrodes in clinically relevant populations. These measurements were obtained, using a bespoke impedance spectroscopy system that autonomously performed impedance sweeps in the 1kHz to 100kHz frequency range. Analysis of the reactance component of impedance revealed distinct frequency dependent profiles for each cell type with post confluence reactance declines in Endothelial Cell populations that have not been previously reported. Such profiles provide a means of non-invasively characterising between the cell types and give an indication that impedance spectroscopic techniques may enable the non-invasive characterisation of the arterial response to stent placement."
https://openalex.org/W2899808407,"Maintaining balance on ramps is important for mobility. However, balance is commonly assessed using inverted pendulum-based metrics (e.g., margin of stability), which may not be appropriate for assessment of human walking on non-level surfaces. To investigate this, we analyzed stability on ramps using four different inverted pendulum models: extrapolated center of mass (XCOM), foot placement estimate (FPE), foot placement estimate neglecting angular momentum (FPENoH), and capture point (CAP). We analyzed experimental data from 10 able-bodied individuals walking on a ramp at 0°, ±5°, and ±10°. Contrary to our hypothesis that the magnitude of differences between metrics would be greatest at ±10°, we observed the greatest magnitude of differences between metrics at 0°. In general, the stability metrics were bounded by FPE and CAP at each slope, consistent with prior studies of level walking. Our results also suggest that clinical providers and researchers should be aware that assessments that neglect angular momentum (e.g., margin of stability, XCOM) may underestimate stability in the sagittal-plane in comparison to analyses which incorporate angular momentum (e.g., FPE). Except for FPENoH-CAP (r = 0.82), differences between metrics were only moderately correlated (|r|≤0.65) with violations of leg length assumptions in the underlying inverted pendulum models. The differences in FPENoH relative to FPE and CAP were strongly correlated with body center of mass vertical velocity (max |r| = 0.92), suggesting that model representations of center of mass motion influence stability metrics. However, there was not a clear overall relationship between model inputs and differences in stability metrics. Future sensitivity analyses may provide additional insight into model characteristics that influence stability metrics."

Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is involved in collagen production and lung repair. We investigated whether alveolar TGF-β1 was associated with the presence of fibroproliferation and the outcome of ARDS patients.Sixty-two patients were included the first day of moderate-to-severe ARDS. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at day 3 (and day 7 when the patients were still receiving invasive mechanical ventilation) from the onset of ARDS. Survival was evaluated at day 60. TGF-β1 was measured by immunoassay. The patients were classified as having lung fibroproliferation when the alveolar N-terminal peptide for type III procollagen (NT-PCP-III) measured on day 3 was > 9 μg/L as recently reported. The main objective of this study was to compare the alveolar levels of total TGF-β1 according to the presence or not a lung fibroproliferation at day 3.Forty-three patients (30.6%) presented a fibroproliferation at day 3. BALF levels of total TGF-β1 were not statistically different at day 3 (and at day 7) according to the presence or not lung fibroproliferation. Mortality at day 60 was higher in the group of patients with fibroproliferation as compared with patients with no fibroproliferation (68.4% vs. 18.6% respectively; p < 0.001). Total TGF-β1 measured on BALF at day 3 was not associated with the outcome. Multiple logistic regression showed that the presence of lung fibroproliferation was associated with death. In contrast, TGF-β1 was not independently associated with death.Pulmonary levels of TGF-β1 during the first week of ARDS were not associated nor with the presence of fibroproliferation neither with death. TGF-β1 should not be used as a biomarker to direct anti-fibrotic therapies."

Each model was compared to a criterion 4C model with air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) generated BV (4C-ADP). Participants were categorized as normal weight (n = 40; NW = BMI<25.0kg/m2); overweight (n = 40; OWBMI = BMI≥25.0 kg/m2); and overweight with at-risk WC (n = 35; OWBMI+WC = BMI≥25.0 kg/m2 and WC≥88.0cm for women and 102.0cm for men). 4C-DXA1 produced lower BF% than that derived using the 4C-ADP in NW (CE = -3.0%; p<0.001) while 4C-DXA2 was significantly higher (CE = 4.8%; p<0.001). The SEE and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were lower for 4C-DXA2 (1.24% and ±2.5%, respectively) than 4C-DXA1 (2.59% and ±5.0%, respectively) and proportional bias was present for both (p<0.05). 4C-DXA1 BF% was not significant in OWBMI (CE = -0.5%; p = 0.112) whereas 4C-DXA2 was higher (CE = 4.5%; p<0.001).

https://openalex.org/W2900228075,"Seeds planted in early spring frequently experience low temperature stress in the soil during germination and early plant growth. Seed pretreatments such as priming have been shown to ameliorate the negative effects of cold soil in some crops. However, the potential beneficial effects of priming have not been widely investigated for Zea mays (maize). To investigate seed priming effects, 24 diverse maize inbred lines were primed using a synthetic solid matrix, Micro-Cel E, and then exposed to 10°C soil conditions. Six DSLR cameras captured time lapsed images of emerging seedlings. Manual scoring was used to determine treatment effects on three seedling emergence metrics. Chilling substantially reduced total emergence for two of 24 genotypes evaluated. For these genotypes, priming provided protection allowing nearly full emergence. Priming significantly reduced mean emergence time and increased the emergence uniformity of chilling sensitive genotypes. The results suggest that the cold sensitive genotypes may benefit from priming pretreatment. Kernel density, weight, oil, protein, and starch traits, as determined by single-kernel near infrared spectroscopy, were not correlated with seedling emergence traits supporting a conclusion that early seedling performance cannot be determined from these maize kernel characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2899614390,"We have created a new, fast-growing strain of common carp with higher unsaturated fatty acid content in muscle. To better understand the impacts of gene regulation in intestinal tissue on growth and unsaturated fatty acid content, we conducted a comparative RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis between intestine samples of Selected and Control groups (and corroborated selected results by PCR). After eight weeks of cage culture, weight gain of the Selected group was 20.84% higher. In muscles of the control group, monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs) were more abundant, whereas polyunsaturated FAs were more abundant in muscles of the Selected group. In total, we found 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups. Only the endocytosis pathway was significantly enriched in DEGs, with two upregulated genes: il2rb and ehd1. The latter is involved in the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (Gh/Igf) axis, which plays a key role in the regulation of growth in animals. tll2, which is known to be associated with intestinal regeneration, was extremely highly upregulated in both transcriptomic (infinite) and qPCR (610.70) analyses. Two of the upregulated genes are associated with the fatty acid metabolism, several genes are likely to be indicators of heightened transcription levels, several are associated with metabolic and developmental roles, several with neuronal functions (including two with vision), several with the immune system, and two downregulated genes with the development of vasculature. The higher growth rate of the Selected group is likely to be at least partially attributed to increased endocytosis efficiency and genetically-driven behavioural differences (higher aggression levels). There are some indications that this new strain might have slightly impaired immune responses, and a higher propensity for inherited diseases leading to sight impairment, as well for neurodegenerative diseases in general, but these indications still need to be confirmed."

However, there is little information regarding the pastoral community members' awareness about brucellosis as a cause of abortion in animals and its zoonotic importance. In this study, we assessed knowledge and perception of pastoral community members about brucellosis as a cause of abortion in animals and its zoonotic importance in Amibara district, Afar Region, Ethiopia. Between October and December 2016, a total of 475 study participants (age range 18-80 years, mean age 35.9 years) were interviewed about abortion in their animals, its causes, and diseases that can be transmitted to humans through consumption of raw milk. Almost all (97.7%) of the study participants reported that abortion in animals, especially in goats, is a major problem in the area, and they mentioned that disease (44.6%), drought (58.4%) and fly bites (29.5%) as the main causes of abortion. The study participantsalso thought that malaria (42.9%) and bovine tuberculosis (19.3%) can be transmitted to humans through consuming raw milk. Five respondents (4.2%) mentioned brucellosis (locally known as ""hahayita"") as a disease that can be transmitted through frequent consumption of raw milk. The majority (91.9%) mentioned malaria as a cause of febrile illness in humans and 16 (4.4%) participants mentioned brucellosis as a cause of febrile illness. Some participants also mentioned brucellosis as a cause of joint swelling (hygroma) in cattle. In conclusion, the pastoral community members in the present study area lack clear understanding about brucellosis as one of the diseases that cause abortion in their animals and its zoonotic importance. There is a need to create awareness about the zoonotic and animal health importance of brucellosis through various means such as community health extension/veterinary workers and community leaders."
https://openalex.org/W2900103965,"This paper examines possible causes of additional spudcan settlement after preloading using both centrifuge model tests and small strain finite element analysis, in which spudcan settlement due to cavity collapse, consolidation settlement and settlement due to cyclic loading are incorporated. Back-analyses of seven jack-up rigs in the Gulf of Mexico show that even complete cavity collapse could only explain part of the measured additional settlements in the majority of the cases. Small strain finite element analyses also show that spudcan consolidation settlement is likely to account for even less of the additional settlement than cavity collapse in the sites considered. On the other hand, centrifuge model tests show that large amplitude cyclic rocking has a very significant effect on spudcan settlement, even if half of the preload has been removed. However, this effect cannot be explained by the exceedance of the yield envelope since the loading combination had not exceeded the yield envelope. One possible explanation is the stiffness and strength degradation of the soil under cyclic loading. In view of this, a conservative approach is recommended in instances where large amplitude cyclic rocking, such as that arising from storm loading, is expected shortly after preloading. The presence of lattice legs is found to reduce the spudcan settlement during large amplitude cyclic rocking."
https://openalex.org/W2900229439,"Objective Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease associated with inflammation and hormone imbalance. It is noteworthy that dry eye syndrome shares a similar pathophysiology with osteoporosis. Both diseases are more prevalent among the elderly and females. Dry eye syndrome can result in impaired vision, which increases the risk of fall and fracture when osteoporosis exists. In this study, we investigated whether osteoporosis is associated with an increased risk of developing dry eye syndrome. Methods Claims data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan were used to conduct a retrospective population-based cohort study covering the period from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine whether osteoporosis is an independent factor in the risk of developing dry eye syndrome, with risk estimates presented in the form of odds ratios (ORs). Results The exclusion of patients with specific autoimmune diseases and those younger than 50 years old resulted in 42,365 patients in the osteoporosis group and 147,460 patients in the comparison group during the study period. The number of patients newly diagnosed with dry eye syndrome was 6,478 (15.29%) in the osteoporosis group and 15,396 (10.44%) in the comparison group. The crude OR of patients with osteoporosis developing dry eye syndrome was 1.55 and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was 1.50–1.60. After adjusting for patients’ age, sex, and underlying comorbidities, the adjusted OR was 1.26 and the 95% CI was 1.22–1.30. Subgroup analysis revealed this association in each age group and among females but not among males. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that osteoporosis is a risk factor for the subsequent development of dry eye syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of the early symptoms of dry eye syndrome in osteoporotic patients in order to prevent further complications."

https://openalex.org/W2899535051,"Hidden underground, root systems constitute an important part of the plant for its development, nourishment and sensing the soil environment around it, but we know very little about its genetic regulation in crop plants like wheat. In the present study, we de novo assembled the root transcriptomes in reference cultivar Chinese Spring from RNA-seq reads generated by the 454-GS-FLX and HiSeq platforms. The FLX reads were assembled into 24,986 transcripts with completeness of 54.84%, and the HiSeq reads were assembled into 91,543 high-confidence protein-coding transcripts, 2,404 low-confidence protein-coding transcripts, and 13,181 non-coding transcripts with the completeness of >90%. Combining the FLX and HiSeq assemblies, we assembled a root transcriptome of 92,335 ORF-containing transcripts. Approximately 7% of the coding transcripts and ~2% non-coding transcripts are not present in the current wheat genome assembly. Functional annotation of both assemblies showed similar gene ontology patterns and that ~7% coding and >5% non-coding transcripts are root-specific. Transcription quantification identified 1,728 differentially expressed transcripts between root tips and maturation zone, and functional annotation of these transcripts captured a transcriptional signature of longitudinal development of wheat root. With the transcriptomic resources developed, this study provided the first view of wheat root transcriptome under different developmental zones and laid a foundation for molecular studies of wheat root development and growth using a reverse genetic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2899633676,"We present a non-parametric extension of the conditional logit model, using Gaussian process priors. The conditional logit model is used in quantitative social science for inferring interaction effects between personal features and choice characteristics from observations of individual multinomial decisions, such as where to live, which car to buy or which school to choose. The classic, parametric model presupposes a latent utility function that is a linear combination of choice characteristics and their interactions with personal features. This imposes strong and unrealistic constraints on the form of individuals' preferences. Extensions using non-linear basis functions derived from the original features can ameliorate this problem but at the cost of high model complexity and increased reliance on the user in model specification. In this paper we develop a non-parametric conditional logit model based on Gaussian process logit models. We demonstrate its application on housing choice data from over 50,000 moving households from the Stockholm area over a two year period to reveal complex homophilic patterns in income, ethnicity and parental status."
https://openalex.org/W2900006816,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) contrives intracellular abode as a strategy to combat antibody onslaught. Additionally, to thrive against hostile ambiance inside host macrophages, the pathogen inhibits phago-lysosomal fusion. Finally, to further defy host cell offensives, M.tb opts for dormant phase, where it turns off or slows down most of its metabolic process as an added stratagem. While M.tb restrains most of its metabolic activities during dormancy, surprisingly latency-associated alpha-crystallin protein (Acr-1) is expressed most prominently during this phase. Interestingly, several previous studies described the potential of Acr-1 to induce the robust immuno-prophylactic response in the immunized host. It is intriguing to comprehend the apparent discrepancy that the microbe M.tb overexpresses a protein that has the potential to prime host immune system against the pathogen itself. Keeping this apparent ambiguity into consideration, it is imperative to unravel intricacies involved in the exploitation of Acr-1 by M.tb during its interaction with host immune cells. The present study suggests that Acr-1 exhibits diverse role in the maturation of macrophages (MΦs) and related immunological responses. The early encounter of bone marrow derived immune cells (pre-exposure during differentiation to MΦs) with Acr-1 (AcrMΦpre), results in hampering of their function. The pre-exposure of naïve MΦs with Acr-1 induces the expression of TIM-3 and IL-10. In contrast, exposure of fully differentiated MΦs to Acr-1 results in their down-modulation and induces the phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-4 in host MΦs. Furthermore, Acr-1 mediated activation of MΦs results in the induction of Th1 and Th17 phenotype by activated T lymphocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2900051301,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs which are known to posttranscriptionally regulate the expression of most genes in both animals and plants. Meanwhile, studies have shown that numbers of miRNAs are present in body fluids including the plasma. Despite the mode of action of these circulating miRNAs still remains unknown, they have been found to be promising biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment. In order to evaluate the potential of miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers in aquaculture, a time-course experiment was implemented to investigate the postprandial regulation of miRNAs levels in liver and plasma as well as the hepatic expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. We showed that miR-1, miR-33a, miR-122, miR-128 and miR-223 were expressed in the liver of rainbow trout and present at detectable level in the plasma. We also demonstrated that hepatic expression of miR-1, miR-122 and miR-128 were regulated by feed intake and reached their highest levels 12 hours after the meal. Interestingly, we observed that circulating levels of miR-128 and miR-223 are subjected to postprandial regulations similar to that observed in their hepatic counterparts. Statistical correlations were observed between liver and plasma for miR-128 and miR-223 and between hepatic and circulating miR-122, miR-128 and miR-223 and expression of genes related to cholesterol synthesis and efflux or glucose phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that circulating miR-122, miR-128 and miR-223 are potential biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism in rainbow trout."
https://openalex.org/W2900056543,"The American monkfish is an important commercial species that is widely distributed across a range of depths and temperatures from North Carolina to southern Nova Scotia, including on Georges Bank. We examined changes in the seasonal distribution and relative abundance of monkfish in the scallop access areas in Closed Area I and Closed Area II on Georges Bank using catch data from a three-year seasonal scallop dredge survey. Over the course of the survey, more than 6,000 monkfish were caught and measured, and clear seasonal changes in monkfish abundance were documented. Monkfish catch peaked in the summer and early fall when they were caught across the entire survey area, while they were caught only in deeper waters at the edges of the bank in the winter. Monkfish relative abundance was modeled using a generalized linear mixed model with a Tweedie distribution, and the final model, with month, depth, and bottom temperature as fixed effects, effectively explained the seasonal shifts in the location and relative abundance of monkfish observed during this study. The results suggest that monkfish movements are driven by seasonal changes in bottom temperature. Management measures for monkfish are determined primarily based on data collected during the Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl surveys, yet this survey catches few monkfish, adding uncertainty to stock assessments. Our research indicates that increasing the use of dredge surveys to collect data on monkfish would be a positive step toward improving monkfish assessments. If monkfish movements are impacted by changes in thermal habitat, their distributions may shift in response to climate change, increasing the need for improved monkfish assessment strategies to effectively manage the species in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2899519849,"The massive quantities of genetic data generated by high-throughput sequencing pose challenges to data storage, transmission and analyses. These problems are effectively solved through data compression, in which the size of data storage is reduced and the speed of data transmission is improved. Several options are available for compressing and storing genetic data. However, most of these options either do not provide sufficient compression rates or require a considerable length of time for decompression and loading.Here, we propose TRCMGene, a lossless genetic data compression method that uses a referential compression scheme. The novel concept of two-step compression method, which builds an index structure using K-means and k-nearest neighbours, is introduced to TRCMGene. Evaluation with several real datasets revealed that the compression factor of TRCMGene ranges from 9 to 21. TRCMGene presents a good balance between compression factor and reading time. On average, the reading time of compressed data is 60% of that of uncompressed data. Thus, TRCMGene not only saves disc space but also saves file access time and speeds up data loading. These effects collectively improve genetic data storage and transmission in the current hardware environment and render system upgrades unnecessary. TRCMGene, user manual and demos could be accessed freely from https://github.com/tangyou79/TRCM. The data mentioned in this manuscript could be downloaded from: https://github.com/tangyou79/TRCM/wiki."
https://openalex.org/W2899813315,"Objective Stroke is a well-known and devastating complication during the perioperative period. However, detailed stroke risk profiles within 90 days in patients discharged without stroke after inpatient surgery are not fully understood. Using the case-crossover design, we aimed to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke in these patients. Methods We included adult patients with the first hospitalization for ischemic stroke between 2011 and 2012 from 23 million enrollees in the National Health Insurance Research Database. Admission date of the hospitalization was defined as the case day and exactly 365 days before the admission date as the control day. The exposure was the last hospitalization for surgery within 1–30, 31–60, or 61–90 days (case period) before the case day or similar time intervals (control period) before the control day. Surgical types were grouped based on the International Classification of Diseases procedure codes. We performed conditional logistic regression adjusting for time-varying variables to determine the relationship between surgery and subsequent stroke, and case-time-control analyses to examine whether the results were confounded by the time-trend in surgery. Results A total of 56596 adult patients (41% female, mean age 69 years) comprised the study population. After adjustment was made for confounding variables, an association between stroke and prior inpatient surgery within 30 days was observed (adjusted odds ratio 1.44; 95% confidence interval 1.29–1.61). Cardiothoracic, vascular, digestive surgery, and musculoskeletal surgery within 30 days independently predicted ischemic stroke in the case-crossover analysis. In the case-time-control analysis, inpatient surgery remained an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, whereas only cardiothoracic, vascular, and digestive surgery independently predicted ischemic stroke. Conclusions Surgery as a whole independently increased the risk of ischemic stroke within 30 days. Among various types of surgery, cardiothoracic, vascular, and digestive surgery significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2900126035,"The blood pressure (BP) variability (BPV) is a predictor of cardiovascular disease, independently of the BP itself. In addition, visceral fat accumulation can trigger atherosclerotic disease through various mechanisms.We examined the association between fat accumulation and day-to-day BPV in 61 adult hypertensive patients. Visceral fat area (VFA) was measured using the dual bioelectrical impedance analysis method. Participants were divided into three groups based on VFA. The standard deviation (SD) in home systolic BP (SBP) for 7 consecutive days was significantly lower in the high VFA tertile (low VFA, 8.40±4.15 mmHg; intermediate VFA, 8.47±2.80 mmHg; and high VFA, 5.84±2.37 mmHg, p of One-way ANOVA = 0.017, p for trend = 0.0126). A similar association was observed between the coefficient of variance (CV) of home SBP and the VFA tertile. Multiple-regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, antihypertensive drug, diabetes, habitual drinking, and SBP level also showed a significant association between the VFA tertile and the SD or CV of home SBP. The adjusted coefficient of regression for the SD of home SBP was -3.28 (95%CI: -5.60 to -0.97, p = 0.008) and the CV of home SBP was -2.51 (95%CI: -4.31 to -0.71, p = 0.008) for the highest VFA tertile as compared to the lowest VFA tertile.These results show for the first time negative correlation between VFA and day-to-day BPV. The degree of obesity should be taken into account when evaluating the value of BPV."
https://openalex.org/W2900104839,"Most data sets consist of interlaced-distributed samples from multiple classes and since these samples always cannot be classified correctly by a linear hyperplane, so we name them nonlinearly separable data sets and corresponding classifiers are named nonlinear classifiers. Traditional nonlinear classifiers adopt kernel functions to generate kernel matrices and then get optimal classifier parameters with the solution of these matrices. But computing and storing kernel matrices brings high computational and space complexities. Since INMKMHKS adopts Nyström approximation technique and NysCK changes nonlinearly separable data to linearly ones so as to reduce the complexities, we combines ideas of them to develop an improved NysCK (INysCK). Moreover, we extend INysCK into multi-view applications and propose multi-view INysCK (MINysCK). Related experiments validate the effectiveness of them in terms of accuracy, convergence, Rademacher complexity, etc."
https://openalex.org/W2900340140,"When launching a new product, firms often give away free samples to seed the market. This paper aims to identify the optimal seeding targets, such as early adopters, social hubs, or randomly chosen consumers while considering the presence of negative word-of-mouth (WOM). Using agent-based modeling, it was found that seeding early adopters can generate the highest profit and the largest market penetration, followed by the social hubs and random consumers. Moreover, the results show that seeding early adopters can be more beneficial for a low-quality product, wherein adopters are more likely to spread negative WOM. These findings challenge a widely accepted notion in the related research that social hubs are often the most promising targets for seeding programs."
