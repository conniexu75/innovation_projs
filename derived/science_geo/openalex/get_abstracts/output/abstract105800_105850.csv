https://openalex.org/W2112001901,"We have generated mice homozygous for a disruption of the mdr1a (also called mdr3) gene, encoding a drug-transporting P-glycoprotein. The mice were viable and fertile and appeared phenotypically normal, but they displayed an increased sensitivity to the centrally neurotoxic pesticide Ivermectin (100-fold) and to the carcinostatic drug vinblastine (3-fold). By comparison of mdr1a (+/+) and (−/−) mice, we found that the mdr1a P-glycoprotein is the major P-glycoprotein in the blood-brain barrier and that its absence results in elevated drug levels in many tissues (especially in brain) and in decreased drug elimination. Our findings explain some of the side effects in patients treated with a combination of carcinostatics and P-glycoprotein inhibitors and indicate that these inhibitors might be useful in selectively enhancing the access of a range of drugs to the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2095295932,"The Arabidopsis ABI1 locus is essential for a wide spectrum of abscisic acid (ABA) responses throughout plant development. Here, ABI1 was shown to regulate stomatal aperture in leaves and mitotic activity in root meristems. The ABI1 gene was cloned and predicted to encode a signaling protein. Although its carboxyl-terminal domain is related to serine-threonine phosphatase 2C, the ABI1 protein has a unique amino-terminal extension containing an EF hand calcium-binding site. These results suggest that the ABI1 protein is a Ca(2+)-modulated phosphatase and functions to integrate ABA and Ca2+ signals with phosphorylation-dependent response pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2061413318,"The alpha 1-adrenergic receptors activate a phospholipase C enzyme by coupling to members of the large molecular size (approximately 74 to 80 kilodaltons) G alpha h family of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. Rat liver G alpha h is now shown to be a tissue transglutaminase type II (TGase II). The transglutaminase activity of rat liver TGase II expressed in COS-1 cells was inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or by alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation. Rat liver TGase II also mediated alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation of phospholipase C activity. Thus, G alpha h represents a new class of GTP-binding proteins that participate in receptor signaling and may be a component of a complex regulatory network in which receptor-stimulated GTP binding switches the function of G alpha h from transglutamination to receptor signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2094895636,"Growth factors and cytokines are thought to influence the development of uncommitted progenitor cell populations, but the issue of how these factors act on individual cells remains controversial. Such factors may act simply as selective mitogens or survival factors for cells that undergo lineage restrictions stochastically. Alternatively, they may instruct or bias multipotent cells to choose one lineage at the expense of others. Here we show that glial growth factor (GGF), previously defined as a Schwann cell mitogen, strongly suppresses neuronal differentiation of rat neural crest stem cells while promoting or allowing glial differentiation. Quantitative clonal analysis suggests that the action of GGF is likely to be instructive rather than selective. Taken together with the expression pattern of GGF, these data suggest a lateral signaling model for the diversification of cell types within developing peripheral ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2003542304,"Long-term depression (LTD) is an activity-dependent decrease in synaptic efficacy that together with its counterpart, long-term potentiation, is thought to be an important cellular mechanism for learning and memory in the mammalian brain. The induction of LTD in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in neonatal rats is shown to depend on postsynaptic calcium ion entry through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels paired with the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Although induced postsynaptically, LTD is due to a long-term decrease in transmitter release from presynaptic terminals. This suggests that LTD is likely to require the production of a retrograde messenger."

https://openalex.org/W2079973734,"Spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) represent the second most common fatal autosomal recessive disorder after cystic fibrosis. Childhood spinal muscular atrophies are divided into severe (type I) and mild forms (types II and III). By a combination of genetic and physical mapping, a yeast artificial chromosome contig of the 5q13 region spanning the disease locus was constructed that showed the presence of low copy repeats in this region. Allele segregation was analyzed at the closest genetic loci detected by markers C212 and C272 in 201 SMA families. Inherited and de novo deletions were observed in nine unrelated SMA patients. Moreover, deletions were strongly suggested in at least 18 percent of SMA type I patients by the observation of marked heterozygosity deficiency for the loci studied. These results indicate that deletion events are statistically associated with the severe form of spinal muscular atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1550494424,"We have identified 20-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides which potently (IC50 values of 100-200 nM) and specifically inhibit protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha mRNA and protein expression in human lung carcinoma (A549) cells. These oligonucleotides target multiple, diverse sites on PKC-alpha mRNA including the AUG translation codon and 3'-untranslated sequences. 2'-O-Methyl phosphorothioate analogs of these oligonucleotides were without effect on PKC-alpha mRNA levels, suggesting that the reduction in targeted PKC-alpha mRNA is through RNase H-mediated cleavage. One oligonucleotide, however, was effective at inhibiting PKC-alpha protein levels as a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate at concentrations 2-3-fold greater than its phosphorothioate/deoxy homolog. These results suggest that the ability to serve as an RNase H substrate, although not required for all oligonucleotides, certainly increases their potency. These oligonucleotides have been used to examine the role played by PKC-alpha in mediating the phorbol ester-induced changes in mRNA levels of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1. In A549 cells, ICAM-1 mRNA is increased 10-20-fold by treatment of cells with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. When PKC-alpha protein levels are depleted by oligonucleotide treatment of A549 cells, the increase in ICAM-1 expression in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is greatly reduced, demonstrating that PKC-alpha plays a major role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2074235051,"Quantal analysis has provided evidence for a presynaptic contribution to long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 cells. This however leaves unexplained the observation that long-term potentiation has little or no effect on the NMDA receptor-mediated component of the synaptic signal. Here, I report that, in baseline conditions, the coefficient of variation of the AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated signal (CVA/K) is consistently larger than that of the NMDA component (CVNMDA), a result which can be explained if AMPA/kainate receptors are absent or nonfunctional at a proportion of synapses. Long-term potentiation is associated with a reduction in CVAK, but no change in either the average amplitude of the NMDA component or CVNMDA. This is consistent with the proposal that long-term potentiation induction uncovers clusters of latent AMPA/kainate receptors, with no change in transmitter release."

https://openalex.org/W1519949493,"To gain insight into the mechanisms which govern cellular identity in the intestinal epithelium we have begun a detailed study of the murine cdx-2 homeobox gene. We isolated and sequenced both cDNA and genomic clones in order to define the open reading frame and mature transcript. A detailed analysis of cdx-2 transcript levels late in embryogenesis showed that they increased 6-7-fold at a time when the gut undergoes a major developmental transition. In the adult, cdx-2 was expressed in colon in a region-specific manner with transcripts some 5-fold more abundant in the cecum as compared with the rectum. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical experiments showed cdx-2 transcripts and protein were present in all epithelial cells in the proximal colon irrespective of their degree of differentiation. In distal colon, however, transcripts were most abundant in undifferentiated cells at the bottom of crypts, whereas the highest protein levels were present in mature cells in the upper half of crypts. We conclude that cdx-2 is expressed specifically in gut epithelium where it is not restricted to a particular cell lineage. Rather, the rostrocaudal expression gradient suggests that it may play a role in specifying positional identity."
https://openalex.org/W1594394126,"Inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis or experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, are characterized by adhesion of lymphocytes on cerebral microvascular endothelium, followed by transendothelial migration into the brain parenchyma. T lymphocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells is mediated by several types of adhesion molecules, including the integrin leukocyte function-associated molecule 1 and its endothelial counter receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms that support lymphocyte extravasation, we intended to investigate a putative role of ICAM-1 in signal transduction in brain microvessel endothelial cells. Here we describe, using a well differentiated rat brain endothelial cell line (RBE4 cells), that ICAM-1 activation by a specific monoclonal antibody, or by syngeneic encephalitogenic T cells, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins together with stimulation of the tyrosine kinase p60src activity. One of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, of 85 kDa, has been identified by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, as the recently described actin-binding protein, p60src substrate, cortactin. These findings demonstrate that ICAM-1 activation transduces signals in brain endothelial cells, which may lead to cytoskeleton changes and transendothelial migration of lymphocytes into the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1536524213,"5-HT2C receptor antagonists, such as mianserin and mesulergine, exhibit negative intrinsic activity, defined as a decrease in agonist-independent, receptor-mediated, phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cells transfected with the 5-HT2C receptor cDNA. These drugs are classified as inverse agonists. Guanine nucleotides reciprocally modulate the binding of an agonist and inverse agonist, suggesting that an inverse agonist binds preferentially to the G protein-uncoupled form of the 5-HT2C receptor. Another 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide, functions as a neutral antagonist with no intrinsic activity, but is able to block both agonist and inverse agonist. Chronic treatment of choroid plexus cells with an inverse agonist, but not with the neutral antagonist, causes 5-HT2C receptor down-regulation, suggesting that the biological effects of 5-HT2C receptor antagonists are not solely due to antagonism of endogenous agonist. These results provide evidence that constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors are biologically significant. The functionally distinct properties of inverse agonists and neutral antagonists may elucidate the mechanisms controlling basal receptor activity states and lead to novel approaches in the development of therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1596053521,"We report the use of two independent new methods to measure the flexural rigidity of microtubules. Microtubules were grown off axonemal pieces adhering to a glass coverslip. In the first method, a hydrodynamic flow was applied to microtubules and the flexural rigidity was derived from the analysis of the bending shape of the microtubules at equilibrium in the flow. In the second method, the flexural rigidity was derived from the thermal fluctuations of the free end of axoneme-bound microtubules. With both methods, the flexural rigidity of standard GDP microtubules was estimated to be 0.85 +/- 0.2 x 10(-23) newtons x m2 which corresponded to a persistence length of 2 +/- 0.2 mm. Binding of ligands known to affect the biochemical properties of microtubules affected their rigidity. The structural analogs of inorganic phosphate AlF4- and [BeF3-, H2O], which bind to the site of the gamma-phosphate of GTP on GDP microtubule and reconstitute the GDP-Pi microtubule intermediate state of GTP hydrolysis, cause an approximately 3-fold increase in microtubule flexural rigidity and persistence length. Taxol and taxotere, antitumoral microtubule-stabilizing drugs, in contrast cause a decrease in flexural rigidity and appear to affect the three-dimensional superstructure of microtubules, which can no longer be considered as semi-flexible rods. The relationship between the mechanical properties of microtubules and their biological function is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1564205457,"It has previously been reported that alpha crystallin (alpha) a major lens protein composed of alpha A and alpha B subunits, can act as a chaperone interacting with other proteins to prevent heat-induced insolubilization. It is now shown that with gamma (gamma), beta L (beta L), and beta H (beta H), other major crystallin groups, this interaction occurs exclusively with soluble denatured protein. Based on studies primarily conducted with the gamma and the beta L crystallins, there is at least one binding site per alpha monomer (alpha m). This conclusion is derived from the following evidence. The binding of soluble denatured protein to alpha increases in a linear stoichiometric manner until a 1:1 ratio of alpha m to gamma or to the presumed (beta L)m is achieved. This is based upon determination of the apparent molecular weight of the alpha-denatured protein aggregate with a calibrated TSK-G4000 SW column and on the determination of the relative masses from the areas of the aggregate peak and those of the reactants. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirms that the aggregates contain the presumed components following reaction with either gamma, beta L, or beta H. Studies in which gamma or beta L crystallins have been independently heat denatured indicate that species representing 50% of the gamma population and 30% of beta L population have not heat denatured under the conditions employed. When the abundance of the denatured soluble protein exceeds that of the alpha subunits present in the macromolecular complex, further interaction occurs leading to a loss of solubility of the complex. A small increase in the size of the complex remaining in solution is also observed. The results contribute to understanding earlier observations that soluble native low molecular weight alpha species cannot be found in the inner regions of old human lenses but have shifted to large aggregates containing other crystallin components. The work tentatively suggests that the interaction rates of alpha with denatured soluble crystallins are gamma > beta L > beta H."
https://openalex.org/W1503657227,"Abstract Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is a beta 2 integrin that participates in a broad range of leukocyte functions through binding to its ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The location of the ICAM-1 binding site on LFA-1 is not known. approximately 200-amino acid inserted or domain, which is part of the beta 2 integrin alpha subunit, is homologous to the A domains found in the adhesive protein von Willebrand factor and in a number of other proteins. In von Willebrand factor, the domains are involved in ligand binding, but their function in the other proteins is still unclear. In this report, we show that the LFA-1 I domain contains a binding site for ICAM-1, which can be expressed as an isolated functional unit. The I domain contains the epitopes for 18 out of 20 anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies, many of which interfere with the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1. The I domain binds directly to purified recombinant ICAM-1 and also inhibits LFA-1-dependent T cell adhesion to ICAM-1. This report establishes the I domain as an ICAM-1 binding region in LFA-1 and the first ligand binding site to be identified in a beta 2 integrin."
https://openalex.org/W1503086187,"Many Oriental people possess a liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase where glutamate at position 487 has been replaced by a lysine, and they have very low levels of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. To investigate the cause of the lack of activity of this aldehyde dehydrogenase, we mutated residue 487 of rat and human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase to a lysine and expressed the mutant and native enzyme forms in Escherichia coli. Both rat and human recombinant aldehyde dehydrogenases showed the same molecular and kinetic properties as the enzyme isolated from liver mitochondria. The E487K mutants were found to be active but possessed altered kinetic properties when compared to the glutamate enzyme. The Km for NAD+ at pH 7.4 increased more than 150-fold, whereas kcat decreased 2-10-fold with respect to the recombinant native enzymes. Detailed steady-state kinetic analysis showed that the binding of NAD+ to the mutant enzyme was impaired, and it could be calculated that this resulted in a decreased nucleophilicity of the active site cysteine residue. The rate-limiting step for the rat E487K mutant was also different from that of the recombinant rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase in that no pre-steady-state burst of NADH formation was found with the mutant enzyme. Both the rat native enzyme and the E487K mutant oxidized chloroacetaldehyde twice as fast as acetaldehyde, indicating that the rate-limiting step was not hydride transfer or coenzyme dissociation but depended upon nucleophilic attack. Each enzyme form showed a 2-fold activation upon the addition of Mg2+ ions. Substituting a glutamine for the glutamate did not grossly affect the properties of the enzyme. Glutamate 487 may interact directly with the positive nicotinamide ring of NAD+ for the Ki of NADH was the same in the lysine enzyme as it was in the glutamate form. Because of the altered NAD+ binding properties and kcat of the E487K variant, it is assumed that people possessing this form will not have a functional mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1607672162,"Stimulation of guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A) by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is antagonized by activators of protein kinase C (PKC). Thus, it has been suggested that PKC phosphorylates and desensitizes GC-A. Here, we have developed stable GC-A transfectants of NIH3T3 cells, which display marked reductions in hormone-dependent cGMP elevations and guanylyl cyclase activity after incubation with ANP or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). ANP binding and immunoblot analysis indicated that the decreases were not due to receptor internalization or degradation. GC-A isolated from 32PO4-labeled cells contained phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. ANP and/or PMA addition caused substantial decreases in the 32P content of the receptor that coincided with reductions in hormone-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity. The specific PKC inhibitor, GF-109203X, completely blocked the PMA-dependent dephosphorylation and desensitization of GC-A but failed to inhibit either ANP-dependent process. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of GC-A isolated from ANP- or PMA-treated cells were unique, suggesting that the sites that dephosphorylated in response to each agent were different. In contrast to previous reports, we conclude that PMA and ANP desensitization of GC-A are distinct events mediated by dephosphorylation of specific residues through PKC-dependent and -independent pathways, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1539233028,"Oxyanions in the form of pentavalent antimony compounds are currently the drug of choice for treating leishmaniasis. Leishmania mutants resistant to high concentrations of the oxyanion arsenite were obtained in a stepwise selection procedure. Amplification of the H locus P-glycoprotein-related gene ltpgpA, as part of extrachromosomal circles, is a frequent event in arsenite-resistant cells, but was observed only in cells resistant to high concentrations of the metalloid salts. Revertants grown in the absence of the drug lost their ltpgpA-containing amplicon and part of their resistance. The results of previous transfection experiments in Leishmania had suggested that ltpgpA is only involved in low level resistance to arsenite and antimonite. The results of this study using transfection of ltpgpA alleles isolated from arsenite-resistant mutants or of whole circular amplicons containing ltpgpA demonstrate clearly that this P-glycoprotein-related gene is involved in low level resistance to oxyanions, including the pentavalent antimony-containing drug Pentostam. By site-directed mutagenesis, the LtpgpA protein was shown to require an intact nucleotide-binding site to confer arsenite resistance. Under the experimental conditions used, decreased accumulation of the 73AsO2- drug was not observed in the ltpgpA transfectants. One possibility is that LtpgpA-mediated arsenite resistance could result from sequestration of the toxic anion in an intracellular compartment. The results indicate that despite the fact that ltpgpA amplification is a frequent event in oxyanion-resistant mutants, it contributes only slightly to the overall resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1582134837,"Abstract Assembly of P pili on the surface of pyelonephritic Escherichia coli proceeds from periplasmic chaperone-subunit complexes. The outer membrane protein PapC, which has been termed a molecular usher, is thought to be the site of assembly, where the chaperone dissociates from the subunits as they are incorporated into the pilus across the outer membrane. The kinetics of assembly and the energy requirements of the events at the outer membrane were investigated using a pulse-chase analysis in which preformed labeled periplasmic chaperone-subunit complexes were assembled into pili in synchrony by the induction of PapC. Provided that a sufficient amount of PapC was present and functional in the outer membrane, the incorporation of the major PapA subunit into pili was shown to be completed in less than 5 min. Our results also indicated that the targeting of PapC to the outer membrane may be a rate-limiting factor for pilus assembly. Following the arrival of PapC, the formation of pili seemed to proceed spontaneously and was not sensitive to a pH shift or an inhibitor of the electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane. We suggest that the secretion of pili across the outer membrane may be independent of cellular energy and thermodynamically driven."
https://openalex.org/W1514281522,"Extracellular calcium (Cao) stimulates the differentiation of keratinocytes; 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 1,25(OH)2D3) does likewise. Since 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates calcium flux in other cells, we hypothesized that 1,25(OH)2D)3 acted through and promoted the effects of calcium on keratinocyte differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3 alone and in combination on the mRNA and protein levels of involucrin and transglutaminase in neonatal human keratinocytes. Cao alone increased these mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion (0.03 to 1.2 mM) over a 24-h period. This increase in mRNA levels was associated with a stimulation by calcium of involucrin and transglutaminase gene transcription. However, by 72 h, the mRNA levels of involucrin and transglutaminase decreased. At 0.03 mM Cao, 1,25(OH)2D3 showed a dose-dependent stimulation of involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA for up to 48 h and potentiated the initial (4-h) stimulation by Cao of involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA. As for calcium alone, this increase in mRNA was associated with an increase in transcription of the involucrin and transglutaminase genes. However, by 24 h of exposure to both calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3, a dose-dependent fall in mRNA levels was seen. The mRNA levels of involucrin and transglutaminase were stable for 24 h when neonatal human keratinocytes were grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium containing 0.03 or 1.2 mM Cao alone. However, the mRNAs of both genes underwent rapid degradation when neonatal human keratinocytes were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, especially in high Cao. 1,25(OH)2D3 and Cao increased the protein levels of involucrin and transglutaminase activity in a synergistic fashion throughout the 48-h time course. These data support the hypothesis that 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes calcium-induced differentiation at the level of both gene expression and mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1517080212,"HIV-infected individuals and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have, on the average, decreased plasma cysteine and cystine concentrations and decreased intracellular glutathione levels. We show that the cysteine supply and the intracellular glutathione levels have a strong influence on the T cell system, A study of healthy human subjects revealed that persons with intracellular glutathione levels of 20-30 nmol/mg protein had significantly higher numbers of CD4+ T cells than persons with either lower or higher glutathione levels. Persons who moved during a 4-weck observation period from the optimal to the suboptimal range (10-20 nmol/mg) experienced, on the average, a 30% decrease in CD4+ T cell numbers. This decrease was prevented by treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). NAC caused this relative increase of CD4+ T cell numbers in spite of decreasing glutathione levels and not by increasing the glutathione level. Our studies suggest that the immune system may be exquisitely sensitive not only against a cysteine and glutathione deficiency but also against an excess of cysteine.—Kinscherf, R., Fischbach, T., Mihm, S., Roth, S., Hohenhaus-Sievert, E., Weiss, C., Edler, L., Bärtsch, P., Dröge, W.

This provides the first unambiguous evidence for the involvement of pol delta in DNA repair synthesis. The mRNA levels of both pol delta and PCNA were significantly stimulated subsequent to UV irradiation of cultured cells, providing the first evidence that the cellular response to UV damage may involve regulation of pol delta and PCNA at the gene level. Thus, DNA polymerase delta and its accessory proteins, in addition to their function in replicative DNA synthesis, also function in DNA repair synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966375200,"In Drosophila, the misexpression or altered activity of genes from the bithorax complex results in homeotic transformations. One of these genes, abd-A, normally specifies the identity of the second through fourth abdominal segments (A2 to A4). In the dominant Hyperabdominal mutations (Hab), portions of the third thoracic segment (T3) are transformed toward A2 as the result of ectopic abd-A expression. Sequence analysis and deoxyribonuclease I footprinting demonstrate that the misexpression of abd-A in two independent Hab mutations results from the same single base change in a binding site for the gap gene Krüppel protein. These results establish that the spatial limits of the homeotic genes are directly regulated by gap gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1558170529,"The aim of this study was to examine whether interleukin-13 (IL-13), a cytokine with anti-inflammatory activities, affected expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors (R) in human polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). Treatment with IL-13 augmented both type I and type II (decoy) R transcripts, with the latter being by far the most represented. The transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D blocked the induction of IL-1 R mRNAs by IL-13. Nuclear run-off experiments demonstrated an augmented transcriptional rate of IL-1 decoy R in IL-13-treated B lymphoblastoid cells. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocked type I R expression but superinduced decoy R expression. IL-13 augmented the binding of radiolabeled IL-1 beta on the PMN surface with an increased number of IL-1 receptors and no change in Kd values. IL-13 induced the surface expression of IL-1 decoy R and the release by PMN of an IL-1-binding protein identified as a soluble version of the IL-1 decoy R. These results show that PMN is an important target for IL-13 and that induction of expression and release of the IL-1 decoy R, in concert with inhibition of cytokine synthesis, may represent an important mechanism by which IL-13 blocks IL-1, a central mediator of inflammatory reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1505753985,"Guanylyl cyclase (GC) C is a heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) receptor with a monomeric M(r) of approximately 140,000. We calculated from its hydrodynamic parameters that an active GC-C complex has a M(r) of 393,000, suggesting that GC-C is a trimer under native conditions. Both trimeric and dimeric GC-C complexes were detected by 125I-STa binding and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. The GC activity and STa binding from intestinal brush border membranes comigrated in gel filtration and velocity sedimentation with recombinant GC-C. However, 125I-STa cross-linking demonstrated that STa receptors with molecular masses of 52 and 74 kDa are non-covalently attached to GC in the intestine. Radiation inactivation revealed different functional sizes for basal GC activity, STa-stimulated GC activity, and STa binding (59, 210-240, and 32-52 kDa, respectively). At low radiation doses, basal GC activity was stimulated, suggesting that GC-C is inhibited by a relatively large, probably internal structure. These results suggest that STa may activate GC-C by promoting monomer-monomer interaction (internal dimerization) within a homotrimeric GC-C complex, and that GC-C is proteolytically modified in the brush border membrane but retains its function."

It is expressed principally by trophoblast cells and macrophages. PAI-2 in trophoblast membranes has been found cross-linked to large complexes apparently catalyzed by trophoblast transglutaminase (Jensen, P. H., Lorand, L., Ebbesen, P., and Gliemann, J. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 214, 141-146). Recombinant human PAI-2 was labeled with [14C]putrescine catalyzed by guinea pig liver transglutaminase. The [14C]putrescine-labeled PAI-2 was digested with cyanogen bromide and trypsin, and the peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance chromatography. Amino acid sequencing and plasma desorption mass spectrometry of the labeled peptides revealed [14C]putrescine incorporation at Gln83, Gln84, and Gln86. These residues are present in a PAI-2-specific region of 33 amino acids that is inserted between helices C and D and which probably represents a unique solvent-exposed domain. A PAI-2 mutant lacking this insertion was determined not to be a substrate for transglutaminase by [14C]putrescine incorporation and could not form transglutaminase-catalyzed polymers. Thus, the unique PAI-2 insertion represents a functional domain that, by virtue of its transglutaminase acceptor sites, allows participation in binding reactions without affecting the inhibitory function of PAI-2."
https://openalex.org/W1526866741,"Wild-type MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were cultured for 3 months in 1 microM benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and resistant clones were screened for inducibility of CYP1A1 gene expression by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). One of the BaP-resistant (BaPR) clones exhibited unique genotypic expression which distinguished it from both wild-type and drug-resistant (AdrR) variant MCF-7 cells. Glutathione levels, glutathione S-transferase activities, estrogen receptor levels, estrogen responsiveness, and expression of the multidrug-resistant MDR1 and MRP mRNA levels were similar in the wild-type and BaPR cells, whereas these parameters were reported to be altered in AdrR cells. In contrast, TCDD induced CYP1A1 gene expression and inhibited selected estrogen-induced responses in wild-type but not BaPR MCF-7 cells. Treatment of wild-type and BaPR cells with [3H]TCDD resulted in formation of the radiolabeled aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) 6 S nuclear receptor complex in both cell lines. The loss of Ah responsiveness in the BaPR variant cells correlated with the failure of the nuclear or transformed cytosolic Ah receptor complex to bind genomic dioxin-responsive elements as determined in gel retardation assays."

Spectral simulation based on Gaussian analyses and visible bands indicate that H2O2- and TBHP-induced intermediates' spectra of the wild type are close to that of Compound I of horseradish peroxidase, whereas TBHP- and CHP-induced intermediates' spectra of the mutants are close to that of Compound II of horseradish peroxidase. Based on kinetic parameters of the spectral changes, it is suggested that: 1) TBHP and CHP mainly form porphyrin+.FeIV = O due to heterolytic O-O scission in the wild type, while forming porphyrinFeIV = O for the mutants owing to homolytic O-O scission; and 2) heterolytic O-O scission of H2O2 is not changed by the mutations. Heterolytic/homolytic cleavage ratios for the P450 1A2 reactions with CHP obtained from product analysis were consistent with those obtained from spectral changes."
https://openalex.org/W1587605904,"Construction of a series of chimeric antibodies (murine variable region and human constant region) derived from the murine antibody BIRR1, which recognizes intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), has revealed differences in the relative binding abilities of the chimeric antibody to antigen. The chimeric antibodies show a ranking of their ability to compete with BIRR1 for antigen on the surface of cells with the order BIRR1 = cIgG1 (100%) > cIgG4 (30%) > cIgG2 (10%) as demonstrated by solid-phase competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Papain digestion yielded Fab fragments that were purified to homogeneity. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the chimeric and murine Fab binding constants were equivalent. A solution-phase binding assay (analyzed by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography) between the intact mAbs and recombinant soluble ICAM-1 further established that the binding constants involving the Fab arms of the two antibodies were equivalent. In summary, the murine and chimeric anti-ICAM-1 antibodies bind cellular ICAM-1 with equivalent affinities but with differing avidities."
https://openalex.org/W1546603420,"gamma-Glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) catalyzes a transpeptidation reaction which is involved in the metabolism of glutathione. Glutathione is abundant within the epithelial lining fluid of the lung. However, little is known about gamma-GT expression in the epithelial cells of the lung alveolus. Herein we show that the pulmonary alveolar epithelial type 2 cell expresses the gene for gamma-GT. We were unable to detect expression in the pulmonary alveolar epithelial type 1 cell or in the pulmonary alveolar macrophage. gamma-GT expression in the pulmonary alveolar epithelial type 2 cell is via mRNA III, a transcript that was initially cloned from the liver. This cell synthesizes gamma-GT protein and releases enzyme activity into a surfactant-associated pool within the lung alveolus. The specific activity of this surfactant-associated enzyme is almost 10-fold higher than that of whole lung. This activity results from amphipathic gamma-GT since it partitions with lung surfactant phospholipid and with the detergent phase of Triton X-114. Activity can be dissociated from each by papain proteolysis. These results demonstrate that gamma-GT is expressed in the differentiated pulmonary alveolar epithelial type 2 cell and that amphipathic gamma-GT protein is released by this cell along with lung surfactant. These results suggest that surfactant may serve an expanded role in lung cell biology as the vehicle for the redistribution of amphipathic signal anchored proteins throughout the gas exchange surface of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1531453124,"The yields of active dodecameric glutamine synthetase (GS) are significantly increased when in vitro folding is initiated in the presence of the Escherichia coli groE chaperonins and ATP (37 degrees C). To observe the effects of chaperonins and ATP on GS assembly, the GS assembly intermediates were separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, visualized by Western analysis, and studied as a function of time. The form of GS that was initially released from groEL is monomeric. After the monomers formed dimers, active GS oligomers were assembled by the association of assembly competent dimers with higher order even-numbered oligomers until the dodecamer was formed. When ATP was added to the groEL.GS complex (no groES), a groEL.GS complex remained visible for up to 30 min after the renaturation was initiated. This slow disappearance of the groEL.GS complex is consistent with observed lags in both the GS activity regain profile and the assembly-dependent increase in GS tryptophan fluorescence. When groES was present, the addition of ATP resulted in the disappearance of observable complex at early sample times ( or = 2 mM), the rates were identical. Since ATP hydrolysis is not absolutely required, the combined binding energies of groES and ATP (or ADP) appear to be sufficient to weaken the binding affinity of groEL for GS subunits and facilitate the release and refolding of assembly competent GS monomers from groEL."
https://openalex.org/W1600641729,"Abstract The P pilus is a composite consisting of a thin adhesive tip fibrillum joined to the pilus rod that mediates specific adherence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to human uroepithelial cells via the PapG tip adhesin. P pilus assembly depends upon the periplasmic chaperone PapD. The interaction of PapD with different pilus subunits was investigated to gain further insight into pilus assembly. PapA, the major subunit of the pilus rod, formed two periplasmic complexes (DA2 and DA) with PapD. PapK, an adaptor protein that joins the tip fibrillum to the pilus rod, formed only one complex with PapD (DK). Only fiber forming or homopolymeric subunits, PapA in the rod and PapE in the tip fibrillum, were able to form subunit-subunit interactions in the periplasm. Subunits that are present in single or low copy in the pilus (PapK and PapG) did not form periplasmic intersubunit interactions. A pulse-chase analysis revealed that a chaperone-PapA complex is a true periplasmic intermediate in pilus assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1905297632,"alpha-Crystallin, a major structural protein of the ocular lens of vertebrates, has been characterized recently as a molecular chaperone (Horwitz, J. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 10449-10453 and Jakob, U., Gaestel, M., Engel, K., and Buchner, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 1517-1520). While alpha-crystallins prevent the aggregation of various proteins denatured by heat or chaotropic agents, neither the mode of interaction between target proteins and alpha-crystallin nor the specific conformational requirements, if any, of the target protein are known. Here, we demonstrate that the ability of alpha-crystallin to prevent thermally induced aggregation of zeta-crystallin/NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase, an abundant crystallin of guinea pigs and camelids, is strongly dependent on the presence of the obligate cofactor (NADPH) of the target enzyme. zeta-crystallin in the absence of NADPH is readily aggregated at 41 degrees C, and alpha-crystallin added at a 1:1 (w/w) ratio offers very little protection. In contrast, in the presence of NADPH zeta-crystallin remains stable to 45 degrees C and with the addition of alpha-crystallin (1:1 (w/w)) is protected from aggregation even at 55 degrees C. Cibacron blue 3GA, a nonmetabolized pyridine nucleotide analog, which has very high binding affinity to zeta-crystallin had similar effects. NADH and NAD+, which are not bound by zeta-crystallin, had no such effect. Complex formation between alpha-crystallin and non-native zeta-crystallin was demonstrated in the presence of either cibacron blue 3GA or NADPH. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of zeta-crystallin in the presence and absence of NADPH or cibacron blue indicated that nucleotide binding was accompanied by a change in the protein's aromatic amino acid environment but that the secondary structure was unaffected. The data suggest that subtle change in the conformation of denaturing proteins can markedly affect the ability of alpha-crystallin to protect them from aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1572721033,"gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is an enzyme encoded by multiple mRNAs (mRNAI to mRNAIV) that, in the rat, are transcribed from a single copy gene in a tissue-specific manner. In the liver, GGT expression is up-regulated in transformed cells, and this induction is the most widely used marker of liver cell transformation. We characterized the GGT mRNA species expressed in the liver (mRNAIII), and we report that this mRNA differs from the other GGT mRNA species by a 275-base alternate 5'-end sequence. Its transcription occurs on a specific promoter (promoter III) that maps on the GGT gene upstream of the two promoters coding for the GGT mRNAI and mRNAII. In hepatoma cells, mRNAIII expression is related to the differentiation state of the cells. We have shown that, in Reuber H-35-derived cell lines, the GGT mRNAIII is transcribed in cells that express a differentiated phenotype (Fao), but not in the dedifferentiated C2 and H5 variants. Moreover, we observed a reexpression of the GGT mRNAIII species in the C2 Rev7 variant, which has reverted from C2 toward a differentiated hepatocyte phenotype. In the proximal promoter III region, we identified a sequence that strongly enhances transcriptional activity in Fao and C2 Rev7 cells, but not in the dedifferentiated C2 variant. This motif interacts with nuclear proteins belonging to the NF-1 and NF-Y families that govern GGT promoter III expression in differentiated hepatoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581973531,"The prion protein (PrP) displays some unusual features in its biogenesis. In cell-free systems it can be synthesized as either an integral transmembrane protein spanning the membrane twice, with both amino and carboxyl domains in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, or as a fully translocated polypeptide. A charged, extracytoplasmic region, termed the Stop Transfer Effector (STE) sequence, has been shown to direct the nascent translocating chain to stop at the adjoining hydrophobic domain to generate the first membrane-spanning region (TM1). However, the determinants of the second translocation event in the biogenesis of the transmembrane form have not been identified previously. Moreover, the relationship of transmembrane and fully translocated forms of PrP has not been well understood. Here, we report progress in resolving both of these issues. Using protein chimeras in cell-free translation systems and Xenopus oocytes, we identify the sequence which directs nascent PrP to span the membrane a second time, with its carboxyl-terminal domain in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Surprisingly, PrP carboxyl-terminal domain translocation does not appear to be directed by an internal signal or signal-anchor sequence located downstream of TM1, as would have been expected from studies of other multispanning membrane proteins. Rather, carboxyl-terminal domain translocation appears to be another consequence of the action of STE-TM1, that is, the same sequence responsible for generating the first membrane-spanning region. Studies of an STE-TM1-containing protein chimera in Xenopus oocytes demonstrate that most of these chains upon completion of their translation, initially span the membrane twice, with a topology similar to that of transmembrane PrP, but are carbonate-extractable. These chains have the transmembrane orientation only transiently and chase into a fully translocated form. These results support a model in which a metastable “transmembrane” intermediate, residing within the aqueous environment of the translocation channel, can be converted into either the integrated transmembrane or the fully translocated form of PrP, perhaps directed by trans-acting factor (s). Such a model may explain why stable the transmembrane isoform of PrP has not been observed in normal cells and how nascent PrP might be directed to alternate pathways of folding."
https://openalex.org/W1588362530,"The isoprenoid pathway leads to various essential non-sterol products in insects. These end products have a crucial role in growth, differentiation, sexual maturation, and reproduction. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase (EC 4.1.3.5.) has generally been considered one of the committed steps of the pathway. We had previously reported the cloning of a cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase cDNA in Blattella germanica; we have now isolated and characterized a new cDNA clone for HMG-CoA synthase in this insect. Analysis of this 1716-base pair cDNA reveals a deduced protein of 455 residues with a molecular mass of 51,424 Da. The two HMG-CoA synthases have 69% identical amino acid residues, and both lack an N-terminal leader peptide to target the protein into mitochondria. This HMG-CoA synthase cDNA can revert the Chinese hamster ovary-K1-derived cell line, Mev-1, which is a defective mutant for HMG-CoA synthase. Both HMG-CoA synthase genes are expressed differently throughout development. Analysis of adult tissues shows higher expression in ovary and fat body. The expression of HMG-CoA synthase (EC 4.1.3.5.) and reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) genes during the gonadotrophic cycle in B. germanica shows that the three genes of the isoprenoid pathway are developmentally regulated in the ovary."
https://openalex.org/W139778603,"An endogenous inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase from bovine lung has been partially purified by use of anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration chromatography. This inhibitor is a protein with a molecular weight of about 149,000 which was estimated from its elution behavior, versus that of a series of standards, on a Sephacryl S-300-HR column. Its activity was measured by comparison of the level of cGMP production from soluble guanylyl cyclase in the presence and absence of the inhibitor protein. Soluble guanylyl cyclase is inhibited by this protein when either Mg2+ or Mn2+ is used as a cofactor. The insensitivity of its inhibitory activity to both isobutylmethylxanthine and the presence of cGMP demonstrates that this new protein is not a phosphodiesterase. This new protein inhibits both activated and unactivated soluble guanylyl cyclase. Because the inhibition was found to be noncompetitive with respect to the substrate, GTP, it appears that this inhibitor may be an allosteric regulator of soluble guanylyl cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1608409978,"The multidrug resistance transporter is an integral membrane protein, termed P-glycoprotein, which can function as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump to reduce intracellular drug accumulation in treated cells. The physiologic function of this protein in normal cells, however, is not completely understood. We report here that prenylcysteine methyl esters, which represent the C-terminal structures of prenylated proteins, both stimulate the transporter's intrinsic ATPase activity and compete for drug binding. The structural elements of prenylcysteine methyl esters involved in their interaction with P-glycoprotein include the isoprenoid moiety, the carboxyl methyl group, and the free amino group. These findings indicate that these molecules are potential physiologic ligands of the transporter. Furthermore, as the structures of the active prenylcysteines are distinct from the known substrates of P-glycoprotein, this information may facilitate design of novel inhibitors of the transporter."

Re-RC-160 yields the same average solution conformation as does the apo form with an antiparallel beta-sheet fold and a type II' beta-turn centered at D-Trp4-Lys5. These results indicate that the spatial topography of the side chains essential for somatostatin receptor binding is maintained in Re-RC-160."
https://openalex.org/W1490506565,"D-Amino-acid oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of D-amino acids to imino acids. In the oxidative half-reaction, oxygen reacts with the reduced enzyme-imino acid complex to reoxidize the bound FAD. This is then followed by dissociation of the imino acid. The effects of pH and D2O on the kinetics of the oxidative half-reaction of D-amino-acid oxidase have been determined with glycine, D-alanine, and D-serine as substrates. Reaction of the reduced enzyme with oxygen requires that a group with a pKa value of about 10.5 be protonated and a group with a pKa value of 8.5 be deprotonated. The former value is not seen with D-alanine as substrate; the latter is only seen with glycine. No solvent isotope effects are seen on the V/KO2 value with D-alanine, consistent with rate-limiting electron transfer. Product release involves a pH-dependent conformational change. This is rate-limiting at all pH values with D-alanine as substrate. Significant solvent isotope effects are seen on the Vmax value with D-alanine. The proton inventory at high pH is linear, consistent with release of a single proton in the slow step; at pH 6 the solvent inventory is bowl-shaped, consistent with a solvent isotope effect on the conformation of the protein. With glycine the DV value increases to the intrinsic value at pH 10.5; this establishes that CH bond cleavage becomes rate-limiting with this substrate above pH 10."
https://openalex.org/W1583395840,"Antibodies raised against two synthetic peptides from rat liver F1-ATPase alpha-subunit sequence recognized two main heat-shock proteins from Drosophila (p71 and p56) and rat liver (p74 and p54) cells. One of the antisera showed a 20-fold higher reactivity toward Escherichia coli GroEL chaperonin than toward the alpha-subunit purified from Drosophila. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation experiments located both mammalian heat-shock proteins in the mitochondria. The recent findings of functional homology between chaperonins and alpha-subunits, together with the unsuspected immunological reactivity of two mitochondrial molecular chaperones toward antisera derived from two different sequence motifs of the alpha-subunit, strongly argue in favor of the existence of an evolutionary relationship between chaperonins and alpha-subunits. The complete sequence alignment of F-type ATPase alpha-subunits and chaperonins revealed the existence of eleven most conserved regions (approximately 30% of each protein sequence) with an overall amino acid identity of 20 +/- 2% and similarity of 39 +/- 4%. A search of protein data bases with three different consensus sequences derived from this alignment identified a significant proportion of proteins belonging only to these two protein families. Since the alpha-subunit protein family is evolutionary related to the other catalytic (A and beta) and regulatory (B) subunits of V- and F-type ATPases, the homology reported herein allowed us to analyze, in the chaperonin sequences, the conservation of critical residues involved in nucleotide binding. These data support the hypothesis that chaperonins and the major subunits of V- and F-type ATPases are evolutionary related."
https://openalex.org/W1520850203,"A previous study (Govezensky, D., Greener, T., and Zamir, A. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 20, 6339-6346) indicated that the chaperonin GroEL was required for maximal expression from nif promoters in Klebsiella pneumoniae and nif-transformed Escherichia coli. That this requirement stemmed from the ability of GroEL to properly fold NifA, the nif transcriptional activator, was first supported by co-immunoprecipitation of NifA in K. pneumoniae extracts with anti-GroEL antibodies. In the present in vitro study, NifA, partially purified from E. coli overexpressing the protein, was diluted from a 6 M urea solution into a refolding buffer in the presence or absence of GroEL. Dilution in the absence of GroEL caused the complete precipitation of NifA. When present in the dilution buffer, GroEL bound NifA and maintained it in a soluble state. GroEL was also found to bind NifA newly synthesized in an in vitro translation system. For both NifA preparations, cochaperonin GroES and ATP promoted release of NifA from GroEL. These results provide evidence for the association of NifA with GroEL and for the role of both GroEL and GroES in the solubilization and thereby folding of the nif transcriptional activator."
https://openalex.org/W1537767353,"Amplification and overexpression of the c-erbB-2 gene appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of human breast and other cancers. Frequent amplification (20-30%) of the c-erbB-2 gene was observed in human adenocarcinomas of kidney, pancreas, lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. The gene product is a 185-kDa glycoprotein that has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and is believed to be a receptor. Several candidate ligands have been described. In the present study we have identified and purified a novel DNA-binding protein from malignant human breast tissues. The protein binds to a core element (-22 to +9, +1 being the transcription start site) of the c-erbB-2 promoter region in a sequence-specific manner. The affinity-purified protein has the ability to induce DNA synthesis in quiescent NIH/3T3 cells, suggesting that the factor has mitogenic activity. The purified protein induces c-erbB-2 expression on the surface of microinjected NIH/3T3 cells. This DNA-binding protein is a sequence-specific cellular factor that is associated with high level expression of the c-erbB-2 gene and appears to play a role in cell transformation. Understanding the control and expression of this DNA-binding protein may shed light on the mechanism(s) of c-erbB-2 gene regulation and its potential role in the pathogenesis of human adenocarcinomas."
