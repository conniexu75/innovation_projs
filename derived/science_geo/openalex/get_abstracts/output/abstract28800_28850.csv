https://openalex.org/W2079321730,"High-affinity nucleic acid ligands for a protein were isolated by a procedure that depends on alternate cycles of ligand selection from pools of variant sequences and amplification of the bound species. Multiple rounds exponentially enrich the population for the highest affinity species that can be clonally isolated and characterized. In particular one eight-base region of an RNA that interacts with the T4 DNA polymerase was chosen and randomized. Two different sequences were selected by this procedure from the calculated pool of 65,536 species. One is the wild-type sequence found in the bacteriophage mRNA; one is varied from wild type at four positions. The binding constants of these two RNA's to T4 DNA polymerase are equivalent. These protocols with minimal modification can yield high-affinity ligands for any protein that binds nucleic acids as part of its function; high-affinity ligands could conceivably be developed for any target molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2069366448,"A two-fold (C2) symmetric inhibitor of the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) has been designed on the basis of the three-dimensional symmetry of the enzyme active site. The symmetric molecule inhibited both protease activity and acute HIV-1 infection in vitro, was at least 10,000-fold more potent against HIV-1 protease than against related enzymes, and appeared to be stable to degradative enzymes. The 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the inhibitor-enzyme complex demonstrated that the inhibitor binds to the enzyme in a highly symmetric fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1964688185,"After actively entering its host cells, the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii resides in an intracellular vacuole that is completely unable to fuse with other endocytic or biosynthetic organelles. The fusion blocking requires entry of viable organisms but is irreversible: fusion competence of the vacuole is not restored if the parasite is killed after entry. The fusion block can be overcome, however, by altering the parasite's route of entry. Thus, phagocytosis of viable antibody-coated T. gondii by Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with macrophage-lymphocyte Fc receptors results in the formation of vacuoles that are capable of both fusion and acidification. Phagocytosis and fusion appear to involve a domain of the Fc receptor cytoplasmic tail distinct from that required for localization at clathrin-coated pits. These results suggest that the mechanism of fusion inhibition is likely to reflect a modification of the vacuole membrane at the time of its formation, as opposed to the secretion of a soluble inhibitor by the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1506981847,"Acute exercise, like insulin, increases D-glucose uptake into rat hind limb muscles. Here we examine the distribution of the muscle glucose transporters GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 in plasma membrane and intracellular membrane fractions of skeletal muscle prepared from control, exercised, and acutely insulin-treated rats. Immunoblotting with an anti-GLUT-4 polyclonal antibody showed that acute insulin treatment (by hind limb perfusion or in vivo injection) increased GLUT-4 transporters in a plasma membrane fraction and decreased them in an intracellular membrane fraction. Exercise also increased the GLUT-4 transporters in the plasma membrane, but in contrast to insulin, did not significantly decrease them in the intracellular fraction. Immunoblotting with anti-GLUT-1 antibody revealed that this transporter is largely localized in the plasma membrane. Neither insulin nor exercise significantly increased GLUT-1 transporters in the plasma membrane. The data show that GLUT-4 is an insulin-responsive glucose transporter in skeletal muscle and, furthermore, that GLUT-4 also responds to acute exercise. The results are consistent with recruitment of GLUT-4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores. Moreover, exercise-sensitive GLUT-4 transporters do not originate from the insulin-sensitive intracellular membrane fraction, suggesting the existence of distinct intracellular insulin- and exercise-recruitable GLUT-4 transporter pools."
https://openalex.org/W1997721662,"The string (stg) locus of Drosophila encodes a factor that is thought to trigger mitosis by activating the p34cdc2 protein kinase. stg is required for mitosis early in development and is transcribed in a dynamic pattern that anticipates the pattern of embryonic cell divisions. Here we show that differential cell cycle regulation during postblastoderm development (cell cycles 14–16) occurs in G2. We demonstrate that stg mRNA expressed from a heat shock promotor triggers mitosis, and an associated S phase, in G2 cells during these cycles. Hence, differential cell cycle timing at this developmental stage is controlled by stg. Finally, we use heat-induced stg expression to alter the normal pattern of embryonic mitoses. Surprisingly, the complex mitotic pattern evident during normal development is not essential for many features of pattern formation or for viability."
https://openalex.org/W2085450869,"MHC class I molecules devoid of peptide are expressed on the cell surface of the mouse mutant lymphoma cell line RMA-S upon culture at reduced temperature. Empty class I molecules are thermolabile at the cell surface and in detergent lysates, but can be stabilized by the addition of presentable peptide; peptide binding appears to be a rapid process. Furthermore, class I molecules on the surface of RMA-S (H-2b haplotype) cells cultured at 26 degrees C can efficiently and specifically bind iodinated peptide presented by H-2Kb. Binding of iodinated peptide is also observed at a lower level for nonmutant cells (RMA) cultured at 26 degrees C. These experiments underscore the role for peptide in maintenance of the structure of class I molecules and, more importantly, provide two assay systems to study the interactions of peptides with MHC class I molecules independent of the availability of T cells that recognize a particular peptide-MHC class I complex."
https://openalex.org/W2036277985,"The X-ray structures of the guanine nucleotide binding domains (amino acids 1-166) of five mutants of the H-ras oncogene product p21 were determined. The mutations described are Gly-12----Arg, Gly-12----Val, Gln-61----His, Gln-61----Leu, which are all oncogenic, and the effector region mutant Asp-38----Glu. The resolutions of the crystal structures range from 2.0 to 2.6 A. Cellular and mutant p21 proteins are almost identical, and the only significant differences are seen in loop L4 and in the vicinity of the gamma-phosphate. For the Gly-12 mutants the larger side chains interfere with GTP binding and/or hydrolysis. Gln-61 in cellular p21 adopts a conformation where it is able to catalyze GTP hydrolysis. This conformation has not been found for the mutants of Gln-61. Furthermore, Leu-61 cannot activate the nucleophilic water because of the chemical nature of its side chain. The D38E mutation preserves its ability to bind GAP."
https://openalex.org/W2053053546,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently causes neurological dysfunction and is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with HIV encephalitis or myelopathy. The virus is found mostly in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage within the CNS, but the possibility of infection of other glial cells has been raised. Therefore, the effects of different HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains were studied in primary cultures of adult human brain containing microglial cells, the resident CNS macrophages, and astrocytes. These cultures could be productively infected with macrophage-adapted HIV-1 isolates but not with T lymphocyte-adapted HIV-1 isolates or two HIV-2 isolates. As determined with a triple-label procedure, primary astrocytes did not express HIV gag antigens and remained normal throughout the 3-week course of infection. In contrast, virus replicated in neighboring microglial cells, often leading to their cell fusion and death. The death of microglial cells, which normally serve immune functions in the CNS, may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalitis or myelopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1982641454,"We have used monolayers of control 3T3 cells and 3T3 cells transfected with a cDNA encoding human N-CAM as a culture substrate for embryonic chick retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). At embryonic day 6 (E6), but not at Ell, RGCs extended longer neurites on monolayers of N-CAM-transfected cells. This loss of RGC responsiveness was not associated with substantial changes in the level of N-CAM expression on RGC growth cones. The neurite outgrowth response from E6 RGCs could be inhibited by removal of N-CAM from the monolayer, by removal of α2–8-linked polysialic acid from neuronal N-CAM, or by antibodies that bind exclusively to chick (neuronal) N-CAM. In contrast, the response was not dependent on neuronal (31 integrin function. These data provide substantive evidence for a homophilic binding mechanism directly mediating N-CAM-dependent neurite outgrowth, and suggest that changes in polysialic acid expression on neuronal N-CAM may modulate N-CAM-dependent axonal growth during development."
https://openalex.org/W2001610972,"The transcriptional induction of heat shock genes in eukaryotes is mediated by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF). In yeast, this induction appears to involve the phosphorylation of DNA-bound factor. I report here that HSF contains two distinct transcriptional activation regions. In response to a temperature upshift, an N-terminal region mediates transient increases in HSF activity and a C-terminal region is essential for sustained increases. These sustained and transient activities are regulated over different temperature ranges, and increases in both are associated with rises in the level of HSF phosphorylation. I propose that the two HSF activation regions are regulated independently in response to different stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1606032544,"A synthetic gene encoding horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme C (HRP C) has been synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nonglycosylated recombinant enzyme (HRP C*) was produced in inclusion bodies in an insoluble inactive form containing only traces of heme. HRP C* was solubilized and conditions under which it folded to give active enzyme were determined. Folding was shown to be critically dependent upon the concentrations of urea, Ca2+, and heme and on oxidation by oxidized glutathione. Purification of active HRP C* from the folding mixture gave a peroxidase, with about half the activity of HRP C. Glycosylation is thus not essential for correct folding and activity. The C-terminal and N-terminal extensions to HRP identified previously in cloned cDNA sequences are also not required for correct folding. However, Ca2+ appears to play a key role in folding to give the active enzyme. The overall yield of purified active enzyme was 2-3%, but this could be increased by reprocessing material that precipitated during folding."
https://openalex.org/W2078406153,"Replication of HIV-1 requires Tat, which stimulates gene expression through a target sequence, TAR. It is known that TAR is a Tat-responsive target. Since Tat increases transcriptional initiations from the HIV-1 LTR promoter, it is unclear mechanistically how Tat utilizes an RNA target. Here we show that TAR RNA is only one component of the Tat-responsive target. Efficient Tat trans-activation was observed only when TAR was present in conjunction with the HIV-1 LTR NF-kappa B/SP1 DNA sequences. TAR RNA outside of this context produced a suboptimal Tat response. We propose that TAR RNA serves an attachment function directing Tat to the LTR. A Tat protein engineered to interact with LTR DNA could trans-activate through a TAR-independent mechanism. This suggests that Tat also has a DNA target."
https://openalex.org/W1526233070,"The amounts of the brain type and muscle type glucose transporters (designated Glut 1 and 4, respectively) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes have been determined by quantitative immunoblotting with antibodies against their carboxyl-terminal peptides. There are about 950,000 and 280,000 copies of Glut 1 and 4, respectively, per cell. Insulin caused the translocation of both types of transporters from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane. The insulin-elicited increase in cell surface transporters was assessed by labeling the surface transporters with a newly developed, membrane-impermeant, photoaffinity labeling reagent for glucose transporters. The increases in Glut 1 and 4 averaged 6.5- and 17-fold, respectively, whereas there was a 21-fold in hexose transport. These results indicate that the translocation of Glut 4 could largely account for the insulin effect on transport rate, but only if the intrinsic activity of Glut 4 is much higher than that of Glut 1. The two transporters are colocalized intracellularly: vesicles (average diameter 72 nm) isolated from the intracellular membranes by immunoadsorption with antibodies against Glut 1 contained 95% of the Glut 4 and, conversely, vesicles isolated with antibodies against Glut 4 contained 85% of the Glut 1."
https://openalex.org/W1536076490,"Endothelins 1-3 are a family of 21-amino acid peptides whose structure consists of two rings formed by intra-chain disulfide bonds and a linear tail. These peptides were originally described on the basis of their potent vasoconstrictor activity. The hydrolytic inactivation of endothelin action has recently been implicated to be attributed, at least in part, to the enzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (Scicli, A. G., Vijayaraghavan, J., Hersh, L., and Carretero, O. (1989) Hypertension 14, 353). The kinetic properties and mode of hydrolysis of the endothelins by this enzyme are reported in this study. The Km for endothelins 1 and 3 hydrolysis is approximately 2 microM while endothelin2 exhibits a 5-fold higher Km. Endothelins 1 and 2 exhibit similar Vmax values while endothelin3 is hydrolyzed considerably more slowly. The initial cleavage site in endothelin1 is at the Ser5-Leu6 bond located within one of the cyclic structures. Thermolysin, a bacterial neutral endopeptidase with a similar substrate specificity to neutral endopeptidase 24.11 initially cleaves endothelin1 between His16-Leu17 which lies within the COOH-terminal linear portion of the molecule. The cleavage of endothelins 2 and 3 by neutral endopeptidase 24.11 differs from that observed with endothelin1 in that cleavage of these endothelins occurs at Asp18-Ile19 within the linear COOH-terminal tail structure. These results demonstrate that the endothelins are good substrates for neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and suggest that their mode of cleavage is dependent upon both amino acid sequence as well as peptide conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1488647821,"We established an experimental system for measuring the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells using fura-2 as a Ca2(+)-specific probe in conjunction with digital image processing and examined changes in [Ca2+]i in response to alpha-factor in single cells of a mating type. The addition of alpha-factor to a cells raised [Ca2+]i to several hundred nanomolar in the cells from a basal level of approximately 100 nM, simultaneous with the induction of Ca2+ influx. When the cells were incubated with alpha-factor in a Ca2(+)-deficient medium, Ca2+ influx was greatly reduced, and the rise in [Ca2+]i was not detected. This indicates that the alpha-factor-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is generated by Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane and not by release from internal stores. In the Ca2(+)-deficient medium, a cells died specifically after they had changed into cells with one projection on the cell surface. This indicates that the rise in [Ca2+]i is essential for the late response to alpha-factor. The duration of Ca2+ requirement for maintaining viability was limited to this stage, and the earlier and later stages were not affected by Ca2+ deprivation. Mating between a and alpha mating type cells was impaired in this medium due to cell death at and before the stage of conjugation. These findings are the first evidence for an essential role for mobilized Ca2+ in the yeast life cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1972260692,"Transcription of heat shock genes is induced by exposure of cells to elevated temperatures or other stress conditions. In yeast, it is thought that induction of transcription is mediated by conversion of a DNA-bound transcriptionally inactive form of the heat shock transcription factor (HSTF) to a DNA-bound transcriptionally active form. We have identified domains in HSTF involved in transcriptional activation and in repression of transcriptional activation at non-shock temperatures. We present evidence that a temperature-regulated transcriptional activation domain exists in HSTF and that this domain is essential for survival of yeast cells at heat shock temperatures. We propose a model for temperature-regulated transcriptional activation by a derepression mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1608869439,"The fidelity of DNA synthesis by an exonuclease-proficient DNA polymerase results from the selectivity of the polymerization reaction and from exonucleolytic proofreading. We have examined the contribution of these two steps to the fidelity of DNA synthesis catalyzed by the large Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, using enzymes engineered by site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the proofreading exonuclease. Measurements with two mutant Klenow polymerases lacking exonuclease activity but retaining normal polymerase activity and protein structure demonstrate that the base substitution fidelity of polymerization averages one error for each 10,000 to 40,000 bases polymerized, and can vary more than 30-fold depending on the mispair and its position. Steady-state enzyme kinetic measurements of selectivity at the initial insertion step by the exonuclease-deficient polymerase demonstrate differences in both the Km and the Vmax for incorrect versus correct nucleotides. Exonucleolytic proofreading by the wild-type enzyme improves the average base substitution fidelity by 4- to 7-fold, reflecting efficient proofreading of some mispairs and less efficient proofreading of others. The wild-type polymerase is highly accurate for -1 base frameshift errors, with an error rate of less than or equal to 10(-6). The exonuclease-deficient polymerase is less accurate, suggesting that proofreading also enhances frameshift fidelity. Even without a proofreading exonuclease, Klenow polymerase has high frameshift fidelity relative to several other DNA polymerases, including eucaryotic DNA polymerase-alpha, an exonuclease-deficient, 4-subunit complex whose catalytic subunit is almost three times larger. The Klenow polymerase has a large (46 kDa) domain containing the polymerase active site and a smaller (22 kDa) domain containing the active site for the 3'----5' exonuclease. Upon removal of the small domain, the large polymerase domain has altered base substitution error specificity when compared to the two-domain but exonuclease-deficient enzyme. It is also less accurate for -1 base errors at reiterated template nucleotides and for a 276-nucleotide deletion error. Thus, removal of a protein domain of a DNA polymerase can affect its fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2140685580,"Ryanodine binding proteins of the CNS have been identified using monoclonal antibodies against avian skeletal muscle ryanodine binding proteins. These proteins were localized to intracellular membranes of the dendrites, perikarya, and axons of cerebellar Purkinje neurons using laser confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy. Ryanodine binding proteins were not found in dendritic spines. Immunoprecipitation and [3H]epiryanodine binding experiments revealed that the cerebellar ryanodine binding proteins have a native molecular weight of ∼2000 kd and are composed of two high molecular weight ∼500 kd) polypeptide subunits. A comparable protein having a single high molecular weight polypeptide subunit was observed in the remainder of the brain. If the ryanodine binding proteins in muscle and nerve are similar in function, then the neuronal proteins may participate in the release of calcium from intracellular stores that are mechanistically and spatially distinct from those gated by inositol trisphosphate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1624941700,"We have investigated effects of monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) on the uptake of acetylated low density lipoproteins (acetyl-LDL) and the activity of cholesterol esterification in human monocyte-derived macrophage. The cells were cultured with M-CSF for 10 days and then incubated with acetyl-LDL for 24 h. M-CSF (128 ng/ml) enhanced the uptake and degradation of 10 micrograms/ml of 125I-acetyl LDL 7.5-fold (n = 6) and the effect of M-CSF was dose-dependent at the concentrations of 0.5-32 ng/ml. The binding experiments at 4 degrees C demonstrated that the number of acetyl-LDL receptor was increased by the addition of M-CSF. Supporting this, ligand blotting analysis revealed a significant increase in a receptor protein for acetyl-LDL (240 kDa). Binding of LDL was also enhanced by M-CSF but less significantly than that of acetyl-LDL. Cellular cholesterol esterification in the presence of 10 micrograms/ml acetyl-LDL was enhanced 24.1-fold (n = 13) by 128 ng/ml M-CSF. It was evident that M-CSF enhanced cholesterol esterification to a greater extent than the cellular uptake of acetyl-LDL (24.1- versus 7.5-fold). Cholesterol esterification was also enhanced by the addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 1. We conclude that M-CSF enhances the uptake of both acetyl-LDL and LDL by increasing their receptor number, and further enhances the process of cholesterol esterification, resulting in a remarkable increase in cholesterol esterification in macrophages. These findings strongly suggest the significant involvement of cytokines such as M-CSF in cholesterol metabolism of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1728402667,"An in vitro translation system using lysed etioplasts was developed to test if the accumulation of plastid-encoded chlorophyll a apoproteins is dependent on the de novo synthesis of chlorophyll a. The P700 apoproteins, CP47 and CP43, were not radiolabeled in pulsechase translation assays employing lysed etioplasts in the absence of added chlorophyll precursors. When chlorophyllide a plus phytylpyrophosphate were added to lysed etioplast translation assays in the dark, chlorophyll a was synthesized and radiolabeled P700 apoproteins, CP47 and CP43, and a protein which comigrates with D1 accumulated. Chlorophyllide a or phytylpyrophosphate added separately to the translation assay in darkness did not induce chlorophyll a formation or chlorophyll a apoprotein accumulation. Chlorophyll a formation and chlorophyll a apoprotein accumulation were also induced in the lysed etioplast translation system by the photoreduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide a in the presence of exogenous phytylpyrophosphate. Accumulation of radiolabeled CP47 was detectable when very low levels of chlorophyll a were synthesized de novo (less than 0.01 nmol/10(7) plastids), and radiolabel increased linearly with increasing de novo chlorophyll a formation. Higher levels of de novo synthesized chlorophyll a were required prior to detection of radiolabel incorporation into the P700 apoproteins and CP43 (greater than 0.01 nmol/10(7) plastids). Radiolabel incorporation into the P700 apoproteins, CP47 and CP43, saturated at a chlorophyll a concentration which corresponds to 50% of the etioplast protochlorophyllide content (0.06 nmol of chlorophyll a/10(7) plastids)."

https://openalex.org/W1497790249,"The combined activities of rabbit liver cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase and C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase convert tetrahydrofolate and formate to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. In this reaction C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase converts tetrahydrofolate and formate to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, which is hydrolyzed to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase-glycine complex. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase, in the presence of glycine, catalyzes the conversion of chemically synthesized 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate with biphasic kinetics. There is a rapid burst of product that has a half-life of formation of 0.4 s followed by a slower phase with a completion time of about 1 h. The substrate for the burst phase of the reaction was shown not to be 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate but rather a one-carbon derivative of tetrahydrofolate which exists in the presence of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. This derivative is stable at pH 7 and is not an intermediate in the hydrolysis of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate by C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase. Cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate 15-fold faster than the hydrolysis of the monoglutamate derivative. The pentaglutamate derivative of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate binds tightly to serine hydroxymethyltransferase and dissociates slowly with a half-life of 16 s. Both rabbit liver mitochondrial and Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyze the conversion of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate at rates similar to those observed for the cytosolic enzyme. Evidence that this reaction accounts for the in vivo presence of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate is suggested by the observation that mutant strains of E. coli, which lack serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity, do not contain 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, but both these cells, containing an overproducing plasmid of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and wild-type cells do have measurable amounts of this form of the coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1517406463,"This study addresses a major obstacle to vaccine development for leprosy, the isolation and characterization of the native protein antigens of the leprosy bacillus. Mycobacterium leprae harvested from armadillos was subjected to a simple fractionation protocol to arrive at the three major subcellular fractions, cell walls, cytoplasmic membrane, and soluble cytoplasm. The application of extensive detergent phase separations to membrane fractions allowed removal of lipoarabinomannan and the mannosyl phosphatidylinositols, and the recognition and purification of two major membrane proteins (MMP) of molecular mass 35 kDa (MMP-I) and 22 kDa (MMP-II); recovery of these proteins was about 0.5 mg each per g of M. leprae. MMP-I is N-blocked and is perhaps a lipoprotein. End group analysis on MMP-II indicates a new protein. Three major cytoplasmic proteins (MCP) of molecular mass 14 kDa (MCP-I), 17 kDa (MCP-II), and 28 kDa (MCP-III) were also recognized. MCP-I, the most abundant protein in M. leprae, represents 1% of the bacterial mass. End group analysis of the first 30 residues and immunoblotting studies demonstrate sizeable structural homology to a protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis but immunological distinctiveness. MCP-I, which also occurs in highly immunogenic peptidoglycan-bound form, is a primary candidate for future vaccine development. The cell walls of M. leprae are also characterized by one major extractable protein, also of molecular mass 17 kDa. Thus the major antigens of the leprosy bacillus, protein and carbohydrate alike, are now nearer to complete definition."
https://openalex.org/W2090409921,"We constructed a recombinant baculovirus, A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, containing the Drosophila Shaker H4 K+ channel cDNA under control of the polyhedrin promoter. When infected with this recombinant baculovirus, the cell line Sf9, derived from the army-worm caterpillar S. frugiperda, expresses fully functional Shaker transient K+ currents, as assayed by whole-cell recording. K+ currents begin to appear at about 15 hr after infection, and they continue to increase over the next 3 days. Over the same period of time, a 75 kd band appears on SDS gels stained with Coomassie blue. The identity of this band as a Shaker gene product is confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Shaker antiserum. The 75 kd band accounts for a substantial fraction of the membrane protein in Shaker-infected Sf9 cells. These results give hope that the baculovirus system, which has been used successfully for high-level expression of soluble proteins from higher eukaryotes, may be appropriate for producing large amounts of cloned ion channel proteins as well."
https://openalex.org/W2106582339,"We and others previously described the melanoma-associated oncofetal glycosphingolipid antigen 9-O-acetyl-GD3, a disialoganglioside O-acetylated at the 9-position of the outer sialic acid residue. We have now developed methods to examine the biosynthesis and turnover of disialogangliosides in cultured melanoma cells and in Golgi-enriched vesicles from these cells. O-Acetylation was selectively expressed on di- and trisialogangliosides, but not on monosialogangliosides, nor on glycoprotein-bound sialic acids. Double-labeling of cells with [3H]acetate and [14C]glucosamine introduced easily detectable labels into each of the components of the ganglioside molecules. Pulse-chase studies of such doubly labeled molecules indicated that the O-acetyl groups turn over faster than the parent molecule. When Golgi-enriched vesicles from these cells were incubated with [acetyl-3H]acetyl-coenzyme A, the major labeled products were disialogangliosides. [Acetyl-3H]O-acetyl groups were found at both the 7- and the 9-positions, indicating that both 7-O-acetyl GD3 and 9-O-acetyl GD3 were synthesized by the action of O-acetyltransferase(s) on endogenous GD3. Analysis of the metabolically labeled molecules confirmed the existence of both 7- and 9-O-acetylated GD3 in the intact cells. Surprisingly, the major 3H-labeled product of the in vitro labeling reaction was not O-acetyl-GD3, but GD3, with the label exclusively in the sialic acid residues. Fragmentation of the labeled sialic acids by enzymatic and chemical methods showed that the 3H-label was exclusively in [3H]N-acetyl groups. Analyses of the double-labeled sialic acids from intact cells also showed that the 3H-label from [3H]acetate was exclusively in the form of [3H]N-acetyl groups, whereas the 14C-label was at the 4-position. Pulse-chase analysis of the 3H/14C ratio showed that the N-acetyl groups of both GD3 and of the monosialoganglioside GM3 were turning over faster than the parent molecules. Selective periodate oxidation showed that both the inner and outer sialic acid residues of GD3 incorporated 3H-label in the in vitro reaction, and showed similar turnover of N-acetylation in the pulse-chase study. Taken together, these results indicate that both the O- and N-acetyl groups of the sialic acid residues of gangliosides turn over faster than the parent molecules. They also demonstrate a novel re-N-acetylation reaction that predicts the existence of de-N-acetyl gangliosides in melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605631270,"Complex formation between the human papilloma virus type-16 E7 protein (HPV-16 E7) and the retinoblastoma suppressor protein (pRB) is believed to be important in the process of cellular transformation that leads to cervical carcinoma. Utilizing an in vitro solution assay as well as a plate binding assay that measures the association between HPV-16 E7 and pRB proteins, we have examined a series of synthetic HPV-16 E7 peptides. HPV-16 E7 peptides which lie between amino acid residues 14 and 32 were found to be potent inhibitors of E7/pRB binding. The minimal peptide structure that possessed full antagonist activity was N-acetyl-E7-(21-29)-peptide amide. This peptide inhibited 100% of E7/pRB binding and exhibited an IC50 of 40 nM in the plate binding assay. A purified beta-galactosidase-E7 fusion protein exhibited an IC50 of 2 nM in the same assay. These results suggest that other regions of the E7 molecule in addition to amino acids 21-29 may contributed to E7/pRB interaction. Analysis of E7-(20-29)-peptides containing single amino acid substitutions suggests that Cys24, Tyr23, Tyr25, Asp21, and Glu26 are important residues for maintaining maximal antagonist activity. This series of peptides should prove useful in analyzing the biological consequences of E7/pRB binding in HPV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606581707,"We have examined the physical state of highly purified deep rough chemotype lipopolysaccharide (ReLPS) from Escherichia coli D31m4 as an aqueous suspension and as complexes with bovine serum albumin min (BSA). The ReLPS suspension showed large ellipsoidal particles 12-38 nm wide and 40-100 nm long. The solubility of this form of ReLPS was determined by equilibrium dialysis experiments to be 3.3 x 10(-8) M at 22 degrees C and 2.8 x 10(-8) M at 37 degrees C in 150 mM Tris-KCl, pH 7.5; 3.0 x 10(-8) M at 37 degrees C in 0.75 mM Tris-KCl, pH 7.5. The BSA-ReLPS complexes were fractionated on a Sephacryl S-200 column to yield peaks I and II with apparent masses of about 240 and 70 kDa, respectively. Peak II was a BSA monomer with estimated BSA:ReLPS molar ratios of 1:1-1:7. The ReLPS suspension and the two complexes were compared as antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using three select monoclonal antibodies to lipopolysaccharide. The results were consistent with the high state of disaggregation of the ReLPS in both peaks I and II. Since the ReLPS in these complexes were not visible by electron microscopy, they did not contain vesicles or large particles. All forms of ReLPS tested were capable of stimulating 70Z/3, a lipopolysaccharide-responsive murine pre-B cell line. However, peak II was consistently more stimulatory at very low concentrations than the other preparations. The maximally stimulatory concentration of ReLPS for 70Z/3 cells was 40 ng/ml (1.6 x 10(-8) M) for peak II and 70 ng/ml (2.8 x 10(-8) M) for the ReLPS suspension. As expected, the above concentrations were at or below the solubility of the ReLPS. These results suggested that the highly disaggregated form of ReLPS (possibly the monomer) is the active unit that stimulates the cellular response in 70Z/3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2104414338,"Abstract beta-Glucoside Enzyme II (IIBgl) of the Escherichia coli phosphotransferase system transports and phosphorylates beta-glucosides, whereas the glucose Enzyme II-III pair (IIGlc-IIIGlc) transports and phosphorylates glucose as well as certain aliphatic alpha- and beta-glucosides. Comparisons of their respective amino acid sequences previously revealed that both systems are homologous and must be evolutionarily related. To gain more insight into the details of the transport mechanism, we made use of the observed homologies among phosphotransferase system permeases to design a suitable set of site-specific mutants within the gene encoding IIBgl. This set was used to study in vivo fermentation and to analyze in vitro P-enolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphorylation as well as sugar phosphate-dependent sugar transphosphorylation. The following results were obtained. (i) IIBgl transports and phosphorylates glucose as well as aryl- and alkyl-beta-glucosides; (ii) histidyl 547 is essential for the phosphorylation of IIBgl by the histidine-containing phosphoryl carrier protein of the phosphotransferase system (HPr) (first phosphorylation site); (iii) both cysteyl 24 and histidyl 306 are essential for the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the sugar; (iv) replacement of Cys-24 by serine leads to uncoupling of sugar transport from phosphorylation; and (v) histidyl 183 is important for substrate specificity. Our studies also revealed heterologous phosphoryl transfer between the beta-glucoside and glucose permease components which probably occurs as follows: 1) HPr-P----IIBgl (His-547)----IIGlc----alkyl-alpha- or -beta-glucosides or glucose (but not aryl-beta-glucosides) and 2) HPr-P----IIIGlc----IIBgl (Cys-24 or His-306)----alkyl- or aryl-beta-glucosides or glucose (but not methyl-alpha-glucoside). In addition to the essential residues noted above, several residues in IIBgl were identified which when mutated reduced the in vitro catalytic efficiency of the enzyme more than 10-fold. Thus, aspartyl 551 and arginyl 625 appeared to function together with histidyl 547 in phosphoryl transfer involving the first phosphorylation site in the permease, whereas histidyl 183 appeared to function together with cysteyl 24 and histidyl 306 in phosphoryl transfer involving the second phosphorylation site in the permease."
https://openalex.org/W2021946448,"Eukaryotic cells respond to elevated temperatures by rapidly activating the expression of heat shock genes. Central to this activation is heat shock-inducible binding of the transcriptional activator, termed heat shock factor (HSF), to common regulatory elements, which are located upstream of all heat shock genes. The DNA binding activity of the inactive form of Drosophila HSF was induced in vitro by treatment with polyclonal antibodies to the purified, in vivo-activated factor. This finding, together with observations that high temperature and low pH activate HSF binding in vitro, suggests that the inactive form of HSF can directly recognize and transduce the heat shock signal without undergoing a covalent modification of protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1531919411,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase has been efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified to homogeneity using phosphocellulose chromatography. The interactions between apoenzyme and its acyl-CoA and peptide ligands were examined by an isoelectric focusing gel shift assay, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy, and a continuous assay of enzyme activity which measures the release of CoA from acyl-CoA using the thiol-specific reagent 5-5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate. Addition of myristoyl-CoA (without a substrate peptide) results in the formation of a high affinity reaction intermediate which can be operationally defined by the appearance of a more acidic enzyme isoform and by quenching of the tryptophan emission with a maximal difference at 340 nm. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that these changes are accompanied by minimal changes in the enzyme's secondary structure. Incubation of purified NMT with [1-14C] myristoyl-CoA, followed by chymotryptic digestion, denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and treatment with hydroxylamine yielded results that are highly suggestive of a covalent ester-linked acyl-enzyme complex. Edman degradation of chymotryptic peptides has narrowed the site of interaction to a domain spanning Arg42 to Thr220 of the 455 amino acid acyltransferase. An octapeptide containing Gly but not Ala at position 1 is able to reverse the change in pI and reduce the quenching almost entirely. These data suggest a preferred order or ping-pong reaction mechanism with the acyl-CoA substrate binding event occurring first. They also indicate that Gly1 is absolutely necessary for the reaction to proceed forward from the acyl-enzyme reaction intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2093231070,"Expression of the bgl operon of Escherichia coli is regulated in vitro by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a positive regulatory protein, BglG, which functions in its nonphosphorylated state as a transcriptional antiterminator. The degree of phosphorylation of BglG in vivo was shown to be dependent on the cellular levels of BglF protein, which is both the BglG kinase and phosphatase. The degree of phosphorylation of BglG also depended on the presence or absence of a beta-glucoside, the inducer of operon expression. Addition of inducer to cells in growth medium resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of phosphorylated BglG. The bgl operon is thus regulated by a sensory system that modulates gene expression by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to the external levels of inducer."

After the treatment, the plasma cholesterol levels fell by 33.2% from 61.4 +/- 25.9 to 41.0 +/- 10.2 mg/dl (mean +/- S.D.). We also injected a large dose of M-CSF (500 micrograms/day) for 6 days into Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbits, which are deficient in low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. Again, there was a significant reduction in plasma cholesterol levels by 36.2% from 730.5 +/- 176.4 to 466.0 +/- 104.9 mg/dl (n = 4). In the kinetic studies in New Zealand White rabbits with very low density lipoprotein, LDL, and methylated LDL, the removal rates of those lipoproteins were increased 1.9-, 1.7-, and 2.0-fold, respectively, after the treatment. Immunoblot analysis of LDL receptors in the treated rabbits showed no significant changes in LDL receptor proteins in livers but a great increase in spleens and bone marrows compared with the controls. Messenger RNA was also estimated by Northern blotting in both groups, and the results were compatible with those from the immunoblot. The data suggest that M-CSF stimulates the clearance of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B-100 via both LDL receptor-dependent and -independent pathways in target cells of M-CSF and reduces plasma cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1663525282,"Ribonuclease H (RNase H) from Escherichia coli is an endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNAs of RNA:DNA hybrids. The enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of 155 amino acid residues, of which 4 are methionines. To solve the crystallographic three-dimensional structure of E. coli RNase H by the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction technique, we have constructed methionine auxotrophic strains of E. coli that overexpress selenomethionyl RNase H. MIC88 yields about 10 mg of selenomethionyl RNase H per liter of culture, which is comparable to the overexpression of the natural recombinant protein. We have purified both proteins to homogeneity and crystallized them isomorphously in the presence of sulfate. These are Type I crystals of space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with the cell parameters a = 41.8 A, b = 86.4 A, c = 36.4 A, one monomer per asymmetric unit, and approximately 36% (v/v) solvent. Crystals of both proteins diffract to beyond 2-A Bragg spacings and are relatively durable in an x-ray beam. On replacement of sulfate with NaCl, crystals of natural RNase H grow as Type I' (very similar to Type I) at pH between 7.0 and 8.0; at pH 8.8, crystals of Type II are obtained in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 44.3 A, b = 87.3 A, and c = 35.7 A. Type II crystals can be converted to Type I by soaking in phosphate buffer. RNase H crystals of Type II have also been reported by Kanaya et al.

https://openalex.org/W1587060900,"DNA polymerase I (Pol I) is an enzyme of DNA replication and repair containing three active sites, each requiring divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. As determined by EPR and by 1/T1 measurements of water protons, whole Pol I binds Mn2+ at one tight site (KD = 2.5 microM) and approximately 20 weak sites (KD = 600 microM). All bound metal ions retain one or more water ligands as reflected in enhanced paramagnetic effects of Mn2+ on 1/T1 of water protons. The cloned large fragment of Pol I, which lacks the 5',3'-exonuclease domain, retains the tight metal binding site with little or no change in its affinity for Mn2+, but has lost approximately 12 weak sites (n = 8, KD = 1000 microM). The presence of stoichiometric TMP creates a second tight Mn2+ binding site or tightens a weak site 100-fold. dGTP together with TMP creates a third tight Mn2+ binding site or tightens a weak site 166-fold. The D424A (the Asp424 to Ala) 3',5'-exonuclease deficient mutant of the large fragment retains a weakened tight site (KD = 68 microM) and has lost one weak site (n = 7, KD = 3500 microM) in comparison with the wild-type large fragment, and no effect of TMP on metal binding is detected. The D355A, E357A (the Asp355 to Ala, Glu357 to Ala double mutant of the large fragment of Pol I) 3',5'-exonuclease-deficient double mutant has lost the tight metal binding site and four weak metal binding sites. The binding of dGTP to the polymerase active site of the D355A,E357A double mutant creates one tight Mn2+ binding site with a dissociation constant (KD = 3.6 microM), comparable with that found on the wild-type enzyme, which retains one fast exchanging water ligand. Mg2+ competes at this site with a KD of 100 microM. It is concluded that the single tightly bound Mn2+ on Pol I and a weakly bound Mn2+ which is tightened 100-fold by TMP are at the 3',5'-exonuclease active site and are essential for 3',5'-exonuclease activity, but not for polymerase activity. Additional weak Mn2+ binding sites are detected on the 3',5'-exonuclease domain, which may be activating, and on the polymerase domain, which may be inhibitory. The essential divalent metal activator of the polymerase reaction requires the presence of the dNTP substrate for tight metal binding indicating that the bound substrate coordinates the metal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

While most of these proteins fail to bind insulin, a truncation that includes only the alpha-subunit is secreted as a monomer that binds the hormone with an affinity only slightly less than that of the complete heterotetrameric extracellular domain. These results thus demarcate landmarks within the primary sequence which will now guide further analysis of the structure and function of this complex domain of the receptor."

(1989) Mol. Pharmacol. 36, 831-835), has been used as a probe for the P2Y-purinergic receptor on turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes. In the absence of light, [32P]BzATP bound to membranes with high affinity (KD approximately 5 nM), and in a saturable and reversible manner. The binding of [32P]BzATP was competitively inhibited by ATP and ADP analogs (2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate greater than adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) greater than BzATP greater than ATP greater than beta,gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate greater than 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate) with pharmacological specificity consistent with that of a P2Y-purinergic receptor. Guanine nucleotides (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) greater than GTP greater than guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) greater than GMP) noncompetitively inhibited the binding of radioligand. Photolysis of [32P] BzATP-prelabeled membranes resulted in incorporation of radiolabel into a protein of approximately 53,000 Da. Photolabeling was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by ATP and ADP analogs with a potency order characteristic for a P2Y-purinergic receptor and was modulated by guanine nucleotides. A protein of approximately 53,000 daltons was also labeled by [32P]BzATP in membranes from several other tissues known to express the P2Y-purinergic receptor. These results suggest that [32P]BzATP can be used to label covalently the P2Y-purinergic receptor and that this radioprobe will be a useful reagent for further characterization and purification of the P2Y-purinergic receptor."

Sf9 cells infected with the full-length HIR viruses synthesize recombinant HIR (rHIR) with an insulin-binding alpha subunit of apparent Mr = 110,000 and a beta subunit of apparent Mr = 80,000. Uncleaved alpha beta proreceptor accumulates in infected cells. Both of these forms assemble into higher order disulfide-linked dimers or heterotetramers of apparent Mr greater than 350,000. Insulin-binding activity in cells infected with rHIR viruses is present predominantly on the extracellular aspect of the plasma membrane (greater than 80%). Insulin binding to the full-length rHIR occurs with typical complex kinetics with Kd1 = 0.5-1 x 10(-9) M and Kd2 = 10(-7) M and receptors are present in large amounts in infected cells (1 x 10(6) receptors/cell; 1-2 mg HIR/10(9) cells). The full-length rHIR undergoes insulin-dependent autophosphorylation; half-maximal activation of beta subunit autophosphorylation occurs at 1-2 x 10(-8) M. The alpha beta proreceptor also becomes phosphorylated in vitro. Analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides derived from in vitro autophosphorylated beta subunit and alpha beta proreceptor reveals a pattern of phosphorylation that is indistinguishable from that of authentic placental HIR. Sf9 cells infected with rHIRsec viruses synthesize and secrete an (alpha beta')2 heterotetrameric complex having an insulin-binding alpha subunit of apparent Mr = 110,000 and a truncated beta' subunit of apparent Mr = 45,000 that lacks kinase activity. The rHIRsec complex purified from the conditioned medium of infected cells binds insulin with high affinity (Kd = 10(-9) M)."
https://openalex.org/W1567556391,"Data on initial velocity and isotope exchange at equilibrium suggest a nonclassical ping-pong mechanism for the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase from pig liver. Initial velocity patterns in the absence of inhibitors appeared parallel at low reactant concentration, with substrate inhibition by NADPH that is competitive with uracil and with substrate inhibition by uracil that is uncompetitive with NADPH. The Km values for both uracil (1 microM) and NADPH (7 microM) are low. As a result, it was difficult to determine whether the initial velocity pattern in the absence of added inhibitors was parallel. Thus, the pattern was redetermined in the presence of the dead-end inhibitor 2,6-dihydroxypyridine, which binds to both sites. This treatment effectively eliminates the inhibition by both substrates and increases their Km values, giving a strictly parallel pattern. Product and dead-end inhibition patterns are consistent with a mechanism in which NADPH reduces the enzyme at site 1 and electrons are transferred to site 2 to reduce uracil to dihydrouracil. The predicted mechanism is corroborated by exchange between [14C] NADP and NADPH as well as [14C]thymine and dihydrothymine in the absence of the other substrate-product pair."
https://openalex.org/W1598465619,"The LexA repressor of Escherichia coli modulates the expression of the SOS regulon. In the presence of DNA damaging agents in vivo, the 202-amino acid LexA repressor is inactivated by specific RecA-mediated cleavage of the Ala-84/Gly-85 peptide bond. In vitro. LexA cleavage requires activated RecA at neutral pH, and proceeds spontaneously at high pH in an intramolecular reaction termed autodigestion. A model has been proposed for the mechanism of autodigestion in which serine 119 serves as the reactive nucleophile that attacks the Ala-84/Gly-85 peptide bond in a manner analogous to a serine protease, while uncharged lysine 156 activates the serine 119 hydroxyl group. In this work, we have tested this model by examining the effect of the serine protease inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) on autodigestion. We found that DFP inhibited autodigestion and that serine 119 was the only serine residue to react with DFP. We also examined [3H]DFP incorporation by a number of cleavage-impaired LexA mutant proteins and found that mutations in the proposed active site, but not in the cleavage site, significantly reduced the rate of [3H]DFP incorporation. Finally, we showed that the purified carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains the proposed catalytic residues, incorporated [3H]DFP at a rate indistinguishable from the intact protein. These data further support our current model for the mechanism of autodigestion and the organization of LexA."
https://openalex.org/W1513455869,"Due to the lack of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) is an essential enzyme in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni for supplying guanine nucleotides and has been proposed as a potential target for antiparasitic chemotherapy. While the enzyme can be purified from adult schistosome worms, yields are too low to allow extensive structural and kinetic studies. We therefore cloned and sequenced the cDNA and gene encoding the schistosomal enzyme but were unable to positively identify the amino-terminal sequence of the enzyme from the DNA sequence. Knowledge of the exact amino terminus was necessary before accurate expression of active enzyme could be attempted. Therefore, we purified the HGPRTase from crude extracts of the adult worms. The purified enzyme has a subunit molecular mass of 26 kDa and an amino-terminal sequence of Met-Ser-Ser-Asn-Met. This sequence matched one of the potential initiation sites predicted from the cDNA and gene sequence. We next expressed the correct size cDNA of the S. mansoni HGPRTase in Escherichia coli using a vector that is regulated by a bacterial alkaline phosphatase promoter and uses an E. coli signal peptide for secretion of expressed product into the periplasmic space. Using this expression system, some of the recombinant enzyme is secreted and found to have a correct amino terminus. That remaining in the cytoplasm has part of the signal peptide attached to the amino terminus. The recombinant schistosomal HGPRTase isolated from the periplasm of the transformed E. coli was purified and found to have kinetic and physical properties identical to those of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2347025710,"Endonuclease VII is an enzyme from bacteriophage T4 capable of resolving four-arm Holliday junction intermediates in recombination. Since natural Holliday junctions have homologous (2-fold) sequence symmetry, they can branch migrate, creating a population of substrates that have the branch point at different sites. We have explored the substrate requirements of endonuclease VII by using immobile analogs of Holliday junctions that lack this homology, thereby situating the branch point at a fixed site in the molecule. We have found that immobile junctions whose double-helical arms contain fewer than nine nucleotide pairs do not serve as substrates for resolution by endonuclease VII. Scission of substrates with 2-fold symmetrically elongated arms produces resolution products that are a function of the particular arms that are lengthened. We have confirmed that the scission products are those of resolution, rather than nicking of individual strands, by using shamrock junction molecules formed from a single oligonucleotide strand. A combination of end-labeled and internally labeled shamrock molecules has been used to demonstrate that all of the scission is due to coordinated cleavage of DNA on opposite sides of the junction, 3' to the branch point. Endonuclease VII is known to cleave the crossover strands of Holliday junctions in this fashion. The relationship of the long arms to the cleavage direction suggests that the portion of the enzyme which requires the minimum arm length interacts with the pair of arms containing the 3' portion of the crossover strands on the bound surface of the antiparallel junction."
https://openalex.org/W1573740705,The three-dimensional structure of thymidine phosphorylase from Escherichia coli has been determined at 2.8 A resolution using multiple-isomorphous-replacement techniques. The amino acid sequence deduced from the deoA DNA sequence is also reported. Thymidine phosphorylase exists in the crystal as an S-shaped dimer in which the subunits are related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Each subunit is composed of a small alpha-helical domain of six helices and a large alpha/beta domain. The alpha/beta domain includes a six-stranded mixed beta-sheet and a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The active site has been identified by difference Fourier analyses of the binding of thymine and thymidine and lies in a cavity between the small and large domains. The central beta-sheet is splayed open to accommodate a putative phosphate-binding site which is probably occupied by a sulfate ion in the crystal.
https://openalex.org/W2470200999,"A synthetic DNA fragment encoding a protease precursor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV2) was cloned and expressed in bacteria and yeast. A recombinant plasmid encoding a hybrid polypeptide consisting of human superoxide dismutase and an HIV2 protease precursor of 113 amino acids was constructed for regulated intracellular expression in bacteria. Induction of this plasmid produced an autoprocessed form of the retroviral enzyme possessing the correct molecular weight. Overexpression and secretion of the protease from yeast was achieved with an expression vector encoding the yeast pheromone alpha-factor signal/leader sequence fused to a protease precursor of 115 amino acids. Amino-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the viral enzyme exported from yeast was correctly processed from its precursor by cleavage of the predicted Ala-Pro peptide bond located at the NH2 terminus of the protease in the pol open reading frame. No additional amino acid residues were required at the COOH terminus of the protease for this autoproteolytic event. The HIV2 protease expressed in bacteria and yeast was active in an in vitro assay when tested on the HIV1 polyprotein precursor, myristylated Pr53gag. Two synthetic peptides representing junction sequences in the HIV1 gag-pol precursor were used to assay purified HIV2 protease. The enzyme exhibited a kcat/KM of 23.2 min-1 mM-1 on the HIV1 matrix-capsid junction peptide and a kcat/KM of 71.4 min-1 mM-1 on the protease-reverse transcriptase junction peptide.

LAC9 belongs to a family of fungal proteins having a conserved domain containing 6 cysteines. This domain, termed a C6 zinc finger, is thought to bind one zinc atom and to play a vital role in DNA binding. To further characterize the DNA-binding domain of LAC9, we have developed a procedure to produce and to purify milligram amounts of LAC9 peptides. The two larger peptides, one containing amino acids 1-228 and the other containing amino acids 85-228, formed dimers in solution and bound DNA specifically as a dimer. The smallest LAC9 peptide, amino acids 85-160, failed to dimerize and did not bind DNA. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that each LAC9 monomer coordinated two zinc atoms, not one, as had been predicted. This result suggests, as does previously published data, that the C6 zinc finger domain has a unique conformation that may represent a new type of DNA-binding motif."

https://openalex.org/W1503058133,"Abstract We have previously reported that human vascular endothelial cells and skin fibroblasts carry out degradation of [3H]histamine by a mechanism involving two successive enzymatic steps: imidazole ring tele-methylation by the cells' endogenous methyltransferase and subsequent amine oxidation by an exogenous diamine oxidase. Both histamine and the exogenous second enzyme in the pathway associate with the cells via separate binding sites or receptors. The enzymatic degradation process results in cellular accumulation of the proximal and distal metabolites tele-methylhistamine and 1-methyl-4-imidazoleacetic acid (MIAA) (Haddock, R. C., Mack, P., Fogerty, F. J., and Baenziger, N. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10220-10228). We have now demonstrated that this two-stage histamine degradative pathway is dependent on Na+ and Cl- in the extracellular environment. Accumulation of [3H] histamine-derived products is partially inhibited under conditions of Na+ deprivation and more substantially when Cl- is also withdrawn. The individual tele-methylation and amine oxidation enzymatic reactions themselves are unaffected or actually facilitated under these conditions. This indicates that it is the cellular mechanism for uptake coupled to the degradative pathway which reflects the cation and anion dependency. Restoration of degradative uptake displays a biphasic Na+ concentration curve, suggesting that the uptake process may be driven by multiple components. These findings indicate a role for both inward Na+ and Cl- ion movement in this cellular degradative uptake mechanism."
