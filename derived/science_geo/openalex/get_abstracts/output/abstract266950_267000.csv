https://openalex.org/W1995419949,"Carbon dioxide-rich fluid bubbles, containing approximately 86 percent CO(2), 3 percent H(2)S, and 11 percent residual gas (CH(4) + H(2)), were observed to emerge from the sea floor at 1335- to 1550-m depth in the JADE hydrothermal field, mid-Okinawa Trough. Upon contact with seawater at 3.8 degrees C, gas hydrate immediately formed on the surface of the bubbles and these hydrates coalesced to form pipes standing on the sediments. Chemical composition and carbon, sulfur, and helium isotopic ratios indicate that the CO(2)-rich fluid was derived from the same magmatic source as dissolved gases in 320 degrees C hydrothermal solution emitted from a nearby black smoker chimney. The CO(2)-rich fluid phase may be separated by subsurface boiling of hydrothermal solutions or by leaching of CO(2)-rich fluid inclusion during posteruption interaction between pore water and volcanogenic sediments."

In order to determine whether differences in performance are an allometric consequence of interpopulation differences in size, yolk was removed from southern eggs, thereby producing miniaturized hatchlings equivalent in size to northern hatchlings. Miniaturized southern hatchlings no longer had higher speed than northern hatchlings, but maintained higher stamina. Interpopulation differences in speed but not in stamina are thus an allometric consequence of differences in egg size. Size manipulation adds an experimental dimension to aliometric analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2006207719,"A large (540 square meters) bed of Bathymodiolus n. sp. (Mytilidae: Bivalvia) rings a pool of hypersaline (121.35 practical salinity units) brine at a water depth of 650 meters on the continental slope south of Louisiana. The anoxic brine (dissolved oxygen </=0.17 milliliters per liter) contains high concentrations of methane, which nourishes methanotrophic symbionts in the mussels. The brine, which originates from a salt-cored diapir that penetrates to within 500 meters ofthe sea floor, fills a depression that was evidently excavated by escaping gas. The spatial continuity of the mussel bed indicates that the brine level has remained fairly constant; however, demographic differences between the inner and outer parts of the bed record small fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W1502883158,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) results for copper-63, oxygen-17, and yttrium-89 nuclei in the superconducting composition range of YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x) (0.4 </= x </= 1.0) are reviewed and interpreted. Copper NMR shift and susceptibility data, combined with a simple ionic model of local magnetic properties, yield a comprehensive analysis of the normal-state anisotropic susceptibility components and full characterization of the copper spin and orbital hyperfine couplings. Data on the spin-lattice relaxation time of these three nuclear species serve to characterize the highly correlated fermion dynamics in this system. Relaxation data from YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) (superconducting transition temperature T(c) = 90 K) and oxygen-deficient samples of this material (T(c) approximately 60 K) have been analyzed in terms of meanfield models incorporating short-range antiferromagnetic order, giving a quantitative account of (planar) relaxation for these three nuclei in terms of a single dynamical susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2064220914,"Butterfly caterpillars produce calls that appear to play a role in maintaining symbiotic associations with ants. A survey of butterfly species from South and Central America, North America, Europe, Thailand, and Australia suggests that the ability for caterpillars to call has evolved independently at least three times, and that calling may be ubiquitous among ant-associated species. Because ants use substrate-borne sound in their communication systems, this study points to the possibility that the calls of one insect species have evolved to attract other, unrelated species."
https://openalex.org/W2028720768,"Coprinites dominicana gen.nov., spec.nov. (Coprinaceae) found in amber from the Dominican Republic is the earliest known gilled mushroom, the first fossil fleshy agaric determinable, and the only kiiown fossil ""mushroom"" (Agaricales) from the tropics. This find is of significance with respect to the evolutionary development of the Basidiomycetes. Because the appearance of this fossil is quite modern, it suggests that mushrooms as a group probably arose much earlier than the early to mid-Tertiary."
