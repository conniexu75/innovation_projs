Here, we report a strategy to hinder mitochondrial electron transport and increase superoxide O2·¯ radical generation in human leukemia cells as a novel mechanism to enhance apoptosis induced by anticancer agents. This strategy was first tested in a proof-of-principle study using rotenone, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport complex I. Partial inhibition of mitochondrial respiration enhances electron leakage from the transport chain, leading to an increase in O2·¯ generation and sensitization of the leukemia cells to anticancer agents whose action involve free radical generation. Using leukemia cells with genetic alterations in mitochondrial DNA and biochemical approaches, we further demonstrated that As2O3, a clinically active anti-leukemia agent, inhibits mitochondrial respiratory function, increases free radical generation, and enhances the activity of another O2·¯-generating agent against cultured leukemia cells and primary leukemia cells isolated from patients. Our study shows that interfering mitochondrial respiration is a novel mechanism by which As2O3 increases generation of free radicals. This novel mechanism of action provides a biochemical basis for developing new drug combination strategies using As2O3 to enhance the activity of anticancer agents by promoting generation of free radicals.

Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that play central roles in energy metabolism and apoptosis. During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are delivered through the mitochondrial respiratory complexes, and a proton gradient is established across the inner mitochondrial membrane as the energy source for ATP production. One important biochemical event associated with this metabolic process is the production of superoxide radical O2·¯. When an electron escapes from the mitochondrial electron transport chain, especially at complex I or III, it may react with a molecular oxygen to form O2·¯ (1Saybasili H. Yuksel M. Haklar G.

Because O2·¯ is constantly generated during cellular metabolism and can be converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; O2·¯, superoxide radical; 2-ME, 2-methoxyestradiol; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Rot, rotenone.

Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd ed. Oxford University Press Inc., New York, NY1999Google Scholar). Because ROS are chemically reactive and potentially toxic to the cells when accumulated to high levels, these chemical species need to be promptly eliminated from the cells by a highly regulated anti-oxidant system, which include metabolic enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), various peroxidases, and other redox molecules. Under physiological conditions, the maintenance of an appropriate level of intracellular ROS is important in keeping redox balance and signaling cellular proliferation (5Murrell G.A. Francis M.J.

However, an overproduction of ROS or a suppression of cellular ability to eliminate ROS from the cells would result in a significant increase of intracellular ROS, leading to cellular damage, including lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA modifications, protein oxidation, and enzyme inactivation. These damages can ultimately cause cell death if the ROS stress is severe and persistent. Although the cell-damaging effect of free radicals has been associated with various pathological processes, this may also provide a possibility to kill cancer cells if one could preferentially induce ROS accumulation in the malignant cells with appropriate agents. Because cancer cells are in general metabolically active, produce high levels of ROS, and are under intrinsic oxidative stress, the malignant cells are more vulnerable to further oxidative stress by exogenous ROS-generating agents (10Szatrowski T.P.

It has been postulated that when ROS stress reaches a certain threshold, an apoptotic program is triggered to kill the cancer cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that the anticancer agent 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) inhibits the O2·¯-eliminating enzyme SOD and causes an accumulation of superoxide radical in cancer cells, leading to a preferential killing of the malignant cells and an enhancement of photodynamic therapy (16Huang P.

In addition to the essential role in ATP synthesis and ROS metabolism, mitochondria also play a critical role in apoptosis. Upon receipt of apoptotic stimuli, either externally or internally generated, respective signaling pathways are initiated in the cells and often converged upon the mitochondria to promote release of cytochrome c and other apoptotic factors to the cytoplasm. This is associated with changes in the mitochondrial ultrastructure, membrane permeability, and transmembrane potential (19Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.-W. Ma J. Nieminen A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A direct damage to the mitochondrial membrane by ROS also causes a leak of cytochrome c (16Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 20Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A.

Cytochrome c is normally localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain essential for aerobic ATP generation. However, once cytochrome c is released into the cytosol, it binds apaf-1 in the presence of dATP or ATP and activates procaspase-9, which in turn activates the downstream caspases and triggers the apoptotic cascade (23Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 24Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that cancer cells may have certain alterations in the mitochondria, leading to increased glycolysis, even in the presence of normal oxygen tension (25Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). This “respiration injury” would predict a low coupling efficiency of the mitochondrial electron transport, and an increased likelihood of electron leakage during respiration in the cancer cells, leading to O2·¯ radical formation and increased oxidative stress. These biochemical characteristics suggest a possibility that the mitochondrial respiration chain in cancer cells may be vulnerable to therapeutic intervention and may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy. The objective of this study was to test a new approach to enhance drug-induced apoptosis by a drug combination strategy that increases mitochondrial generation of O2·¯ radical and at the same time inhibits its elimination. Because the overall cellular O2·¯ content is determined by the balance between O2·¯ generation and elimination, interference of both processes is expected to cause a severe accumulation of O2·¯ radical and likely to have a synergistic effect against cancer cells. In the present study, we used rotenone, a known inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I, in combination with the SOD inhibitor 2-ME to test their effect on cellular superoxide levels and possible synergistic activity against cancer cells in vitro. The potential therapeutic implications of this approach were further investigated using clinically relevant anticancer agents whose action involves ROS generation. Cells and Cell Cultures—Human monoblastic ML-1 and lymphoblastoid T-cell Jurkat lines were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary leukemia cells were isolated from patients diagnosed as having B-cell CLL according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI, National Institutes of Health) criteria for the diagnosis of CLL (26Cheson B.D. Bennett J.M. Rai K.R. Grever M.R. Kay N.E. Schiffer C.A. Oken M.M. Keating M.J. Boldt D.H. Kempin S.J. Foon K.A. Am. J. Hematol. 1988; 29: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). CLL cells were isolated from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation as previously described (27Huang P. Sandoval A. Van Den N.E. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh blood samples were diluted with 3 volumes of cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then layered over 10 ml of Ficoll-Hypaque mixture (specific gravity, 1.077 g/ml). After centrifugation at 400 × g for 20 min, the buoyant layer containing leukemia cells was recovered, washed twice with sterile PBS, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Drug incubations were started after the cells were pre-cultured in fresh medium for 24 h. Incubation of CLL cells in fresh medium (no drug) for 48 h resulted in about 5–30% of the cells being annexin-V positive, indicating various degrees of “spontaneous” apoptosis among CLL samples from different patients. This is consistent with the observations by Robertson et al. (28Robertson L.E. Chubb S. Meyn R.E. Story M. Ford R. Hittelman W.N. Plunkett W. Blood. 1993; 81: 143-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, the drug-induced apoptosis was calculated by subtracting “spontaneous” apoptosis from total apoptosis of the respective samples. Reagents—Hydroethidine and Mitotraker Green were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human PARP antibody and cytochrome c antibody were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Antibody to β-actin and all other reagents, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Western Blot Analysis—Cytosolic protein extracts was prepared as previously described (29Gao C.F. Ren S. Zhang L. Nakajima T. Ichinose S. Hara T. Koike K. Tsuchida N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 210 mm sucrose, 70 mm mannitol; 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μm digitonin). After a 10-min incubation at 25 °C, the samples were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants containing cytosolic proteins were stored at –80 °C until analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein extracts were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed for various proteins (cytochrome c, PARP, and β-actin) using appropriate antibodies as described individually in the figure legends. The bound primary antibodies were detected using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by detection with a SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Analysis of Cellular Superoxide and Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential Δψm—Cellular superoxide was measured by a flow cytometry analysis using dihydroethidium as the fluorescent dye relatively specific for superoxide (30Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Kawase M. Copin J.C. Calagui B. Epstein C.J. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3414-3422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dihydroethidium was dissolved in Me2SO (100 mg/ml stock) and further diluted with PBS at 1:10,000. The diluted dye was added into the cell culture at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml and incubated at 37 °C during the last 60 min of the drug treatment. The cells were washed twice in PBS and then analyzed with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Mountain View, CA) as described previously (16Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-123, a cationic voltage-sensitive probe that reversibly accumulates in mitochondria (31Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemaster J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), was used in the present study to detect changes in transmembrane mitochondrial potential (Δψm). Exponentially growing cells were incubated with rotenone, 2-ME, or both in combination as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were labeled with 1 μm rhodamine-123 at 37 °C for 60 min before the end of the drug incubation. After washing, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (16Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Assessment of Apoptosis by Annexin-V Staining and Analysis of Cellular DNA Contents—Cells were stained with annexin-V-FITC for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface as an indicator of apoptosis, following the manufacturer's instruction (BD Biosciences). Briefly, after cells were treated with the indicated compounds, ∼1 × 106 cells were collected, washed with a binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2), and then resuspended in 100 μl of the binding buffer containing 10 μl of annexin-V-FITC. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the cells were washed with the binding buffer (without annexin-V), resuspended in 300 μl of binding buffer containing propidium iodide (PI), and then analyzed by a flow cytometer. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software. Cells that were positively stained by annexin-V-FITC only (early apoptosis) and positive for both annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide (late apoptosis) were quantitated and both subpopulations were considered as overall apoptotic cells. To analyze cellular DNA contents, cells were collected after drug incubation as indicated in the figure legends, fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and kept at –20 °C for at least 14 h. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 2.5 μg/ml RNase at 4 °C overnight, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The profiles of cellular DNA contents indicate the distribution of the cells in different phases of the cell cycle and any possible DNA loss due to DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. The cells with a DNA content less than a G1 cellular DNA was classified as sub-G1 population and considered as apoptotic cells (32Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar). Measurement of Mitochondrial Respiration Activity in Cultured Cells—Oxygen consumption by intact cells was measured as an indication of the mitochondrial respiration activity. After appropriate drug treatment, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh culture medium pre-equilibrated with 21% oxygen and then placed in the sealed respiration chamber equipped with a thermostat control and a micro-stirring device (Oxytherm, Hansatech Instrument, England). Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically at 37 °C with the Clark-type oxygen electrode disc, using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The oxygen content in the suspension medium was constantly monitored, and the signals were integrated using the software supplied by the manufacturer. The oxygen contents in the starting medium were normalized assuming an O2 concentration of 220 μm in air-saturated medium at 37 °C (33Hail Jr., N. Youssef E.M. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6698-6702PubMed Google Scholar). Respiration rate is expressed as nanomoles of O2 consumed as a function of time (min). DNA Sequence Analysis of Mitochondrial ND1 Gene—DNA was isolated from the HL-60 human leukemia cell line and its respiration-deficient subclone C6F/ρ– cells using a method previously described (34Huang P. Robertson L.E. Wright S. Plunkett W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 9: 1005-1013Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K, and then incubated at 45 °C in a water bath for 16 h. Following digestion, the cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, Promega, Madison, WI) and rotated at ambient temperature for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube, added 150 mm NaAc and 10 mm MgCl2, and mixed with 3 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. After precipitated overnight at –20 °C, the DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice with 100% ethanol, and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). To analyze the DNA sequence of the mitochondrial ND1 gene, a region of the ND1 gene was amplified under standard PCR conditions using the specific primers as previously described (35Wei Y.H. Kao S.H. Lee H.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 786: 24-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, amplifications were performed in 50-μl reactions comprising ∼50 ng of DNA, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 1× PCR Gold Buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm each primer, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and nuclease-free H2O (Promega, Madison, WI). Primer sequences used for amplification of a region of the ND1 gene (amino acids 3304–3836) were as follows: sense, 5′-AACATACCCATGGCCAACCT-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCAGGAGTAATCAGAGGTG-3′ (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). PCR reactions were amplified in a Robocycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following cycling protocol: 94 °C for 3 min, 55 °C for 3 min, 72 °C for 1 min (first cycle); 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. The final cycle was prolonged to allow a 7-min extension at 72 °C. 10% of each PCR product was electrophoresed along with 500 ng of a 100-bp ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on a 1.2% agarose gel at 100 V for 45 min to confirm product purity and correct size. The remaining portion of the PCR product was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified products were sequenced using the same primers used for PCR amplification (SeqWright, Inc., Houston, TX). Sequencing results were aligned with the revised Cambridge reference sequence, GenBank™ accession NC-001807, using the pairwise BLAST alignment method (National Center for Biotechnology Information, available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Amino acid changes were determined using the MitoAnalyzer Tool (National Institute of Standards and Technology, available at www.cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase/mitoanalyzer.html). DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation assay was performed according to the method described previously (16Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were treated with the indicated compounds in the presence or absence of an antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine). Cells (1 × 106) were washed once with PBS (4 °C, pH 7.4) and collected by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were then digested in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K overnight. For analysis, 30 μl of DNA was loaded on a 1.8% agarose gel containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer (18 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 18 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 70 V for 3 h. After treatment with RNase A (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) overnight, DNA bands were visualized under ultraviolet light and photographed. Recent studies suggest that cancer cells are more active in free radical production and are under increased oxidative stress compared with their normal counterparts (15Hileman E.O. Achanta G. Huang P. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2001; 5: 679-710Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that this also hold true when primary leukemia cells isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were compared with normal lymphocytes from healthy donors. As shown in Fig. 1A, quantitation of cellular O2·¯ radical by flow cytometry analysis revealed that the average O2·¯ radical content in CLL cells was 18.9 ± 4.8 arbitrary units (fluorescence intensity, n = 12 patients), significantly higher than that of the normal lymphocytes (6.4 ± 1.3, p < 0.001). The intrinsic oxidative stress makes CLL cells much more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to 2-ME, which blocks O2·¯ elimination. At the concentration of 30 μm, 2-ME induces apoptosis in ∼50% of the CLL cells in 24 h, as measured by annexin-V/PI double staining (Fig. 1B). In contrast, less than 10% of normal lymphocytes underwent apoptosis under the same conditions. A free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used to further evaluate the role of O2·¯ in 2-ME-induced apoptosis in CLL cells. Fresh leukemia cells isolated from the blood sample of a CLL patient were incubated with 30 μm 2-ME in the presence or absence of 5 mm NAC. Flow cytometry analysis using hydroethidine fluorescent dye revealed that this concentration of antioxidant effectively suppressed the accumulation of O2·¯ in the 2-ME-treated cells. CLL cells treated with 2-ME for 24 h showed an increase of O2·¯ by 234% over the control cells. Addition of 5 mm NAC reduced the O2·¯ content to the control level. Analysis of annexin-V-positive cells showed that the drug-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced from 85% (2-ME alone, 30 μm for 48 h) to 21% (30 μm 2-ME plus 5 mm NAC, data not shown). These results suggest that O2·¯ accumulation is a critical event in 2-ME-induced apoptosis in CLL cells. Although the selectivity of 2-ME against CLL cells appears promising, the relatively high drug concentration required to kill the cancer cells suggests a need of new strategies to improve its efficacy. One possibility is to enhance endogenous O2·¯ radical generation by interfering the function of mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is a main source of O2·¯ generation. Certain mitochondrial respiration inhibitors can enhance O2·¯ radical generation by causing a bifurcation in the normal pathway of electron flow, leading to a one-electron transfer from the electron transport chain to molecular oxygen and the formation of superoxide (2Staniek K. Gille L. Kozlov A.V. Nohl H. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We used rotenone, a known inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport complex I (36Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 37Chan T.S. Teng S. Wilson J.X. Galati G. Khan S. O'Brien P.J. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), to test its ability to increase superoxide generation and to enhance the activity of 2-ME. The rationale for this experimental design is shown in Fig. 2A. We postulated that a partial blockage of complex I function by a low concentration of rotenone might divert a portion of the electron flow to molecular oxygen and thus increase the production of O2·¯. Addition of 2-ME to the rotenone-treated cells would inhibit the elimination of O2·¯ by SOD and caused a further increase of O2·¯. This indeed occurred when human leukemia cells were tested. As shown in Fig. 2B, incubation of Jurkat cells with 50 nm rotenone for 2 h caused a partial inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport, as evidenced by a significant decrease in oxygen consumption by the cells. Further blockage of respiration was seen with higher concentrations of rotenone (Fig. 2C). As expected, relatively low concentrations of rotenone (50–250 nm) caused an increase in of O2·¯ generation in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2D) and ML-1 cells (Fig. 2E). A sub-toxic concentration of 2-ME (0.3 μm) was then used to test its ability to further increase O2·¯ radical accumulation in the rotenone-treated cells and to evaluate the combined cytotoxic activity of both compounds. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 (A and B), 0.3 μm 2-ME alone caused only a moderate increase of cellular O2·¯ radical. Consistent with this observation, 0.3 μm 2-ME showed a minimum apoptotic effect in these leukemia cells, as evidenced by a small amount of DNA fragmentation (data not shown). Combination of the two sub-toxic concentrations of rotenone and 2-ME resulted in an additive accumulation of O2·¯ radical in both Jurkat and ML-1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). This increase of superoxide was associated with a substantial increase of apoptosis, as demonstrated by a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Fig. 3C), release of cytochrome c and cleavage of poly(ADP)-ribosyltransferase (Fig. 3D), and appearance of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 3E). Quantitation of apoptotic cells by annexin-V/PI double staining using flow cytometry analysis further confirmed the combination of 2-ME and rotenone had more than additive activity against leukemia cells (Table I). In Jurkat cells, incubation with 50 nm rotenone or 0.3 μm 2-ME alone for 24 h caused apoptosis in 5 and 16% of the cells, respectively. Combination of both compounds resulted in 37% ap"

https://openalex.org/W1988348433,"Horizontal gene transfer--the exchange of genes across mating barriers--is recognized as a major force in bacterial evolution. However, in eukaryotes it is prevalent only in certain phagotrophic protists and limited largely to the ancient acquisition of bacterial genes. Although the human genome was initially reported to contain over 100 genes acquired during vertebrate evolution from bacteria, this claim was immediately and repeatedly rebutted. Moreover, horizontal transfer is unknown within the evolution of animals, plants and fungi except in the special context of mobile genetic elements. Here we show, however, that standard mitochondrial genes, encoding ribosomal and respiratory proteins, are subject to evolutionarily frequent horizontal transfer between distantly related flowering plants. These transfers have created a variety of genomic outcomes, including gene duplication, recapture of genes lost through transfer to the nucleus, and chimaeric, half-monocot, half-dicot genes. These results imply the existence of mechanisms for the delivery of DNA between unrelated plants, indicate that horizontal transfer is also a force in plant nuclear genomes, and are discussed in the contexts of plant molecular phylogeny and genetically modified plants."
https://openalex.org/W2032698433,"Hydrogen bonding acts as a ubiquitous glue to sustain the intricate architecture and functionality of proteins, nucleic acids and many supramolecular assemblies1,2, but this weak interaction is seldom used as a force for promoting chemical reactions3,4,5. Here we show that a simple chiral alcohol uses hydrogen bonding to catalyse an important family of cycloaddition reactions of a diene with various aldehydes — moreover, this reaction is highly enantioselective, generating only one of the mirror-image forms of each dihydropyran product. This type of catalysis mimics the action of enzymes and antibodies, and is unlike traditional, metal-based catalysts used in organic chemistry6."

https://openalex.org/W2009102686,"Paired-associate learning is often used to examine episodic memory in humans1. Animal models include the recall of food-cache locations by scrub jays2 and sequential memory3,4. Here we report a model in which rats encode, during successive sample trials, two paired associates (flavours of food and their spatial locations) and display better-than-chance recall of one item when cued by the other. In a first study, pairings of a particular foodstuff and its location were never repeated, so ensuring unique ‘what–where’ attributes. Blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in the hippocampus—crucial for the induction of certain forms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity5,6—impaired memory encoding but had no effect on recall. Inactivating hippocampal neural activity by blocking α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors impaired both encoding and recall. In a second study, two paired associates were trained repeatedly over 8 weeks in new pairs, but blocking of hippocampal AMPA receptors did not affect their recall. Thus we conclude that unique what–where paired associates depend on encoding and retrieval within a hippocampal memory space7,8, with consolidation of the memory traces representing repeated paired associates in circuits elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2108066473,"Human chromosome 7 has historically received prominent attention in the human genetics community, primarily related to the search for the cystic fibrosis gene and the frequent cytogenetic changes associated with various forms of cancer. Here we present more than 153 million base pairs representing 99.4% of the euchromatic sequence of chromosome 7, the first metacentric chromosome completed so far. The sequence has excellent concordance with previously established physical and genetic maps, and it exhibits an unusual amount of segmentally duplicated sequence (8.2%), with marked differences between the two arms. Our initial analyses have identified 1,150 protein-coding genes, 605 of which have been confirmed by complementary DNA sequences, and an additional 941 pseudogenes. Of genes confirmed by transcript sequences, some are polymorphic for mutations that disrupt the reading frame."
https://openalex.org/W2020188213,"All primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV) encode Nef proteins, which are important for viral replication and pathogenicity in vivo. It is not known how Nef regulates these processes. It has been suggested that Nef protects infected cells from apoptosis and recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Other studies suggest that Nef influences the activation state of the infected cell, thereby enhancing the ability of that cell to support viral replication. Here we show that macrophages that express Nef or are stimulated through the CD40 receptor release a paracrine factor that renders T lymphocytes permissive to HIV-1 infection. This activity requires the upregulation of B-cell receptors involved in the alternative pathway of T-lymphocyte stimulation. T lymphocytes stimulated through this pathway become susceptible to viral infection without progressing through the cell cycle. We identify two proteins, soluble CD23 and soluble ICAM, that are induced from macrophages by Nef and CD40L, and which mediate their effects on lymphocyte permissivity. Our results reveal a mechanism by which Nef expands the cellular reservoir of HIV-1 by permitting the infection of resting T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2103551853,"Mutations in a gene on chromosome 1, DJ-1, have been reported recently to be associated with recessive, earlyonset Parkinson's disease. While one mutation is a large deletion that is predicted to produce an effective knockout of the gene, the second is a point mutation, L166P, whose precise effects on protein function are unclear. In the present study, we show that L166P destabilizes DJ-1 protein and promotes its degradation through the ubiq-uitin-proteasome system. A double mutant (K130R, L166P) was more stable than L166P, suggesting that this lysine residue contributes to stability of the protein. Subcellular localization was broadly similar for both wild type and L166P forms of the protein, indicating that the effect of the mutation is predominantly on protein stability. These observations are reminiscent of other recessive gene mutations that produce an effective loss of function. The L166P mutation has the simple effect of promoting DJ-1 degradation, thereby reducing net DJ-1 protein within the cell.

Clinical phenotypes vary somewhat between patients with mutations in these genes, but all produce symptoms that overlap between each other and with sporadic PD. This suggests that mutations in different genes would have common effects on those neurons that are susceptible to degeneration in PD. Although our knowledge of common cellular effects of these different proteins is incomplete, it has been shown, for example, that parkin can protect cells against the toxic effects of mutant α-synuclein both in vitro (6Petrucelli L.

A current hypothesis for the pathogenic pathway that leads to cell death in PD is that there is a deficiency in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Identification of mutations in DJ-1 may allow us to test this hypothesis (8Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2003; 37: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The function of DJ-1 protein appears to be multifaceted (8Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2003; 37: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It was identified through an interaction with c-myc (9Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

DJ-1 may affect mRNA expression via protein-protein interactions with a complex including the androgen receptor and the sumoylation enzyme, PIASxα (12Niki T. Takahashi-Niki K. Taira T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). DJ-1 has been found to shift to a more acidic isoform under oxidative conditions (14Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These studies provide evidence that DJ-1 might be involved in (i) control of gene regulation, (ii) post-translational modifications of proteins by SUMO, a ubiquitin-like modifier, and (iii) oxidative events. DJ-1 has moderate homology to the bacterial proteins ThiJ and Pfp1, which are involved in thiamine synthesis and protease activity respectively. As the ThiJ/Pfp1 superfamily (pfam01965) is large, there may be other unidentified functions of DJ-1. For example, other members of the same family have chaperone-like activity (16Quigley P.M. Korotkov K. Baneyx F. Hol W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3137-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The DJ-1 gene has 7 exons and encodes a 189 amino acid (predicted 20 kDa) protein. One of the reported DJ-1 mutations is a large genomic deletion removing the first 5 exons, and thus, it is unlikely to produce any protein. The second is a point mutation (L166P) of a highly conserved amino acid in a region that is predicted to affect oligomerization, based on sequence similarity to the bacterial protein PH1704 (5Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human DJ-1 has been solved recently (17Honbou K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M.

DJ-1 is localized to both nuclei and cytoplasm in different cell types (9Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 10Hod Y. Pentyala S.N. Whyard T.C. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In their functional analysis of DJ-1, Bonifati et al. (5Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) suggested that the L166P mutant protein mislocalizes to mitochondria and that loss of cytoplasmic function may be sufficient to cause disease. Here we show that the L166P mutation makes DJ-1 dramatically less stable and promotes degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in lower steady state protein levels and functionally mimicking the deletion mutation in resulting in low or absent levels of protein. DJ-1 Constructs and Transfections—Full-length cDNA for DJ-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF021819) cloned into pCDNA3.1/GS was purchased from Invitrogen. This construct has an in-frame C-terminal V5 epitope-His6 fusion tag. The L166P and K130R mutants were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primer sequences are available on request from the authors. We also made an N-terminal myc-tagged DJ-1 construct by subcloning the full coding sequence into the EcoRI site of pGW1myc2b, with mutations introduced as above. The inserts of all constructs were fully sequenced using BigDye terminator kit on an ABI 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) prior to use. Human HEK293, M17 neuroblastoma, or monkey COS-7 cells were grown in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen) and were transiently transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). To generate pools of stable transfectants, cells were selected with 50 μg/ml Zeocin™ (Invitrogen). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid tests were performed as described previously (19Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using the L40 yeast strain harboring the reporter genes HIS3 and β-galactosidase under the control of upstream LexA binding sites. The DJ-1 bait consisted of the entire coding sequence fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain in the pBHA vector. Deletion constructs were produced by PCR amplification using Pfu-Turbo (Stratagene), incorporating EcoRI ends for subcloning into pBHA or pGAD10. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as above. An EcoRI fragment containing residues 433–572 of PIASxα was produced by PCR amplification and subcloned into pGAD10. Yeast two-hybrid interactions were semiquantified as described previously (19Blackstone C. Roberts R.G. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) based on growth on –His/Leu/Trp (–HLT) plates (supplemented with 3 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) and X-gal filter lift assays at room temperature, with similar results obtained in at least three experiments. Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—For Western blotting, cells were lysed as described previously (6Petrucelli L. O'Farrell C. Lockhart P.J. Baptista M. Kehoe K. Vink L. Choi P. Wolozin B. Farrer M. Hardy J. Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of total protein were separated on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-DJ1 (clone 3E8, Stressgen, San Diego, CA), monoclonal anti-V5 (Invitrogen), monoclonal anti-myc (clone 9E10, Roche Applied Science), and monoclonal anti-β-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma). Blots were developed with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA) using ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of protein expression was performed by capturing ECL-plus with a Storm phosphorimager using the blue fluorescence mode. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) collected by centrifugation and then resuspended by briefly sonicating in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were precleared with immobilized protein G (Pierce) and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-V5 conjugated to agarose beads (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). As a negative control we used goat anti-GFP conjugated to agarose (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After five washes in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, proteins were eluted from beads by heating in the presence of Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using a sheep polyclonal antibody raised against the rat Sp22 protein (20Klinefelter G.R. Welch J.E. Perreault S.D. Moore H.D. Zucker R.M. Suarez J.D. Roberts N.L. Bobseine K. Jeffay S. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 48-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the coding sequence of which has 90% identity with human DJ-1. Blots were reprobed with monoclonal antibodies to α-synuclein at 1:1000 dilution (clone 42; BD Transduction Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Gel-exclusion Chromatography—Cells overexpressing myc-DJ-1 were lysed in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and clarified by centrifugation (130,000 × g, 30 min). The extract was applied to a FPLC Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected and proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE then immunoblotted using anti-myc antibodies to detect DJ-1. Protein standards (Amersham Biosciences and Sigma) were applied onto the same column under the same conditions to prepare a standard curve, from which the native molecular weight of DJ-1 was calculated. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed using procedures similar to those described in Ref. 21Darios F. Corti O. Lucking C.B. Hampe C. Muriel M.P. Abbas N. Gu W.J. Hirsch E.C. Rooney T. Ruberg M. Brice A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, with modifications. Briefly, cells transfected with various constructs were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors and lysed using a hand-held homogenizer. We centrifuged the lysate sequentially at 1000 × g, 10,000 × g, and 100,000 × g, retaining pellets for each step and using the supernatant for each subsequent step. The pellets at 1000 × g (P1) and 10,000 × g (P10) were used as crude nuclear/whole cell and mitochondrial fractions, while the final 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) was taken as soluble cytosolic proteins. Similar total amounts (5 μg) of protein were loaded in each lane, and Western blotting was performed as described above. We used the following additional markers for specific fractions: anti-Tim23 for mitochondria (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:2500) and anti-nucleoporin p62 for nuclei (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:5000). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol, and cDNA was synthesized by priming 1 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT), using Superscript II RNA polymerase according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA templates were diluted 5-fold before use in reverse transcription-PCR using primers for DJ-1 (forward, 5′-GTCATTTGTCCTGATGCCAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCAGATAAATTCTGTGCGCCC-3′) or β-actin (forward, 5′-TCACCATGGATGATGATATCGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCACACGCAGCTCATTGTAGAAGG-3′). Real time quantitative PCR was performed and analyzed using the ABI 7900 system (Applied Biosystems Inc.) as described previously (22Baptista M.J. O'Farrell C. Daya S. Miller D.W. Hardy J. Farrer M.J. Cookson M.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 957-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips, transfected with V5-tagged DJ-1 variants (or GFP as a control) and fixed in 4% paraformaldhehyde in Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and quenched with 0.1 m glycine. Coverslips were then washed in DPBS, nonspecific immunoreactivity blocked with DPBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with monoclonal anti-V5 (diluted 1:200) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated prior to mounting under ProLong Antifade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were either preincubated with 500 nm Mitotracker CMTMRos (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to staining or counterstained with SYTO-64 to label nuclei after staining (both from Molecular probes). Slides were examined using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope using independent excitation for both channels. Omission of primary antibody was used to evaluate nonspecific fluorescence and in all cases gave no signal, whereas staining for V5 alone was similar to that seen in dual labeling experiments. Because the signal strength for the L166P variant was substantially lower than that for wild type (see “Results”), we scanned antibody stained cells using a higher sensitivity, by increasing the photomultiplier tube voltage on this channel, hence the collected signals are similar in appearance. In this fashion we maintained separate signals for both channels with minimal bleed-through. Statistical Analyses—Quantitative Western blotting data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Neumann-Kuell's post-hoc tests to determine differences between groups. DJ1 Forms Homo-oligomers in Yeast and Mammalian Cells—As other proteins in the DJ-1 superfamily are oligomeric (5Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P.

A. 2003; 100: 3137-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we tested for a self-interaction of human DJ-1 using yeast two-hybrid assays. Using full-length DJ-1 in both bait and prey fusion proteins, we found evidence for a strong self-interaction of DJ-1 (Fig. 1, A and B), which was markedly attenuated or abolished by deletion of relatively small sequences at either N or C termini. These results imply that full-length DJ-1 protein is required for self-interaction. Similar results were seen using deletion analysis of either bait or prey molecules. Substitution of L166P for wt protein in either bait or prey constructs produced a substantial decrease in the signal from yeast two-hybrid assays, which was undetectable if both constructs had the L166P mutation (Fig. 1C). We also tested a K130R mutant that has been reported to be deficient in sumoylation (13Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which did not affect the yeast two-hybrid interaction. We were able to confirm the previously reported interaction of DJ-1 with PIASxα (13Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The interaction with PIASxα was much less robust than the self-interaction of DJ-1 and was not detectable in the presence of the L166P DJ-1 mutation. We were able to demonstrate a self-interaction of DJ-1 in mammalian cells by transfecting in V5his-tagged DJ-1 and co-immunoprecipitating endogenous, untagged DJ-1 from HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D). The exogenous DJ-1 interacted with endogenous protein, indicating that DJ-1 forms at least a dimer and that the V5-His-tagged protein retains this property. α-Synuclein was not co-immunoprecipitated under the same conditions. We also extracted DJ-1 from transfected cells and analyzed the native protein size by FPLC gel-exclusion chromatography. A single major peak was seen at about 55 kDa, consistent with oligomerization and slightly larger than the predicted size of a DJ-1 homodimer (Fig. 1E). Low Steady State Protein Levels of L166P DJ-1 Are Due to Proteasomal Degradation—We next examined the level of expression of wild type and L166P DJ-1 in mammalian cells. All of the cell types examined (HEK293, M17, and COS-7) show robust basal expression of the DJ-1 protein. To distinguish the transfected DJ-1 from endogenous protein, we took advantage of the C-terminal V5-His tag in transfected DJ-1 to provide an additional epitope and a small increase in molecular mass from approximately 21 to 25 kDa (Fig. 2A). In transient transfection experiments, expression was similar to that of the endogenous protein in HEK293 cells and in human brain extracts (Fig. 2A). However, when we transfected L166P DJ-1 into the same cells, we found very low levels of V5-tagged protein (Fig. 2B). We considered that this might be a result of a defective plasmid, such as a deletion outside of the open reading frame that was not sequenced, but three independent clones of the same V5-tagged L166P construct gave similar results. Furthermore, an N-terminally myc-tagged construct also showed much lower levels of protein when mutated to L166P (see below). The effect was not cell type-dependent as this was seen in both HEK293 and M17 cells (Fig. 2B) and in COS-7 cells (data not shown) and was reproducible in at least triplicate independent experiments in each cell type. We compared protein and mRNA expression of wt and L166P DJ-1 in pools of stably transfected M17 human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2, C and D). As in transiently transfected cells, mutant protein was difficult to detect using either V5 or DJ-1 antibodies, requiring loading of increased protein. This was confirmed in measurements made in n = 3 lines, with eight replicate measurements per cell line (Fig. 2D), where protein expression was similarly low (data not shown). The similar levels of DJ-1 mRNA in the transfected cells suggests that the low levels of L166P protein are not due to a lack of transcription. We, therefore, considered whether this post-transcriptional effect was due to increased degradation of the protein. Two major routes for protein degradation in the cell are via lysosomes or via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To inhibit the lysosome we used 25 mm NH4Cl (23Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B.I. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8053-8061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which did not alter steady state levels of either wt or L166P DJ-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, a 5 μm concentration either of the non-competitive proteasome inhibitor lactacystin or the competitive inhibitor MG132 was able to increase the levels of L166P DJ-1 by approximately 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The relative increased protein levels with lactacystin compared with MG132 are consistent with the known potencies of the two drugs. Similar effects of both proteasome inhibitors were seen in at least triplicate experiments. The effects on wild type protein were less dramatic; although a small increase in steady state protein levels was seen with both proteasome inhibitors, neither effect was statistically significant. We additionally performed a dose-response curve for MG132 (Fig. 3, C and D). Although the effect on L166P steady state protein levels was dose-responsive, no additional benefit of MG132 at higher concentrations was noted. We ascribe this lack of enhanced effect as due to the toxicity of MG132 after 24-h exposure to concentrations above 2 μm (data not shown). In some experiments we used a construct myc-tagged at the N terminus of DJ-1. As for the constructs that were tagged with V5 at the C terminus, myc-tagged L166P DJ-1 was unstable, and steady state levels of protein were increased in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Using these high levels of expression, we saw an additional DJ-1 band of ∼29 kDa, which was more prominent after treatment with MG132. We have not been able to unambiguously identify this protein, but this is likely to be a covalent modification of DJ-1 as it is stable to SDS. We reasoned that as the L166P mutant was responsive to proteasome inhibition it is likely to be ubiquitylated and that modifying lysine acceptor sites for ubiquitin might stabilize the protein. To test this hypothesis, we generated an artificial K130R,L166P double mutant. K130R is reported to be sumoylation-deficient (13Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and as SUMO and ubiquitin can target the same lysine residue (e.g. 24), we surmised that K130R might also be deficient in ubiquitylation. K130R has recently shown to be appropriately folded (18Tao X. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31372-31379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The double mutant K130R, L166P DJ-1 was more stable than L166P alone but less stable than wild type protein, and the additional 29-kDa band was not present. MG132 increased steady state protein levels of the double mutant, indicating that the rescue of the L166P-induced protein instability was incomplete. Therefore, additional factors may play a role in the instability of the L166P protein (see “Discussion”). We have also noted distinct degradation products of K130R mutants that are not readily detected with the wild type protein. As proteasomal processing of ubiquitylated proteins usually results in small peptides and amino acids, these lower molecular weight species may represent non-proteasomal degradation of the double mutant. Localization of L166P Mutant DJ-1—Previous studies have shown that DJ-1 is found in cytoplasm and nuclei and L166P has been suggested to mislocalize to mitochondria in COS-7 (5Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). We stained transiently transfected cells (COS-7 or M17) for transfected DJ-1 and counterstained with either nuclear or mitochondrial markers (Fig. 5). Consistent with previous reports, wt DJ-1 was found in both cytoplasm and nuclei, as evidenced by overlap with nuclear dyes SYTO-64 (Fig. 5, L and Q). In most cells, there was overlap with Mitotracker, but no specific localization to mitochondria. However, in a proportion of cells, we saw decreased cytoplasmic staining and specific localization to mitochondria, although nuclear labeling was maintained (Fig. 5, C and E). This was true for both cell types examined and represented ∼10% of the total transfected cells. The signal with L166P DJ-1 was lower than that for wild type, but we were able to distinguish sufficient specific signal in transfected cells compared with untransfected cells in the same cultures by increasing sensitivity of collection on this channel (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that the overall distribution of L166P was similar to wild type protein and was localized to mitochondria in some cells (Fig. 5, J and O), but not all (Fig. 5, D and N). We additionally assessed the distribution of wt and L166P DJ-1 using subcellular fractionation by separating into crude nuclear/whole cell, mitochondrial, and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 6). Consistent with immunofluorescence data, wt DJ-1 was found in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, as well as a strong signal in the whole cell lysate that includes the nuclear fraction. We saw only a minor amount of DJ-1 in the microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) fraction. L166P DJ-1 was seen in the same fractions at lower levels, consistent with the immunofluorescence results. Therefore, the major effect of the L166P mutation is on steady state protein levels rather than distribution of the protein within the cell. There are two critical elements of knowledge about genes that cause human diseases, namely the functions of the gene product under normal circumstances and how mutations in the gene alter that function. In the present study we have assessed how the L166P point mutation causes a loss of function in DJ-1. We have shown that DJ-1 self-associates and that the L166P mutation significantly reduces the signal in yeast two-hybrid experiments. This lack of signal could be due to a reduced capacity for self-interaction or due to lower steady state levels of the protein (see below). Gel-exclusion chromatography results indicated that native DJ-1 is oligomeric and likely to be either a dimer or trimer. These data are consistent with recent x-ray diffraction data (17Honbou K.

As such, fatty acid binding to PPAR leads to changes in the transcription of many genes involved in lipid metabolism and storage. Although the composition of the intracellular NEFA pool is likely an important factor controlling PPAR activity, little information is available on factors affecting its composition. Accordingly, we have examined the effects of exogenous fatty acids on PPARα activity and NEFA pool composition in rat primary hepatocytes. Prior to the addition of fatty acids to primary hepatocytes, nonesterified unsaturated fatty acid levels are very low, representing ≤0.5% of the total fatty acid in the cell. The relative abundance of putative PPARα ligands in the NEFA pool is 20:4n-6 = 18:2n-6 = 18:1n-9 > 22:6n-3 > 18:3n-3/6 = 20:5n-3. Of these fatty acids, only 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 consistently induced PPARα activity. Metabolic labeling of primary hepatocytes indicated that both 14C-18:1n-9 and 14C-20:5n-3 are rapidly assimilated into neutral and polar lipids. Although the addition of 18:1n-9 had no effect on NEFA pool composition, 20:5n-3 mass increased >15-fold within 90 min. Changes in NEFA pool 20:5n-3 mass correlated with dynamic changes in the PPARα-regulated transcript mRNACYP4A. Metabolic labeling also indicated that a significant fraction of 14C-20:5n-3 was elongated to 22:5n-3. Cells treated with 22:5n-3 or 22:6n-3 led to a significant accumulation of 20:5n-3 in the NEFA pool through a process that requires peroxisomal β-oxidation and fatty acyl CoA thioesterase activity. Further analyses suggest that 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, but not 22:5n-3, are active ligands for PPARα. These studies suggest that basal fatty acid levels in the NEFA pool coupled with rates of fatty acid esterification, elongation, desaturation, peroxisomal β-oxidation, and fatty acyl thioestease activity are important determinants controlling NEFA pool composition and PPARα activity.

As such, fatty acid binding to PPAR leads to changes in the transcription of many genes involved in lipid metabolism and storage (1Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G.

Fatty acids enter cells through transporters, e.g. fatty acid transport proteins 2–5, and are bound by binding proteins (FABP), which may play a role in directing fatty acids to various intracellular compartments for metabolism and gene expression (3McArthur M.J.

Esterification of fatty acids into triglycerides, polar lipids, and cholesterol esters and their β-oxidation (mitochondrial and peroxisomal) requires conversion of fatty acids to fatty acyl CoA thioesters (6Coleman R.A.

Other pathways, like microsomal NADPH-dependent mono-oxidation and eicosanoid synthesis, utilize nonesterified fatty acids as substrates. These reactions are likely to influence cellular levels of activating ligands. In the case of PPARα and PPARγ, formation of eicosanoids may be important routes for receptor activation (2Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because PPARs are known to bind nonesterified fatty acids (1Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A.

Cell. 1999; 3: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to expect that the composition of the intracellular NEFA pool is an important determinant in the control of PPAR activity. The composition of the intracellular NEFA pool is affected by the concentration of exogenous fatty acids entering cells, their rate of removal via acyl CoA-synthetase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, e.g. microsomal monooxygenation, and the return of NEFA or oxidized lipids to the NEFA pool as a result of lipid metabolism. In addition, fatty acid structure may also be an important determinant. For instance, 18- and 20-carbon N6-PUFA, but not N3-PUFA, are preferred substrates for cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-dependent eicosanoid synthesis (10Jump D.B. J. Biol.

Hepatic parenchymal cells have little or no cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase activity but have robust NADPH-dependent CYP monooxygenase activity (14Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Jump D.B. J.

Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Clearly, the factors contributing to the composition of the intracellular NEFA pool are complex. Added to this, drugs, disease, and genetic background are likely to affect lipid metabolism and NEFA pool composition, which in turn affects fatty acid-regulated nuclear receptor activity. In an effort to better understand how cellular metabolism contributes to the control of fatty acid-regulated transcription factor activity, we have taken advantage of previous findings for the fatty acid regulation of PPARα in primary rat hepatocytes. In vivo feeding studies have shown that when calories supplied as saturated and monounsaturated fat are ≤20% of total calories, hepatic PPARα-regulated transcripts, like acyl CoA oxidase and cytochrome P-450–4A (CYP4A) are marginally affected (15Ren B.

Substituting fish oil, a rich source of 20- and 22-carbon N3-PUFA, leads to a pronounced induction of enzymes involved in lipid oxidation. Eicosapentaenoic acid (20: 5n-3), a known PPARα ligand (1Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A.

Moreover, PUFA induction of these transcripts requires a functional PPARα. However, other PPARα ligands, like 18:1n-9 and 20:4n-6, have little effect on PPARα activity or PPARα-regulated genes in cultured primary hepatocytes (16Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

The differential effects of putative fatty acid ligands on PPARα activity and hepatic gene expression raises the question of the role hepatic metabolism plays in the control of PPARα activity. Accordingly, we have carried out a detailed analysis of fatty acid regulation of PPARα as well as fatty acid metabolism in primary hepatocytes. These studies will document dynamic changes in the intracellular NEFA pool composition and effects on PPARα-regulated hepatic gene expression. In addition, our studies will provide evidence for β-oxidation products of 22-carbon fatty acids in the NEFA pool and their effects on PPARα activity.

For metabolic labeling and RNA studies, the cells were plated onto 50- or 100-mm Primaria plastic dishes at 3 × 106 or 107 cells/plate, respectively, in Williams E with 10 mm lactate, 10 nm dexamethasone, 100 nm insulin, and 10% fetal calf serum. After a 4–6-h attachment period, the medium was changed to a serum-free medium, Williams E with 10 mm lactate, 10 nm dexamethasone, and 100 nm insulin. For transfection studies, the cells were plated in the same medium onto 6-well Primaria plastic dishes at 106 cells/well. The cells were transfected in this serum-free medium using Lipofectin (6 μl/μg DNA) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (1.3 μl/μg DNA) (Invitrogen) as described (14Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Jump D.B. J.

The TKMH100x4-Luc reporter contains four binding sites for the Gal4-DNA-binding domain. phRG-Luc was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and served as a control for transfection efficiency as well as nonspecific effects on promoter activity. The medium was changed the next morning to Williams E with 25 mm glucose, 10 nm dexamethasone, 100 nm insulin, fatty acid (NuChek Prep, Elysian, MN), and bovine serum albumin (BSA to fatty acid ratio was 1:5) or the PPARα agonist, WY14,643 (Chemsyn Science Laboratories, Lenexa, KS). After 24 h of treatment, the cells were harvested for luciferase assays. Each treatment involves triplicate samples, and each study was repeated at least twice. The results are expressed as relative luciferase activity: firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity. RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Primary hepatocytes were plated onto 100-mm primary plates at 107 cells/plate and treated as described above. RNA was extracted from rat primary hepatocytes using Triazol (Invitrogen) and separated electrophoretically in denaturating agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 32P-cDNA for CYP4A (16Ren B.

Levels of hybridization were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphoimager 820 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Fatty Acid Metabolism—Primary hepatocytes were plated in the same medium as described above but onto 50-mm Primaria plastic dishes at 3 × 106 cells/plate. The ratio of culture medium to cell number was maintained constant for the different plating conditions. The cells were treated with different fatty acids (see figure legends for details) essentially as described for gene expression studies. The cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium prior to fatty acid treatment. For metabolic labeling studies, the cells were treated with 14C-labeled fatty acids in 3 ml of medium containing 250 μm fatty acid (0.5 μCi, 1.7 Ci/mol) (20Pawar A. Xu J. Jerks E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39243-39250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled fatty acids were purchased from (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonradioactive fatty acids were purchased from NuChek Prep. Fatty acid-free BSA (Roche Applied Science) was included at a ratio of fatty acid to BSA of 5:1. After fatty acid treatment, the medium was collected, the cells were washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline and 40 μm BSA, washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 500 μl of 40% methanol (20Pawar A.

This washing method minimizes contamination of cellular lipids with unincorporated free fatty acids. The methanol extract of cells was acidified with HCl to 0.25 n, and lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) containing 1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The protein and aqueous phases were re-extracted with chloroform. The organic phases were pooled, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform and 1 mm BHT, and stored at -80 °C. 14C-Labeled lipid extracts were further fractionated by thin layer chromatography (LK6D Silica G 60A; Whatman) and developed in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (90:30:1). The distribution of 14C-fatty acids in various lipid fractions was visualized by exposure of the TLC to a phosphorimaging screen (Amersham Biosciences), and the levels of radioactivity were quantified. The location of lipids was compared with authentic standards for triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, cholesterol ester, fatty acids, fatty acid (wax) esters, and glycerol- and sphino-phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids). The uptake of 14C-fatty acids into cells and the organic fraction was quantified by scintillation counting. The depletion of 14C-labeled fatty acids from medium was quantified by scintillation counting and TLC followed by phosphorimaging analysis as described above. The NEFA fraction in total cellular lipids was fractionated on aminopropyl columns (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) (20Pawar A. Xu J. Jerks E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol.

Lipid extracts in chloroform and 1 mm BHT were applied to amino-propyl columns (100 mg) and washed extensively with chloroform:isopropanol (2:1) to remove neutral lipids. NEFA were eluted with diethyl ether and 2% acetic acid. Phospholipids were retained on the column. The diethyl ether, 2% acetic acid fraction was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in methanol and 10 μm BHT, and used directly for RP-HPLC fractionation and quantification of unsaturated fatty acids. The fractional recovery of NEFA from whole cell lipid extracts was ≥95%. RP-HPLC Analysis of Unsaturated Fatty Acids—The total extracted lipids were saponified (0.4 n KOH in 80% methanol for 1 h at 50 °C), neutralized, extracted in diethyl ether and 1% acetic acid, dried, and resuspended in methanol and 0.1 mm BHT for RP-HPLC analysis (reverse phase C18 column; Symmetry Shield, 2487 UV detector set to 192 nm with a 600 Controller; Waters Corp., Milford, MA). A linear gradient of 22 to 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid over 40 min was used to fractionate unsaturated fatty acids (20Pawar A. Xu J. Jerks E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39243-39250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Verification and quantification of unsaturated fatty acids by RP-HPLC used authentic fatty acid standards (NuChek Prep) and Win-flow Radio HPLC software (IN/US Systems, Inc, Tampa, FL). The identity of specific fatty acids was verified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry at the mass spectrometry facility at Michigan State University. Effect of Unsaturated Fatty Acids on PPARα Activity in Primary Hepatocytes—To examine the effect of unsaturated fatty acids on PPARα activity in primary hepatocytes, the cells were transfected with a chimeric receptor composed of the PPARα ligand-binding domain (LBD) fused to a Gal4-DNA-binding domain. Co-transfection with the TKMH100x4Luc reporter allows for an examination of changes in PPARα activity without recruitment of its heterodimer partner, retinoid X receptor, a prospective target for fatty acid control (21Mata de Urquiza A. Liu S. Sjoberg M Zetterstrom R.H. Criffith W Sjovall J. Perlmann T. Science. 2000; 290: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were treated with various unsaturated fatty acids at 250 μm (Fig. 1A). The 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids bind PPARα in vitro with affinities (IC50) ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 μm (1Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Milburn M.V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Binding affinities for the 22-carbon fatty acids, 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, have not been reported. Of the putative PPARα ligands tested, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 consistently induced PPARα. The 18-carbon fatty acids 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3 and the 20-carbon N6-PUFA, 20:4n-6 did not consistently affect PPARα activity. For comparison, WY14,643 induced PPARα activity nearly 6-fold. A dose response analysis reveals the difference in effect of two prospective ligands on PPARα activity (Fig. 1B). Increasing the dose of 20:5n-3 significantly induced PPARα activity (∼8-fold at 1 mm), whereas a comparable dose of 18:1n-9 had no effect. These studies confirm previous findings on the differential effects of these putative ligands on PPARα activity in primary hepatocytes (15Ren B. Thelen A. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These studies also indicate that the difference in effect of these two fatty acids on PPARα activity cannot be explained on the basis of treatment dose alone. In addition, by using the Gal4-PPARα-LBD chimeric receptor, these studies indicate that 22-carbon PUFAs are activators of PPARα in primary hepatocytes and exclude a role for retinoid X receptor heterodimerization for this action. In the studies to follow, we will first examine the metabolic basis for the differential effect of 18:1n-9 and 20:5n-3 on PPARα activity. Because structural studies suggest that fatty acids with >20 carbons are poor ligands (1Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Milburn M.V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), the second part of the study will determine whether the 22-carbon PUFA effect on PPARα activity is due to its conversion to an active ligand, e.g. 20:5n-3. Analysis of the Hepatocellular Unsaturated Fatty Acid Mass prior to Fatty Acid Treatment—Numerous reports with a variety of cell lines indicate that a broad array of fatty acids affect PPAR activity (2Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). In fact, our studies with the rat hepatoma cell line, FTO2B, indicates that, with the exception of 22:5n-3, all of the fatty acids examined in Fig. 1 induce PPARα ≥2-fold. 2A. Pawar and D. B. Jump, unpublished observation. We hypothesized that the difference in fatty acid responsiveness of rat primary hepatocytes and established cell lines is related to the distribution of fatty acids in the NEFA pool. Accordingly, the mass of hepatocellular fatty acids in the total saponified lipid fraction and in the NEFA pool was examined. Our analysis focused only on unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 2). The abundance of total saponified and NEFA in primary hepatocytes shows that the prominent unsaturated fatty acids include 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, and 20:4n-6. Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) is of intermediate abundance, whereas 18:3n-3, 18: 3n-6, 20:5n-3, 22:4n-6, and 22:5n-3 are low abundance unsaturated fatty acids in primary hepatocytes. The relative abundance of these unsaturated fatty acids is comparable with fatty acid profiles reported for liver (22Salem H.J. Spiller G.S. Scala J. Current Topics in Nutrition and Disease. Vol. 22. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New, York1989: 109-128Google Scholar, 23Christiansen E.N. Lund J.S. Rortveit T. Rustan A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NEFA pool displays nearly the same relative abundance of fatty acids as seen in the total saponified lipid fraction, i.e. 18:1n-9 = 18:2n-6 = 20:6n-6 > 22:6n-3 > 18:3n-3/6 = 20:5n-3. Moreover, this profile is similar to the array of fatty acids bound to l-FABP (24Murphy E.J. Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. Colles S Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As expected, the mass of fatty acids in the NEFA pool is very low, representing ≤0.5% of the total saponified fatty acid level. For comparison, 18:1n-9 is the predominant fatty acid in the total saponified (480 nmol/mg protein) and NEFA (2.2 nmol/mg protein) fractions in FTO2B cells. All other unsaturated fatty acids are very low: <50 nmol/mg protein in the saponified fraction and <0.2 nmol/mg protein in the NEFA fraction. 2A. Pawar and D. B. Jump, unpublished observation. The profile of fatty acids in FTO2B cells parallels the distribution of fatty acids in the fetal calf serum used to maintain the cells. Thus, FTO2B cells display a very different fatty acid profile from primary hepatocytes. Metabolic Labeling of Primary Hepatocytes—Because of the striking difference in effect of 18:1n-9 and 20:5n-3 on PPARα activity and the >100-fold difference in mass of 18:1n-9 and 20:5n-3, we examined the metabolism of these fatty acids in primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were treated with 14C-labeled fatty acids at 250 μm for 1.5, 6, and 24 h. Within 6 h of treatment, nearly ≥80% of each fatty acid was cleared from the medium; by 24 h of treatment essentially all exogenously added fatty acids were cleared from the medium (not shown). A difference in fatty acid clearance and assimilation into the organic extracts was observed only at the 1.5-h time point (Fig. 3); 140 and 230 nmol/mg protein of fatty acid accumulated in cells receiving 18:1n-9 and 20:5n-3, respectively. By 6 h, the mass of exogenous 18:1n-9 exceeded 20:5n-3 by ∼15%, and by 24 h, there was no difference. Primary hepatocytes assimilate a fraction of exogenous fatty acids into complex lipids, which are then packaged into lipoprotein particles (very low density lipoprotein) and released to the medium. The amount of exogenous fatty acid appearing in the medium as triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester at the 1.5- and 6-h time points was not different between the two fatty acids and represented 1 and 5% of the total exogenous fatty acid added to hepatocytes. By 24 h, levels of 14C-fatty acid appearing in complex lipids increased to 15% for 18:1n-9-treated cells and 9% for 20:5n-3-treated cells (not shown). Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) has a modest repressive effect on release of complex lipids from primary hepatocytes, a finding consistent with the well known effect of fish oils on hepatic very low density lipoprotein production and secretion (25Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X. Wu X. Wang H. Jamil H. Sparks J.D. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27855-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Lang C.A. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2079-2086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because intracellular lipids are the likely regulators of PPARs, we focused on the distribution of exogenous fatty acids in various intracellular lipid fractions. The 14C-fatty acids were distributed to five fractions: triacylglycerols (∼80%) > polar lipids (∼10–15%) > cholesterol esters (variable) > diacylglycerol (∼3%) (Fig. 3) > NEFA (Fig. 4). In contrast to in vitro studies (13Berge R.K. Madsen L. Vaagenes H. Tronstad K.J. Gottlicher M. Rustan A.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), these results indicate that both 18:1n-9 and 20: 5n-3 are good substrates for di- and tri-acylglycerol formation. 14C-Fatty acids recovered as cholesterol esters increased over time. In vitro studies have suggested that 20-carbon unsaturated fatty acids are poor substrates for cholesterol ester synthesis (12Seo T. Oelkers P.M. Giattina M.R. Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Deckelbaum R.U. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4756-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At the 1.5- and 6-h time points, >50% less 20:5n-3 is assimilated into cholesterol ester than 18:1n-9. By 24 h, however, this difference was not apparent. This may be due to the fact that by 24 h, 20:5n-3, but not 18:1n-9, attenuates secretion of cholesterol ester and triglycerides to the medium as very low density lipoprotein, leading to retention of cholesterol esters and triglycerides in cells. The fraction of fatty acid recovered as NEFA was measured by two methods (Fig. 4). The TLC method examines only the level of 14C-fatty acid recovered as NEFA and reflects the mass of the exogenous fatty acid. The HPLC method measures total mass of NEFA. The approach allows us to describe the effect of exogenous fatty acids on NEFA pool comp"
https://openalex.org/W1995194065,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 acts as a potent growth inhibitor of prostate epithelial cells, and aberrant function of its receptor type I and II correlates with tumor aggressiveness. However, intracellular and serum TGF-beta1 levels are elevated in prostate cancer patients and further increased in patients with metastatic carcinoma, suggesting the oncogenic switch of TGF-beta1 role in prostate tumorigenesis. Recently, we reported the mitogenic conversion of TGF-beta1 effect by oncogenic Ha-Ras in prostate cancer cells. Here, we show that TGF-beta1 activates interleukin (IL)-6, which has been implicated in the malignant progression of prostate cancers, via multiple signaling pathways including Smad2, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), JNK, and Ras. TGF-beta1-induced IL-6 gene expression was strongly inhibited by DN-Smad2 but not by DN-Smad3 while it was further activated by wild-type Smad2 transfection. IL-6 activation by TGF-beta1 was accompanied by nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which was blocked by the p38 inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580 or by IkappaBalphaDeltaN transfection, indicating the crucial role for the p38-NF-kappaB signaling in TGF-beta1 induction of IL-6. TGF-beta1 activated c-Jun phosphorylation, and IL-6 induction by TGF-beta1 was severely impeded by DN-c-Jun and DN-JNK or AP-1 inhibitor curcumin, showing that the JNK-c-Jun-AP-1 signaling plays a pivotal role in TGF-beta1 stimulation of IL-6. It was also found that the Ras-Raf-MEK1 cascade is activated by TGF-beta1 and participates in the TGF-beta1 induction of IL-6 in an AP-1-dependent manner. Cotransfection assays demonstrated that TGF-beta1 stimulation of IL-6 results from the synergistic collaboration of the Smad2, p38-NF-kappaB, JNK-c-Jun-AP-1, or Ras-Raf-MEK1 cascades. In addition, a time course IL-6 decay revealed that mRNA stability of IL-6 is modestly increased by TGF-beta1, indicating that TGF-beta1 also regulates IL-6 at the post-transcriptional level. Intriguingly, IL-6 inactivation restored the sensitivity to TGF-beta1-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis, suggesting that elevated IL-6 in advanced prostate tumors might act as a resistance factor against TGF-beta1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IL-6 expression is stimulated by tumor-producing TGF-beta1 in human prostate cancer cells through multiple signaling pathways including Smad2, p38, JNK, and Ras, and enhanced expression of IL-6 could contribute to the oncogenic switch of TGF-beta1 role for prostate tumorigenesis, in part by counteracting its growth suppression function."
https://openalex.org/W1981057091,"We report that human galectin-1 (dGal-1), a small dimeric β-galactoside-binding protein, induces phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, measured by Annexin V staining, on human promyelocytic HL-60 cells, T leukemic MOLT-4 cells, and fMet-Leu-Phe-activated, but not resting, human neutrophils. This effect of dGal-1 on HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells is enhanced by pretreatment of the cells with neuraminidase, but treatment of resting neutrophils with neuraminidase does not enhance their sensitivity to dGal-1. Although the induction of staining with Annexin V is often associated with apoptosis, the dGal-1-treated HL-60 cells, MOLT-4 cells, and activated neutrophils do not undergo apoptosis, and there is no detectable DNA fragmentation. HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells treated with dGal-1 continue to grow normally. By contrast, camptothecin-treated HL-60 cells, etoposide-treated MOLT-4 cells, and anti-Fas-treated neutrophils exhibit extensive DNA fragmentation and/or cell death. Lactose inhibits the dGal-1-induced effects, indicating that dGal-1-induced signaling requires binding to cell surface β-galactosides. The dimeric form of Gal-1 is required for signaling, because a monomeric mutant form of Gal-1, termed mGal-1, binds to cells but does not cause these effects. Importantly, dGal-1, but not mGal-1, treatment of HL-60 cells and activated human neutrophils significantly promotes their phagocytosis by activated mouse macrophages. These dGal-1-induced effects are distinguishable from apoptosis, but like apoptotic agents, prepare cells for phagocytic removal. Such effects of dGal-1 may contribute to leukocyte homeostasis.

It is believed that the turnover of neutrophils and other leukocytes in tissues involves programmed cell death (apoptosis) and then phagocytosis by tissue macrophages (1Homburg C.H. Roos D. Curr.

Such observations led us to explore whether the basement membrane and extracellular matrix might harbor other proteins capable of binding to leukocytes and inducing their apoptosis or phagocytic recognition. A candidate protein is the β-galactoside-binding protein termed galectin-1 (dGal-1), which binds to most leukocytes. dGal-1 is a widely expressed dimeric protein (subunit ∼14.6 kDa), which is a member of the galectin family of lectins (17Cooper D.N.

To explore the biological activity of dGal-1 toward leukocytes, we prepared a recombinant form of dimeric human dGal-1 and a mutated, monomeric form of galectin-1 (mGal-1). We explored the interactions of these lectins with HL-60 cells, MOLT-4 cells, and both resting and activated human neutrophils. Our results show that dGal-1, but not mGal-1, rapidly enhances surface staining with Annexin V (phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure) in desialylated HL-60 cells, desialylated MOLT-4 cells, and activated, but not resting, human neutrophils. The exposure of PS is often associated with apoptosis (35Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp.

However, dGal-1 does not induce apoptosis, because no DNA fragmentation is observed in dGal-1-treated cells, and HL-60 cells and MOLT-4 cells continue to grow normally.

Thus, dGal-1-induced effects are distinguishable from apoptosis yet prepare cells for phagocytic recognition. These results suggest that dGal-1 could induce surface changes that play a role in leukocyte turnover in tissues independently of apoptosis. Preparation of dGal-1 and mGal-1—The cDNA for human dGal-1 was cloned by PCR from the published sequence (38Couraud P.O. Casentini-Borocz D. Bringman T.S. Griffith J. McGrogan M. Nedwin G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1310-1316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hirabayashi J. Ayaki H. Soma G. Kasai K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The recombinant form of human dGal-1 was purified as described previously (40Cho M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5198-5206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) employing affinity chromatography on lactosyl-Sepharose, and the protein was eluted with lactose. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of PBS (0.01 m Na2HPO4, 0.01 m Na2HPO4, 0.85% NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 2-ME (14 mm), and the bound dGal-1 and mGal-1 were eluted with PBS containing 2-ME (14 mm) and lactose (0.1 m). To confirm that the purified protein quantitatively retained carbohydrate-binding activity, the protein was re-chromatographed on lactosyl-Sepharose. The elution profile of the re-purified dGal-1 revealed a single peak of protein that was quantitatively eluted with lactose (data not shown). In some studies we heat-inactivated the dGal-1 by heating the protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml to 100 °C for 10 min. The treated sample remained in suspension, although cloudy, and was inactive, because it was unable to bind lactosyl-Sepharose. To generate a monomeric form of the protein (mGal-1), we used PCR primer-directed mutagenesis as described for the hamster-derived Gal-1 (41Cho M. Cummings R.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13081-13088Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to place a Ser residue codon at the Cys-2 position and an Asp residue at the Val-5 position. The cDNAs for dGal-1 and mGal-1 were ligated into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the plasmid PQE-50 (Qiagen). Both dGal-1 and mGal-1 were expressed at high levels in transformed Escherichia coli. dGal-1 and mGal-1 were purified from sonicated E. coli cell extracts on columns of lactosyl-Sepharose as described above. Human dGal-1 at a concentration from 2–80 μm behaves as a dimeric protein on size-exclusion chromatography, whereas mGal-1 behaves as a monomeric species under the same conditions, using experimental approaches previously described (41Cho M. Cummings R.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13081-13088Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The detailed characterization of the binding properties and kinetics of subunit association of human dGal-1 and mGal-1 will be described elsewhere. 2M. Cho, H. Zhu, C. Brower, R. P. McEver, and R. D. Cummings, submitted for publication. Cell Lines and Enzymatic Desialylation—HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in complete RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 milliunits/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To desialylate the cells, HL-60 cells or MOLT-4 cells (3 × 107 cells) were treated with 100 milliunits of Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (Sigma) in 500 μl of complete RPMI for 1 h at 37 °C. The treated cells were washed twice with RPMI before use. Isolation, Activation, and Desialylation of Neutrophils—Heparinized blood was obtained from normal donors. Neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis, and density gradient centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) as described previously (42Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Typically, the polymorphonuclear cells were >90% neutrophils by Wright-Giemsa staining and >90% CD16+ as assessed by flow cytometry. Neutrophils were activated by treatment with fMet-Leu-Phe (Sigma, 1.0 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of HBSS/HSA (Ca2+-Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.2% HSA). Desialylated neutrophils were prepared by treating 1 × 107 neutrophils with A. ureafaciens neuraminidase (Sigma, 100 milliunits) in 500 μl of HBSS/HSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with HBSS/HSA before use. Flow Cytometry—Galectins and the sialic acid binding plant lectin Maackia amurensis leukoagglutinin (MAL) (Vector Laboratories) (43Wang W.C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were biotinylated by using EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce). Cells were incubated with biotinylated forms of the lectins (10 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice and washed twice with sterile PBS. The washed cells were incubated with FITC-streptavidin (1:100 dilution, Sigma), washed with sterile PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur equipped with a 488-nm argon laser (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 in the absence of either MAL, dGal-1, or mGal-1 in complete RPMI or HBSS/HSA. In the case of dGal-1 and mGal-1, we used control treatments in which lactose (20 mm) was included during the incubations to inhibit galectin binding. After this incubation, all cells either treated or untreated with galectins were treated with lactose (20 mm) in sterile PBS to remove galectins. The lactose-treated cells were washed at least two times in sterile PBS and then incubated in a 100-μl final volume in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl2,5mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) with a mixture of FITC-conjugated Annexin V (Roche Applied Science, 2 μlof conjugate per 100 μl of resuspended cells, as described by the manufacturer) and PI (Molecular Probes, 1 μg/ml final concentration) at room temperature for 15 min. Into this tube was pipetted 300 μl of HEPES buffer, and the sample was analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur. As known inducers of apoptosis, we used camptothecin (Calbiochem, 0–25 μm), etoposide (Calbiochem, 20 μm), and IgM anti-Fas (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 250 ng/ml). Resting and activated neutrophils were stained with anti-MAC 1 antibody (anti-CD11b, Caltag) and anti-L-selectin antibody (purified DREG 56) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Approximately 1 × 106 neutrophils were washed once in HBSS and resuspended in 100 μl of HBSS/HSA. The specific antibodies were added at a final concentration of 10–20 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Then the cells were washed twice with HBSS before resuspension in 100 μlof HBSS/HSA. Goat anti-mouse F(ab)2 conjugated to FITC was then added, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C for an additional 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with HBSS before resuspending them in HBSS/HSA for flow cytometric analysis. Confocal Microscopy—At the end of incubations with galectins, cells were washed with 20 mm lactose in PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in PBS with the DNA stain Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml, Molecular Probes). These cells were then stained with a mixture of FITC-conjugated Annexin V and PI and analyzed by confocal microscopy on a Leica TCS NT Microscope. DNA Fragmentation Assays—To detect DNA fragmentation, two approaches were used. In the first approach, cells were subjected to the TUNEL assay. Cells were treated with or without dGal-1 (20 μm for 8 h), the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (15 μm for 4 h), or anti-Fas mouse monoclonal IgG antibody (R & D Systems, 100 ng/ml for 8 h). Cells were then washed with lactose (20 mm), fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde buffered with PBS, and permeabilized with 70% ethanol on ice. The TUNEL reaction (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) was conducted by incubating the cells for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture. The cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the second approach, we examined DNA fragmentation by gel electrophoresis. After treatments of cells with galectins or other reagents as described above, 1 × 107 cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in EDTA (20 mm), Tris-HCl (50 mm), pH 7.5, and then microcentrifuged to remove pelleted, insoluble material. The supernatants were then treated with RNase A (5 μg/μl) for 2 h at 56 °C, followed by digestion with proteinase K (2.5 μg/μl) for 2 h at 37 °C. A half volume of ammonium acetate (10 m) was added, and DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol. DNA was recovered by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 min and dissolved in gel loading buffer. Finally, DNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 1.6% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (44Sorenson C.M. Barry M.A. Eastman A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Determination of HL-60 and MOLT-4 Cell Growth in the Presence of dGal-1—Desialylated HL-60 cells (1.8 × 105/ml) or MOLT-4 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with or without dGal-1 (20 μm) in complete RPMI in 12-well plates (2 ml/well). Cells were collected at 24-h intervals, washed with lactose (20 mm), pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS. Live cell counts were determined by trypan blue exclusion and counting with a hemacytometer in duplicate assays. Camptothecin (Calbiochem, 20 μm) and etoposide (Calbiochem, 20 μm) were used in control experiments to induce apoptosis. Phagocytosis Assays—The standard macrophage phagocytosis assay was utilized as described (45Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zhuang J. Ren Y. Snowden R.T. Zhu H. Gogvadze V. Savill J.S. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15628-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, peritoneal macrophages were collected from mice treated intraperitoneally with Brewer's thioglycolate (Difco, 4%), and the isolated macrophages were cultured in a 24-well plate. The macrophage monolayer was washed with PBS, before use. dGal-1- or mGal-1-treated cells, untreated cells (negative control), in vitro aged human neutrophils that had been incubated in vitro for 24 h at 37 °C in HBSS/HSA (positive control), or camptothecin-treated HL-60 cells (positive control), were added to each well containing macrophages and incubated for1hat37 °C. After incubation, each well was washed in ice-cold PBS and treated briefly with trypsin (0.25%) to remove lightly adherent cells. The macrophages were fixed with paraformaldehyde (1.8%), and phagocytosis was microscopically evaluated by counting 200 macrophages/well in each duplicate well and noting those macrophages that had visibly enlarged and contained visibly phagocytosed cells. Results were then expressed as the percentage of macrophages that had phagocytosed cells (% phagocytosis), as described by Fadok et al. (45Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar) and as modified by Zhuang et al. (46Zhuang J. Ren Y. Snowden R.T. Zhu H. Gogvadze V. Savill J.S. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15628-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding of dGal-1 and mGal-1 to HL-60 Cells, MOLT-4 Cells, Resting Human Neutrophils, and Activated Human Neutrophils—The human recombinant galectin-1 preparation was purified by affinity chromatography on lactosyl-Sepharose, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity and stability of the purified protein was demonstrated by the quantitative rebinding of the material to a column of lactosyl-Sepharose (data not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions demonstrated that the protein was apparently homogeneous and migrated with a molecular mass of ∼14.9 kDa (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the protein used in the studies below was quantitatively active and pure. Similar purification and activity profiles were obtained with mGal-1, the monomeric mutant form of galectin-1 (data not shown), prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Human dGal-1 at a concentration from 2–80 μm behaves as a dimeric protein on size-exclusion chromatography, whereas mGal-1 behaves as a monomeric species under the same conditions, using experimental approaches previously described (41Cho M. Cummings R.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13081-13088Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We examined the binding of dGal-1 and mGal-1 to HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line. Both dGal-1 and mGal-1 bound to HL-60 cells, but enzymatic desialylation of the cells significantly enhanced the binding of both lectins (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). The binding of both dGal-1 and mGal-1 was inhibitable by lactose. We confirmed the effectiveness of enzymatic desialylation by examining the binding of the sialic acid-specific lectin MAL, which recognizes NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4Glc-NAc-R linkages (43Wang W.C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic desialylation of HL-60 cells (dsHL-60 cells) decreased the binding of MAL (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that both dGal-1 and mGal-1 bind equivalently to HL-60 cells and that enzymatic desialylation of the cells exposes more binding sites for both lectins. We then assessed the binding of dGal-1 to normal human leukocytes. For these studies we used resting neutrophils, enzymatically desialylated resting neutrophils, and fMet-Leu-Phe-activated neutrophils. dGal-1 bound to resting neutrophils, but it bound at higher levels to activated neutrophils (Fig. 1D). The binding of dGal-1 was largely inhibitable by inclusion of lactose (20 mm) (Fig. 1D). dGal-1 binding was enhanced to enzymatically desialylated resting neutrophils (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained using mGal-1 (data not shown). The enzymatic desialylation of resting neutrophils was effective, as shown by the higher binding of MAL to resting neutrophils than to enzymatically desialylated resting neutrophils (Fig. 1E). We also observed that activation of neutrophils without treatment of the cells with neuraminidase, also slightly reduced their binding to MAL, consistent with a possible loss or redistribution of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates upon activation (Fig. 1E). In control studies, we confirmed the activation of neutrophils, because activation resulted in up-regulation of MAC-1 expression and down-regulation of L-selectin expression (47Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F). These results demonstrate that dGal-1 binds to resting neutrophils but binds slightly more to activated neutrophils. PS Exposure on Leukocytes Induced by Treatment with dGal-1—Based on observations by others that dGal-1 appears to induce apoptosis in some leukocytes (31Perillo N.L. Uittenbogaart C.H. Nguyen J.T.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811PubMed Google Scholar), we assessed whether dGal-1 could induce apoptosis of neutrophils by assessing the staining of cells by Annexin V. Apoptosis is often accompanied by increased exposure of cell surface PS, which is recognized by Annexin V (35Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2556) Google Scholar, 36Rimon G. Bazenet C.E. Philpott K.L. Rubin L.L. J. Neurosci.

Blood. 1995; 85: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). dGal-1 treatment of resting human neutrophils did not significantly induce PS exposure (Fig. 2A). In addition, dGal-1 treatment of enzymatically desialylated resting neutrophils, while increasing their binding to dGal-1 (Fig. 1D), did not significantly induce surface exposure of PS (Fig. 2A). By contrast, dGal-1 treatment of fMet-Leu-Phe-activated neutrophils markedly enhanced their staining with Annexin V (Fig. 2B). Lactose inhibited the effects of dGal-1 on activated neutrophils (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that carbohydrate ligands on the cell surface are required for the dGal-1-induced staining of these cells with Annexin V (Table I and Fig. 2, A and B). dGal-1-treated neutrophils stained with Annexin V remained impermeable, as measured by the lack of staining with PI (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that changes induced by dGal-1 are not associated with membrane leakage. These results demonstrate that dGal-1 induces surface PS exposure in activated but not resting neutrophils.Table IInduction of PS exposure on human cell lines by dimeric dGal-1Treatment, Experiment 1% of cells staining with Annexin VaHL-60 cells or MOLT-4 cells (106 cells) (either untreated or desialylated by neuraminidase treatment, ds) were treated with dGal-1 (20 μm) or mGal-1 (20 μm) in the presence or absence of lactose (20 mm) for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with lactose (20 mm) and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI. The dashed line signifies lack of treatment.

This activated cysteine can be easily overoxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid or cysteine sulfonic acid, especially under oxidative stress conditions. The regeneration of peroxiredoxins after a short, intense oxidative stress was studied, using a proteomics approach. Important differences in regeneration speed were found, prx2 being the fastest regenerated protein, followed by prx1, whereas prx3 and prx6 were regenerated very slowly. Further study of the mechanism of this regeneration by pulse-chase experiments using stable isotope labeling and cycloheximide demonstrated that the fast-regenerating peroxiredoxins are regenerated at least in part by a retroreduction mechanism. This demonstrates that the overoxidation can be reversible under certain conditions. The pathway of this retroreduction and the reasons explaining the various regeneration speeds of the peroxiredoxins remain to be elucidated.

Among the enzymes detoxifying reactive oxygen species, peroxiredoxins (prx) 1The abbreviations used are: prx, peroxiredoxin; AspN, peptidyl-Asp metalloendopeptidase (3.4.24.33); MALDI-TOF; matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: prx, peroxiredoxin; AspN, peptidyl-Asp metalloendopeptidase (3.4.24.33); MALDI-TOF; matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry. appear as a special class both for their catalytic mechanism and for their ubiquitous localization in cells. Furthermore, although their catalytic activity appears to be inferior to the more classical peroxidases (1Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), they seem to play a key role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (2Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In addition to their catalytic role, they also bind to various cellular proteins such as proto-oncogenes (3Wen S.T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 4Mu Z.M. Yin X.Y. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43175-43184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and modulate their activities. One of the peculiarities of peroxiredoxins is their catalytic mechanism. They represent a special type of peroxidases, as the protein is the reducing substrate itself. In the general case (e.g. glutathione peroxidase) the enzyme reduces the peroxide while oxidizing a co-substrate (e.g. glutathione). In the case of peroxiredoxins, the enzyme contains an activated cysteine at the active site (5Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and can contain another conserved cysteine (6Hirotsu S. Abe Y. Okada K. Nagahara N. Hori H. Nishino T. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12333-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Declercq J.P. Evrard C. Clippe A. Vander Stricht D. Bernard A. Knoops B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the normal catalytic cycle, the activated cysteine is oxidized to cysteine sulfenic acid (5Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) or to a disulphide (8Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when a peroxide is reduced. To complete the enzymatic catalytic cycle, the peroxiredoxins are then reduced back to their active thiol form, for example by the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system for 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (9Kwon S.J. Park J.W. Choi W.K. Kim I.H. Kim K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 201: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), (8Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, peroxiredoxins are also prone to overoxidation phenomena, in which the active site cysteine is oxidized to a sulfinic acid (10Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or even to a sulfonic acid (12Wagner E. Luche S. Penna L. Chevallet M. Van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Lunardi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19396-19401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This of course leads to the inactivation of the enzyme, even in the presence of thioredoxin-based regenaration system (11Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Such overoxidation phenomena are encountered in various situations in vivo, but are very prominent under oxidative stress conditions, where more than 90% of all peroxiredoxins can be converted to the overoxidized forms (12Wagner E. Luche S. Penna L. Chevallet M. Van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Lunardi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19396-19401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This poses in turn the problem of cell survival after a strong oxidative stress, once all the peroxiredoxins have been overoxidized. If the active peroxiredoxins are indeed essential to aerobic life, as suggested by some experiments (2Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), the cell needs to regenerate active peroxiredoxins after oxidative stress. It has been recently suggested that overoxidized peroxiredoxins can be reduced back to the active form during recovery after oxidative stress, prx1 being taken as an example (15Woo H.A. Chae H.Z.

We thus decided to investigate the regeneration of peroxiredoxins after oxidative stress in more detail using the proteomics toolbox, which is able to deconvolute the overoxidized forms from those involved in the normal catalytic cycle (11Yang K.S.

Cell Culture and Oxidative Stress—HeLa S3 cells were cultured in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 10% fetal calf serum. Oxidative stress was performed by adding to the culture medium 75 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide for 2 h. In the first series of experiments using labeling with stable isotopes, the cells were grown for 2 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dl-lysine 3,3,4,4,5,5,5,6,6-d8 (Isotec). The cells were stressed with butyl hydroperoxide as described above then recovered by centrifugation, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and left to recover in the same medium but without deuterated lysine for various periods of time prior to final harvesting. In the second series of experiments using labeling with stable isotopes, the cells were grown in normal culture medium, stressed with butyl hydroperoxide, and left to recover in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12-depleted medium (Sigma) reconstituted with all missing amino acids in normal form except lysine, which was used as its 4,4,5,5 tetradeuterated form (Isotec). The medium was also supplemented with 1mm pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The recovery phase tool place in this medium for 1–3 h in the absence or presence of 1 mm cycloheximide. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in homogeneization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). A buffer volume approximately equal to the packed cell volume was used. The suspension was transferred to a polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 4 volumes (respective to the suspension volume) of 8.75 m urea, 2.5 m thiourea, 25 mm spermine base, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. After 1 h at room temperature, the extracts were ultracentrifuged (30 min at 200,000 × g). The supernatant was collected and the protein was determined by a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Carrier ampholytes (0.4% final concentration) were added, and the protein extracts were stored at –20 °C. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed with immobilized pH gradients for isoelectric focusing. Non linear 4–10 pH gradients were used (16Gianazza E. Giacon P. Sahlin B. Righetti P.G. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 53-56Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Homemade pH gradient plates were cast and cut into 4-mm-wide strips (17Rabilloud T. Valette C. Lawrence J.J. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1552-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The samples were applied onto the strips by in-gel rehydration overnight (17Rabilloud T. Valette C. Lawrence J.J. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1552-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using a thiourea-urea mixture as a denaturing agent (18Rabilloud T. Adessi C. Giraudel A. Lunardi J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The gels were then migrated in a Multiphor apparatus (with a voltage limited to 3500 V) up to 60,000 Vh. The immobilized pH gradient strips are then equilibrated in SDS buffer and placed on top of a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel. After migration, the gels were stained either with silver (19Sinha P. Poland J. Schnolzer M. Rabilloud T. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or with colloidal Coomassie Blue (20Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). In Gel Digestion—Excised gel slice rinsing and reduction/alkylation steps were performed by the Massprep (Micromass, Manchester, UK) as described previously (12Wagner E. Luche S. Penna L. Chevallet M. Van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel pieces were completely dried with a Speed Vac before digestion. The dried gel volume was evaluated and three volumes of enzyme, either trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) or AspN (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 12.5 ng/μl freshly diluted in 25 mm NH4HCO3, were added. The digestion was performed at 35 °C overnight. Then, the gel pieces were centrifuged for 5 min in a Speed Vac and 5 μl of 35% H2O/60% acetonitrile/5% HCOOH were added to extracted peptides. The mixture was sonicated for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was recovered and the procedure was repeated once. MALDI-TOF-MS Analysis—Mass measurements were carried out on an Ultraflex™ MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). This instrument was used at a maximum accelerating potential of 20 kV and was operated either in reflector-positive or reflector-negative mode. Sample preparation was performed with the dried droplet method using a mixture of 0.5 ml of sample with 0.5 ml of matrix solution. For analysis in positive mode, matrix solution was prepared from a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in H2O/50% acetonitrile diluted 3 times. For analysis in negative mode, samples were mixed with a matrix containing 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone together with di-ammonium hydrogen citrate in organic solution (1:1 v/v mixture of ethanol and acetonitrile) as described previously (21Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In positive mode, internal calibration was performed with tryptic peptides resulting from autodigestion of trypsin (monoisotopic masses at m/z = 842.51; m/z = 1045.564; and m/z = 2211.105). In negative mode, the calibration was performed in external mode with angiotensin, substance P, bombesin, and ACTH, with monoisotopic masses at m/z = 1044.542; m/z = 1345.736; m/z = 1618.807; and m/z = 2463.199, respectively. MS Data Analysis—Monoisotopic peptide masses were assigned and used for databases searches using the search engine MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK). All human proteins present in Swiss-Prot were used without any pI and M r restrictions. The peptide mass error was limited to 70 ppm, one possible missed cleavage was accepted and modifications on lysine (d8 or d4) were taken into account. The peptides labeled with lysine d4 or d8 were screened from the MALDI-MS data with a computer algorithm developed in-house. From the list of assigned peaks, this software automatically detects the peak pairs separated by m/z unit multiples of 4 (or 8), from 1 to 2 lysine d4 (d8) with a tolerance of 50 ppm and report these pairs on a new list. From this d0 and d4 (d8) tagged pairs list, respective intensity of each first monoisotopic peak was used to calculate the ratio d4 (d8) over d0. Finally, after verification of the pairs on the list and discarding unlikely tagged peptides, an average and the corresponding standard deviation of the list of ratios are calculated. Experimental errors for the ratio values were estimated at ± 10%. For MS experiments with the d4 lysine labeling, the ratio d4/d0 calculated for the control before oxidative stress was used as a reference to estimate the experimental isotopic contribution at the mass of the peptide of interest plus 4 Da. Depending on the molecular weight of this peptide, the isotopic contribution was taken into account or ignored. When necessary, the corresponding “natural” d4/d0 ratio was subtracted to the d4/d0 ratios calculated at different times of the chase. The starting point of this study lies is the fact that peroxiredoxins appear as doublet spots, which are oxidative stress-sensitive. The basic spot of the doublet appears to correspond to the forms involved in the normal catalytic cycle (12Wagner E. Luche S. Penna L. Chevallet M. Van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as the thiol and disulfide forms are indistinguishable in our separation system. The acidic spot of the doublet corresponds to the overoxidized form of the peroxiredoxin, where the active site cysteine is converted to a sulfinic or sulfonic acid (11Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A.

We can thus use this resolving power to determine the quantitative evolution of the normal and oxidized forms of peroxiredoxins during recovery after oxidative stress. Typical results are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Fig. 2. Although it appears that prx4 is not very strongly oxidized in our stress conditions, prx1, 2, 3, and 6 are overoxidized at more than 90% (prx5 was not detected in these experiments). However, the evolution of the relative amounts of the oxidized versus normal forms showed important differences between peroxiredoxins, as shown in Fig. 2. Although prx2 was quickly regenerated, with more than 50% of the original amount of normal prx2 recovered in 1 h and complete regeneration in 3 h, the regeneration of prx3 and prx6 appeared much slower, with 50% regeneration in only 12 h for prx6 and complete regeneration in 24 h or more. Regneration of prx1 was intermediate between these two extremes, with 50% regeneration in 6 h. Moreover, the quantitative results obtained from two-dimensional gels also showed major differences among the different peroxiredoxins. Although the total prx1 amount stayed more or less constant throughout the complete regeneration process, the amount of prx3 and prx6 showed a transient decrease. This decrease is driven by a gradual disappearance of the oxidized form, which is larger and earlier than the reappearance of the normal form. Conversely, prx2 showed a transient increase in its total amount during recovery after oxidative stress. This phenomenon is driven by a fast increase in the normal form, which is larger than the decrease of the oxidized form.Fig. 2Bar chart representation of peroxiredoxin regeneration after oxidative stress. The white bar represents the abundance (in ppm of the total spots integrated) of the basic form of each peroxiredoxin. The hatched bar represents the abundance of the acidic form, the total height of each bar representing the sum of the two forms. For simplicity reasons, the standard deviations are not represented. They are always inferior to 5% of the mean value. C, control; S, immediately after stress (t-butylhydroperoxide, 2 h); 1, 1 h of recovery in peroxide-free medium after oxidative stress; 3, 3 h of recovery; 6, 6 h of recovery; 12, 12 h of recovery; 24, 24 h of recovery.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the regeneration process in more detail, we used a pulse-chase-like setup, using deuterated lysine as the label. In the first set of experiments, the cells were grown in a medium enriched in deuterated lysine up to steady state labeling. The cells were then submitted to an oxidative stress, rinsed, and left to recover in a medium containing only normal lysine. The quantitative ratio between the labeled and unlabelled peptides arising from the trypsin digestion of the peroxiredoxins spots can be determined easily with a mass spectrometer. Typical results are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Fig. 4. Here again, the order prx2-prx1-prx6 is found. For the latter protein, the very low d8/d0 ratio obtained after a 24 h regeneration period is clearly compatible with a regeneration of the active form by simple de novo synthesis, and slow degradation of the oxidized forms. This is, however, not the case for prx2, where the d8/d0 ratio never goes below 0.3 after a 24 h regeneration period, which is very close to the ratio observed for structural proteins of relatively slow turnover, such as actin or numatrin. Once again, prx1 stands between these two extremes. The spots corresponding to the oxidized peroxiredoxins could also be analyzed by this method. The decrease in the d8/d0 ratio demonstrates the flow of newly synthesized peroxiredoxins into the oxidized form, and thus the constant but slow inactivation process taking place during the recovery process. Here again, prx2 and prx1 behaved differently from prx3 and prx6. For the latter two proteins, the d8/d0 ratio stays very high for almost 24 h, showing that very little de novo synthesized prx3 or prx6 was oxidized during recovery after oxidative stress. Oppositely, the d8/d0 ratio decreased rapidly for prx2 and prx1, giving the impression of a massive protein flow going to the oxidized form even during the recovery phase. As to the normal forms of peroxiredoxins, the rapid regeneration of prx2 could be consistent with two mechanisms, which are either a very rapid regeneration by de novo synthesis, coupled with a very fast destruction of the oxidized prx2, or the retroreduction of the overoxidized form into the normal one. To discriminate between the two hypotheses, we performed a proteomics experiment with the reverse labeling scheme. In this experiment, the cells are grown in normal conditions and left to recover in a medium containing the labeled lysine, in this case with 4 deuterium only, either in the presence of absence of high doses of cycloheximide to completely block de novo synthesis. Typical results are shown in Fig. 5 and detailed in Table I. The absence of labeling with deuterated lysine clearly shows that de novo synthesis is completely blocked by cycloheximide. However, reapparition of the normal prx2 spot, and to a lesser extent of the normal prx1 spot, is obvious within the first 3 h, thereby suggesting the retroreduction of the oxidized prx2 (and prx1) into the normal form. Further time points could not be investigated because of massive cell death occurring in the presence of cycloheximide in the stressed cells.Fig. 4Bar chart representation of the evolution of the d8/d0 ratio during a pulse-chase experiment. C, control (no oxidative stress, no chase); S, stress (2 h oxidative stress in d8-containing medium, no chase); Rn, recovery in d0-only medium for n hours after steady-state labeling and oxidative stress in d8-containing medium. Numatrin is used as a control protein. A lower d8/d0 ratio than numatrin means a higher de novo synthesis, whereas a higher d8/d0 ratio means a lower de novo synthesis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Peroxiredoxin regeneration in the presence of cycloheximide. Cells grown in a normal medium and stressed for 2 h by 75 μm butylhydroperoxide were left to recover in a medium containg deuterated lysine (d4) and in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. The cellular proteins are analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the normal prx2 spot was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The 110–119 peptide of prx2 is shown.

Open table in a new tab To get further details of this retroreduction, we carried out a detailed characterization of the two peroxiredoxins forms, using the negative MALDI-MS approach described previously (12Wagner E. Luche S. Penna L. Chevallet M. Van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 and summarized in Table II. They point to several important phenomena. On the spots corresponding to the oxidized forms, both the sulfinic and sulfonic forms could be identified, except for prx3 where only the sulfonic acid form was identified. Moreover, the ratio of the sulfinic to sulfonic forms did not change during the early stages of recovery for all peroxiredoxins, suggesting either that the sulfonic form is produced from the sulfinic form during the separation process, as suggested elsewhere (11Yang K.S.

However, it must be noted that the spots co-migrating with the oxidized spots but present before oxidative stress did not show the oxidized peptide but the peptide containing a normal cysteine instead. This demonstrates that these spots do not correspond to the oxidized forms of peroxiredoxins, but to another post-translational modification such as phosphorylation (22Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). The two phenomena can even superimpose, as show by the example of the acidic prx2 and prx1 spots after 3 h of recovery.Fig. 7Negative MALDI spectrum of the prx1 peptides containing the active site cysteine. The AspN digest of the native and oxidized forms of peroxiredoxins was analyzed by MALDI MS operating in negative mode. For clarity reasons, a close-up is made on the masses corresponding to the peptides containing the active site cysteine. Uncleaved by AspN means uncleaved at the oxidized cysteine. Peak assignment from the AspN digestion rules and post-translational modifications: m/z 1010, CPTEIIAFS, sulfinic acid form, cleaved at the oxidized cysteine by AspN; m/z 1026, same as 1010, sulfonic acid form; m/z 1620, DFTFVCPTEIIAFS, oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid, uncleaved by AspN; m/z 1636, DFTFVCPTEIIAFS, oxidized to cysteine sulfonic acid, uncleaved by AspN; m/z 1645, DFTFVCPTEIIAFS alkylated on cysteine by iodoacetamide (used in the two-dimensional gel process); m/z 1652, DFTFVCPTEIIAFS, oxidized to cysteine sulfonic acid, uncleaved by AspN, hydroxylated, or DFTFVCPTEIIAFS, acetylated, sodium adduct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IISummary of results obtained for normal and oxidized cysteines and regeneration for various peroxiredoxinsTable IISummary of results obtained for normal and oxidized cysteines and regeneration for various peroxiredoxins The most surprising results, however, came from the analysis of the spots migrating to the position of the normal forms. Although the expected peptide containing a cysteine is found on the unstressed forms of all peroxiredoxins that can be analyzed by this approach (i.e. excluding prx6), the same spot obtained during the recovery process can either show only the cysteine in its thiol form (prx2 and 3) or show mainly the cysteine in its oxidized form (prx1). In the latter case, the spot migrating to the position of the normal one is indeed not a bona fide reduced peroxiredoxin, but a modified oxidized form co-migrating with the normal one. In addition to that, additional peptide masses are frequently encountered close to the mass predicted for the normal peptide with its alkylated cysteine, with monoisotopic masses at –25, –9, and +7 Da compared with the normal, alkylated peptides. These masses correspond exactly to the masses of the non-alkylated peptide + 32, 48, and 64 Da, i.e. +2, +3, and +4 oxygen atoms. They can be interpreted as an oxidized peptide with an uncleaved AspN site at the oxidized cysteine and, for the +64 Da form, with an extra hydroxylation on the peptide. Alternatively, the +64 Da form can be a sodium adduct of an acetylated but unalkylated peptide. Interestingly enough, these peptides are encountered in the oxidized spots and in the basic prx1 spot during the early recovery phase, further evidencing the presence of oxidized cysteine in this spot. They are also encountered, at a much weaker extent, in the basic prx1 spot in the control conditions. This demonstrates that the situation is not very clear for prx1, with some oxidized protein co-migrating with the normal one for a still unknown reason. Unfortunately, with the protein amounts available from two-dimensional gels, these peptides could only be observed in negative MALDI mode and neither in positive MALDI nor in electrospray ionization. This prevented us from gaining additional knowledge in the detail of the modifications by peptide fragmentation. Peroxiredoxins are a growing family of proteins involved in the redox regulation of cells, together with peroxidases, catalase, and superoxide dismutases. As a matter of fact, many of these redox control proteins are themselves very sensitive to the redox status of the cell. This is not surprising, as these proteins have active centers that are very reducing and therefore very sensitive to overoxidation, leading to the inactivation of these proteins (11Yang K.S.

However, if the oxidative stress is short enough, the cells can recover and resume growth. This recovery phase was studied previously (13Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R.

Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These two reports demonstrate that two different phenomena account to explain the regeneration of peroxiredoxins 1 and 2, namely de novo synthesis (13Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Lunardi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19396-19401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and, more surprisingly, retroreduction from the overoxidized form (15Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, both studies rely only on spot position on two-dimensional gels to evidence the mechanisms of peroxiredoxin regeneration. To get more details on the phenomena taking place for peroxiredoxin regeneration during recovery after oxidative stress, we used HeLa cells, which display a wider panel of peroxiredoxins (12Wagner E. Luche S. Penna L. Chevallet M. Van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a combination of protein labeling in vivo with stable isotopes, mass spectrometry, and protein synthesis blocking with cycloheximide. Our results demonstrate a wide variety of regeneration speeds for the various peroxiredoxins. At one end stands prx2, which regenerates very fast by a mixed mechanism coupling de novo synthesis (as shown by the increase in amount of total prx2) and retroreduction. At the other end stand prx6 and prx3, for which the regeneration speed, the transient decrease in the total amount of the protein, and the labeling data are not consistent with a retroreduction mechanism, but rather with a regeneration mechanism using only de novo synthesis. The situation is more complex for prx1, which shows an intermediate speed. As mentioned in previous studies (15Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) protein synthesis blocking with cycloheximide suggested that prx1 was retroreduced, but any parasite, reversible post-translational modification could also induce shuttling of the protein spots between the ones corresponding to the normal and oxidized form positions. As a matter of fact, any modification decreasing the number of negative charges or unmasking a positive charge could give the same migration pattern as cysteine sulfinic or sulfonic acid retroreduction, this being true for prx1 and prx2. To exclude this phenomenon and to ascertain for retroreduction, we tried to characterize in detail the peptide bearing the active site cysteine in all peroxiredoxin spots arising either before oxidative stress, immediately after oxidative stress, or during the recovery phase. These experiments clearly showed that only prx2 met the requirements for a true retroreduction, both as the regeneration speed and as the disappearance of the oxidized cysteine and reappearance of the normal cysteine in the normal form. The fact that oxidized cysteine could be found in the normal prx1 spot clearly showed that simple co-migration with the bona fide normal peroxoredoxin is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate retroreduction. This evidence for retroreduction clearly breaks the dogma of the irreversibility of the overoxidation (11Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

It is clear that neither glutathione (15Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19174-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar) clearly leaves the field open, as suggested by recent results obtained on plants (25Collin V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Marchand C. Hirasawa M. Lancelin J.M. Knaff D.B. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23747-23752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The second important point to understand is why the retroreducibility of peroxiredoxins varies so widely. For prx3, which is located in the mitochondria, it can be argued that the retroreducing system is absent or very poorly efficient in mitochondria. However, the difference between the three cystosolic proteins (prx1, 2, and 6) is more puzzling. The first hypothesis is that prx6 is not retroreduced because it is a peroxiredoxin that cannot form a disulfide bridge in its catalytic cycle, oppositely to prx1 and prx2. This does not explain, however, why prx2 is more easily retroreduced than prx1. An explanation is that prx2 has a high affinity for the retroreducer, whichever it is, whereas this affinity would decrease for prx1. It is quite clear that the various peroxiredoxins are able to bind different proteins (22Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar), which can support this hypothesis. When combined with our labeling data on the oxidized form, prx2 appears as the most dynamic peroxiredoxin, going very easily back and forth on the complete oxidation-reduction cycle from the thiol to the sulfinic acid states. Oppositely, prx3 and prx6 appear much more static and classical in their redox behavior. The status of prx1 is still less clear but probably intermediate between the two extremes represented by prx2 and prx6. Whatever the reasons for the easy retroreducibility of prx2 are, this characteristic differentiate prx2 as the very last cellular defense line within peroxiredoxins. Although prx2 is clearly inactivated under oxidative stress, as the other peroxiredoxins are, the quick reversibility of this inactivation makes it the first peroxiredoxin to be active again to protect the cell from oxidative damage after the oxidative stress episode is over. The variability in retroreducibility, coupled with the presence of peroxiredoxins in almost all cell compartments, to bind a variety of other cellular partners (22Wood Z.A. Schroder E.

Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar), to perform other functions than simple destruction of peroxides (26Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I.

Differentiated chondrocytes in articular cartilage undergo dedifferentiation and apoptosis during arthritis, in which NO production plays a critical role. Here, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of action of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells and the maintenance and survival of differentiated articular chondrocytes. IGF-1 induced chondrogenesis of limb bud mesenchymal cells during micromass culture through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt. PI3K activation is required for the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-α and p38 kinase and inhibition of ERK1/2. These events are necessary for chondrogenesis. The growth factor additionally blocked NO-induced dedifferentiation and apoptosis of primary culture articular chondrocytes. NO production in chondrocytes induced down-regulation of PI3K and Akt activities, which was blocked by IGF-1 treatment. Stimulation of PI3K by IGF-1 resulted in blockage of NO-induced activation of p38 kinase and ERK1/2 and inhibition of PKCα and PKCζ, which in turn suppressed dedifferentiation and apoptosis. Our results collectively indicate that IGF-1 regulates differentiation, maintenance of the differentiated phenotype, and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes via a PI3K pathway that modulates ERK, p38 kinase, and PKC signaling.

Cartilage formation during embryo development is initiated by the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes. Chondrogenesis is triggered by precartilage condensation (i.e. aggregation of mesenchymal cells) that develops into cartilage nodules. Chondrocytes in cartilage either further mature into hypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral bone formation or remain as permanent chondrocytes throughout their life cycle in joint articular cartilage. Articular chondrocytes synthesize cartilage-specific extracellular matrix components such as type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycan to maintain cartilage homeostasis (1DeLise A.M. Fischer L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 2Sandell L.J. Adler P. Front.

Homeostasis is destroyed during joint cartilage diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, eventually leading to cartilage destruction, which involves activation of matrix metalloproteinases, loss of differentiated chondrocyte phenotypes (i.e. dedifferentiation), and increases in chondrocyte apoptosis (4Poole A.R. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 662-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar).Differentiation, survival, and maintenance of the differentiated chondrocyte phenotype are regulated by a number of physical and soluble factors. For example, chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells during limb bud development is regulated by cell-cell adhesion, cell-cell matrix interactions, and a complicated array of growth factors, including bone morphogenetic protein, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling.1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling.-1, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, and Indian hedgehog (1DeLise A.M. Fischer L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Survival and maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes in articular cartilage are additionally regulated by growth factors and cytokines. For instance, IGF-1 exerts anabolic effects on articular cartilage by stimulating matrix molecule synthesis (6McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2001; 11: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 exert catabolic effects during cartilage destruction (7Fernandes J.C. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines are mediated by NO production (8Amin A.R. Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Indeed, direct production of NO in primary culture articular chondrocytes induces dedifferentiation and apoptosis by modulating various intracellular signaling processes such as activation of p38 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (9Kim S.-J.

Chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells during micromass culture is further regulated by a complicated protein kinase cascade involving PKCα activation, inhibition of ERK, and p38 kinase activation (13Chang S.-H.

Elevated PKCα and reduced ERK activities are additionally responsible for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of articular chondrocytes (18Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Among the anabolic factors for chondrocytes and cartilage, IGF-1 and IGF-2 are single polypeptides homologous to proinsulin. These growth factors regulate cellular functions by stimulating cell-surface receptors, which in turn initiate the phosphorylation cascade (19Valentinis B. Baserga R. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). IGF-1 is expressed in developing cartilage within the condensing region of the limb as well as in mature cartilage and synovial fluid, where it regulates chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells and anabolism of cartilage matrix molecules (20Martel-Pelletier J. Di Battista J.A. Lajeunesse D. Pelletier J.P. Inflamm. Res. 1998; 47: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For instance, IGF-1 in synovial fluid enhances proteoglycan synthesis. Elimination of IGF-1 from synovial fluid with neutralizing antibody results in decreased cartilage proteoglycan synthesis and enhanced proteoglycan breakdown (21Schalkwijk J. Joosten L.A. van den Berg W.B. van Wyk J.J. van de Putte L.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 66-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IGF-1 enhances cartilage matrix synthesis both in vivo and in vitro (22Fukumoto T. Sperling J.W. Sanyal A. Fitzsimmons J.S. Reinholz G.G. Conover C.A. O'Driscoll S.W. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2003; 11: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 23Yaeger P.C. Masi T.L. de Ortiz J.L. Binette F. Tubo R. McPherson J.M. Exp.

Hardingham T.E. Matrix. 1991; 11: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Kolettas E. Muir H.I. Barrett J.C. Hardingham T.E. Rheumatology. 2001; 40: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, IGF-1 appears to function as an inducing signal for chondrogenesis and an anabolic growth factor in cartilage homeostasis. Moreover, this growth factor protects various cell types from apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli via the activation of complex anti-apoptotic and survival signals such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (27Vincent A.M. Feldman E.L. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2002; 12: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Loeser R.F. Shanker G. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Apoptotic death of articular chondrocytes induced by NO production or Fas ligand is implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis (29Yatsugi N. Tsukazaki T. Osaki M. Koji T. Yamashita S. Shindo H.J. J. Orthop. Sci. 2000; 5: 150-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Vazquez-Martul E. de Toro F.J. Galdo F.

However, it is not known whether IGF-1 prevents apoptosis of primary culture chondrocytes triggered by NO or that of chondrocytes in arthritic cartilage.IGF-1 has been reported to play a role in the regulation of chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells and to have anabolic effects on differentiated chondrocytes; however, the signaling mechanisms mediating IGF action are yet to be elucidated. Moreover, there is no available evidence on IGF-1 regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated the role of IGF-1 in the regulation of mesenchymal cell chondrogenesis, maintenance of the differentiated phenotype, and NO-induced apoptosis of knee joint articular chondrocytes. We further investigated the signaling mechanism that mediates IGF-1 action, focusing on the protein kinase cascade. Our data show that IGF-1 induces chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells and inhibits NO-induced dedifferentiation and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes by modulating PI3K, Akt, ERK, p38 kinase, and PKC signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMicromass Culture of Mesenchymal Cells—Mesenchymal cells were isolated from limb buds of Hamburger-Hamilton stage 23/24 chicken embryos and maintained as a micromass culture to induce chondrogenesis as described previously (13Chang S.-H.

Briefly, cells at a density of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml in Ham's F-12 medium were spotted as 15-μl drops on culture dishes and cultured for up to 5 days in the presence of various pharmacological reagents as stipulated in each experiment. Chondrogenesis was induced by adding the indicated concentrations of IGF-1 in serum-free culture medium, unless otherwise specified. After spotting for 2 h, mesenchymal cells were infected for 2 h with adenoviral control or with adenovirus containing the p85 or p110 subunit of PI3K or wild-type PKCα. Infected cells were cultured for up to 5 days in Ham's F-12 medium. Chondrogenesis was determined by immunohistochemical analysis of type II collagen expression and accumulation of sulfated proteoglycans using Alcian blue staining as described previously (14Oh C.-D.

After collecting individual cells by brief centrifugation, cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin and plated on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 with medium replacement every 2 days. Cells at day 4 were washed with serum-free medium and treated with the indicated pharmacological reagents 1 h prior to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment in the absence of serum. These reagents include IGF-1 (Sigma); LY294002 (Calbiochem), which inhibits PI3K (32Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

For immunohistochemical staining, cartilage explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, dehydrated with graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4-μm slices as described previously (35Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Sections were stained by standard procedures using Alcian blue or antibody against type II collagen (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and visualized by developing with a kit purchased from Dako Corp. Apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) as described below.Apoptosis Assay—DNA fragmentation and TUNEL assays demonstrate that NO-induced death of primary culture articular chondrocytes is due to apoptosis (9Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this study, apoptotic chondrocytes in cartilage explants were detected with a TUNEL assay kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) as described previously (36Yoon J.-B. Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G Chang S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15319-15325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections of cartilage explants were incubated with a TUNEL mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and fluorescein-labeled dUTP. Cells with apoptosis-induced DNA strand breaks were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, apoptotic chondrocytes were quantified by flow cytometry by counting the number of cells displaying fragmented DNA. Briefly, cells were fixed in 80% ethanol and incubated for 1 h with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μg/ml RNase A in phosphate-buffered saline. The number of cells containing fragmented DNA was quantified on a FACSort flow cytometer with the Cellquest analysis program (BD Biosciences) using ∼1 × 104 cells.PI3K Assay—Chondrifying mesenchymal cells or primary culture articular chondrocytes were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 25 mm NaF). Following removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g, equal amounts of protein (500 μg) were incubated overnight with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and collected on protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40; three times with buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 500 mm LiCl2; and twice with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Next, immune complexes were resuspended in 45 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA), and the kinase reaction was initiated by adding phosphatidylinositol (200 μg/ml) and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/sample) at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. Reaction products were extracted using 200 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) and resolved on a thin layer chromatography silica plate coated with potassium oxalate in solvent containing CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). The PI3K reaction product (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) was identified by autoradiography.Caspase-3 Assay—In vitro assay of caspase-3 activity was performed by measuring absorbance of the cleaved synthetic substrate of caspase-3, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chromophore p-nitroaniline, as described previously (9Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes were lysed in the buffer provided in the Clontech colorimetric assay kit. Lysates (100 μg of protein) were reacted with 50 μm Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chromophore p-nitroaniline in reaction buffer (0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.4), 20% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as described above) for 1 h at 37 °C and analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Enzyme activity was calculated from a standard curve prepared using p-nitroaniline. The relative levels of p-nitroaniline were normalized against the protein concentration of each extract.PKC and p38 Kinase Assays—PKCα, PKCζ, and p38 kinase activities were determined by immunoprecipitation experiments and an in vitro kinase assay. Briefly, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and an inhibitor mixture of proteases and phosphatases as described above. Cell lysates were incubated with polyclonal antibody against p38 kinase or PKCζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or with monoclonal antibody against PKCα (Transduction Laboratories) for 2 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were precipitated by adding 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry. The immune complex was resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/sample) and substrate (1 μg; activating transcription factor-2 for p38 kinase and myelin basic protein for PKCα and PKCζ). After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the kinase reaction was terminated by adding 4× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Substrate phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography.NF-κB Luciferase Assay—NF-κB activity was determined using a reporter gene assay. Briefly, chondrocytes were transfected with either a plasmid containing luciferase and three tandem repeats of serum response element or with a control vector. Transfection of the expression vector was performed as described in an earlier report (11Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Shin D.-Y. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The expression vector (1 μg) was introduced into cells at 30–40% confluency using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h, and luciferase activity was determined with an assay kit from Promega. Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity.Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with an inhibitor mixture of proteases and phosphatases as described above. Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following primary antibodies were employed to detect proteins: mouse anti-chicken type II collagen monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.); mouse anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); rabbit anti-human phospho-ERK polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA); mouse anti-human PKCα and PKCζ monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against mouse p38 kinase, human IκBα, human Bax, and human active caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) and an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSIGF-1 Induces Chondrogenesis of Mesenchymal Cells via a PI3K Pathway—Chick limb bud mesenchymal cells were maintained as a micromass culture to induce chondrogenesis. Chondrogenic differentiation was confirmed by examining the expression of type II collagen (a hallmark of chondrocytes) or by staining the sulfated proteoglycan with Alcian blue. Mesenchymal cells cultured for 4 days in the presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-1 in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium synthesized sulfated proteoglycan and expressed type II collagen as revealed by Alcian blue staining and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1A), indicating chondrogenic differentiation. An in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1B) showed that, in the absence of serum, IGF-1 activated PI3K and its downstream signaling molecule, Akt (demonstrated by increased phosphorylation) (Fig. 1C, upper panel). IGF-1 effects on Akt activation were dose-dependent (Fig. 1C, middle panel). Akt phosphorylation was blocked upon treatment with 10 μm LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 1C, lower panel). LY294002 abolished IGF-1-induced accumulation of proteoglycans (Fig. 1D), implying that the growth factor induces chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells via a PI3K/Akt pathway.The role of PI3K in serum-induced chondrogenesis was determined by culturing mesenchymal cells with 10% serum in the absence of exogenous IGF-1. PI3K activity was increased during serum-induced chondrogenesis (Fig. 2, A and B), and LY294002 blocked type II collagen expression (Fig. 2C) and proteoglycan synthesis (Fig. 2D). The role of PI3K in serum-induced chondrogenesis was further confirmed by infecting mesenchymal cells with control adenovirus or with adenovirus encoding a dominant-negative mutant (p85) or constitutively active mutant (p110) of PI3K. As shown in Fig. 2E, expression of p85 was accompanied by a decrease in type II collagen levels, whereas the constitutively active p110 subunit increased type II collagen expression. The above results collectively indicate that chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells induced by either IGF-1 or serum is dependent on PI3K activation.Fig. 2PI3K regulates serum-induced chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells. A and B, mesenchymal cells were maintained as a micromass culture in 10% serum-containing medium for the indicated time periods in the absence or presence of 10 μm LY294002 (LY). PI3K activity was determined using an in vitro kinase assay (A), and type II collagen (Coll-II) was detected by Western blotting (B). C and D, mesenchymal cells were cultured in serum-containing medium for 4 days in the presence of the indicated concentrations of LY294002. Expression of type II collagen (C) and accumulation of sulfated proteoglycan (D) were determined by Western blotting and Alcian blue staining, respectively. ERK1 was detected as a loading control. E, mesenchymal cells during micromass culture in serum-containing medium were treated for 4 days without (Control) or with 10 μm LY294002 or were infected with adenovirus containing the p85 regulatory or p110 catalytic subunits. Expression of type II collagen was determined by immunostaining. Data from a typical experiment are presented. Experiments were performed more than five times with similar results.

Additionally, PKCα-independent activation of p38 kinase is a prerequisite for chondrogenesis (14Oh C.-D. Chang S.-H. Yoon Y.-M. Lee S.-J. Lee Y.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5613-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether IGF-1 induces chondrogenesis via a PI3K pathway by modulating PKCα, ERK, and/or p38 kinase. PKCα expression and activity were increased during IGF-1-induced chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3A, upper and middle panels). The stimulatory effects of IGF-1 on PKCα were suppressed by the PI3K blocker LY294002 (Fig. 3A, lower panel), confirming that the growth factor regulates PKCα via a PI3K pathway. PKCα down-regulation with phorbol ester (Fig. 3B) or inhibition with GF109203X (data not shown) resulted in blockage of IGF-1-induced chondrogenesis. However, PKCα overexpression by adenovirus infection did not induce chondrogenesis in the absence of IGF-1 or enhance IGF-1-induced chondrogenesis (Fig. 3B). Therefore, it is likely that expression and activation of PKCα via IGF-1 signaling are necessary (but not sufficient) for the induction of chondrogenesis.Fig. 3Activation of PI3K by IGF-1 is necessary for PKCα expression. A, mesenchymal cells were maintained as a micromass culture in serum-free medium for the indicated time periods in the absence (Control) or presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-1 (upper panel), in the presence of the indicated concentrations of IGF-1 for 3 days (middle panel), or in the presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-1 and the indicated concentrations of LY294002 for 3 days (lower panel). Expression and activity of PKCα were determined by Western blotting and an in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein (pMBP) as a substrate, respectively. B, mesenchymal cells during micromas"

Previous genetic studies have revealed that alcohol dehydrogenase Adh1 is required for efficient clearance of excess retinol to prevent toxicity, thus demonstrating that the mechanism involves oxidation of excess retinol to retinoic acid (RA). Whereas Adh1 plays a dominant role in the first step of the clearance pathway (oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde), it is unknown what controls the second step (oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA). We now present genetic evidence that aldehyde dehydrogenase Aldh1a1, also known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase Raldh1, plays a dominant role in the second step of retinol clearance in adult mice. Serum RA levels following a 50 mg/kg dose of retinol were reduced 72% in Raldh1 -/- mice and 82% in Adh1 -/- mice. This represented reductions in RA synthesis of 77–78% for each mutant after corrections for altered RA degradation in each. After retinol dosing, serum retinaldehyde was increased 2.5-fold in Raldh1 -/- mice (indicating defective retinaldehyde clearance) and decreased 3-fold in Adh1 -/- mice (indicating defective retinaldehyde synthesis). Serum retinol clearance following retinol administration was decreased 7% in Raldh1 -/- mice and 69% in Adh1 -/- mice. LD50 studies indicated a small increase in retinol toxicity in Raldh1 -/- mice and a large increase in Adh1 -/- mice. These observations demonstrate that Raldh1 functions downstream of Adh1 in the oxidative metabolism of excess retinol and that toxicity correlates primarily with accumulating retinol rather than retinaldehyde.

DeLuca H.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 347-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). RA functions in the control of gene expression by serving as a ligand for several nuclear RA receptors and retinoid X receptors (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Whereas in vitro studies suggested that all-trans-RA (a ligand for RA receptors) and its isomer 9-cis-RA (a ligand for retinoid X receptors) might both regulate gene expression (3Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar), in vivo studies indicate that only all-trans-RA is needed physiologically to correct a lethal genetic defect in RA synthesis (4Mic F.A. Molotkov A. Benbrook D.M. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7135-7140Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Retinoid metabolic enzymes ensure that sufficient all-trans-RA is produced from retinol to control RA signaling in target tissues (5Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Also, mechanisms exist to prevent excessive accumulation of RA and retinol as high levels of either of them are teratogenic during development or toxic to adult animals (6Kochhar D.M. Acta Pathol.

Retinol can be considered a pro-ligand for RA signaling that is activated to a ligand when its alcohol group is sequentially oxidized to first an aldehyde (to produce retinaldehyde) and then to a carboxylic acid (to produce RA). Enzymes that can activate retinol to RA include cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) (10Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem.

Various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes deactivate RA by oxidation to more polar metabolites such as 4-oxo-RA that are more easily excreted (23Roberts E.S. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar, 24White J.A. Guo Y.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilworth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol.

The combined activity of RA-synthesizing and RA-degrading enzymes determines the steady-state level of RA in target tissues for signaling plus ensures that excess retinol or RA is metabolized to excretable forms. Within the enzyme families listed above, genetic studies are beginning to reveal the identity of individual members that function in retinoid metabolism in vivo. Adh1 -/- mice do not exhibit defects in growth or survival but display greatly reduced metabolism of a dose of retinol to RA and increased retinol toxicity (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ADH1 possesses high activity for oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, which is important for clearance of retinol to prevent its toxic buildup. Adh3 -/- mice display a small reduction in metabolism of a dose of retinol to RA, but more notably they suffer defects in postnatal growth and survival (27Molotkov A. Fan X. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5337-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). ADH3 possesses low activity for oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, but this is evidently useful for synthesis of RA needed for RA signaling during development. Further studies have shown that ADH1 (expressed at high levels in liver) is the primary retinol-oxidizing enzyme responsible for the clearance of excess retinol to prevent toxicity, whereas ADH3 (expressed ubiquitously) plays a secondary role in this process (28Molotkov A. Fan X. Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Adh4 -/- mice do not display a significant reduction in metabolism of a dose of retinol to RA but are much more sensitive to defects in postnatal growth and survival during vitamin A deficiency (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ADH4 has high activity for oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, which is apparently needed to produce sufficient RA for developmental RA signaling when retinol levels are low. An analysis of Rdh5 -/- mice has shown that the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme RDH5 participates in oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinaldehyde for production of the visual pigment, but there is no evidence reported that RDH5 plays an in vivo role in RA synthesis (29Driessen C.A.G.G. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P.M. Van Vugt A.H.M. Van Hooser J.P. Wieringa B.E. Deutman A.F. Palczewski K. Ruether K. Janssen J.J.M. Mol.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 590-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Raldh2 -/- (Aldh1a2 -/-) mice have severe embryonic developmental defects and greatly reduced embryonic RA, indicating that RALDH2 (ALDH1A2) plays an important in vivo role in oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA to activate RA signaling during development (31Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dollé P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 32Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Cyp26a1 -/- mice display abnormally high embryonic RA levels and embryonic defects similar to those observed during RA teratogenesis, suggesting that the ability of CYP26A1 to oxidize RA to polar metabolites including 4-oxo-RA protects against excessive accumulation of RA during development (33Sakai Y. Meno C. Fujii H. Nishino J. Shiratori H. Saijoh Y. Rossant J. Hamada H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 34Abu-Abed S. Dollé P. Metzger D. Beckett B. Chambon P. Petkovich M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Further genetic studies have shown that the oxidative derivatives of RA produced by CYP26A1 are not needed for RA signaling during development but are degradation products (35Niederreither K. Abu-Abed S. Schuhbaur B. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Dollé P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These genetic studies indicate that retinoid-oxidizing enzymes may perform two different functions: 1) establishment and maintenance of correct RA levels for developmental RA signaling, or 2) clearance of excess retinol to prevent toxicity in adult animals. In the first case, the RA produced is used directly to regulate developmental events, but in the second case, the RA produced is an intermediate in the degradation process to prevent retinol toxicity. With regard to synthesis and degradation of RA for developmental signaling, physiological roles for ADH3, ADH4, RALDH2, and CYP26A1 have been established, thus covering all of the three oxidation steps. As for prevention of retinol toxicity in adult animals, a physiological role for ADH1 in the first step has been established, but enzymes involved physiologically in the subsequent steps have not been identified. RALDH1 (ALDH1A1) was the first member of the ALDH family found to possess in vitro activity for oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA (18Lee M.-O. Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, introduction of mouse RALDH1 mRNA into frog embryos has been found to stimulate RA synthesis in vivo (36Ang H.L. Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RALDH1 is highly expressed in the embryonic and adult dorsal retina as well as in adult liver in mouse (37McCaffery P. Tempst P. Lara G. Dräger U.C. Development. 1991; 112: 693-702PubMed Google Scholar), chicken (38Godbout R. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Godbout R. Monckton E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32896-32904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and frog (40Ang H.L. Duester G. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, we have reported that Raldh1 -/- (Aldh1a1 -/-) mice do not exhibit obvious developmental defects in the retina or other tissues (41Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S.-I. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). RALDH1 is much less abundant than RALDH2 in embryonic tissues but much more abundant than RALDH2 in adult mouse tissues including liver (42Haselbeck R.J. Hoffmann I. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 353-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that RALDH1 may play a role in adult retinoid metabolism similar to ADH1. Here we have examined retinoid metabolism in Raldh1 -/- mice following a dose of retinol and compared these results with previous studies on Adh1 -/- mice (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22553-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as well as new studies presented here on Adh1 -/- mice. Our results indicate that RALDH1 plays a role in oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA for clearance of excess retinol in adult mice, thus acting downstream of ADH1. Animals—Raldh1 -/- mice were generated as described previously using a gene replacement targeting vector that removed exon 11 from the Raldh1 (Aldh1a1) gene (41Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S.-I. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The wild-type and Adh1 -/- mice used here have been described previously (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol.

Quantitation of Serum Retinoic Acid and Retinol—Retinoids were administered orally essentially as described previously (45Collins M.D. Eckhoff C. Chahoud I. Bochert G. Nau H. Arch. Toxicol. 1992; 66: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinol or all-trans-RA (Sigma) were dissolved in acetone-Tween 20-water (0.25:5:4.75 v/v/v) and were administered by oral injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg for retinol or 10 mg/kg for RA. At several time points following retinoid injection, blood was collected and stored at -20 °C. Retinoids were extracted from 0.2 ml of serum under darkened conditions, and all-trans-retinol and all-trans-RA were quantitated by reversed-phase HPLC using a MICROSORB-MVTM 100 C18 column as described previously (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22553-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Serum Retinaldehyde—All-trans-retinol was dissolved in acetone-Tween 20-water (0.25:5:4.75 v/v/v) and administered by oral injection at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Blood was collected at 1 h after injection and processed immediately as below. All of the extraction and analytical procedures were carried out in a darkened room to protect retinoids from exposure to light. All-trans-retinaldehyde was quantitated after conversion to the more stable oxime as described previously (46Von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Serum (0.2 ml) was mixed with 0.05 ml of 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 6.8) and 0.2 ml of methanol. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was extracted twice with 1 ml of hexane. Hexane layers were collected, combined, and evaporated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 0.15 ml of hexane, and 0.1 ml of resulting mixture was injected into the HPLC. Normal-phase HPLC analysis was performed on a Waters 2695 HPLC system using an MICROSORB-MVTM 100 Silica column (250 × 4.6 mm, Varian) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min and column temperature of 35 °C. Mobile phase consisted of 92% hexane and 8% ethyl acetate. Detection of retinoids was performed using a photodiode array detector (Waters model 2996), which collected spectra between 200 and 450 nm. A standard solution of all-trans-retinaldehyde oximes (syn- and anti-oximes) was prepared by treatment of all-trans-retinaldehyde (Sigma) with 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 6.8) as above. This standard solution was used to identify the peaks and obtain the calibration curves. Characteristic peak spectra and retention times were used to identify all-trans-retinaldehyde, and quantitation of peak areas was calculated at λmax using Waters Millennium Chromatography Manager software. Retinol LD 50 Determination—Mice were given oral doses of retinol to determine the lethal dose as reported previously (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol.

All-trans-retinol (Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil and administered by gavage at doses ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 g/kg (the volume of the dose was 0.2 ml/10 g body weight). Lethality was monitored daily for 14 days after retinol administration. The methods of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (47Litchfield Jr., J.T. Wilcoxon F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1949; 96: 99-117PubMed Google Scholar) were used to calculate the doses resulting in the death of 16 (LD16), 50 (LD50), or 84% (LD84) of the mice by day 14 plus the 95% confidence limits for the LD50 dose. Data Analysis—Quantitation of RA synthesis or degradation over time was performed by determining the area under the curve (AUC). Statistical significance was determined for raw data using the unpaired Student's t test (Statistica version 5.0). Growth of Raldh1 -/- Mice—We previously reported that Raldh1 -/- mice were obtained at the normal Mendelian ratio and appeared to be viable and fertile without obvious defects in growth or survival (41Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S.-I. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using a previously described mouse RALDH1 antibody (42Haselbeck R.J. Hoffmann I. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 353-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that RALDH1 protein is undetectable in Raldh1 -/- liver, lung, and testis while being abundant in all of these tissues from wild-type mice (41Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S.-I. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This indicates that a null mutation was generated. We have obtained no evidence as of yet that Raldh1 is essential for development, contrasting with the results obtained from null mutants of Raldh2, which result in embryonic lethality at mid-gestation (31Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dollé P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 32Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolism of Retinol to RA in Raldh1-/- and Adh1-/-Mice—RA is normally very low in serum, being reported at ∼4 ng/ml in mouse (48Satre M.A. Ugen K.E. Kochhar D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 802-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and 0.5 ng/ml in rat (49Kurlandsky S.B. Gamble M.V. Ramakrishnan R. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17850-17857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, treatment of mice with retinol results in a temporary increase of serum RA as retinol is metabolized to RA and then further metabolized to 4-oxo-RA (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22553-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 45Collins M.D. Eckhoff C. Chahoud I. Bochert G. Nau H. Arch. Toxicol. 1992; 66: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, mice were treated orally with a single dose of retinol (50 mg/kg) and metabolism to RA was followed over time by quantitation of serum RA. Our previous studies indicated peak RA concentrations of 1170 ng/ml for wild-type mice and 270 ng/ml for Adh1 -/- mice (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22553-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In comparison, Raldh1 -/- mice exhibited a peak RA concentration of 390 ng/ml (Fig. 1). A comparison of AUC values for wild-type mice and the two mutant strains demonstrated that Raldh1 deficiency results in a 72% reduction in serum RA detectable during the 4-h period following retinol administration, whereas Adh1 deficiency results in an 82% reduction in serum RA (Table I). These findings suggest that RALDH1 and ADH1 are both needed to efficiently metabolize excess retinol to RA.Table IArea under curve (AUC) values for the effect of Raldh1 or Adh1 deficiency on synthesis or degradation of all-trans-RA and clearance of retinolGenotypeTreatmentAll-trans-retinoic acid AUCΔAUCa[AUC (2 or 3) - AUC (1)] × 100 ÷ AUC (1)μg × h/ml%RA synthesis bValues were calculated from data shown in Fig. 11) wild-typeRetinol (50 mg/kg)2.932) Raldh1-/-Retinol (50 mg/kg)0.83-723) Adh1-/-Retinol (50 mg/kg)0.52-82RA degradation cValues were calculated from data shown in Fig. 21) wild-typeRA (10 mg/kg)4.902) Raldh1-/-RA (10 mg/kg)6.05+233) Adh1-/-RA (10 mg/kg)3.65-26GenotypeTreatmentAll-trans-retinolΔAUCa[AUC (2 or 3) - AUC (1)] × 100 ÷ AUC (1)μg × h/ml%Retinol clearance dValues were calculated from data shown in Fig. 31) wild-typeRetinol (50 mg/kg)6.612) Raldh1-/-Retinol (50 mg/kg)7.07+73) Adh1-/-Retinol (50 mg/kg)11.17+69a [AUC (2 or 3) - AUC (1)] × 100 ÷ AUC (1)b Values were calculated from data shown in Fig. 1c Values were calculated from data shown in Fig. 2d Values were calculated from data shown in Fig. 3 Open table in a new tab RA Degradation in Raldh1 -/- and Adh1 -/- Mice—We examined whether the observed decrease in serum RA detectable in Raldh1 -/- mice after retinol administration is due to a decrease in RA synthesis or whether altered RA degradation in these mutants may play a role. RA is efficiently metabolized to polar degradation products (50Frolik C.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Vol. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 177-208Crossref Google Scholar), leading to a half-life in mouse serum of 0.5–1.0 h (8Armstrong R.B. Ashenfelter K.O. Eckhoff C. Levin A.A. Shapiro S.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 545-572Google Scholar). Following treatment of wild-type mice with 10 mg/kg RA, serum RA was quantified over time to examine the time course of clearance (degradation). Our earlier studies have demonstrated that treatment with this dose of RA results in peak serum RA concentrations of 1550 ng/ml for wild-type mice and 1250 ng/ml for Adh1 -/- mice (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22553-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In comparison, Raldh1 -/- mice exhibited a peak RA concentration of 1560 ng/ml (Fig. 2). A comparison of AUC values for wild-type mice and the two mutants shows that Raldh1 deficiency results in a 23% increase in serum RA detectable during the 6-h period following RA administration, whereas Adh1 deficiency results in a 26% decrease in serum RA (Table I). Thus, there is a small decrease in RA degradation in Raldh1 -/- mice and a small increase in RA degradation in Adh1 -/- mice. The effects on RA degradation are relatively small for both mutants, strengthening the case that the observed reductions in RA detection following retinol administration are primarily the result of decreases in RA synthesis. Clearance of Retinol in Raldh1 -/- and Adh1 -/- Mice—The normal concentration of retinol in mouse serum is ∼0.3 μg/ml (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our previous investigations have shown that serum retinol levels measured 2 h after retinol administration (50 mg/kg) are increased to 1.6 μg/ml in wild-type mice and to 3.1 μg/ml in Adh1 -/- mice, suggesting slower retinol clearance in Adh1 -/- mice (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22553-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, retinol clearance was measured over a 4-h period for wild-type, Raldh1 -/-, and Adh1 -/- mice treated with 50 mg/kg retinol (Fig. 3). A comparison of AUC values for wild-type mice and the two mutant strains indicates that Raldh1 deficiency results in a 7% increase in serum retinol detectable during the 4-h period following retinol administration, whereas Adh1 deficiency results in a 69% increase (Table I). This demonstrates that Raldh1 -/- mice have a small decrease in retinol clearance, whereas Adh1 -/- mice have a relatively large decrease in retinol clearance. Appearance of Retinaldehyde Following Retinol Administration—As the equilibrium of the reversible retinol/retinaldehyde interconversion by ADH favors retinaldehyde reduction (51Bliss A.F. Arch. Biochem. 1951; 31: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and as further oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA by ALDH is very efficient (18Lee M.-O. Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 52Futterman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), retinaldehyde is normally present at very low levels in tissues with the exception of the eye where it functions in the visual cycle (53Wald G. Science. 1951; 113: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we found that retinaldehyde was undetectable in serum of wild-type, Raldh1 -/-, and Adh1 -/- mice prior to retinol treatment (the limit of detection was 1 ng/ml). One hour after retinol administration (100 mg/kg), serum retinaldehyde was detected at 60 ng/ml in wild-type mice, 150 ng/ml in Raldh1 -/- mice, and 20 ng/ml in Adh1 -/- mice (Fig. 4). Thus, during clearance of excess retinol, deficiency of Raldh1 leads to excessive accumulation of retinaldehyde, whereas deficiency of Adh1 leads to a reduction in retinaldehyde accumulation. Retinol Toxicity in Raldh1 -/- and Adh1 -/- Mice—We previously reported retinol LD50 values for wild-type mice (2.72 g/kg) and Adh1 -/- mice (0.9 g/kg), demonstrating that Adh1 plays a large role in reducing retinol toxicity (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, the retinol LD50 value for Raldh1 -/- mice was found to be 2.0 g/kg, close to the border of being statistically significant when considering the confidence limits (Table II). These findings suggest that Raldh1 may provide some protection against retinol toxicity but that Adh1 plays a larger role.Table IIEffect of Raldh 1 or Adh 1 deficiency on retinol lethal dose The values for wild-type and Adh1 -/- mice were previously reported (26Molotkov A.

Molotkov A. Manabe S.-I. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the results reported here establish that Raldh1 plays a role in retinol clearance in vivo. Evidence is provided that Raldh1 functions downstream of Adh1 in the oxidative clearance of excess retinol through metabolism to RA. As the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde by ADH1 is a reversible reaction (10Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 51Bliss A.F. Arch. Biochem. 1951; 31: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 54Zachman R.D. Olson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2309-2313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), efficient clearance of retinol requires that retinaldehyde be metabolized further and RALDH1 does this by irreversibly oxidizing retinaldehyde to RA. This function distinguishes Raldh1 from Raldh2, which clearly plays a role in the production of RA for developmental RA signaling (31Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dollé P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 32Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether Raldh1 functions in any aspects of RA synthesis needed for RA signaling in either adult or developing animals in addition to its function in retinol turnover described here. The genetic studies presented here have demonstrated that RALDH1 metabolizes large quantities of retinaldehyde to RA in adult mice as part of the oxidative pathway to remove toxic levels of retinol initiated by ADH1. Although acute retinol doses of 50–100 mg/kg were needed to effectively quantitate the RA and retinaldehyde produced in Raldh1 -/- mice, this level of retinol would not be encountered in the normal diet of animals in the wild. However, our previous results demonstrating decreased postnatal survival and increased liver toxicity in Adh1 -/- mice treated chronically with a retinol-supplemented diet containing 10-fold higher retinol are applicable to physiological conditions for some animals (such as carnivores) as the amount of retinol ingested could be obtained by natural diets rich in vitamin A (i.e. liver) (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that in some animals ADH1 and RALDH1 are useful for prevention of chronic accumulation of dietary retinol. We had demonstrated earlier by analysis of Adh1 -/- mice and wild-type mice treated with ethanol (an effective competitive inhibitor of ADH1-catalyzed retinol oxidation) that ADH1 is responsible for most of the metabolism of retinol to RA during the 4-h period following retinol administration (43Molotkov A. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22553-22557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As calculated here, ADH1 is responsible for 82% of the AUC RA before correction for an apparent 26% increase in RA degradation in Adh1 -/- mice and 78% after correction for increased RA degradation (AUCuncorrected (0.52) × 1.26 = AUCcorrected (0.65)). Under the same experimental conditions, we show here that RALDH1 is responsible for 72% of the AUC RA before correction for an apparent 23% decrease in RA degradation in Raldh1 -/- mice and 77% after correction for decreased RA degradation (AUCuncorrected (0.83) ÷ 1.23 = AUCcorrected (0.67)). The effects of Adh1 or Raldh1 null mutations on RA degradation are relatively small, demonstrating that the observed reductions in serum RA following administration of retinol to Adh1 -/- and Raldh1 -/- mice are mostly the result of reduced RA synthesis. As the corrected AUC values show that each null mutant reduces RA synthesis by approximately the same amount (77–78%), this establishes quite conclusively that they are effecting the same metabolic pathway. In addition, the observation of 3-fold reduced serum retinaldehyde levels in Adh1 -/- mice following retinol treatment provides evidence that ADH1 is the dominant enzyme-catalyzing oxidation of excess retinol to retinaldehyde. Likewise, the observation of 2.5-fold higher serum retinaldehyde levels in Raldh1 -/- mice following retinol treatment provides evidence that RALDH1 is the dominant enzyme-catalyzing oxidation of excess retinaldehyde to RA. Thus, a loss of RALDH1 results in accumulation of retinaldehyde produced by ADH1. We have previously shown that RA produced following a dose of retinol is not the primary toxic moiety in adult animals, because Adh1 -/- mice have less RA production while exhibiting increased toxicity (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that retinol may be the primary toxin, although the intermediate retinaldehyde should be considered. The LD50 value for Adh1 -/- mice was reduced 3-fold compared with wild-type mice, whereas the LD50 value for Raldh1 -/- mice was reduced 1.4-fold. Thus, ADH1 plays a more important role than RALDH1 in protection against retinol toxicity. Following a dose of retinol, we observed excessive accumulation of serum retinol in Adh1 -/- mice, whereas accumulation of retinol in Raldh1 -/- mice was only marginally higher than wild type. We did observe excessive accumulation of retinaldehyde in Raldh1 -/- mice following retinol administration, and this may be responsible for some increased toxicity observed in these mice in the LD50 studies. However, serum retinaldehyde levels were lower in Adh1 -/- mice while toxicity was much higher, providing evidence that excessive accumulation of retinol rather than retinaldehyde is the major factor contributing to toxicity after retinol administration. Our findings indicate that RALDH1-independent mechanisms for retinaldehyde disposition must exist since a large blockage in the further disposition of retinaldehyde would have resulted in a large accumulation of retinol due to the reversible nature of the retinol/retinaldehyde reaction catalyzed by ADH1. We observed that RA was produced at a slower rate in the absence of RALDH1, suggesting that another enzyme can oxidize retinaldehyde to RA in adult mice. This slower rate of RA production may have been sufficient to allow Raldh1 -/- mice to escape major retinol toxicity, but it is possible that retinaldehyde was also metabolized in other fashions. In any event, our results show that the critical step in prevention of retinol toxicity lies in the oxidative metabolism of retinol to retinaldehyde by ADH1, which evidently produces less toxicity than disposition of retinol through other pathways. Other pathways may include P450s, which are known to metabolize retinol to 4-hydroxyretinol (23Roberts E.S. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar). However, metabolism of this sort would actually contribute further to toxicity as P450-mediated metabolism requires molecular oxygen and produces oxygen free radicals that can cause liver damage (55Lieber C.S. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 1994; 32: 631-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 56Kono H. Bradford B.U. Yin M. Sulik K.K. Koop D.R. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. McDonald T. Dikalova A. Kadiiska M.B. Mason R.P. Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1259-G1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolism of retinol by ADH (and retinaldehyde by ALDH) does not directly produce oxygen free radicals because it occurs via dehydrogenation with the cofactor NAD. Another pathway of retinol disposition is glucuronidation to form retinyl glucuronides (57Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 229-255Google Scholar). However, excessive production of retinyl glucuronides may result in toxicity as this has been demonstrated to greatly reduce the amount of uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid substrate available to perform glucuronidation reactions of other compounds to facilitate their excretion (58Bray B.J. Rosengren R.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 173: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are several additional similarities between Adh1 and Raldh1 that provide further evidence that they are functioning in the same metabolic pathway. Similar to Raldh1 -/- mice, Adh1 -/- mice also do not have noticeable defects in development, postnatal viability, or fertility (26Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This points to a function for both ADH1 and RALDH1 in some aspect of adult maintenance, perhaps protection against toxic alcohols or aldehydes. ADH1 is the most abundant ADH protein in mouse liver (59Algar E.M. Seeley T.-L. Holmes R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 60Zgombic-Knight M.

Res. 1997; 21: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and RALDH1 protein is also quite abundant in mouse liver (42Haselbeck R.J. Hoffmann I. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 353-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a major function for both enzymes is the removal of toxic substances in the liver. ADH1 and RALDH1 proteins are both easily detectable in a variety of adult tissues (liver, intestine, adrenal, uterus, and ovary), suggesting that they may function in common metabolic pathways in several adult tissues. ADH1 and RALDH1 can use many corresponding alcohol/aldehyde pairs as substrates including retinol/retinaldehyde, ethanol/acetaldehyde, propanol/propionaldehyde, hexanol/hexanal, and 4-hydroxynonenol/4-hydroxynonenal (10Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 59Algar E.M. Seeley T.-L. Holmes R.S. Eur. J.

These observations indicate that ADH1 and RALDH1 are likely to cooperate in the oxidative clearance of many toxic aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes through reversible equilibration of the alcohol/aldehyde pair by ADH1 followed by irreversible conversion to the carboxylic acid by RALDH1. We thank the Burnham Institute Mouse Genetics Facility for help in generation of Raldh1 -/- mice."

https://openalex.org/W2078685341,"Trichohyalin is expressed in specialized epithelia that are unusually mechanically strong, such as the inner root sheath cells of the hair follicle. We have previously shown that trichohyalin is sequentially subjected to post-synthetic modifications by peptidylarginine deaminases, which convert many of its arginines to citrullines, and by transglutaminases, which introduce intra- and interprotein chain cross-links. Here we have characterized in detail the proteins to which it becomes cross-linked in vivo in the inner root sheath of the mouse hair follicle. We suggest that it has three principal roles. First, it serves as an interfilamentous matrix protein by becoming cross-linked both to itself and to the head and tail end domains of the inner root sheath keratin intermediate filament chains. A new antibody reveals that arginines of the tail domains of the keratins are modified to citrullines before cross-linking, which clarifies previous studies. Second, trichohyalin serves as a cross-bridging reinforcement protein of the cornified cell envelope of the inner root sheath cells by becoming cross-linked to several known or novel barrier proteins, including involucrin, small proline-rich proteins, repetin, and epiplakin. Third, it coordinates linkage between the keratin filaments and cell envelope to form a seamless continuum. Together, our new data document that trichohyalin is a multi-functional cross-bridging protein that functions in the inner root sheath and perhaps in other specialized epithelial tissues by conferring to and coordinating mechanical strength between their peripheral cell envelope barrier structures and their cytoplasmic keratin filament networks."

Here, we used genome-wide microarray comparative genomic hybridization to carry out a higher resolution evaluation of the effect of MMR competence on genomic alterations occurring in 20 cell lines and to determine if characteristic aberrations arise in MMR-proficient and -deficient HCT116 cells undergoing selection for methotrexate resistance. We observed different spectra of aberrations in MMR-proficient compared to -deficient cell lines, as well as among cell lines with different types of MMR-deficiency. We also observed different genetic routes to drug resistance. Resistant MMR-deficient cells most frequently displayed no copy number alterations (16/29 cell pools), whereas all MMR-proficient cells had unique abnormalities involving chromosome 5, including amplicons centered on the target gene, DHFR and/or a neighboring novel locus (7/13 pools). These observations support the concept that tumor genomes are shaped by selection for alterations that promote survival and growth advantage, as well as by the particular dysfunctions in genes responsible for maintenance of genetic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2137729056,"Toc159, a protein located in the outer envelope membrane and the cytosol, is an important component of the receptor complex for nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins. We investigated the molecular mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts by atToc159 using the ppi2 mutant, which has a T-DNA insertion at atToc159, shows an albino phenotype, and does not survive beyond the seedling stage due to a defect in protein import into chloroplasts. First we established that transiently expressing atToc159 in protoplasts obtained from the white leaf tissues of ppi2 plants complements the protein import defect into chloroplasts. Using this transient expression approach and a series of deletion mutants, we demonstrated that the C-terminal membrane-anchored (M) domain is targeted to the chloroplast envelope membrane in ppi2 protoplasts, and is sufficient to complement the defect in protein import. The middle GTPase (G) domain plays an additional critical role in protein import: the atToc159[S/N] and atToc159[D/L] mutants, which have a mutation at the first and second GTP-binding motifs, respectively, do not support protein import into chloroplasts. Leaf cells of transgenic plants expressing the M domain in a ppi2 background contained nearly fully developed chloroplasts with respect to size and density of thylakoid membranes, and displayed about half as much chlorophyll as wild-type cells. In transgenic plants, the isolated M domain localized to the envelope membrane of chloroplasts but not the cytosol. Based on these results, we propose that the M domain is the minimal structure required to support protein import into chloroplasts, while the G domain plays a regulatory role. Toc159, a protein located in the outer envelope membrane and the cytosol, is an important component of the receptor complex for nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins. We investigated the molecular mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts by atToc159 using the ppi2 mutant, which has a T-DNA insertion at atToc159, shows an albino phenotype, and does not survive beyond the seedling stage due to a defect in protein import into chloroplasts.

Leaf cells of transgenic plants expressing the M domain in a ppi2 background contained nearly fully developed chloroplasts with respect to size and density of thylakoid membranes, and displayed about half as much chlorophyll as wild-type cells. In transgenic plants, the isolated M domain localized to the envelope membrane of chloroplasts but not the cytosol. Based on these results, we propose that the M domain is the minimal structure required to support protein import into chloroplasts, while the G domain plays a regulatory role. The majority of chloroplast proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and synthesized in the cytosol. Numerous studies have focused on the molecular mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts (1Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P.

Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The in vitro import assay system, which utilizes purified chloroplasts and in vitro-translated precursor protein, is a crucial tool in these studies (1Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These analyses have indicated that the N-terminal transit peptide contains all the necessary information for the translocation of cargo proteins from the cytosol into chloroplasts. It has been proposed that following translation, soluble precursor proteins migrate by diffusion to receptor complexes located on the envelope membranes of chloroplasts (6Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Keegstra K. Froehlich J.E. Curr. Opin.

The precursor initially binds to lipids of the outer envelope membrane of the chloroplast (10van't Hof R. van Klompenburg W. Pilon M. Kozubek A. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R.A. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4037-4042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bruce B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 223-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently diffuses to the receptor complex. This allows specific interactions between the transit peptide and receptor complex. The precursor is subsequently translocated through a channel formed by subunits of the receptor complexes (12van ‘t Hof R. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22368-22373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Schleiff E. Soll J. Planta. 2000; 211: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), followed by cleavage of the transit peptide to produce mature protein within the chloroplast (14Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Components of the import complex, including proteins located at the outer and inner envelope membranes, have been identified and characterized at the molecular level (6Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Schleiff E. Soll J. Planta. 2000; 211: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the exact roles of these components have not yet been fully elucidated. Toc75 forms a channel at the outer envelope membrane for translocation of chloroplast proteins (15Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 16Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Sveshnikova N. Harrer R. Soll J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Toc34 and Toc159 may function as receptor components that bind transit peptides of precursor proteins. Recent studies show that these three Toc proteins form a complex at the outer envelope membrane (17Schleiff E. Soll J. Kuchler M. Kuhlbrandt W. Harrer R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Another protein component, Toc64, may also bind to the transit peptide at early time points (18Sohrt K Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the role of this protein needs to be further delineated. Using ppi2 plants, which do not have functional Toc159, Toc159 has been shown to be essential for protein import into chloroplasts as well as chloroplast biogenesis (8Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts in ppi2 plant cells are in a proplastid state with almost no thylakoid membranes, which gives an albino phenotype to the leaf tissues (8Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Toc132 and Toc120, two homologs of Toc159, have been identified in the Arabidopsis genome (8Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, these homologs do not complement the loss of Toc159 in ppi2 plants, implying that these proteins are either not expressed in the same cells or are functionally different from Toc159. ppi1 plants, which contain a mutation at Toc34, also have defective protein import into chloroplasts (19Jarvis P. Chen L.J. Li H. Peto C.A. Fankhauser C. Chory J. Science. 1998; 282: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), but in contrast to Toc159, the loss of Toc34 in the ppi1 plant induces a mild phenotype. This may be due to compensation by the expression of Toc33, a close homolog of Toc34 (20Gutensohn M. Schulz B. Nicolay P. Flugge U.I. Plant J. 2000; 23: 771-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toc33/34 and Toc159 contain GTP-binding domains; the GTP-binding domain of Toc159 plays a critical role in its targeting to the outer envelope membrane (21Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The GTP-binding domains of Toc159 and Toc34 are proposed to form a heterodimer for facilitating Toc159 targeting (21Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to the Toc components, the translocon of inner envelope membrane components (Tic) 1The abbreviations used are: Tic, translocon of inner envelope membrane components; atToc159, A. thaliana Toc159; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. subunits have been identified, including Tic115, Tic55, and Tic40 (23Jarvis P. Soll J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1541: 64-79Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, these proteins are less well characterized with respect to their precise roles in protein import. To clarify the role of Toc159, we examined whether Arabidopsis thaliana Toc159 (atToc159) supports protein import into chloroplasts when transiently expressed in ppi2 protoplasts. The atToc159 protein is composed of three different domains, the N-terminal acidic (A), middle GTPase (G), and C-terminal membrane-anchored (M) domains (8Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We further characterized these domains and examined their roles in protein import into chloroplasts. Our data show that the C-terminal M domain is essential for protein import into chloroplasts in a transient expression system of protoplasts as well as transgenic plants. Growth of Plants—Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) (wild type and mutants) were grown on B5 plates in a growth chamber. Leaf tissues were harvested from plants and immediately employed for protoplast isolation. Arabidopsis mutant seeds (seed line, CS11072, Arabidopsis Stock Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) that have a TDNA insertion at the atToc159 gene were planted on kanamycin plates. 2The T-DNA insertion mutant of the atToc159 gene (CS11072) was obtained from a collection of T-DNA insertion lines (Ohio Stock Center). Plants that were kanamycin-resistant and had a wild-type appearance were transferred to soil to set seeds (8Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). ppi2 homozygote plants have an albino phenotype (plants with white leaf tissues, see Fig. 8A, panel b) and do not develop beyond the seedling stage with a few true leaves, indicating that ppi2 plants are seedling lethal. However, heterozygote plants (attoc159/atToc159) are normal and develop into mature plants that set seeds. Thus, the mutants were maintained as heterozygotes (attoc159/atToc159). Homozygous ppi2 mutants (attoc159/attoc159) were selected from pools of plants on plates based on the albino phenotype and used for preparation of protoplasts. Construction of Plasmids—A cDNA encoding atToc159 was isolated from a library by PCR, using the primers 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGACTCAAAGTCGGTT-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTAGTACATGCTGTACTTGTCG-3′. To generate T7:atToc159, atToc159-A, atToc159-G, atToc-159-M, atToc159:GFP, atToc159S/N, atToc159D/L, atToc159M, atToc-159MN78, and atToc159-MC31, PCR amplification was performed, using atToc159 as template, and the following primers: GCTCTAGATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGACAGCAAATG GGTATGGACTCAAAGTCGGTTACT and TCCCCCGGGTTAGTACATGCTGTACTTGTCG for T7:atToc159, 5′-GCTCTAGATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGACAGCAAATGAACCGTTCCAACATCTTTTCC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTAGTACATGCTGTACTTGTCG-3′for atToc159-A, 5′-GCAGCAGCTCCACGTGCAGTTAGATCCCCGCCTCTC-3′and 5′-GAGAGGCGGGGATCTAACTGCACGTGGAGCTGCTGC-3′ for atToc159-G, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGACTCAAAGTCGGTT-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTATCGGAAACCAAATACTTTACGATGG-3′for atToc159-M, 5′-GCTCTAGATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGACAGCAAATGGTTAGATCCCCGCCTCTC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTAGTACATGCTGTACTTGTCG-3′for atTco159M, 5′-CGTACACGTGGAATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-CGTACACGTGCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′ for atToc159:GFP,5′-GGGGTGGGAAAAAATGCTACTATAAATTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTTATAGTAGCATTTTTTCCCACCCC-3′ for atToc159S/N, 5′-GTCAAGATTACCTTTATTTTGACTCCGGGTTTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCAAACCCGGAGTCAAAATAAAGGTAATCTTGAC-3′ for atToc159D/L, 5′-CGTAAAGTATTTGGTTTCCGATTCGAGGAGTATGATTACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTAATCATACTCCTCGAATCGGAAACCAAATACTTTACG-3′ for atToc159MN78, and 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGACTCAAAGTCGGTT-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTACTGATCCGAGCTGCTGGTTC-3′ for atToc159-MC31. All PCR products were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and placed into a pUC-based expression vector with the [35S]CaMV promoter and nos-terminator. Generation of Transgenic Plants and Analysis by PCR—Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing various forms of T7-tagged atToc159 were generated using a binary expression vector with a hygromycin-resistance gene (pBI-Hyg) and the floral dip method (24Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic plants resistant to both kanamycin and hygromycin were screened as described previously (24Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From individual T2 transgenic plants selected on plates containing both kanamycin and hygromycin, two rosette leaves were harvested and used to isolate genomic DNA. PCR was performed with primers designed to amplify the transgenes. The following primers were used: 5′-GAAAGAGTCTCAGTAGCAAAGC-3′ and 5′-TTAGTACATGCTGTACTTGTCG-3′ for endogenous atToc159; 5′-GAAAGAGTCTCAGTAGCAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GATGCAATCGATATCAGCCAATTTTAGAC-3′ for the T-DNA insert; 5′-ATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGA-3′ and 5′-TTAGTACATGCTGTACTTGTCG-3′ for transgenes of T7:atToc159, T7:atToc159-A, T7:atToc159-G, and T7:atToc-159M; and 5′-ATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGA-3′ and 5′-TCGGAAACCAAATACTTTACGATGG-3′ for atToc159-M. Leaves were harvested from the same individual plants for ultrastructural analyses. Ultrastructural Analysis—To obtain a detailed structure of chloroplast morphology, leaf tissues were fixed for 4 h with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), rinsed with the same buffer, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in a cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After dehydration, specimens were embedded in London Resin White (London Resin Co., London, UK). Ultra-thin sections (40-60 nm thick) were collected on uncoated nickel grids (300 mesh), stained with 4% uranyl acetate, and examined using a transmission electron microscope (Jeol 1200) at 60-80 kV. Protein Fractionation and Gel Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were prepared as described previously (25Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Whole-cell extracts were subjected to low-speed centrifugation (7000 × g) at 4 °C for 5 min to eliminate cellular debris. The low-speed supernatant was further fractionated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Whole-cell extracts or fractions were assayed by Western blotting using anti-GFP (Clontech, Inc) and anti-T7 (Novagen) antibodies. RbcS was detected with a polyclonal anti-Rbc antibody (26Kim Y.-W. Park D.S. Park S.C. Kim S.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transient Expression and in Vivo Targeting of Reporter Proteins— Plasmids were introduced by PEG-mediated transformation (25Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 27Lee K.H. Kim D.H. Lee S.W. Kim Z.H. Hwang I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 14: 388-397Google Scholar) into Arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from leaf tissues. Expression of fusion constructs was monitored at various times after transformation, and images were captured with a cooled CCD camera and a Zeiss (Jena, Germany) Axioplan fluorescence microscope (25Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemistry, transformed protoplasts were prepared as described previously (28Sohn E.J. Kim E.S. Zhao M. Kim S.J. Kim H. Kim Y.-W. Lee Y.J. Hillmer S. Sohn U. Jiang L. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Fixed cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody at 4 °C overnight and washed three times with TSW buffer. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) secondary antibody. Images were captured as described above. Transient Expression of atToc159 Supports Protein Import into Chloroplasts in ppi2 Protoplasts—We investigated the role of atToc159 in protein import into chloroplasts using protoplasts derived from Arabidopsis leaf tissues as an experimental system. In this system, DNA constructs encoding reporter proteins destined for the chloroplasts were introduced into protoplasts by the polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation method (25Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 27Lee K.H. Kim D.H. Lee S.W. Kim Z.H. Hwang I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 14: 388-397Google Scholar), and expression of the encoded proteins was monitored at various subsequent time points. We employed two different approaches to analyze the expression and targeting of the proteins. One is based on expressing fusion proteins including green or red fluorescent proteins (GFP or RFP), followed by image analysis using a fluorescent microscope. The other is based on Western blot analysis using antibodies to the expressed proteins. We employed a GFP fusion protein with the N-terminal transit peptide of the small subunit of rubisco complex (RbcS) as a reporter protein (Fig. 1A), as described previously (27Lee K.H. Kim D.H. Lee S.W. Kim Z.H. Hwang I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 14: 388-397Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy analyses revealed that RbcS-nt:GFP is efficiently imported into chloroplasts in protoplasts derived from leaf tissues of wild-type plants (Fig. 1B, panels d-f). In contrast, GFP alone was observed as a diffuse pattern in the cytosol (Fig. 1B, panels a-c). To further confirm the localization of RbcS-nt:GFP, we performed Western blotting using proteins obtained from RbcS-nt:GFP-transformed protoplasts. As shown in Fig. 1D, the majority of RbcS-nt:GFP was detected at 31 kDa (lane 3). Furthermore, the 31-kDa band co-purified with chloroplasts in a Percoll gradient (lane 4), indicating the presence of the protein within this organelle. A very weak band was sometimes detected at 39 kDa (the expected size of full-length RbcS-nt:GFP) in total protein extracts (lane 3) but not in chloroplast extracts (lane 4); this likely corresponds to the precursor RbcS-nt:GFP protein. The 31-kDa band may correspond to the mature protein because the N-terminal transit peptide of chloroplast proteins is proteolytically processed during import (1Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Hand J.M. Szabo L.J. Vasconcelos A.C. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3195-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A band that is smaller than 31 kDa was also observed in the protein extracts, which may be a product of additional proteolytic processing in chloroplasts. Control GFP was detected at 29 kDa, as expected (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Next we examined the import of RbcS-nt:GFP into chloroplasts in protoplasts derived from leaf tissues of ppi2 plants. We examined whether proteins can be imported into the undeveloped chloroplasts in ppi2 plants (8Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). ppi2 protoplasts prepared from the white leaf tissues of ppi2 plants were transformed with RbcS-nt:GFP, and the reporter protein was localized by observing its green fluorescence under a fluorescent microscope. As shown in Fig. 1C, a diffuse pattern of green fluorescent signals from RbcS-nt:GFP (panels d-f) was detected, and was similar to that of GFP alone (panels a and c) except for a few punctate stains (indicated by arrows). The narrow strip patterns of GFP signals observed in these protoplasts are due to the cytosol that is confined between the large central vacuole and the plasma membrane. A similar result was obtained with other reporter proteins such as RA-nt:GFP (a GFP fusion protein with the transit peptide of rubisco activase) (data not shown). Interestingly, the GFP signals of RbcS-nt:GFP at the few punctate stains closely overlapped the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll, as depicted by the yellow signals (indicated by arrows, Fig. 1C, panel f). This suggests that although RbcS-nt:GFP is not efficiently imported into chloroplasts, some portion of RbcS-nt:GFP expressed in ppi2 protoplasts may be imported into the undeveloped chloroplasts. To further confirm the GFP pattern of RbcS-nt:GFP in ppi2 protoplasts, protein extracts were prepared from transformed ppi2 protoplasts and examined by Western blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody. RbcS-nt:GFP was detected as two strong bands at 31 and 39 kDa (Fig. 1D, lane 5). In ppi2 protoplasts, the 39-kDa band was 40% (±5%, n = 6) of total expressed RbcS-nt:GFP and the 31-kDa band was 60% (±5%, n = 6), indicating that the amount of the precursor form is greatly increased in ppi2 protoplasts compared with the wild-type protoplasts. These results are in agreement with the results obtained from the image analysis. Next, we examined whether transient expression of atToc159 complements the loss of atToc159 with respect to protein import into chloroplasts in ppi2 protoplasts. We generated atToc159 tagged with a small epitope (T7) at the N terminus for detection by Western blot. Protoplasts obtained from ppi2 plants were co-transformed with two plasmids, RbcS-nt:GFP and T7:atToc159, and localization of the reporter protein was examined. When co-transformed with T7:atToc159, the green fluorescence of RbcS-nt:GFP was detected as punctate stains with no diffuse signals (Fig. 2A, panels e and g), in contrast to what was seen in ppi2 protoplasts expressing RbcS-nt:GFP alone (panels a and c). Furthermore, these green punctate stains closely overlapped the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll. To further verify protein import in the presence of co-expressed atToc159, Western blotting was performed using proteins prepared from transformed ppi2 protoplasts. As shown in Fig. 2B (top panel), RbcS-nt:GFP was detected mainly as the mature form, with nearly undetectable levels of precursor (lane 3), indicating that the protein is efficiently imported into chloroplasts. We additionally examined the expression of atToc159 using an anti-T7 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B (bottom panel), the monoclonal anti-T7 antibody specifically detected a band at 230 kDa (the expected position of atToc159) (lane 3) in protoplasts transformed with RbcS-nt:GFP together with atToc159, but not in those transformed with RbcS-nt:GFP alone (lane 2) or non-transformed protoplasts (lane 1). The C-terminal M Domain Is Sufficient for Protein Import into Chloroplasts in ppi2 Mutants—The next step was to identify the domain of atToc159 that is critical for protein import into chloroplasts. Various deletion mutants were generated and tagged with T7 at the N terminus (Fig. 3A). Constructs were introduced into protoplasts along with RbcS-nt:GFP, and import of the fusion protein into chloroplasts was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 3, B and C). The degree to which these mutants complemented the defect in the protein import was assessed by measuring the reduction in the precursor form. In control protoplasts transformed with the vector alone, the precursor level was 35% of the total RbcS-nt:GFP (Fig. 3B, lane 1). In protoplasts expressing atToc159-A (lane 3) or atToc159M (lane 6), the precursor form of RbcS-nt:GFP was nearly undetectable, similar to that observed with full-length atToc159 (lane 2). In the presence of atToc159-G (lane 4), the amount of precursor protein was 15% of the total RbcS-nt:GFP expressed, implying that the ability of this mutant to support protein import into chloroplasts was hampered but still functional. However, in protoplasts expressing atToc159-M (lane 5), the amount of precursor RbcS-nt:GFP was equivalent to that in protoplasts transformed with vector alone, indicating that the M domain is most critical for protein import into chloroplasts. Expression of these mutant atToc159 proteins in ppi2 protoplasts was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-T7 antibody. The deletion mutants were present at nearly equal levels in the protein extracts prepared from transformed protoplasts (Fig. 3D), confirming their expression in ppi2 protoplasts. atToc159-A (lane 3) and atToc159-M (lane 6) were detected at the expected positions based on their calculated molecular weights, whereas the atToc159 (lane 2), atToc159-G (lane 4), and atToc159-M (lane 5) bands were much larger than their expected sizes. Toc159 has previously been detected at 230 kDa instead of 159 kDa (the calculated molecular weight of Toc159) (29Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The migration patterns of these deletion mutants strongly suggest that the abnormal mobility of atToc159 is due to the A domain. To further define the domain necessary for protein import into chloroplasts, we generated additional mutants, atToc159-MN78 and atToc159-MC31 (Fig. 4A). The atToc159-MN78 mutant underwent a 78-amino acid deletion from the N-terminal side of the M domain, while atToc159-MC31 has a 31-amino acid deletion from the C terminus of the M domain. The deletion mutants were introduced into ppi2 protoplasts together with RbcS-nt:GFP. Protein extracts were prepared and RbcS-nt:GFP import was examined by Western blot. As depicted in Fig. 4, B and C, ∼29% of RbcS-nt:GFP was detected as the precursor form upon co-expression with atToc159-MN78 (lane 3), and 24% was detected as precursor when RbcS-nt:GFP was co-expressed with atToc159-MC31 (lane 4). In the control protoplasts transformed with RbcS-nt:GFP alone, 35% of the RbcS-nt:GFP was in the precursor form. Expression of the atToc159-MN78 and atToc159-MC31 mutant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using the anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 4D). Our results strongly suggest that the intact M domain is necessary to support protein import into chloroplasts. The M Domain Alone Is Targeted to Chloroplasts—Earlier studies have shown that Toc159 is present in both membrane-associated and soluble forms (29Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and that the G domain plays a critical role in the targeting of the protein to the outer envelope membrane (21Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the fact that the M domain is sufficient to support protein import into chloroplasts in ppi2 protoplasts raises the possibility that the isolated M domain may also be targeted to chloroplasts. Thus, we examined the localization of atToc159 and the M domain. We generated GFP-tagged atToc159 by inserting the GFP coding region between the A and G domains; the resulting construct was introduced into protoplasts of wild-type plants."
https://openalex.org/W2067046669,"p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by binding of the p21 G proteins Cdc42 or Rac. The ubiquitous PAK-2 (γ-PAK) is unique among the PAK isoforms because it is also activated through proteolytic cleavage by caspases or caspase-like proteases. In response to stress stimulants such as tumor necrosis factor α or growth factor withdrawal, PAK-2 is activated as a full-length enzyme and as a proteolytic PAK-2p34 fragment. Activation of full-length PAK-2 stimulates cell survival, whereas proteolytic activation of PAK-2p34 is involved in programmed cell death. Here we provide evidence that the proapoptotic effect of PAK-2p34 is regulated by subcellular targeting and degradation by the proteasome. Full-length PAK-2 is localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the proteolytic PAK-2p34 fragment translocates to the nucleus. Subcellular localization of PAK-2 is regulated by nuclear localization and nuclear export signal motifs. A nuclear export signal motif within the regulatory domain prevents nuclear localization of full-length PAK-2. Proteolytic activation removes most of the regulatory domain and disrupts the nuclear export signal. The activated PAK-2p34 fragment contains a nuclear localization signal and translocates to the nucleus. However, levels of activated PAK-2p34 are tightly regulated through ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Inhibition of degradation by blocking polyubiquitination results in significantly increased levels of PAK-2p34 and as a consequence, in stimulation of programmed cell death. Therefore, nuclear targeting and inhibition of degradation appear to be critical for stimulation of the cell death response by PAK-2p34."

Herein, we describe the identification of carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) as a novel target of LRH-1 in pancreas, a tissue in which LRH-1 is abundantly expressed. In situ hybridization and gene expression studies demonstrate that both LRH-1 and CEL are co-expressed and confined to the exocrine pancreas. LRH-1 interacts with a consensus LRH-1 response element in the human CEL promoter, which is perfectly conserved in the rat gene, and induces CEL promoter activity in cotransfection assays. As reported for other LRH-1 target genes, the nuclear receptor short heterodimer partner represses LRH-1-induced CEL promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that binding of LRH-1 to the CEL promoter increases histone H4 acetylation corresponding with the activation of endogenous CEL gene transcription.

(sterol esterase; EC 3.1.1.13), also called bile salt-dependent lipase, bile salt-stimulated lipase, or pancreatic cholesterol esterase, is synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum of pancreatic acinar cells and secreted into the intestinal lumen as one of the major components of pancreatic juice. CEL binds to the brush border membrane of the small intestine enterocytes in a heparin-dependent fashion (1Bosner M.S. Gulick T. Riley D.J. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The free cholesterol and fatty acids then released are absorbed by the mucosal cells, where they are re-esterified and transported to the liver as chylomicron particles. CEL has also been shown to be involved in the assembly and secretion of large chylomicrons by the enterocytes of the proximal intestine because it controls the hydrolysis of long chain ceramides (2Kirby R.J.

These long chain ceramides are generated from sphingomyelin hydrolysis, which is required for cholesterol uptake by enterocytes.

Moreover, LRH-1 seems to be involved in the control of cholesterol homeostasis. It has been shown to regulate two of the main enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol, CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 (11Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CYP7A1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway, and CYP8B1 is involved in cholic acid synthesis. The level of CYP8B1 activity determines the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid pool, which influences biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion as well as intestinal cholesterol absorption. Bile acids inhibit their own synthesis via a farnesoid X receptor-mediated induction of the short heterodimer partner (SHP), an atypical nuclear receptor, which represses LRH-1 activity (15Lu T.T.

Interestingly, LRH-1 has been shown to be a necessary competence factor for LXR/RXR heterodimer-mediated activation of CYP7A1 (15Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J.

LRH-1 is also required for reverse cholesterol transport because it induces the expression of the human cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (18Luo Y. Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Finally, in the intestine, it induces the multidrug resistance protein 3, a protein believed to be involved in the transport of bile acids from the enterocyte into blood (20Inokuchi A. Hinoshita E.

This study identifies a novel implication for LRH-1 in cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of CEL transcription. CEL represents the first LRH-1 target gene expressed in the exocrine pancreas. In view of the role of CEL in cholesterol absorption and in lipoprotein assembly, our data further emphasize the central role of LRH-1 in cholesterol homeostasis and provide indications for a more general role in lipid homeostasis. Recombinant Plasmids—The different CEL promoter luciferase reporter plasmids, CEL1 (–955 to +49), CEL2 (–871 to +49), CEL3 (–667 to +49), and CEL4 (–459 to +49), were generated by cloning different promoter fragments in the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis of the potential LRH-1 binding sites in the CEL3 construct was accomplished with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward mutagenic primers (mutated bases underlined) are m1, 5′-AgggAAACCTAAACCgTTgggCTAgATgCC-3′; m2, 5′-gACAgTTCCACACCgATTAgTgggACTgCC-3′; m3, 5′-gCTCgTACAgAAATCgTCAgCCACATgAgT-3′; m4, 5′-CCCTTTTCTCTgACgATTACACCAAgCCCT-3′; m5-1, 5′-AACAAgCATgTgACgATTgATCCAgCTCCA-3′. Full-length mouse LRH-1 cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pCMX. The pCMX-LXRα and -β expression vectors were a gift from D. J. Mangelsdorf, the CDM8-SHP vector was provided by D. D. Moore, and the pSG5-RXRα expression vector was a gift from P. Chambon. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The expression vector CMV-β-Gal encoding for β-galactosidase is described elsewhere (22MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—CV-1 and HepG2 cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK), whereas the mouse pancreatic adenocarcinoma LTPA cell line was from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained as specified by the providers. Transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation (23Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar) or by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Luciferase measurements were normalized to β-galactosidase activity (23Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). RNA Analysis and in Situ Hybridization—RNA extraction, Northern blot analysis, and hybridizations were performed as described previously (24Schoonjans K. Gelman L. Haby C. Briggs M. Auwerx J. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), the human β-actin (26Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. McDonald R.J. Cowan M.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), and the human LRH-1 cDNA (GenBank accession number U93553) were used as probes. The human multiple tissue Northern blot was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Reverse transcription of RNA was performed at 37 °C for 1 h using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT, followed by a 15-min inactivation at 70 °C. In situ hybridization was performed using 35S-labeled sense and antisense RNA probes on 10-μm cryosections of adult pancreatic tissue, as described by Dolle et al. (27Dolle P. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mouse LRH-1 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript-SK+ (Stratagene) and linearized by NotI. Antisense LRH-1 RNA was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). A 794-bp fragment (93 to 886) of the human CEL cDNA that recognizes the mouse CEL was cloned between the sites XhoI and HindIII of pBluescript-SK+ and linearized by XhoI. Antisense CEL RNA was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). EMSA and Oligonucleotide Sequences—Mouse LRH-1 was synthesized in vitro using the TNT T7-quick coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and the expression vector pCMX-LRH-1. Molecular weight and quality of the proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously (23Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, an anti-LRH-1 antibody (kindly provided by C. Dreyer (28Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Hihi A.K. Laudet V. Keller H. Wahli W. Dreyer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2786-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was allowed to interact in the binding buffer with the in vitro synthesized LRH-1. After 15 min, radioactive probe was added. The total mixture was incubated for 20 min and loaded on gel. For competition experiments, increasing amounts (from 10- to 200-fold molar excess) of unlabeled oligonucleotide (s5, 5′-gATCCAgCATgTgACCTTggATCCAgA-3′, m5-1, 5′-gATCCAgCATgTgACgATTgATCCAgA-3′; and m5-2, 5′-gATCCAgCATgAAACgATTgATCCAgA-3′) (mutated bases underlined) were included in the reactions. ChIP Assays—For chromatin immunoprecipitation, an anti-acetylated H4 histone antibody (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France) and an anti-LRH-1 antibody (28Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Hihi A.K. Laudet V. Keller H. Wahli W. Dreyer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2786-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Cellular proteins were cross-linked to DNA with 1% formaldehyde at 21 °C for 10 min. After cell lysis, three 9-s cycles of sonication were performed to prepare DNA fragments ranging in size from 200 to 1000 bp. Next, lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out overnight at 4 °C using dilutions of 1/400 for the anti-acetyl H4 histone and of 1/80 for the anti-LRH-1 antibody. The antibody-DNA complex was precipitated using protein A-Sepharose. After washing and elution, the cross-linking was reversed by heating the samples at 65 °C overnight. The DNA was then purified and used for PCR amplification using quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCR—Quantification was carried out by real-time PCR using a LightCycler and the DNA double-strand specific SYBR Green I dye for detection (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The primer pairs used to amplify mouse LRH-1, mouse/human 36B4, and human CEL cDNAs were: 5′-CTAgTTTggATACTggAgATTTTCA-3′ and 5′-ATAggAgTAATTCACCATTTTAAAT-3′, 5′-ATgTgAAgTCACTgTgCCAg-3′ and 5′-gTgTAATCCgTCTCCACAgA-3′, and 5′-AgAAggTgggTTCgTggAAg-3′ and 5′-gAAggTgACCACgATgACgT-3′, respectively. The primer pairs used to amplify a CEL promoter domain containing s5 and to amplify a region that does not contain s5 were: 5′-ACCAAgCCCTgTgAACAAAC-3′ and 5′-TCTgATTgAgCgAgAgAgCA-3′, and 5′-CTTgAggCTCAggAgTTTCg-3′ and 5′-gCTAgAgTgCAgTggCACAA-3′, respectively. Expression of CEL Co-localizes with LRH-1 Expression in the Exocrine Pancreas—Expression of the genes encoding for LRH-1 and CEL was determined in a number of human and murine tissues by Northern blot hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1). In humans and mice, CEL mRNA was detected only in the pancreas, a tissue also particularly enriched in LRH-1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Co-expression of CEL and LRH-1 in the pancreas was confirmed at the subcellular level by in situ hybridization on sections of mouse pancreas, where the expression of CEL and LRH-1 was confined to the exocrine structures (Fig. 1C). As reported previously (9Galarneau L. Paré J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Lévesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Li M.

Dev. 1999; 89: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), LRH-1 is also expressed in mouse intestine (Fig. 1B, lane 2), as well as in murine and human liver (Fig. 1, B, lane 3, and A, lane 5, respectively). The observation that CEL and LRH-1 are co-expressed in the exocrine pancreas pointed to the possibility that LRH-1 might control the expression of CEL in this tissue. The CEL Promoter Is Activated by LRH-1—To determine whether LRH-1 regulates transcription of the CEL gene, CV-1 cells were cotransfected with a human CEL promoter-luciferase reporter construct, containing sequences between –955 bp and +49 (CEL1) (Fig. 2A), and an LRH-1 expression vector. A 6-fold increase in CEL promoter activity was observed (Fig. 2B). In addition, a 3.9-fold induction of the CEL promoter activity was seen upon LRH-1 cotransfection of the mouse pancreatic LTPA cell line (Fig. 2C). These observations suggest that LRH-1 activates the CEL promoter. To localize the potential response element(s) in the CEL promoter mediating LRH-1 regulation, CEL1, CEL2, CEL3, and CEL4 deletion constructs (Fig. 2A) were generated and assayed for responsiveness to LRH-1 in CV-1 cells. Cotransfection of LRH-1 induced the CEL1, CEL2, and CEL3 reporter constructs to a similar extent, whereas a drop in promoter activation was observed with the CEL4 construct (Fig. 2B). Because construct CEL3 retained most of the promoter activity in response to LRH-1 cotransfection, we focused on the sequence between –667 and +49 to further map the regulatory element(s) mediating the effect of LRH-1. LRH-1 Stimulates CEL Gene Transcription through Its Direct Interaction with s5—Five sequence motifs, designated s1 to s5, with homology to the consensus Ftz-F1 motif 5′-YCAAGGYCR-3′, were identified in the region spanning the nucleotide –667 up to +49 of the human CEL promoter (CEL3) (Fig. 3A). One of these, s5, is perfectly conserved between the rat (29Fontaine R.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7008-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and human genes (Fig. 3B) and is highly homologous to LRH-1 response elements previously identified in the promoter of different LRH-1 target genes (Fig. 3C). EMSA were used to investigate binding of in vitro synthesized LRH-1 to these potential response elements in the CEL promoter (s1 to s5; Fig. 3A). An intense shifted band was observed only with the s5 probe (Fig. 4A). This band was no longer present upon addition of an anti-LRH-1 antibody that interferes with LRH-1 DNA binding domain, showing the specific binding by LRH-1. CEL s5 and an LRH-1 binding site (TCAAGGTTG) in the SHP promoter (30Lee Y.K. Parker K.L. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20869-20873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were capable of binding LRH-1 with comparable affinity (data not shown). When increasing concentrations of unlabeled, wild-type oligonucleotide representing s5 were added as competitor, binding of LRH-1 to the CEL s5 probe was inhibited dose-dependently (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–5). Addition of up to 200-fold molar excess of two different mutated oligonucleotides corresponding to s5 (Figs. 3A and 4B, lanes 6–11) did not result in competition for binding of LRH-1 to s5. Likewise, the two mutant s5 sequences were unable to bind LRH-1 in EMSA (Fig. 4B, lanes 12 and 13). These results demonstrate that LRH-1 binds preferentially to the s5 sequence motif, spanning the region –46 to –38, in the CEL promoter.Fig. 4Activation of the CEL promoter by LRH-1 is confined to s5. A, EMSA determining the site in the CEL promoter involved in LRH-1 binding. Double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the sites 1 to 5 of CEL were incubated with unprogrammed (–), reticulocyte lysate programmed to synthesize LRH-1 (+), or reticulocyte lysate programmed to synthesize LRH-1 in the presence of an anti-LRH-1 antibody. LRH-1 binds only s5; this binding is specific as demonstrated by the disappearance of the retarded band in the presence of the anti-LRH-1 antibody. B, competition EMSA was performed in which unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides s5, m5-2, and m5-1 were added at 10-(lanes 3, 6, and 9), 100-(lanes 4, 7, and 10) or 200-(lanes 5, 8, and 11) fold molar excess to a radiolabeled s5 oligonucleotide and in vitro synthesized LRH-1. Only the wild-type s5 (lane 2), but not m5–1 (lane 12) or m5–2 (lane 13) oligonucleotide, was able to bind LRH-1. C, CEL3 reporter constructs carrying mutations of the various sites in the CEL promoter were used in cotransfection experiment in CV-1 cells with an empty control vector or with an LRH-1 expression vector. m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5-1 correspond to the different mutated CEL3 constructs at site 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, shown in Fig. 3A. The fold induction by LRH-1 after correction for transfection efficiency is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To unequivocally demonstrate which of the five putative sequence elements in the CEL promoter confers responsiveness to LRH-1, all five potential sites (Fig. 3A) were mutated individually in the CEL3 reporter construct, and their activity was then compared in CV-1 cells. Although mutation of the s5 element (m5-1) resulted in a complete loss of activation of the CEL promoter by LRH-1, mutations in s1 (m1), s2 (m2), s3 (m3), and s4 (m4), retained complete ability to respond to LRH-1 (Fig. 4C). These results are consistent with those of the EMSA and underscore the idea that s5, the only LRH-1 response element completely conserved between rat and human, is the principal mediator for the LRH-1 response. LRH-1 Binds and Activates the CEL Promoter in Vivo—To show that LRH-1 actually binds and transactivates the CEL promoter in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies were performed using antibodies against LRH-1 and acetylated H4 histones. Acetylation of histones has been shown to stimulate transcription initiation by facilitating access of transcription factors. HepG2 cells were transfected with either an empty expression vector or an LRH-1 expression vector. Upon transfection with LRH-1, specific binding of LRH-1 to the CEL promoter was observed as evidenced by the presence of the band corresponding to the amplification product of the CEL promoter region containing the s5 site (Fig. 5A, top, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the anti-LRH-1 antibody did not immunoprecipitate a region of the CEL promoter distant from s5 (Fig. 5A, center). Occupancy of the CEL promoter by LRH-1 was also associated with an increase in H4 histone acetylation (Fig. 5A, bottom), which corresponds to a 3.8-fold induction as quantified by real-time PCR (Fig. 5B). These observations in the ChIP assay were further corroborated by a 3.7-fold induction of endogenous CEL mRNA levels in response to LRH-1 overexpression (Fig. 5C). In combination, these results establish that LRH-1 binds in vivo to the human CEL promoter and induces an increase in H4 histone acetylation, facilitating subsequent transcriptional initiation. The CEL Promoter Is Regulated by LRH-1 and SHP, but Not by LXR/RXR Heterodimers—SHP was previously shown to inhibit LRH-1 activity on a number of LRH-1 target promoters (15Lu T.T. Makishima M.

To test whether SHP also inhibits the LRH-1-mediated induction of CEL promoter activity, increasing amounts of a SHP expression vector were cotransfected with a fixed amount of LRH-1 and the CEL3 reporter construct. Significant attenuation of the activation of the CEL promoter by LRH-1 was observed upon cotransfection of SHP (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 3 and 4–5). In view of the reported synergism between LRH-1 and LXR (15Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 18Luo Y. Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24767-24773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we tested whether this observation could also be further generalized to the CEL promoter. Interestingly, cotransfection with LXRα/RXR or LXRβ/RXR did not affect the activity of the CEL reporter construct CEL1 in the presence or absence of their cognate ligands, 22-(R)-OH-cholesterol and LG 100268 (Fig. 6B and data not shown). In this study, we provide evidence that CEL expression is subject to regulation by LRH-1. CEL and LRH-1 mRNAs are co-expressed in the exocrine pancreas, compatible with a regulatory role of LRH-1 on CEL expression. LRH-1 induces hCEL promoter activity through a direct interaction with the consensus s5 LRH-1 response element, which was identified by a combination of transient transfection and EMSA experiments. None of the other potential LRH-1 binding sites upstream of s5 interacted with LRH-1. In vivo evidence for the direct regulation of the CEL promoter by LRH-1 was furthermore obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated in vivo binding of LRH-1 to the promoter. Moreover, ChIP assays also showed an increase in H4 histone acetylation on the CEL promoter, indicating that the occupancy of this promoter by LRH-1 is associated with a transcriptional active status. These findings are further corroborated by the observed increase of endogenous CEL mRNA levels in cells that overexpress LRH-1. Interestingly, LRH-1 responsiveness was reduced for the smallest reporter construct CEL4 that still harbors the s5 site. This partial reduction in LRH-1 responsiveness could point to the existence of additional factor(s) acting upstream of s5 that contribute to LRH-1-mediated activation of the CEL promoter. Indeed, LRH-1 and steroidogenic factor-1, another receptor of the Ftz-F1 family, are known to act in synergism with other transcription factors. A transcriptional cooperation between LRH-1 and LXR (15Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1920-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has been reported on other target genes. Most often, such a cooperation translates in a synergistic transcriptional activation. We excluded a cooperative effect between LRH-1 and LXR on CEL promoter activity (see below). We therefore speculate that the reduced activity of the CEL4 reporter relative to longer CEL reporters is caused by the loss of cooperation with another transcription factor, also unidentified, binding to the CEL promoter. High fat/high cholesterol feeding has been shown to induce CEL mRNA levels (7Brodt-Eppley J. Hui D.Y. J. Lipid. Res. 1994; 35: 27-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the activation of the LXR/RXR signaling pathway by cholesterol (33Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Cotransfection with LXRα/RXR or LXRβ/RXR, in the presence of their cognate ligands, did not affect the activity of the CEL promoter, an effect that was not changed by the presence of LRH-1. The absence of a regulatory effect of LXR on CEL expression is furthermore bolstered by the absence of LXR expression in the exocrine pancreas (M. Dubois, K. Schoonjans, J. Auwerx, unpublished data). Hence, another factor might be involved in the high fat/high cholesterol induction of CEL mRNA levels. SHP has been reported to interact with a variety of nuclear receptors (34Seol W. Choi H.S.

In line with these data, we demonstrate here that SHP also attenuates the LRH-1-mediated induction of CEL promoter activity. CEL is a key gatekeeper of dietary cholesterol absorption, as it catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in the intestinal lumen. Dietary cholesterol becomes incorporated through the action of bile acids into mixed micelles and is absorbed as free cholesterol by intestinal cells. Cholesteryl esters require hydrolysis before their absorption. Compared with control mice, CEL null mice absorb only half the amount of cholesteryl esters, confirming a primary role for CEL in hydrolysis and, consequently, absorption of cholesterol from cholesteryl esters (43Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 44Weng W. Li L. van Bennekum A.M. Potter S.H. Harrison E.H. Blaner W.S. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, CEL has a wide substrate specificity in that it has been shown to hydrolyze not only cholesteryl esters but also triglycerides, phospholipids, lysophospholipids (reviewed in Ref. 45Wang C.S. Hartsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), vitamin esters (46Traber M.G. Goldberg I. Davidson E. Lagmay N. Kayden H.J. Gastroenterology. 1990; 98: 96-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), retinyl esters (47Rigtrup K.M. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2920-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and lipoamides (48Hui D.Y. Hayakawa K. Oizumi J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for this enzyme in the digestion and absorption of a broad spectrum of dietary lipids. In view of its enterohepatic expression and its regulatory role in reverse cholesterol transport and bile acid homeostasis, through its effect on human cholesteryl ester transfer protein, scavenger receptor class B type I, CYP7A1, CYP8B1, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, and multidrug resistance protein 3 expression, LRH-1 has been proposed as a key factor in cholesterol homeostasis. The current study, identifying CEL as the first LRH-1 target gene expressed in the exocrine pancreas, lends further support to this hypothesis. The role of CEL in the hydrolysis of dietary lipids and chylomicron assembly and secretion might, however, point to a more complex role of LRH-1 that goes beyond the regulation of reverse cholesterol transport and bile acid homeostasis, and suggests that LRH-1 could control other critical steps in cholesterol homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W1970579022,"Nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) has been shown both to block apoptosis and to promote cell proliferation, and hence has been considered an important target for anticancer drug development. The pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (araC) is among the most effective agents used in the treatment of acute leukemia, and we demonstrate in this study that its chemotherapeutic activity may be mediated by its inhibition of NF-κB. We found that in Jurkat cells, although tumor necrosis factor (TNF), araC, or ceramide induced NF-κB, the induction was only transient in the case of araC. In both HuT-78 and serum-activated LPS-stimulated Jurkat (SA-LPS/Jkt) cells that expressed NF-κB, TNF or ceramide treatments did not affect the NF-κB expression whereas araC downregulated it. AraC, but not TNF or ceramide was able to induce apoptosis in these cells as detected by assays for lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen intermediates generation, caspase activation, cytotoxicity, Bcl-2 degradation, and DNA fragmentation. AraC also potentiated apoptosis mediated by cis-platin, etoposide, or taxol in these cells. AraC was able to induce protein phosphatases (PP) 2A and 2B-A, and phosphorylation of p65 subunit of NF-κB in the HuT-78 and SA-LPS/Jkt cells was downregulated by araC treatment. Furthermore, calyculin A, a specific phospho-serine/phospho-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, protected HuT-78 and SA-LPS/Jkt cells from araC-mediated NF-κB downregulation and apoptosis. These observations collectively suggest that araC induces apoptosis in NF-κB-expressing cells by dephosphorylating the p65 subunit of NF-κB."

We have identified through yeast two-hybrid screening a novel protein, periphilin, interacting with periplakin, which is known as a precursor of the cornified cell envelope. Periphilin gene at chromosome 12q12 gives rise to multiple alternatively spliced transcripts. A monoclonal antibody detected the keratinocyte-specific periphilin isoform in undifferentiated keratinocytes in speckle-type nuclear granules and at the nuclear membrane, but in differentiated keratinocytes periphilin localized to the cell periphery and at cell-cell junctions, colocalizing there with periplakin. From cultured keratinocytes, periphilin was solubilized only after urea extraction, indicating the highly insoluble character of this protein. The nuclear localization, mediated through the N-terminal sequences of periphilin protein, is a prerequisite for the formation of insoluble complexes. Although the globular N terminus of periphilin was necessary for the interaction with the periplakin tail, the keratinocyte-specific C terminus was responsible for the homodimerization. The C-terminal helical domain, composed of multiple heptad repeats, serves as a substrate for cross-linking by transglutaminases but also was specifically cleaved by caspase-5 in vitro.

The cornified cell envelope consists of proteins such as periplakin, envoplakin, involucrin, loricrin, and small proline-rich proteins, which are gradually deposited under the inner side of the plasma membrane as keratinocytes go through terminal differentiation and move to the higher epidermal layers. These proteins are cross-linked in a Ca2+-dependent reaction that is catalyzed by the epidermal transglutaminases to provide a protective layer between the environment and the living layers of the skin. The water barrier function of this envelope is maintained by a thick layer of lipids attached to the exterior of the cornified envelope (1Kalinin A.E. Kajava A.V. Steinert P.M.

PKB signaling plays a crucial role in providing cellular protection against apoptosis. PKB becomes activated at the plasma membrane by phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mediated production of phosphoinositol lipids. Following activation, PKB needs to translocate to other cellular compartments. In addition to acting as a docking site, periplakin may also function as a shuttle for the delivery of PKB to various subcellular compartments (5van den Heuvel A.P.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Weeren P.C.

Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, MPRs cycle between cell surface and endosomes. MPRs are also involved in the constitutive secretory pathway of small transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. Thus it is suggested that periplakin facilitates the transport of vesicles or that it functions as a scaffold at the plasma membrane during terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, either during the degradation of cellular compartments or the assembly of the cornified envelope. The intermediate filaments, composed of keratins and vimentin, form the major scaffold within both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The colocalization of periplakin with the intermediate filaments (8DiColandrea T. Karashima T. Määttä A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Karashima T. Watt F.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 5027-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the direct molecular interaction with keratin 8 and vimentin (5van den Heuvel A.P.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Weeren P.C. Dijkers P.F. de Bruyn K.M.T. Riedl J.A. Burgering B.M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Kazerounian S. Uitto J. Aho S. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 11: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) emphasize a role for periplakin as an intermediate filament binding protein similar to plectin (11Nikolic B. Nulty E.M. Mir B. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The central rod domain of periplakin, predicted to form a coiled-coil structure, is responsible for homodimerization, but periplakin is also able to heterodimerize with envoplakin (8DiColandrea T. Karashima T. Määttä A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Parry D.A.D. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Envoplakin is one of the early precursors of the cornified cell envelope. Although, envoplakin alone is not able to localize to the plasma membrane or bind to the intermediate filaments, it has been suggested that a dependence on heterodimerization with periplakin can facilitate such actions (8DiColandrea T. Karashima T. Määttä A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To identify proteins interacting with periplakin, we executed a yeast two-hybrid screening with the periplakin C-terminal domain (10Kazerounian S. Uitto J. Aho S. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 11: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of a novel protein that colocalizes with periplakin at the cell-cell junctions in the outer granular cell layers of epidermis but is also a prominent nuclear protein. The novel protein, periphilin, may have a periplakin-independent functional role in the cell nucleus, but although the terminally differentiated keratinocytes become flattened within the upper granular layer of epidermis and the nuclei become disintegrated, the molecular complexes containing this highly insoluble protein may bind to periplakin at the plasma membrane and become incorporated into the cornified cell envelope. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—For the two-hybrid bait construct, a cDNA clone encoding periplakin C-terminal region, aa 1584–1756, was inserted into pGB-MEL1 (10Kazerounian S. Uitto J. Aho S. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 11: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human foreskin keratinocyte cDNA library in the GAL4-AD vector was purchased from Clontech and amplified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed according to the Clontech yeast two-hybrid manual, using the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit (Zymo Research) for preparing competent yeast cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae YRG-2 cells (Stratagene) were cotransformed with 1 μg of GAL4 binding domain and GAL4 activation domain fusion constructs. Cells were plated on double-minus plates (–Trp, –Leu) and triple-minus plates (–Trp, –Leu, –His), and colonies were allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3–5 days. The positive interaction between two proteins was detected by the appearance of large pink colonies on triple-minus plates. The ingredients for yeast media were purchased from Difco and from Bio 101, Inc. (Vista, CA). Periphilin Expression Constructs—Plasmid DNA of the cDNA library was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with DyNAzyme EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes OY, MJ Research, Inc.), and PCR was executed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate periphilin deletion constructs, forward primers 5′-GAA TTC GAT GAA TCT GGT TAT AGA TGG (exon 5) and 5′-GAA TTC GAT AAA GAG AGG CCT GTC CAG (exon 8) and reverse primers 5′-GTC GAC TAT TTC ATG TAA ATT CTG C (exon 11 at the cryptic splicing site) and 5′-GTC GAC TAA AAA GGC TCT CCA AAA TCT (exon 11 at the translation termination site) were used to amplify periphilin domains encoding aa 87–374, 197–374, and 197–349. The EcoRI and SalI sites were incorporated into primers and are underlined above. The PCR fragments were purified and subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). The EcoRI-SalI fragments from pBluescript were purified and cloned in-frame into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), pGB-MEL1 (13Aho S. Arffman A. Pummi T. Uitto J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and pGAD424 (Clontech) vectors. A BamHI fragment (periphilin aa 265–374) from the pGAD10 periphilin two-hybrid clone (aa 8–374) was separated and subcloned into the GAL4-AD vector and into the pGEX-5X-2 vector. C-terminally Myc-tagged periphilin expression construct was generated by PCR using an exon 1-specific primer, 5′-CTC CCG GAG GGC CAG AGT, and a reverse primer complementary to the end of the coding sequence in exon 11, 5′-AGT CGA CTA ATT CAA GTC CTC TTC AGA AAT GAG CTT TTG CTC AAA AGG CTC TCC AAA ATC TTG. The sequence encoding the Myc-tag is underlined. The PCR product was first ligated into EcoRV-cut and T-tailed pcDNA3 vector, and then the HindIII-NotI insert was isolated and ligated to the HindIII-NotI-digested pCEP4 (Invitrogen), which had been modified to drive the expression of the transgene from a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter under the control of seven repeats of the tet response element. The pCEP4 vector contains the EBNA-1 gene for autonomous replication in mammalian cells and a hygromycin gene for the selection of transfected cells. For N-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged periphilin constructs, a fragment of NheI-HindIII digest was separated from pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) and inserted between the NheI and HindIII sites in front of the periphilin cDNA in pCEP4-tet vector. Competent JM109 (Promega) or XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) Escherichia coli cells were used for transformations, and plasmids were purified using Wizard Miniprep Kit (Promega). Purified plasmids were sequenced to confirm the in-frame ligation of the inserts. Cell Cultures and Transfections—Human foreskin keratinocytes were isolated by the cell culture core unit in the Department of Dermatology at Thomas Jefferson University. Keratinocytes at passage 1 were used for the experiments described here. After separating from the epidermis with trypsin treatment, keratinocytes were plated on Matrigel-coated 8-well chamber slides and allowed to adhere and reach 50% confluency. The calcium-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) was supplemented with 60 μm, 150 μm, or 1 mm CaCl2 and applied on the keratinocytes for 2 days before preparing the slides for the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) or harvesting the cells for protein extractions. The Tet-Off cell lines were purchased from Clontech and grown according to the provider's instructions. For the transfections, cells were plated on the 60-mm plates, and FuGENE™ 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was used in the ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 3 μl of transfection reagent, following the manufacturer's instructions. Doxycycline was included in the transfection medium, and 24 h after transfection, selection was started with hygromycin. Cultures were trypsinized and replated before reaching confluency, usually every 3–4 days. After 3–5 passages, no adherent cells were left in the untransfected control culture. For the induction of the transgene expression, cells were trypsinized and plated without doxycycline, left to grow to 70% confluency, trypsinized again, and replated on 60-mm tissue culture plates before harvesting for the Western blotting and into the 4-well chamber slides for IIF. Primary and Secondary Antibodies Used for the Immunoassays—A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-periphilin (aa 265–374) fusion protein was expressed in XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) E. coli strain. The fusion protein was purified through binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences or Cytoskeleton) according to manufacturer's instructions. The protein was eluted with glutathione elution buffer (Sigma), and the protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Periphilin monoclonal antibody was obtained through immunizing mice with the GST-periphilin fusion protein (periphilin aa 265–374). The immunized mice were sacrificed for the hybridoma production (Hybridoma Core Facility, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). Four independent hybridomas were tested for their specificity; one hybridoma was cloned through the limited dilution, and a selected clone was grown in the large-scale culture. The culture supernatant was tested through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and used for Western blotting (1:10 dilution) and immunofluorescence assays (1:3 dilution). Polyclonal antiserum against periplakin head domain was obtained by immunizing a rabbit (#3196, Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), with the peptide GRSSHVSKRARLQSPATKVK (periplakin aa 817–836), conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer (1:100,000) against the peptide was assayed. The antiserum was affinity-purified through binding to a Protein G affinity column (MabTrap™ kit, Amersham Biosciences). The polyclonal mouse serum against the C-terminal domain of periplakin was obtained through immunizing mice with a GST-periplakin fusion protein (periplakin aa 1548–1756), and a hybridoma cell line producing monoclonal antibody recognizing periplakin aa 1548–1583 was selected. 2Aho, S. (2003) Cell Tissue Res., in press. For the Western blotting, GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech) was used in 1:5,000 dilution, mouse monoclonal GST (NeoMarkers) was used in 1:10,000 dilution, and 0.2 pg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody clone C4 (Roche Applied Science) was used. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used for the Western blotting in 1:25,000 dilution. Species-specific secondary antibodies, conjugated with Texas Red and fluorescein isothiocyanate and used for IIF in 1:500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (diamidinophenyl indole), which was included in the secondary antibody incubation. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For the IIF, a block of human foreskin was embedded in the OCT compound, frozen, and cut into 7-μm sections. Slides were either stored frozen at –20 °C, or used immediately. Tissue sections as well as the cultured cells on the chamber slides were fixed with methanol for 5–10 min and, after two washes with PBS, were further permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature (RT), followed by three washes with PBS. Blocking was done with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT, followed by the primary antibody incubation at 8 °C overnight. Slides were washed three times with PBS, each time for 5 min, followed by the secondary antibody incubation at RT for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, slides were mounted with Anti-Fade (Molecular Probes) and studied under a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss, Inc). The images were stored with ImagePro Plus 4.0 imaging software (Media Cybernetics) and processed with Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.) and Canvas 5 (Deneba Software). Solubilization of Periphilin and Western Blot Analysis—To perform a serial extraction of periphilin from keratinocyte cultures, cells on 100-mm culture dishes were first briefly washed on ice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were extracted with 600 μl of the high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 1.5 m KCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 1% Triton X-100; protease inhibitor Complete (Roche Applied Science) 1 tablet dissolved into 10 ml of buffer) by collecting the cell layer with the cell scraper and after transferring to microcentrifuge tubes, cells were mixed by vortexing, then sonicated and incubated on ice for 30 min. The pellet was separated through microcentrifugation in a cold cabinet for 30 min at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant was carefully collected. The pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of the urea buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 8 m urea; 1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 30 min before repeating the centrifugation step. The supernatant was carefully separated. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with β-ME. An aliquot of each supernatant was mixed with the sample buffer, and the samples were heated for 10 min at 96 °C before separation through the SDS-PAGE. For one-step extraction, cells were extracted with a radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA)-buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS). After extraction as described above, the soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation, and the pellet was further dissolved by resuspending into SDS-sample buffer and heated as described above. For Western blotting, 10-μl aliquots of cell lysates were separated on SDS-10% PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were blocked for 1 h at RT in PBS, 1% BSA, 5% nonfat dry milk powder. After the primary antibody incubation in PBS 1% BSA overnight at 8 °C, the membranes were washed four times, 10 min each wash, in Tris-buffered saline/0.5% Tween 20, incubated for 1 h at RT with the secondary antibody, then washed again, and the signal was developed using Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of Periphilin Transcripts—Human Multiple Tissue cDNA panels I and II were obtained from Clontech and used as templates for PCR analysis. A 10-fold serial dilution of a human keratinocyte cDNA library DNA was also used as a PCR template. Periphilin primers (p724) 5′-GGG ACG ATA TGA ATA TGA AAG and (p725) 5′-GAA ACT GCT GAA CCA CTT GA, specific for exons 3 and 8, respectively, and (p767) 5′-GAT AAA GAG AGG CCT GTC CAG and (p768) 5′-TAA AAA GGC TCT CCA AAA TCT, specific for exons 8 and 11, were used. PCR conditions were: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR was conducted using TaqDNA polymerase and the Q-solution provided with the kit (Qiagen). Ubinuclein-specific primers 5′-AGA AGC CAT GCA GTG ACA C and 5′-AGC TCT GGG TAG AAG AAC, producing a PCR fragment of 243 bp, were used as a control (14Aho S. Buisson M. Pajunen T. Ryoo Y.W. Giot J.-F. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. Uitto J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose-TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) gels. The Cross-linking Assay—To examine periphilin as transglutaminase (TGase) substrate, 200 ng of each GST fusion protein was incubated with 1.0 μg of TGase 2 (Sigma) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 20 mm CaCl2; and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with β-ME (Bio-Rad) and heating at 96 °C for 10 min. Human foreskin keratinocytes, cultured in KGM (Clonetics) supplemented with 150 μm Ca2+, were briefly washed and extracted for 20 min on ice with RIPA buffer without protease inhibitors, sonicated on ice, and the lysate was cleared with microcentrifugation in a cold cabinet for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. An aliquot of the lysate (10 μg of protein) was used in the transglutaminase assay as described above. In Vitro Cleavage of Periphilin by Recombinant Caspases—Recombinant human caspases 1–10 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). To examine periphilin as a substrate for caspases, 15 ng of GST-periphilin (aa 197–374) fusion protein was diluted into 20 μl of the caspase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 100 mm NaCl; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 1 mm EDTA; 0.1% CHAPS; 10% glycerol) containing 2 units/μl of the recombinant caspases 1–10. After incubation for 18 h at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by boiling in reducing Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were separated through 4–20% SDS-PAGE. Isolation of Periphilin cDNA—To further explore the functional role of periplakin in epidermal keratinocytes, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using a C-terminal region of periplakin as a bait. The periplakin extended linker domain, aa 1584–1756, identified keratin 8 and vimentin as interacting proteins (10Kazerounian S. Uitto J. Aho S. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 11: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel cDNA clone encoding a previously unidentified polypeptide was isolated. After further characterization, we proposed to name this novel protein “periphilin,” the name of which together with the symbol PPHLN1 for the human periphilin gene was approved October 25, 2002, by the international Nomenclature Committee of HUGO (the Human Genome Organization). Periphilin cDNA sequence and the deduced polypeptide were deposited into the GenBank™ data base (accession number AY157850). Periphilin gene, currently included in Homo sapiens genomic contig NT009781, was initially identified through a Blast search in two overlapping genomic clones of chromosome 12q12, locating close but not within the type II keratin gene cluster in 12q13 (Fig. 1). The full-length periphilin cDNA consists of 14 exons, spanning 120 kb of genomic sequences. Transcripts generated through the alternative splicing of 5′-exons 2, 4, and 7 and 3′-exons 11–14, give rise to multiple protein products. The periphilin cDNA clone isolated through the yeast two-hybrid screening was lacking exons 2, 4, and 12–14 (Figs. 1 and 2). Of sequences present in the human EST (expressed sequence tags) data base, exon 2 is in 23%, exon 4 is in 49%, and exon 7 is in 75% of cDNAs covering the corresponding region. The exclusion of exon 2 deletes the first in-frame translation initiation codon. The second in-frame ATG encodes Met-8. Both ATG codons are preceded by an in-frame translation stop codon TAA. Sequences surrounding the two ATG codons (Fig. 2) display homology to, but do not completely match with, the optimum Kozak consensus sequence GCC(A/G)CCATGG (15Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Periphilin cDNA and deduced amino acid structure. Translation can be initiated either from M1 or M8, depending on the presence or absence of exon 2. The alternatively spliced exons 2 and 4 are highlighted with strikethrough, and exon 7 is underlined. The positions of the introns are indicated by pointing arrowheads. The position of the cryptic splicing within exon 11 is shown by a horizontal arrowhead. The in-frame translation termination codons preceding the open reading frame and the poly-A addition signals are boxed. A putative nuclear localization signal (aa 110–116) and a potential nuclear export signal (aa 320–327) are highlighted in italics. Within the C-terminal half of periphilin four predicted helixes, composed of heptad repeats, are highlighted by bold and underlined. A tetrapeptide LFTD-273, a possible caspase recognition sequence, is highlighted with shading. Nucleotides are numbered at the beginning of each line. Numbering of the amino acid residues, beginning from the first in-frame ATG codon is shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Structural Features of Periphilin—Secondary structure prediction of periphilin polypeptide revealed a hydrophilic flexible N-terminal half, whereas the C-terminal half is composed of heptad repeats potentially forming four α-helixes (Fig. 2). On the nucleotide level, 80% identity along the 690-bp region of periphilin cDNA was detected with a cDNA encoding a protein similar to serine-threonine kinase 6/aurora-A/IPL1-related kinase (GenBank™ number XM222537). The homology domain in cDNA encodes periphilin aa 140–334, showing 64.6% homology and 57.4% identity along this 195-aa region. The C-terminal half of periphilin revealed structural homology to the homodimerization domain of vitellogenin proteins. Such conserved structural motifs are utilized by mammalian proteins, involved in the lipid transport and storage, to form dimerization interfaces (16Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köchl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Molecular Interactions of Periphilin—To map the domain of periphilin responsible for periplakin interaction, a series of periphilin deletion constructs was tested in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3). Because exon 4 was not present in the original two-hybrid clone, and the deletion construct starting from exon 5 did not show interaction, we conclude that N-terminal sequences from Met-8 to Ser-31 are indispensable for the interaction with the periplakin C-terminal domain. The C-terminal half of periphilin contains heptad repeats, which potentially form α-helical conformation (Fig. 2). Because this region showed a low degree of s"

We show that during post-translational targeting of PrP to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) the putative transmembrane domain induces misfolding of PrP in the cytosol and interferes with its import into the ER. Unglycosylated and misfolded PrP with an uncleaved N-terminal signal sequence associates with ER membranes, and, moreover, decreases cell viability. PrP expressed in the cytosol, lacking the N-terminal ER targeting sequence, also adopts a misfolded conformation; however, this has no adverse effect on cell growth. PrP processing, productive ER import, and cellular viability can be restored either by deleting the putative transmembrane domain or by using a N-terminal signal sequence specific for co-translational ER import. Our study reveals that the putative transmembrane domain features in the formation of misfolded PrP conformers and indicates that post-translational targeting of PrP to the ER can decrease cell viability.

Prion diseases in humans and animals are characterized by the accumulation of PrPSc, a partially protease-resistant isoform of the cellular prion protein PrPC. PrPSc is generated through a conformational transformation of PrPC and represents the major component of infectious prions (reviewed in Refs. 1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E.

Studies with recombinant PrP purified from bacteria revealed that the formation of the disulfide bond is essential for the native folding of PrP (9Maiti N.R. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2427-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The co- and post-translational modifications of PrPC are initiated with the cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide (aa 1–22) and the transfer of core glycans, whereas the nascent chain is still associated with the translocon. Shortly after the protein is fully translocated, the GPI anchor is attached to the acceptor amino acid close to the C terminus. The final maturation of PrPC includes the processing of the core glycans into complex-type glycans by a series of enzymatic reactions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartment. Post-translational modifications, like N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor attachment, are often used as diagnostic markers to monitor efficient import into the ER. In the case of PrP, however, we and others have shown that PrP devoid of a GPI anchor remains mainly unglycosylated but is imported efficiently into the ER and transported through the secretory pathway (10Winklhofer K.F.

It has been found that the only specific marker for ER import of PrP is a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence (10Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J.

Misfolding of PrPC in the cytosol or in the ER can induce neurodegeneration in the absence of PrPSc. Neurotoxic properties of cytosolic PrP aggregates were observed after proteasomal inhibition in cultured cells or after the forced expression of cytosolic PrP in transgenic mice (15Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Other studies revealed that a minor fraction of PrP can be synthesized as an integral membrane protein with two different topologies, termed either NtmPrP, with the N terminus facing the ER lumen, or CtmPrP, with the C terminus facing the ER lumen. Amino acids 112–135 of PrP were identified as a putative transmembrane domain (TM) (16Yost C.S. Lopez C.D. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and mutations in the TM domain were found to alter the relative amount of CtmPrP and NtmPrP (17Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A.

Remarkably, the increased synthesis of CtmPrP has been shown to coincide with progressive neurodegeneration both in Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome patients with an A117V mutation and in transgenic mice carrying a triple mutation within the putative TM domain (AV3) (17Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Other studies on the putative TM domain indicated that the hydrophobic stretch of amino acids 106 to 126 has the propensity to form fibrils (18Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In mammalian cells, secretory proteins are usually translocated into the ER via the co-translational pathway, which requires the binding of the signal recognition particle (SRP) to the nascent protein. The SRP directs the targeting of the whole nascent chain-ribosome complex to its receptor (SRPR) on the ER membrane, resulting in the transfer of the growing protein to the translocation pore and a direct release into the ER lumen as soon as the synthesis has finished. An alternative post-translational import pathway has been described in mammalian cells for proteins of less than 75 amino acids in length; in this case the completely synthesized protein is targeted to the ER independently of the SRP/SRPR system (23Müller G. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Schlenstedt G. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, however, a variety of secretory proteins can be imported post-translationally. Whether a co- or post-translational translocation pathway is used in yeast cells seems to be determined mainly by the N-terminal signal sequence. Signal sequences with a hydrophobicity index (Kyte-Doolittle) higher than 2 are strictly dependent on the SRP/SRPR pathway (25Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 26Fewell S.W. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Brodsky J.L. Annu. Rev.

In this study we analyzed the biogenesis of mouse PrP and showed that the putative transmembrane domain induces the misfolding of PrP during post-translational targeting to the ER. As a consequence, unprocessed and misfolded PrP associates with ER membranes and interferes with cell viability. Strains, Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Wild-type yeast (MATa, ura3, his4) was grown in rich medium containing 2% dextrose (YPD). Transformed cells were grown in synthetic complete medium (SCD, 2% dextrose, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base) supplemented with strain-specific nutrients at 30 °C. Solid media contained 2.3% agar (Difco). Mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (31Klebe R.J. Ruddle F.H. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 69aGoogle Scholar) were cultured as described previously (32Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). PrP was detected by the monoclonal anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (33Serban D. Taraboulos A. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Neurology. 1990; 40: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the polyclonal anti-PrP antiserum A7 (10Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The anti-Gas1p antibody was kindly provided by R. Barz, and the anti-Gim2p antibody was described earlier (34Geissler S. Siegers K. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Vacuolar ATPase was detected with the monoclonal anti-V-ATPase antibody 10D7-A7-B2 (Molecular Probes). Renografin 76 was prepared by adjusting TE, pH 7.6, to 66% meglumine diatrizoate and 10% sodium diatrizoate. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma and United States Biochemical. Enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and Promega. DNA Manipulations and Transformation—PrP constructs were cloned into pYES2 or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for expression in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively, using standard procedures. In yeast, expression was driven by the GAS1 promoter (bases -413 to -1). GAS1 sequences were amplified by PCR from pBQ1R14 (R. Barz). PrP sequences were amplified from pcDNA3.1–3F4 (35Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Groschup M.H. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schätzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which contains the mouse PRNP modified to express PrPL108M/V111M for immunostaining with the monoclonal antibody 3F4. The construct pPrPΔGPI contains aa 1–231. For targeting into the yeast ER, aa 1–27 of PrP containing the endogenous mouse signal were replaced by the ER signal sequences of Gas1p (gPrP constructs, aa 1–26) or Kre5p (kPrP constructs, aa 1–21). In gPrP and kPrP, aa 228–254 containing the mouse GPI signal sequence were replaced by the GAS1 GPI signal sequence (aa 526–559). In gPrPΔGPI and all other PrP constructs destined for expression in yeast, the GPI attachment signal was removed (aa 232–254). In gPrPΔ28–140 and gPrPΔ28–156 the respective PrP sequences were deleted. The deletion in gPrPΔTM spans aa 105–133. Cyto-PrP comprises aa 23–231. gPrP-AV3 was constructed by substituting GTC for GCA-(433–435) and GCT-(439–441) and GTT for GCT-(448–450) in the gPrPΔGPI construct in order to replace the alanines at positions 112, 114, and 117 by valines. In gPrP-G122P, the bases GGG-(463–465) were replaced by CCG to code for proline instead of glycine. Yeast cells were transformed using the LiCl method (36Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 37Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). N2a cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (38Winklhofer K.F. Reintjes A. Hoener M.C. Voellmy R. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45160-45167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation of Yeast Extracts and Endo H Treatment—Yeast cells were grown to midlog phase. 50 OD units were poisoned with 10 mm NaF, and proteins were prepared as described previously (39Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were washed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% yeast protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma), resuspended in lysis buffer, and broken using glass beads in the Mini-BeadBeater-8 (Biospec Products). A postnuclear supernatant (cell lysate) was prepared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. To assess the glycosylation status of proteins, the lysate was digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo H, NEB) following the manufacturer's instructions. Endo H Digestion and Secretion Analysis in N2a Cells—For Endo H digestion, cell lysates were prepared in 0.5% SDS, boiled for 10 min, and digested with Endo H (NEB) for 1 h at 37 °C (10Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, the lysates were examined by immunoblotting. To analyze the secretion of PrP, cells were cultivated in fresh medium for 3 h at 37 °C. PrP present in the supernatant cell culture medium was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed as described previously (32Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Colony Assay—Yeast cells were grown to stationary phase. A serial dilution was prepared (5-fold in sterile H2O) and spotted onto selective or rich media plates. Growth was monitored after 2 days of incubation at 30 °C. Membrane Fractionation—Localization of recombinant proteins was analyzed by Renografin density gradient centrifugation (39Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times in sorbitol buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris, 10 mm NaF, pH 7.6) and in TE (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). Lysates were prepared in TE as described above, and 0.5 ml were mixed with 0.5 ml of 76% Renografin, successively overlaid with 1 ml at 34, 30, 26, and 22% Renografin and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C. 14 fractions were removed from the top of the gradient. Membranes were diluted 10-fold with TE, pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C,and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Cell-free Translation and PK Protection Assay—For in vitro translation the TnT Quick transcription/translation kit (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 20 μl of TnT, 1 μg of plasmid-DNA, and 1 μl of [35S]methionine (15 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) were adjusted to 25 μl and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. For co-translational import 2 μl of canine microsomal membranes (Promega) were included in the reaction. All translation reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μm emetine (Sigma). For post-translational import the membranes were added after stopping the translation. All samples were incubated for a further 45 min at 30 °C and were then divided into two aliquots. For the PK protection assay, proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml, Roche Applied Science) was added to one aliquot and incubated for 1 h on ice. The protease was then inactivated by the addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) for 5 min on ice. Samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed for 30 min, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for another 30 min, and dried. Signals were visualized using a phosphorimaging device (FLA-2000, Fuji; AIDA 3.26 software, Raytest, Staubenhardt, Germany). PrP Targeted to the ER Is Unprocessed and Interferes with Yeast Growth—Our aim was to use the yeast model to specifically analyze the import of PrP into the ER. In yeast the hydrophobicity index of the N-terminal signal sequence determines whether a co- or post-translational translocation pathway is used (25Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expressed PrP with its own signal peptide (pPrP) and also with the ER-targeting peptide of the endogenous GPI-anchored protein Gas1p (gPrP) (41Nuoffer C. Jeno P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 42Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Desponds C. Bron C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2233-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both signal sequences have a hydrophobicity index (Kyte-Doolittle) lower than 2, which suggests a post-translational targeting of gPrP and pPrP to the ER (25Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). gPrP contains the C-terminal Gas1p GPI anchor signal sequence, and further PrP constructs were generated lacking either the GPI anchor attachment signal (gPrPΔGPI, pPrPΔGPI) or lacking both the ER targeting and the GPI anchor attachment signals (cyto-PrP) (Fig. 1A). It should be noted that PrPΔGPI expressed in mammalian cells is completely imported into the ER (10Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Walmsley A.R. Zeng F.N. Hooper N.M.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression of these PrP constructs was analyzed by Western blotting using the monoclonal anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (Fig. 1B). To monitor N-linked glycosylation of PrP, yeast extracts were treated with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, which removes all asparagine-linked sugar moieties from yeast proteins (43Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). It appeared that neither the Gas1p nor the PrP signal sequence was able to mediate the import of PrP into the yeast ER. All PrP constructs remained unglycosylated. Moreover, the majority of gPrP (∼95%), pPrPΔGPI (100%), and gPrPΔGPI (∼50%) contained uncleaved N-terminal signal sequences. In this context it is important to note that in mammalian cells PrPΔGPI is mainly unglycosylated, but in contrast to gPrPΔGPI and pPrPΔGPI expressed in yeast, it is N-terminally processed. In the same study we showed that PrP containing a nonfunctional C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence is both N-terminally processed and core-glycosylated (10Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further biochemical analysis revealed that gPrPΔGPI (Fig. 1D), gPrP, pPrPΔGPI, and cyto-PrP (data not shown) were highly insoluble in detergent buffer and partially resistant to proteolytic digestion, corroborating earlier findings (44Ma J.Y. Lindquist S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the course of these experiments we noticed a retarded growth of yeast cells expressing PrP with an uncleaved N-terminal signal sequence, be it gPrP, gPrPΔGPI, or pPrPΔGPI. To analyze the growth of PrP-expressing cells in more detail, yeast cultures were serially diluted and spotted onto selective agar plates (Fig. 1C, SCD-ura). Both gPrP and gPrPΔGPI showed a reduced growth compared with the vector control. Interestingly, decreased growth was specifically linked to the expression of PrP targeted to the ER and was also observed for pPrPΔGPI (data not shown). PrP expressed without a N-terminal signal peptide (cyto-PrP) had no adverse effects on cell growth. These experiments revealed that expression of mouse PrP with a signal peptide specific for post-translational targeting to the ER generates N-terminally unprocessed misfolded PrP and interferes with yeast growth. Cytosolically expressed PrP lacking the signal peptide is misfolded as well; however, this has no adverse effects on yeast growth. Deletion of the Putative Transmembrane Domain Restores Processing of PrP and Yeast Growth—Previous studies revealed that the ER import of PrP is modulated by an internal stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (aa112–135). Instead of being synthesized as a secreted protein, this domain can direct the formation of a transmembrane topology (45Lopez C.D. Yost C.S. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 248: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Different studies indicate that this stretch of hydrophobic amino acids may have additional properties; short peptides comprising residues 106–126 formed fibrils in vitro (18Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To address the role of the putative TM domain in PrP folding and ER import, several deletion mutants lacking the complete TM domain and also PrP-AV3 and PrP-G122P were included in our analysis. The triple A to V and the G to P substitutions are located within the putative transmembrane domain (Fig. 2A). Although the AV3 mutation enhances the formation of CtmPrP, the G122P mutation abolishes the formation of any transmembrane topology, be it CtmPrP or NtmPrP (17Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 46Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that all PrP mutants lacking the putative TM domain were glycosylated, indicated by an increased electrophoretic mobility after Endo H digestion (Fig. 2B, Endo H +). In addition, these glycosylated mutants were N-terminally processed. The mutants with amino acid substitutions in the putative TM domain, gPrP-G122P and gPrP-AV3, remained unprocessed and unglycosylated, similar to gPrP (data not shown), and interfered with yeast growth (Fig. 2C). However, cells expressing PrP mutants with a deleted putative TM domain grew at wild-type rates (Fig. 2C). Our experiments revealed that PrP mutants lacking the putative TM domain were N-terminally processed and glycosylated, although they were targeted to the ER via the Gas1p signal peptide. In addition, these mutants did not interfere with yeast growth. Unprocessed PrP Shows Prolonged Association with ER Membranes—PrP targeted to the ER via the PrP or Gas1p signal peptide (pPrP, gPrP) had biochemical properties similar to cyto-PrP and also seemed to remain in the cytosol. However, cyto-PrP did not interfere with yeast growth. To analyze the cellular localization of the different PrP mutants in more detail, we performed a Renografin density gradient centrifugation (39Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed a specific feature of PrP mutants that interfered with yeast growth. As expected, cytosolic PrP remained in the bottom fractions together with the subunit Gim2p (34Geissler S. Siegers K. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) of the cytosolic GimC complex (Fig. 3A). The glycosylated and N-terminally processed PrP mutant with a deleted TM domain (gPrPΔ28–156) was found in the same fractions as Vhp1p, the 100-kDa subunit of the vacuolar V-ATPase (47Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that the other N-terminally processed and glycosylated PrP mutants analyzed, gPrPΔTM and gPrPΔ28–140, were also exported from the ER and transported to the vacuole (data not shown). In contrast, the N-terminally unprocessed PrP mutant gPrPΔGPI, as well as gPrP, gPrP-AV3, and gPrP-G122P (data not shown), was membrane-associated and co-localized with the ER and plasma membrane fraction. Because gPrPΔGPI has no GPI anchor and was not secreted into the culture medium (data not shown), we assumed that it was associated with ER vesicles. In summary, these data indicate that the PrP mutants characterized by an uncleaved N-terminal signal peptide have a unique feature; they show prolonged association with ER membranes. In Mammalian Cells PrPΔGPI Is N-terminally Processed and Transported through the Secretory Pathway—Our analysis in yeast revealed that PrPΔGPI expression significantly interfered with cell growth. The question arose whether a similar phenotype could be observed in mammalian cells. PrPΔGPI was previously characterized by us and other groups, and adverse effects on the growth of mammalian cells have not been described (10Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W.

https://openalex.org/W2147325375,"The alternative sigma factor σS, mainly active in stationary phase of growth, recognizes in vitro a –10 promoter sequence almost identical to the one for the main sigma factor, σ70, thus raising the problem of how specific promoter recognition by σS-RNA polymerase (EσS) is achieved in vivo. We investigated the promoter features involved in selective recognition by EσS at the strictly σS-dependent aidB promoter. We show that the presence of a C nucleotide as first residue of the aidB –10 sequence (–12C), instead of the T nucleotide canonical for σ70-dependent promoters, is the major determinant for selective recognition by EσS. The presence of the –12C does not allow formation of an open complex fully proficient in transcription initiation by Eσ70. The role of –12C as specific determinant for promoter recognition by EσS was confirmed by sequence analysis of known EσS-dependent promoters as well as site-directed mutagenesis at the promoters of the csgB and sprE genes. We propose that EσS, unlike Eσ70, can recognize both C and T as the first nucleotide in the –10 sequence. Additional promoter features such as the presence of a C nucleotide at position –13, contributing to open complex formation by EσS, and a TG motif found at the unusual –16/–15 location, possibly contributing to initial binding to the promoter, also represent important factors for σS-dependent transcription. We propose a new sequence, TG(N)0–2CCATA(c/a)T, as consensus –10 sequence for promoters exclusively recognized by EσS. The alternative sigma factor σS, mainly active in stationary phase of growth, recognizes in vitro a –10 promoter sequence almost identical to the one for the main sigma factor, σ70, thus raising the problem of how specific promoter recognition by σS-RNA polymerase (EσS) is achieved in vivo. We investigated the promoter features involved in selective recognition by EσS at the strictly σS-dependent aidB promoter. We show that the presence of a C nucleotide as first residue of the aidB –10 sequence (–12C), instead of the T nucleotide canonical for σ70-dependent promoters, is the major determinant for selective recognition by EσS. The presence of the –12C does not allow formation of an open complex fully proficient in transcription initiation by Eσ70. The role of –12C as specific determinant for promoter recognition by EσS was confirmed by sequence analysis of known EσS-dependent promoters as well as site-directed mutagenesis at the promoters of the csgB and sprE genes.

Additional promoter features such as the presence of a C nucleotide at position –13, contributing to open complex formation by EσS, and a TG motif found at the unusual –16/–15 location, possibly contributing to initial binding to the promoter, also represent important factors for σS-dependent transcription. We propose a new sequence, TG(N)0–2CCATA(c/a)T, as consensus –10 sequence for promoters exclusively recognized by EσS. Bacterial cells adapt to changing environmental and physiological conditions by modulating gene expression. Sigma (σ) factors of RNA polymerase, as the subunits responsible for promoter recognition, play a major role in programming gene expression. At least seven different σ subunits have been identified in Escherichia coli; σ70 is the main σ subunit and can carry out transcription from the majority of E. coli promoters. The alternative σ subunits can direct transcription toward specific sets of genes (i.e. heat-shock, extracellular proteins, etc.) whose transcription is directed by σ-specific promoter sequences. A partial exception to the typical role for alternative σ subunits is represented by σS, the product of the rpoS gene, mainly expressed in the stationary phase of growth (1Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 2Jishage M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6832-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 3Jishage M. Iwata A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the other σ subunits, σS-RNA polymerase (EσS) 1The abbreviations used are: EσS, σS-RNA polymerase; Eσ70, σ70-RNA polymerase; PaidB, aidB promoter. can initiate transcription from several promoters also recognized by Eσ70, suggesting that they recognize similar promoter sequences (4Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The recognition of similar promoter sequences by σS and σ70 is reflected by their strong similarity in the DNA binding domains (5Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The alignment of EσS-dependent promoters and the search for an optimal promoter for EσS in vitro using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure have pointed to a –10 consensus sequence for EσS, CTATA(c/a)T that is very similar to the canonical TATAAT sequence for σ70 (6Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2237-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 7Espinosa-Urgel M. Chamizo C. Tormo A. Mol.

These results suggest that promoter selectivity between σ70 and σS might be determined by factors other than promoter DNA sequence. Indeed, studies of different σS-dependent promoters suggest that other parameters such as increased intracellular salt concentration, degree of DNA supercoiling, the ppGpp alarmone, and modulation by trans-acting regulators all contribute to σS selectivity (reviewed in Refs. 11Hengge-Aronis R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Hengge-Aronis R. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 341-346PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hengge-Aronis R. Curr.

The main sequence feature specific for σS-dependent promoters would be a C nucleotide immediately upstream of the –10 promoter element (CTATA(c/a)T at the –13 position relative to the transcription start (–13C)); the –35 element does not appear to be important for promoter recognition by σS, although conflicting data on its role have been reported (10Gaal T.

Mutagenesis studies on σS-dependent promoters have shown that deviations from the consensus CTATACT affect promoter recognition by σS in vivo and have substantiated the importance of the –13C element (8Becker G. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bordes P. Repoila F. Kolb A. Gutierrez C. Mol.

Commun. 2002; 292: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Suppression genetics data suggest that the –13C is directly contacted by the residue Lys-173 of region 2.5 of σS (8Becker G. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the amino acid located at the equivalent position in region 2.5 of σ70 is a glutamate residue (Glu-458) that has been proposed to interact with another promoter element located upstream of the –10, the TG motif (22Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). At the so-called “extended –10” promoters, this TG dinucleotide can be found two nucleotides upstream from the –10 sequence, where it allows transcription even in the absence of a conserved –35 sequence (23Ponnambalam S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1864-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, in vitro selection experiments (10Gaal T. Ross W. Estrem S.T. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R. Gourse R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 939-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) suggest that a TG motif might also be recognized by σS and have proposed TGTGCTATA(c/a)T as the optimal extended –10 sequence for σS binding. The aidB gene belongs to the adaptive response to DNA alkylating agents and is activated by the Ada regulatory protein (29Volkert M.R. Nguyen D.C. Beard K.C. Genetics. 1986; 112: 11-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (for reviews, see Refs. 30Landini P. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6543-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 31Volkert M.R. Landini P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Ada protein, in its methylated form (meAda), can activate transcription at the aidB promoter (PaidB) by both the Eσ70 and EσS forms of RNA polymerase (32Landini P. Volkert M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8285-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Landini P. Bown J.A. Volkert M.R. Busby S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13307-13312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of activation by Ada, aidB expression is strictly σS-dependent in vivo, and only the EσS form of RNA polymerase can efficiently carry out transcription from PaidB in vitro (34Volkert M.R. Hajec L.I. Matijasevic Z. Fang F.C. Prince R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7638-7645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Landini P. Hajec L.I. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R. Volkert M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although Eσ70 can bind PaidB in vitro in the absence of any activator, binding by Eσ70 results in an unusual complex that is partially resistant to heparin challenge but unable to carry out full promoter opening and transcription initiation (21Lacour S. Kolb A. Zehnder A.J.B. Landini P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigate the importance of nucleotides around the –10 region of the aidB promoter for σS selectivity. We confirm the role of –13C for σS activity and show that a TG motif at the unusual –15/–16 position plays a specific role in σS-dependent transcription. We show that, unlike σ70, σS can recognize a C residue instead of the canonical T as first nucleotide of the –10 box (–12C). These features are not unique to the aidB promoter, but they are conserved in a subset of σS-dependent promoters. Thus, based on the presence of either a C oraTasthe first nucleotide in the –10 box, we can distinguish between specific EσS-dependent promoters and promoters that can be recognized by both EσS and Eσ70, at which additional regulatory factors are likely to play a role in selective promoter recognition by EσS. We propose TG(N)CCATA(c/a)T as the new consensus sequence for the factor-independent class of σS-dependent promoters. Strains and Plasmids—The strains used in this study are the E. coli K12 strains MV1161 and its rpoS derivative MV2792 (34Volkert M.R. Hajec L.I. Matijasevic Z. Fang F.C. Prince R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7638-7645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These strains were transformed with derivatives of the reporter plasmid pRS1274 (36Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying lacZ fusions under the control of either the wild type aidB promoter or its mutant derivatives. To produce the reporter plasmids, we cloned the aidB promoter region into the multiple cloning site of the pRS1274 vector as 238-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragments. The PaidB wild type fragment was generated by PCR using the aidBbam primer (5′-TATAGCAAGCTTCGTGCGGAATGGGGATCC-3′), annealing at –140 to –123 of PaidB, and aidBeco (introducing an EcoRI site, 5′-CGGAAAGAATTCGCAGAGCGCGCCATCAGA-3′), annealing at positions 93–116. The aidB mutant promoters shown in Fig. 1 were generated by PCR using the primers aidBeco together with the appropriated mutagenic primer MaidBnco (5′-AATCCATGGCAGTgaccATACTaATGG-3′; the small italic letters indicate the position of the various substitutions), annealing at –29 to –2 and encompassing the NcoI restriction site of PaidB. The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid pMV120 (pUC18, carrying the aidB promoter region; Ref. 36Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites, and introduction of the desired mutations was checked by sequencing. Finally, the 238-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragments encompassing either the wild type or the mutant aidB promoters were subcloned into either the pRS1274 plasmid (for in vivo transcription assays) or the pJCD01 plasmid (37Marschall C. Labrousse V. Kreimer M. Weichart D. Kolb A. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) for in vitro transcription experiments (see below). In Vivo Transcription Assays—Bacterial cultures grown overnight in Luria broth (LB) medium at 37 °C were diluted 1:100 in LB, grown to an OD600 nm = 0.2, then re-diluted 1:100 in pre-warmed LB. The second dilution was performed to reduce the β-galactosidase activity carried over from the overnight cultures. Samples were collected when the re-diluted cultures reached OD600 nm = 0.1 and then after4hof growth; at this time, OD600 nm was ∼2.5 for both MV1161 and MV2792 strains. β-galactosidase activity from the aidB::lacZ fusions was determined as described previously (38Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and was comparable with the activity obtained by a promoterless lacZ gene in samples taken at OD600 nm = 0.1 (data not shown). Protein Purification and Holoenzyme Reconstitution—Core enzyme and σ factors were purified as described previously (Refs. 39Gribskov M. Burgess R.R. Gene. 1983; 26: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 16Tanaka K. Kusano S. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, respectively); proteins appeared to be pure from contaminants as determined from denaturing protein gel electrophoresis. Reconstitution of active holoenzymes for the different experiments was achieved by incubating the core enzyme and either σS or σ70 at a 1:4 ratio (to ensure saturation of the core enzyme by σ factors) for 30 min at 37 °C. For the competition experiment in a bandshift assay, the ratio σ S:σ70:core was reduced to 1, and reconstitution time was reduced to 10 min. The reconstituted holoenzymes were diluted at room temperature in K-glu200 buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) prior to their use for in vitro experiments. Dithiothreitol was omitted from the buffer for permanganate (KMnO4) reactivity experiments. In Vitro Transcription Assays—Single-round transcription assays were performed in K-glu200 buffer on derivatives of the supercoiled plasmid pJCDO1 (37Marschall C. Labrousse V. Kreimer M. Weichart D. Kolb A. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) carrying either wild type or mutant PaidB. Plasmids (3 nm) and reconstituted RNA polymerase holoenzymes (50 nm for EσS or 100 nm for Eσ70) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to allow complex formation. Elongation was started by the addition of a prewarmed mixture containing nucleotides and heparin (final concentrations were 500 μm ATP, GTP, and CTP; 30 μm UTP; 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP; and 500 μg/ml heparin) to the template-polymerase mix and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer (formamide containing 20 mm EDTA, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue). After heating to 65 °C, samples were loaded on 7% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Reaction products from PaidB were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized to the standard RNAI product after background subtraction. Other in Vitro Experiments—Linear DNA fragments (–128 to +52 of either wild type or mutant PaidB) generated by PCR using the primers 5′-aidBbam (5′-GGATCCGTGAAGATAACAC-3′) and 3′-aidB+52 (5′-AAAACGGTGTGAGTTTGCCAG-3′) were used for gel mobility shift assays, DNase I protection experiments, and KMnO4 reactivity assays. The template strand was labeled by 5′-phosphorylation of the 3′-aidB primer using phage T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Linear fragments of the csgB (238 bp) and sprE(P2) (248 bp) promoters were obtained by PCR using the primers B-H-csgB (5′-GGATCCAAGCTTGTCTGGTGCTTTTTGATAGCGG-3′), E-3b-csgB (5′-GAATTCATTT CAACTTGGTTGTTAACG-3′), E-sprE (5′-GAATTCGCTCCCAATGAGGAAAACC-3′), and B-sprE (5′-GGATCCTGGAAAGGAAAATGGACGAAC-3′). The mutant promoters harboring the C to T substitution at position –12 were generated using the double PCR method as described (40Yang C.H. Gavilanes-Ruiz M. Okinaka Y. Vedel R. Berthuy I. Boccara M. Chen J.W. Perna N.T. Keen N.T. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the above listed primers coupled either with 12AcsgB (5′-GGAAAGTAT a TCTGCGGAAAT-3′) and 12TcsgB (5′-ATTTCCGCAGA t ATACTTTCC-3′) (for csgB mutagenesis) or the primers 12TSprE (5′-ATAGCATGC t ACTATTGAGTA-3′) and 12ASprE (5′-TACTCAATAGT a GCATGCTAT-3′) (for sprE(P2) mutagenesis). Constructs were checked by sequencing. For gel mobility shift assays, the reconstituted holoenzyme (5–50 or 6–60 nm for the competition experiment) and the 180-bp promoter DNA fragments (1 nm) were incubated for 16 min at 37 °C in K-glu200 buffer in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a native 5% polyacrylamide gel after the addition of 2.5 μl of loading buffer (50% sucrose, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 150 μg/ml heparin). For DNase I footprinting, reconstituted RNA polymerase (100 nm either EσS or Eσ70) was incubated with either PaidB(WT) or PaidB(12C→T) (4 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C in K-glu200 buffer. Protein-free DNA samples were treated with 1 μg/ml DNase I for 20 s, whereas the incubation was prolonged to 30 s in the presence of RNA polymerase. After the addition of loading buffer containing 150 μg/ml heparin, the samples were separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and the bands corresponding to the RNA polymerase-promoter complexes were eluted from the gel, precipitated, and re-suspended in EDTA (20 mm)-formamide buffer before being loaded on a 7% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. KMnO4 reactivity experiments were performed as described (41Colland F. Barth M. Hengge-Aronis R. Kolb A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3028-3037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 nm RNA polymerase and promoters were incubated in K-glu200 (without dithiothreitol) for 15 min at 37 °C; KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the reaction was stopped after 30 s by adding 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 330 mm. For the kinetic reactivity experiment, samples were taken after 1.2, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 19 min of incubation. The KMnO4-reactive bands were expressed as a percentage of the total labeled DNA loaded onto the gel. Promoter Elements Determinant for Selective Recognition of the aidB Promoter by Eσ S—The aidB promoter (PaidB) is strongly σS-dependent in the absence of Ada activation, i.e. in physiological growth conditions (36Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify which features determine specific recognition of PaidB by EσS, we performed site-directed mutagenesis in and around the –10 sequence. We chose to target four putative promoter elements; as shown in Fig. 1A, a TG dinucleotide, typically a feature of σ70-dependent extended –10 promoters, is placed at an unusual location in PaidB (three and four nucleotides upstream of the –10 box instead of two and three). At this location, a TG motif cannot stimulate σ70-dependent transcription (28Burr T. Mitchell J. Kolb A. Minchin S. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1864-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We also targeted for mutagenesis the –13C residue, proposed to be the main feature for σS-specificity (7Espinosa-Urgel M. Chamizo C. Tormo A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Becker G. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30064-30071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the –12C, i.e. the first nucleotide in the –10 hexamer. Finally, we changed to T the A nucleotide at position –6 immediately downstream of the –10 sequence, because T appears to be conserved at this position in σS-dependent promoters (8Becker G. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30064-30071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of the mutations on promoter activity in vivo using a low copy plasmid carrying the PaidB::lacZ transcriptional fusion (Fig. 1B). We compared promoter activity in the MV1161 strain (wild type relative to rpoS) and its rpoS derivative, MV2792, upon entry into stationary phase (OD600 nm ∼ 2.5). Substitutions that either disrupt the TG motif (15G→ C; designated G15C in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) or eliminate the –13C (13C→ G; designated C13G in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) show a rather small (1.5- to 2-fold) albeit significant and reproducible reduction in promoter activity, suggesting a possible role for these two promoter elements in modulation of affinity by EσS for PaidB. These effects are confirmed in a 15G→ C/13C→ G double mutant (Fig. 1B; this mutant is designated G15C/C13G in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Substitution of the –6A nucleotide had no effect on transcription from PaidB. Displacement of the TG motif (15G→ T/14A→ G double mutant) to the optimal location for σ70 (–15/–14) slightly improves transcription by both EσS and Eσ70. Substitution of the –12C nucleotide to a T (12C→ T; designated C12T in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) results in an almost perfect –10 sequence for σ70 (TATACT); the 12C→ T mutation strongly increases aidB transcription both in the wild type strain (roughly 4-fold) and the rpoS strain (20-fold). Although an increase of σ70-dependent transcription was expected for this promoter mutation, its extent is surprising; transcription from PaidBC12T reaches levels similar to the wild type aidB promoter in the wild type MV1161 strain. This observation suggests that the –12C plays a major role in selective recognition of the aidB promoter by EσS in vivo.Fig. 3Gel retardation assays in the presence of heparin. The formation of heparin-resistant complexes by EσS (A and C) and Eσ70 (B and D) is depicted. RNA polymerase concentrations used in the assay were 7.5, 15, and 50 nm. The σ/core RNA polymerase ratio was 2:1. PaidB-RNA polymerase complexes were separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gel and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. A typical experiment is shown in panels A (EσS)andB(Eσ70); the results in panels C and D are the average of three independent assays.

PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions play a central role in organizing signaling complexes around synaptic receptors for efficient signal transduction. We report here that clinically relevant concentrations of inhalational anesthetics dose-dependently and specifically inhibit the PDZ domain-mediated protein interaction between PSD-95 or PSD-93 and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor or neuronal nitric-oxide synthase. These inhibitory effects are immediate, potent, and reversible and occur at a hydrophobic peptide-binding groove on the surface of the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 in a manner relevant to anesthetic action. These findings reveal the PDZ domain as a new molecular target for inhalational anesthetics.

These findings reveal the PDZ domain as a new molecular target for inhalational anesthetics. Inhalational anesthetics have been in widespread use for more than 150 years and have been essential in the development of modern surgical procedures, but their molecular mechanisms have remained poorly understood. Early hypotheses based on nonspecific interactions of lipid-soluble anesthetics with the lipid bilayer of neuronal membranes have largely given way to the recent suggestion that anesthetics interact with multiple membrane-associated proteins involved in synaptic transmission (1Franks N.P.

Br. J. Anaesth. 2002; 89: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Inhalational anesthetics have been shown to both enhance inhibitory receptor-mediated synaptic neurotransmission and depress excitatory receptor-mediated synaptic neurotransmission. Recent studies have revealed a much more complicated picture of excitatory receptor-mediated synaptic transmission than previously anticipated. For efficient synaptic transmission, the downstream effectors are targeted to the receptors by scaffolding proteins via a complex network of protein-protein interactions (7Pawson T. Scott J D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain is one of the most common protein-protein recognition modules that have been found in diverse scaffolding and signaling proteins (8Hata Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The name PDZ derives from the first three proteins (PSD-95/SAP90, Dlg, and ZO-1 (10Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar)) in which these domains were identified. The PDZ domain recognizes specific C-terminal motifs found in target proteins, most often in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane receptors and channels (10Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 11Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PDZ domain can also recognize structure-related internal motifs to form homo- and heteromeric PDZ-PDZ interactions (12Xu X.Z. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Christopherson K.S. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol.

Therefore, PDZ domain-mediated protein-protein interactions provide a framework for the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes at synapses and neuromuscular junctions. These interactions coordinate and guide the flow of regulatory information and regulate receptor and ion channel activities (16Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 17Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S.

A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). One of the best understood PDZ domain proteins at synapses is PSD-95, a modular protein highly enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD). PSD-95 is one member of a family of related proteins that also includes PSD-93, SAP97, and SAP102. The family members all possess three PDZ domains. The first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 interact with the (S/T)XV-COOH motif of the C termini of NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors (10Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). The second PDZ domain of PSD-95 (PSD-95 PDZ2) also forms a heterodimeric PDZ-PDZ interaction with the PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) (20Brenman J.E Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W.

The coupling of nNOS to the NMDA receptor by the PDZ domain of PSD-95 facilitates NMDA activation of nNOS (13Christopherson K.S. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol.

The knockdown of PSD-95 blocks NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity via nitric oxide production (25Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M.

We reported previously that suppression of spinal cord PSD-95 expression decreases NMDA-receptor-mediated thermal hyperalgesia (28Tao Y.-X. Huang Y.Z. Mei L. Johns R.A. Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain (29Tao F. Tao Y.-X. Gonzalez J.A. Fang M. Mao P. Johns R.A.

Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the amount of anesthetic required to induce anesthesia (31Tao Y.-X. Johns R.A. Anesthesiology. 2001; 94: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We reasoned that disruption of PSD-95 PDZ domain-mediated synaptic protein-protein interactions might be the mechanism by which inhaled anesthetics disrupt synaptic signal transmission and contribute to the anesthetic state. Here we report that inhalational anesthetics at clinically relevant concentrations can dose-dependently disrupt PDZ domain-mediated protein-protein interactions between PSD-95 and the NMDA receptor or nNOS. We have further found that halothane causes this inhibition by selectively binding to a target-binding pocket formed by the αB helix and βB strand of the PSD-95 PDZ2 domain, which is normally occupied by both the C-terminal peptide of the NMDA receptor NR2 subunit and the β-finger structure from the nNOS PDZ domain (10Kornau H.C.

Biol. 2000; 303: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 protein might be a potential molecular target for inhalational anesthetics. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The second PDZ domain of rat PSD-95 (amino acid residues 138–294) or PSD-93 (amino acids 184–327) was subcloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of the yeast vector, pGAD424 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The C terminus of the NMDA receptor subunit 2A (amino acids 1265–1464) or 2B (amino acids 1285–1482) was subcloned individually into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pGBT9 yeast vector (Clontech). Plasmids of pGAD424-PSD-95 PDZ1–3 (amino acids 62–393) and pGBT9-nNOS PDZ (amino acids 1–139) were kindly provided by Dr. Lin Mei. The yeast reporter strain, Y190 (Clontech), was transformed with the pGBT9 and pGAD424 fusion protein plasmids, and protein-protein interactions were evaluated by growth of yeast on selective agar plates sealed in incubator chambers containing different concentrations of anesthetics. Each anesthetic was introduced into the chambers by its conventional calibrated clinical general anesthesia vaporizer (OHIO Medical Products, Madison WI) for 30 min of equilibrium with air at 3 liters/min. Anesthetic concentration within the chamber was determined using a Capnomac Ultima analyzer (Datex Engostrom). Yeast medium/gas partition coefficients for halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane at 30 °C were determined by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5890 series II plus) using the method previously described (35Allott P.R. Steward A. Mapleson W.W. Br. J. Anaesth. 1971; 43: 913-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Concentration of each anesthetic in the medium was thus calculated in millimolar units. The amount of yeast growth was quantified by measuring the average intensity of an image of the yeast using Image-Pro Plus 3.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Anesthetic concentration was converted to minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) according to published values. One MAC equals 0.75% halothane, 1.2% isoflurane, or 2% sevoflurane. In Vitro and in Vivo Binding Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST fusion proteins PSD-95 PDZ2 and GST-PSD-93 PDZ2 were prepared in BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) with glutathione-agarose as an affinity resin for purification. Brain membrane from rat hippocampus and cerebellum was prepared and solubilized as described by Luo et al. (36Luo J. Wang Y. Yasuda R.P. Dunah A.W. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, the solubilized membrane fraction and GST fusion proteins were first preincubated with different concentrations of halothane delivered in an incubation chamber (described under “Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis”) at room temperature for 30 min. Then the membrane fraction was mixed with the GST fusion protein at room temperature for 1 h. After the resin was washed five times with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100), the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis, and detected by immunoblotting. The immunoprecipitation was performed by preparing solubilized PSD fraction of rat cortex as described by Luo et al. (36Luo J. Wang Y. Yasuda R.P. Dunah A.W. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The solubilized PSD fraction (400 μg) was mixed with 4 μg of rabbit anti-NMDA receptor 2A/2B antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) prebound to protein A-Sepharose and then incubated with different concentrations of halothane for 2 h at room temperature. The resin was washed four times in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.57 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). The bound proteins were eluted in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immobilization of Peptide and Protein on the Sensor Surface—The synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal tail of NR2A (EKLSSIESDV) was synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). An additional cysteine residue was added for thiol coupling to the biosensor CM5 chip, as described previously (37Chou C-L. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Full-length nNOS was extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline before being immobilized to a biosensor CM5 chip surface using the standard amine chemistry. Briefly, the matrix surface was activated by injecting a mixture of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 m EDC (1:1) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C for 7 min, and nNOS (100 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2) was immobilized onto the matrix. The remaining active sites of the matrix were blocked with 10 mm glycine. Similarly, the control protein, PSD-95 antibody, was immobilized onto the surface. Binding of the PSD-95 PDZ2 to the Immobilized Peptide and Protein—The IMPACT (intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag) system was used to prepare pure PSD-95 PDZ2 (amino acids 138–294) based on the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The interactions between PSD-95 PDZ2 and NR2A peptide or nNOS protein were analyzed by a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). All binding experiments were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. PSD-95 PDZ2 (20 μm) with various concentrations of halothane was injected over the NR2A peptide- or nNOS-coupled surfaces at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Anesthetic concentrations were determined by head-space sampling with a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II plus) from an aliquot of the anesthetic-containing solution. Sensorgrams were recorded and normalized by subtracting base-line resonance units. The background sensorgrams were obtained by injecting PSD-95 PDZ2 over a nonprotein, blocked surface and by injecting halothane alone over the peptide- or protein-immobilized surface. Between successive measurements, the surfaces were regenerated with 50 mm phosphoric acid (3-min contact time). The analysis of kinetic parameters was performed by using BIAevaluation version 3.0 software according to the manufacturer's instructions. Interaction of Halothane with PSD-95 PDZ2 by NMR—Preparation of 15N-labeled PSD-95 PDZ2 has been described earlier (38Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6474) Google Scholar). Interaction between halothane and PSD-95 PDZ2 was studied by titrating the protein (∼0.2 mm dissolved in a 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) with incremental amounts of a halothane stock solution dissolved in the same phosphate buffer. A 1H-15N HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) spectrum of the protein was recorded at each titration point. The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift changes are defined as follows. Δppm=(ΔδHN)2+(ΔδN)(Eq. 1) The scaling factor (αN) used to normalize the 1H and 15N chemical shifts is 0.17. The complete chemical shift assignment of free PSD-95 was obtained from our earlier work (38Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6474) Google Scholar). The assignment of the halothane-bound form of PSD-95 PDZ2 was obtained by stepwise titration of the 15N-labeled protein halothane. Inhalational Anesthetics Dose-dependently and Reversibly Inhibit PSD-95 PDZ Domain-mediated Protein Interactions— Using a yeast two-hybrid system approach, we first tested whether inhalational anesthetics affect PSD-95 PDZ domain-mediated protein interaction. Under normal conditions, the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 interacts with the PDZ domain of nNOS or the C-terminal tails of the NR2A and NR2B subunits, resulting in the growth of yeast cells harboring both pGAD424-PSD-95 PDZ2 and pGBT9-nNOS or NR2A or NR2B fusion protein plasmids in synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (–LTH) (Fig. 1A). However, treatment with low concentrations of halothane (0.12 and 0.24 mm) slowed the growth of yeast cells, and at higher but still clinically relevant concentrations (0.36 and 0.48 mm), halothane completely inhibited yeast growth (Fig. 1A), indicating that halothane dose-dependently inhibits interactions between PSD-95 PDZ2 and nNOS and between PSD-95 PDZ2 and NR2A or NR2B of the NMDA receptor. Nearly identical results were observed in each pair of protein-protein interactions when PSD-95 PDZ2 was replaced with PSD-93 PDZ2 (Fig. 1A). Interaction between PSD-95 PDZ2 and nNOS PDZ was weaker than that between the three PDZ domains of PSD-95 (PSD-95 PDZ1 to 3) and nNOS (Fig. 1A). Like halothane, both isoflurane and sevoflurane also inhibited the growth of yeast harboring pGAD424-PSD-95 PDZ1–3 and pGBT9-nNOS (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, yeast transformed with pGAD424-PSD-95 PDZ2 and pGBT9-NR2A exhibited diminished growth in the presence of isoflurane and sevoflurane (data not shown). The IC50 values of halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane for disrupting the interaction between PSD-95 PDZ1–3 and nNOS PDZ were 0.18, 0.27, and 0.59 mm, respectively. Relative potencies in disrupting protein interactions were halothane > isoflurane > sevoflurane (Fig. 1D), which are identical to their relative potencies as anesthetics. To further show the relevance of our results to the clinical action of anesthetics, we converted anesthetic concentrations to MAC. One MAC is defined as the concentration of an anesthetic at which 50% of subjects lose responsiveness to painful stimulus. As shown in Fig. 1E, anesthetic inhibition of PSD-95 protein interactions occurred at concentrations comparable with their clinical MAC for anesthesia, and a similar degree of inhibition occurred at equal MAC concentrations rather than equal molar concentrations. Since the effect of anesthetics is reversible in clinical use, we further tested whether the inhibition of the yeast growth can be reversed when the anesthetic is removed. As shown in Fig. 1A, the growth of yeast carrying pGAD424-PSD-95 PDZ1–3 and pGBT9-nNOS was inhibited under 0.48 mm halothane. However, after recovery in normal growth conditions, the yeast grew as well as control yeast that had never been exposed to halothane (Fig. 1F). To test whether halothane affects a non-PDZ domain-mediated protein-protein interaction, we cloned the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95 and Src homology 3 domain of SAP102 into the yeast two-hybrid system, since there is also a protein-protein interaction between the Src homology 3 domain and the guanylate kinase region in the PSD-95 family of proteins (39Shin H. Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that halothane at high concentrations did not affect their interaction (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that inhalational anesthetics have inhibitory effects on the growth of yeast, we grew normal, untransformed Y190 yeast cells in rich medium (Fig. 1G) and grew transformed yeast in synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (–LT) instead of in –LTH medium (Fig. 1H). We found that in both cases, yeast growth was unaffected by high concentrations of halothane. These findings demonstrate that inhalational anesthetics at the concentrations used in the present study are not cytotoxic to the yeast strain. Thus, the failure of the transformed yeast to grow in –LTH medium is due to the disruption of protein-protein interactions by these inhalational anesthetics. Halothane Disrupts PSD-95 PDZ-mediated Protein Interactions in Vitro and in Vivo—We further confirmed the above yeast two-hybrid results in binding studies utilizing immobilized GST-PSD-95 PDZ2 incubated with solubilized rat brain membrane extracts in the presence of various concentrations of halothane. GST-PSD-95 PDZ2, but not GST alone, bound to both NMDA receptor 2A/2B subunits (Fig. 2A) and to neuronal NOS (Fig. 2B) in the absence of halothane. However, halothane inhibited the binding of NR2A/2B or nNOS to GST-PSD-95 PDZ2. The extent of inhibition was proportional to the concentration of halothane. With ∼0.3 μm GST-PSD-95 PDZ2 in the assay, halothane concentrations of 0.36 mm or greater completely prevented binding, and 0.24 mm halothane inhibited more than 50% of binding of NR2A/2B or nNOS to the GST-PSD-95 PDZ2 domain (Fig. 2, A and B). Halothane also inhibited the association of NR2A/2B or nNOS to GST-PSD-93 PDZ2 (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether halothane disrupts protein interactions in a physiologic setting, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation studies using rat brain cortex (Fig. 2C). Immunoprecipitation of NMDA 2A/2B resulted in co-precipitation of PSD-95 under normal conditions, whereas with increasing concentrations of halothane, PSD-95 could not be co-precipitated with the NMDA receptor. This result demonstrates that inhalational anesthetics disrupt the physiological complex of PSD-95 and the NMDA receptor in brain tissue. Halothane Specifically and Immediately Prevents the Binding of PSD-95 PDZ with the NMDA Receptor and nNOS— Using a surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcore assay, we examined the ability of inhalational anesthetics to inhibit these protein-protein interactions in real time. We immobilized the whole length of nNOS protein or the C terminus of NR2A (the last 10 amino acids) to a BIAcore dextran chip and applied purified PSD-95 PDZ2 as a mobile analyte in the absence and presence of different concentrations of halothane. Binding of PSD-95 PDZ2 to nNOS or NR2A was measured in real time as an increase in resonance units. In the absence of halothane, injection of 20 μm PSD-95 PDZ2 led to formation of complexes with immobilized nNOS or NR2A peptides as detected by a large increase in resonance unit levels (Fig. 3, A and C). Interestingly, with the inclusion of increasing concentrations of halothane in the mobile phase, the equilibrium binding changed in a dose-dependent manner, despite lack of any change in the rates of association and dissociation of the complexes (Fig. 3, A and C). This suggests that halothane reduces the number of sites available for the binding between PSD-95-PDZ2 and nNOS as well as between PSD-95-PDZ2 and NR2A, thus preventing the formation of protein-protein complexes. To investigate whether this inhibitory effect of halothane is specific for protein-protein interactions within the NMDA receptor signaling complex, we also coupled monoclonal anti-PSD-95 antibody (recognizing PSD-95 PDZ2) onto the dextran sensor chip. A robust binding of PSD-95 PDZ2 to its antibody was observed. Halothane had no effect on this binding (Fig. 3B). Finally, ethanol instead of halothane was mixed with PSD-95 PDZ2 to flow over the peptide surface. Although ethanol has been shown to disrupt NMDA transmission in a manner analogous to the volatile anesthetics (40Woodward J.J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 2001; 14: 69-89Google Scholar), our result showed that ethanol did not decrease the binding of PSD-95 to the C terminus of NR2A (Fig. 3D) or nNOS (data not shown), suggesting that the disruption of the binding seen in our study is mediated specifically by inhalational anesthetics. The Halothane Binding Site on PSD-95 PDZ2 Completely Overlaps with the Binding Pocket of PSD-95 for nNOS and NR2 Subunit—Our findings thus far demonstrate that inhalational anesthetics specifically inhibit the PSD-95 PDZ2 domain-mediated protein interactions with nNOS and NMDA receptors, suggesting that inhalational anesthetics may directly target the second PDZ domain of the PSD-95 family of proteins. The second PDZ domain of PSD-95 contains a peptide-binding groove on the surface consisting of a βB strand and an αB helix (10Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic groove is a binding pocket for both the C-terminal peptide of the NMDA receptor and a β–finger peptide from the nNOS PDZ (10Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 32Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R.

Biol. 2000; 303: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on their molecular structures, hydrophobic inhalational anesthetics may also bind to the target-binding groove of the PDZ domain. To directly examine this possibility, we studied the binding of halothane to PSD-95 PDZ2 using an NMR chemical shift perturbation technique. Fig. 4 summarizes the chemical shift changes of the amino acid residues in the PSD-95 PDZ2 as a result of binding to halothane. Halothane is likely to bind to a hydrophobic pocket formed by amino acid residues Leu170, Ile172, Ile174, Ile195, Val229, and Leu232. The two positively charged residues located in the vicinity of the hydrophobic pocket also play a positive role in stabilizing the electron-rich halothane molecule. The halothane binding site on PSD-95 PDZ2 directly overlaps with the binding pocket for nNOS and the NMDA NR2 subunit, suggesting that halothane can directly compete with nNOS and NR2 for binding to PSD-95 PDZ2. Consistent with anesthetic mechanism theory, anesthetic disruption of PSD-95 and PSD-93 PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions is immediate, dose-dependent, and reversible and occurs at hydrophobic sites on the protein at concentrations equivalent to the potency of these agents to induce the state of anesthesia. These findings define the second PDZ domain of PSD-95 and PSD-93 proteins as a potential molecular target for inhalational anesthetics. Together with our previous in vivo data showing that suppression of PSD-95 expression dose-dependently decreases the threshold for anesthesia (31Tao Y.-X. Johns R.A. Anesthesiology. 2001; 94: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), our study has demonstrated that anesthetic disruption of PSD-95 or PSD-93 PDZ domain interactions at synapses might be important to the state of anesthesia. Inhaled anesthetics have been demonstrated to occupy preexisting clefts or pockets in a variety of proteins (41Johansson J.S. Scharf D Davies L.A. Reddy K.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 982-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42Jenkins A. Greenblatt E.P. Faulkner H.J. Bertaccini E. Light A. Lin A. Andreasen A. Viner A. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Neuroscience. 2001; 21: 1-4Google Scholar). The cavities of more than 150 Å3 can accommodate typical inhaled anesthetics (43Eckenhoff R.G. Mol. Intervent. 2001; 1: 258-268PubMed Google Scholar). The volume of the peptide-binding groove of PSD-95 PDZ domain is large enough to allow inhaled anesthetics to insert into the cavity. Anesthetic binding may not cause PDZ domain conformation change. Halothane binding to human serum albumin produces no change in local or global structure (44Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Instead, the halothane molecules simply occupy preexisting cavities and make contact with polar and nonpolar amino acids forming the cavity wall. Our study has suggested that halothane binding sites in the peptide-binding groove overlap with those for the C-terminal peptide of the NMDA NR2 subunit and a β-sheet of nNOS. Thus, inhalational anesthetics competitively displace a natural ligand essential for the protein-protein interaction. Moreover, the inhalational anesthetic-induced inhibition can be overcome with time as the concentration of anesthetics is decreased. Although the mechanisms underlying inhalational anesthesia are not well elucidated, a consensus is developing that inhalational anesthetics act on multiple target sites in the central nervous system. A number of ion channel targets of inhalational anesthetics have been identified, and prominent among these are the inhibitory GABAA and glycine receptor channels (2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R.

Neurophysiol. 1991; 66: 2014-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the current study, we provide novel evidence that inhalational anesthetics dose-dependently and specifically disrupt the protein interaction between PSD-95 or PSD-93 and NMDA receptors or nNOS by competitively binding to the second PDZ domain without affecting protein interaction between the PSD-95 guanylate kinase domain and the SAP102 Src homology 3 domain. It has been shown that the coupling of nNOS to the NMDA receptor by the PSD-95 PDZ domain governs many important physiological and pathological aspects of neuronal functioning (25Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 26Aarts M. Liu Y. Liu L. Besshoh S. Arundine M. Gurd J.W. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W.

Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This is the first work to demonstrate that general anesthetics can disrupt protein-protein interactions crucial for neuronal signaling processes. Our previous in vivo work has shown that the deficiency of PSD-95 protein reduced the anesthetic threshold of inhalational anesthetics (31Tao Y.-X. Johns R.A. Anesthesiology. 2001; 94: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Combined with the current work, these data indicate that the PDZ domain might be a target for inhalational anesthetics in the central nervous system. PDZ domain-mediated protein-protein interactions have been identified in a diverse set of signal transduction proteins at synapses. In addition to binding to NMDA receptors and to nNOS, PSD-95 and other PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins bind to a variety of different receptors and channels, including kainate receptors (52Wakamori M. Ikemoto Y. Akaike N. J. Neurophysiol. 1991; 66: 2014-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), AMPA receptors (54Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Additional receptors, including three subtypes of serotonin receptor, also contain the typical C-terminal PDZ target motifs that have been reported to bind to PDZ domain-containing proteins (59Becamel C. Figge A. Poliak S. Dumuis A. Peles E. Bockaert J. Lubbert H. Ullmer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12974-12982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On the basis of their preferences for residues at the C-terminal motifs of ligands, PDZ domain-containing proteins can be divided into at least three main classes (60Huang A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). PSD-95 and PSD-93 belong to class 1, PICK1 (one PDZ-containing scaffold protein that interacts with AMPA receptor subunit GluR2) belongs to class 2, and nNOS belongs to class 3. Our recent work has demonstrated that inhalational anesthetics also disrupt PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions between PSD-95 and the Kv1.4 channel as well as between PICK1 and AMPA receptor subunit GluR2. 2M. Fang, Y.-X. Tao, F. He, M. Zhang, C. F. Levine, P. Mao, F. Tao, C.-L. Chou, S. Sadegh-Nasseri, and R. A. Johns, unpublished data. It is very likely that inhalational anesthetics target the hydrophobic pocket of the PDZ domain rather than the C-terminal binding motif. This idea is supported by the current NMR data showing that halothane binds a hydrophobic peptide-binding groove on PSD-95 PDZ2. Although physiological significance of the disruption of these PDZ domain interactions by inhalational anesthetics remains to be explored, it seems that inhaled anesthetics affect multiple signaling events via PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions in the nervous system. This knowledge may lead to a new concept for anesthetic action in which the general anesthetic state is achieved not only by altering synaptic receptor activities but also by affecting PDZ domain-mediated protein interaction.

https://openalex.org/W1992525673,"p73, a p53 family member, is highly similar to p53 in both structure and function. Like p53, the p73 protein contains an N-terminal activation domain, a DNA-binding domain, a tetramerization domain, and several PXXP motifs. Previously, we and others have shown that some functional domains in p53, such as the DNA-binding and tetramerization domains, are required for inducing both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis whereas others, such as the second activation domain, the proline-rich domain, and the C-terminal basic domain, are only required for inducing apoptosis. To determine the activity of p73 functional domains, we have generated stable inducible cell lines that express p73beta and various mutants deficient in one or more functional domains. We found that in addition to the DNA-binding domain, p73-mediated growth suppression requires the N-terminal activation domain and the tetramerization domain. However, unlike p53, p73-mediated apoptosis does not require the region adjacent to the activation domain or the entire C-terminal region. Interestingly, while the N- or the C-terminal PXXP motifs are dispensable for p73 function, deletion of both the N- and the C-terminal PXXP motifs renders p73 inactive in transactivation. In addition, we found that substitution of two conserved tandem hydrophobic residues with two hydrophilic ones, which can abrogate the activity of the first activation domain in p53, has no effect on p73 transcriptional activity. Together, we showed that the p73 protein has its own unique determinants for transactivation and growth suppression."

The enzyme is found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and participates in diverse metabolic pathways such as photosynthesis, lipogenesis, and energy metabolism.

A sequence comparison of malic enzymes from different sources shows significant homology within the family but no homology to other proteins with the exception of the dinucleotide binding signature motif (5Kulkarni G. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because of its functional importance, the enzyme has been isolated and characterized from several sources (3Karsten W. Cook P.F. Protein Pept. Lett. 2000; 7: 281-286Google Scholar, 6Rao G.S.J.

The mitochondrial NAD-malic enzyme (m-NAD·ME) from the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum, plays a pivotal role in carbohydrate metabolism in parasitic worms (7Saz H.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1981; 43: 323-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the anaerobic metabolism of A. suum, malate, an intermediate in the worm's glycolytic pathway, is transported into the mitochondria where it undergoes a dismutation and is converted to pyruvate and NADH via the malic enzyme reaction and to fumarate via the fumarase reaction. Fumarate is then converted to short, branched-chain fatty acids via succinate mediated by the NADH produced in the malic enzyme reaction. The succinate dehydrogenase reaction is also involved in a site 1 oxidative phosphorylation, the main source of mitochondrial ATP (8Komuniecki R. Harris B.G. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, London, UK1995: 49-66Crossref Google Scholar). Since malic enzyme generates reducing equivalents (NADH) for the conversion of fumarate to succinate, it is not surprising that fumarate regulates its own utilization by activating the malic enzyme reaction (9Landsperger W.J. Harris B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3599-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lai C.-J. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem.

The ascarid malic enzyme has been extensively studied in our laboratories from the standpoint of its kinetic, regulatory, chemical mechanisms and also physicochemical properties (3Karsten W. Cook P.F. Protein Pept. Lett. 2000; 7: 281-286Google Scholar, 6Rao G.S.J. Coleman D.E. Kulkarni G. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Protein Pept. Lett. 2000; 7: 297-304Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the enzyme complexed with NAD has been determined to 2.3-Å resolution and compared with the structure of the human mitochondrial enzyme, also complexed with NAD (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L. Nat. Struct.

Whereas the two enzymes have similar tertiary and quaternary structures and exhibit similarities in domain structure, there are significant differences between the structures of the two enzymes. The ascarid enzyme has 30 additional residues at its amino terminus relative to the human enzyme, and this extra sequence leads to increased interactions at the tetramer interface. Although the active site residues of the ascarid enzyme are similar to those of the human enzyme, residues interacting with NAD differ between the two (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The two enzymes also differ in the organization of the tetramer. The ascarid malic enzyme tetramer is more flattened compared with the human enzyme as a consequence of the difference in the positioning of the C domain in the two structures relative to the A and B domains and also a difference in the positioning of the two dimers within each tetramer. The most notable difference between the two enzymes is that the human enzyme has a second NAD-binding site (exo site), distinct from the active site, at the tetramer interface, which was originally thought to be an ATP-inhibitory site but later on was suggested to be of unknown function (13Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure. 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ascarid enzyme does not have this exo site for NAD (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is not inhibited by ATP at physiological concentrations. 2D. Liu and P. Cook, unpublished observations.2D. Liu and P. Cook, unpublished observations. In the previous structure of the ascarid malic enzyme (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the active site was located by the bound NAD and by comparison with the closed and open forms of the human enzyme (12Yang Z.

Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The NAD cofactor binds with the nicotinamide ring in the anti conformation with the re face directed toward the solvent. In the bound conformation, the nicotinamide ring closely approaches the pyrophosphate moiety, probably resulting in an ionic interaction between N-1 of the nicotinamide ring and one of the oxygens of the pyrophosphate backbone. In order to determine the specific effects of reduction of the nicotinamide ring on the coenzyme binding in the active site and the overall catalytic mechanism, a structure of the Ascaris malic enzyme has been solved with NADH bound at the active site. This is the first report of the structure of a malic enzyme complexed with the reduced coenzyme and reveals a huge movement of the nicotinamide ring closer to the active site residues as a consequence of reduction. Although tartronate was included in our previous crystallization trials, we were not able to clearly identify bound tartronate in the electron density map of ME·NAD crystals. However, the higher resolution data obtained in the present study helped to locate tartronate bound to an allosteric site that is shown to bind fumarate in the human enzyme. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Malic enzyme was purified as described previously (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G.

Crystals of the ME·NADH complex were obtained by the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 100 mm Tris·SO4, pH 7.3, 100 mm sodium acetate, 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 5 mm NADH, 10 mm tartronate, 20 mm MgSO4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% sodium azide. The crystals are typically 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm and are isomorphous with the crystals of ME·NAD complex and belong to the space group P3121 with an asymmetric unit of a = b = 130.95 Å, c = 149.13 Å, containing two monomers. For cryoprotection, crystals were first soaked in a stabilizing solution containing 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 15 mm NAD, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in 100 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.5, for 2 h and then soaked for 24 h in a cryoprotectant solution containing the above components plus 20% ethylene glycol (v/v). Crystals were flash frozen on rayon loops by plunging them into liquid propane and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. X-ray diffraction data to 2.0 Å were collected at the Cornell synchrotron source (CHESS) F1 line (λ = 0.947 Å) equipped with a CCD detector. Data were processed using the DENZO/SCALEPACK programming package (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38436) Google Scholar). Model Building and Refinement—The starting model for refinement was a dimer of the Ascaris ME·NAD structure solved to 2.3 Å in our laboratory (Protein Data Bank code 1LLQ) (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NAD molecules were omitted from the model for the first round of refinement. This initial model was refined with the reflection data for the ME·NADH crystals by simulated annealing with no symmetry constraints using the CNS (version 1.1) programming package (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar). Initial 2F o - F c and F o - F c maps indicated no major differences between the two structures with the exception of the nicotinamide portion of NAD molecule and in the carboxyl-terminal region. The model was manually rebuilt using the interactive graphics model building program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Since differences between the two crystallographically independent subunits (αa and αb) were observed, as in the structure of the enzyme-NAD complex, independent models were used for each monomer after the first two rounds of refinement. A bulk solvent correction was applied to all refinements, and the free-R factor method was used to monitor the refinement (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar). Sine electron density for the NADH cofactor and tartronate molecule was clearly observed in the initial model, NADH and tartronate were added during the first round of model building. The asymmetric unit for the current model contains residues 2–603 (αa) and residues 2–593 (αb) of the two crystallographically independent subunits, two NADH molecules and two Mg2+ bound at the active sites, two tartronate molecules bound in the dimer interface, and 410 water molecules. The subunits superimpose with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.34 Å between 593 corresponding α carbons. Analysis of stereochemistry using the program PROCHECK (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed >90% of the residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Final refinement statistics calculated using all data are given in Table I. Comparison between subunits and domains and with the human ME structures was carried out using O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y.

Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Overall, the structure is a tetramer, which is organized as a dimer of dimers (Fig. 1) (the r.m.s. deviation between the α carbon backbones of the corresponding monomers, dimers, and tetramers of the two complexes are 0.25, 0.32, and 0.34 Å, respectively). Two types of subunit interfaces have been defined: a dimer interface between two subunits composing two monomers and a tetramer interface formed between two dimers (Fig. 1). The monomer is organized into four domains (A, B, C, and D) as previously described for Ascaris ME (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and other malic enzymes (14Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The active site is a cleft, formed between the C and B domains, and one NADH cofactor is bound to each of the four active sites in the tetramer. The B and C domains in the ME·NADH complex superimpose on the corresponding domains in the ME·NAD complex with r.m.s. deviations of 0.18 and 0.30 Å, respectively. The active site, like that of the ME·NAD complex (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), is in an open conformation (i.e. the residues implicated in substrate binding and catalysis (Arg181, Lys199, Asp295, Asp272, and Asn434) are poorly positioned for their prospective roles. In the NAD-bound structure, electron density for three residues, Ala601, Ser602, and Met603 at the C terminus in the D-domain (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was either not present or weak. In the present structure, the three residues could be unambiguously modeled but do not have a significant impact on the overall structure. The tetramer in the present structure has four NADH molecules (one per monomer) bound in the active site and four tartronate molecules (one per monomer) bound within the dimer interface (Fig. 1). The NADH-binding Site—The conformation of the NADH cofactor and its interactions with the enzyme are similar to those of the ME·NAD complex with the exception of a dramatic difference in the conformation and interactions of the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 2, A and B). The nicotinamide ring in the NADH complex rotates +198° about the N-glycosylic bond relative to its orientation in the ME·NAD complex, with the si face exposed to the solvent-accessible region of the active site (Fig. 2A). Binding interactions observed in the ME·NAD complex between the nicotinamide ring amide group and residues Gly477 and Asn479 are broken as a consequence of this rotation, and new hydrogen bonds between the carboxamide side chain and the enzyme are formed between active site residues Asp295 and Arg181 (Table II and Fig. 2B). A water molecule (wat139) occupies the site vacated by the nicotinamide amide group and forms hydrogen bonds with Gly477 and Asn479.Table IIComparison of the interactions between the cofactor and enzyme residues within the Ascaris ME·NAD and ME·NADH binary complexes A key to the atom names for the cofactor is shown below.Table IIComparison of the interactions between the cofactor and enzyme residues within the Ascaris ME·NAD and ME·NADH binary complexes A key to the atom names for the cofactor is shown below. In addition to NADH, Mg2+ is also bound to the active site (Fig. 2B). The metal ion is coordinated to the carboxylate oxygens of Glu271, Asp272, and Asp295 with distances of about 2.3 Å. These residues are homologous to the residues that bind Mn2+ in the human enzyme (Asp255, Asp256, and Asp279) with similar bonding distances (12Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The Tartronate Binding Site—Tartronate, a competitive inhibitor of the ascarid malic enzyme with respect to the substrate malate, was included in all Ascaris ME crystallizations in order to characterize the malate-binding site. Although electron density is observed in the active site corresponding to the tartronate binding site as identified in the human ME·NAD (12Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the density in the ascarid malic enzyme structure is weak and does not conclusively demonstrate that tartronate is bound to the active site (Fig. 3A). This may be due to partial occupancy of the malate-binding site. However, density for tartronate is observed at a different site, within the dimer interface near a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 3B). Here the tartronate molecule is bound to a highly positively charged pocket (Figs. 4, A and B) and is tightly anchored by strong hydrogen bond/ionic interactions with residues from two adjacent subunits. The majority of the residues contributing to the binding site are in a cleft formed between the αA3 (residues 76–87) and αA4 (residues 93–104) helices of a subunit (Figs. 3B and 5A). Oxygen atoms O-1 and O-2 from one tartronate carboxylate group are within hydrogen-bonding distance (Table III) to the N-ϵ atom of the side chain amide group of Gln78 (Gln64 in human ME) and a salt bridge with the guanidinium group of Arg105 (Arg91 in human ME), respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Oxygen atom O-4 of the other carboxylate forms a salt bridge with the guanidinium group of Arg105 (Arg91 in human ME), whereas its O-5 atom forms a salt bridge with the NH2 of the guanidinium group of Arg81 (Arg67 in human ME). The hydroxyl oxygen atom (O-3) of tartronate is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the N-ϵ of Arg81. The remainder of the tartronate binding site is formed by residues 140–142 from the adjacent subunit. These residues are part of a coil, which links the A and B domains of this subunit. The hydroxyl group of Tyr141 is within hydrogen bonding distance to a carboxylate oxygen of tartronate. Binding of tartronate to this site contributes to the subunit interaction across the dimer interface. It is interesting that the dimer interface in the A. suum malic enzyme contains several charged residues and provides a continuous, positively charged pocket (Fig. 4, A and B) for the binding of negatively charged molecules such as tartronate and malate. The tartronate site also contains a water molecule (wat74; Fig. 3B), which is bound to a tartronate carboxylate oxygen and the amide NH of Met64. Its location corresponds to a water molecule bound to the fumarate-binding site in the human ME·NAD.Fig. 4A, electrostatic potential surface of a monomer of Ascaris mME as viewed in roughly the same orientation as in Fig. 3B.

Identification of bound tartronate in the Ascaris ME·NADH complex also definitively indicated that tartronate is bound at the same site in the Ascaris ME·NAD complex. In the ME·NAD complex, although density was observed at the tartronate binding site, the resolution of the data did not permit identification of this density as tartronate. Comparison of the ME·NADH and ME·NAD structures revealed that the unidentified density in ME·NAD was also tartronate and that the binding interactions are identical to those observed in ME·NADH. Overall Structure—The present structure, the first of a malic enzyme with reduced dinucleotide bound to the active site, provides new insights into substrate binding modes and helps resolve some of the questions associated with the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. In addition, the structure reveals the identity of the allosteric site, that binds the activator fumarate. The backbone conformation and the quaternary structure observed in the ME·NADH complex are very similar to those of the ME·NAD complex (the r.m.s. deviation between the main chain atoms of the two structures is 0.25 Å, monomer; 0.32 Å, dimer; and 0.34 Å, tetramer). There are no noticeable differences in the dimer and tetramer interactions. As stated above, the final three residues at the C terminus in the D-domain (Ala601, Ser602, and Met603) can be visualized but have no significant impact on the overall structure of the ME·NADH complex. In earlier studies on the structure of the ME·NAD complex, it was speculated that the residues implicated in metal ion binding (Glu271, Glu272, and Asp295) were not properly positioned for binding the metal ion. In the present structure, the binding site for magnesium is clearly identified (Fig. 2B). Whereas the role of Asp295 in metal ion binding was further confirmed by earlier site-directed mutagenesis studies (19Karsten W. Chooback L. Liu D. Hwang C. Lynch C. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10527-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a role for Glu271 and Asp272 was not postulated. These two residues are part of the malic enzyme sequence QFEDFA (positions 269–274), which agrees well with the consensus metal ion binding sequence XXDDXX, where X is an uncharged or hydrophobic residue (20Hlavaty J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 39: 3389-3403Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All of the residues suggested as metal ion ligands are homologous to residues in the human enzyme (12Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The fact that Mg2+ was not observed bound at the corresponding site in the ME·NAD complex indicates that the metal ion affinity may be sensitive to the oxidation state of the cofactor or that the low resolution data for ME·NAD crystals does not reveal the metal ion-binding site. The binding of the metal ion is consistent with the required ordered addition of metal ion prior to malate. Although the active sites of the ME·NADH and ME·NAD complexes differ in their cofactor conformations and the presence of Mg2+ bound in ME·NADH complex, the active site main chain and side chain conformations are very similar to one another. Conformational Change in the Coenzyme—A comparison of the coenzyme binding pockets in the present structure and the previously reported ME·NAD structure shows interesting changes in the conformation of the nicotinamide ring as a consequence of reduction (Fig. 2, A and B). In the ME·NAD complex, as NAD is bound, the re face of the nicotinamide ring is directed toward the solvent such that its carboxamide side chain is directed away from the catalytic pocket into the protein structure. In the present structure, however, the reduced cofactor has its nicotinamide ring moved into the active site through a rotation about the N-glycosylic bond by +198°, and its si face is now directed toward the solvent. The carboxamide side chain, which was originally hydrogen-bonded to a backbone carbonyl and the amide side chain of Asn479, now interacts with Arg181, which in turn interacts with the α-carboxylate of l-malate, and Asp295, the putative general base, which in turn interacts with the 2-hydroxyl of malate in the Michaelis complex (Table II). The proS proton of the reduced nicotinamide ring is now directed toward the active site. It is interesting to note that whereas the nicotinamide ring rotates by +198° into the active site, other catalytic residues are unaffected. As shown in Fig. 2A, the density around the nicotinamide ring in a difference map calculated from ME·NADH complex with and without NADH is very strong, and there are strong hydrogen-bonding contacts between the carboxamide group of the nicotinamide ring with Arg181 and Asp295, suggesting that the nicotinamide ring is indeed locked in this conformation and that the observed conformational change is not simply due to the conformational flexibility allowed by the Rossman fold as in the case of lactate dehydrogenase (21Vincent J.F.S. Zwahlen C. Post C.B. Brunger J.W. Bodenhausen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; : 4383-4388Google Scholar, 22Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mobility of the nicotinamide ring reported in this study is also observed in other enzymes, and it has been proposed to play a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism of at least two other enzymes, aldehyde dehydrogenase (23Hammen P.K. Allali-Hassani A. Hallenga K. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7156-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (24Adams M.J. Ellis G.H. Gover S. Naylor C.P. Phillips C. Structure. 1994; 2: 651-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Implications to Catalytic Mechanism—A three-step acid-base catalytic mechanism is proposed for ascarid malic enzyme based on pH and isotope partitioning studies (25Park S.-H. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3752-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Kiick D.M. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Weiss P.M. Gavva S.R. Harris B.G. Urbauer J.L. Cleland W.W. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The assignment of the general acid, general base, and binding groups shown in Scheme 1 is based on the x-ray structure of the ME·NAD complex (11Coleman D.E. Rao G.S.J. Goldsmith E.J. Cook P.F. Harris B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6928-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis studies (19Karsten W. Chooback L. Liu D. Hwang C. Lynch C. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10527-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Generally, l-malate is converted to oxaloacetate facilitated by Asp295, which acts as a general base to accept a proton from the 2-hydroxyl of l-malate (19Karsten W. Chooback L. Liu D. Hwang C. Lynch C. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10527-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The hydride at C-2 of malate is transferred to the 4-position of the nicotinamide of NAD, with the positively charged pyridinium nitrogen providing the driving force for reduction. The guanidinium of Arg181 helps to orient malate for reaction by forming an ion pair/hydrogen bond with the α-carboxyl of malate, and Lys199 acts in a similar role by interacting with the β-carboxyl. The metal ion (Mg2+) aids in the orientation of malate for catalysis and facilitates proton transfer to Asp295 by binding to the α-hydroxyl of malate. In the second step, oxaloacetate is decarboxylated to enolpyruvate with the metal ion acting as a Lewis acid and protonated Asp295 acting as a general acid to protonate the enolate oxygen. Finally, enolpyruvate is tautomerized to pyruvate, with Asp295 acting as a general base and the ϵ-amino group of Lys199 acting as a general acid to protonate C-3 of enolpyruvate (29Liu D. Karsten W.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11955-11960Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic mechanism requires a protonated form of the general acid (Lys199) and an unprotonated form of the general base (Asp295). The optimum protonation state for Asp295 (unprotonated) and Lys199 (protonated) is observed in the V/K malate pH-rate profile (26Kiick D.M. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although the catalytic role of Lys199 is not realized until CO2 is released. The observation of the Lys199 pK in the V/K profile indicates the importance of the protonated form of Lys199 in binding malate. Whereas the existence of the protonated form of Lys199 is important for optimum binding of the β-carboxylate of l-malate, it poses a problem in the decarboxylation step, where the ionic/hydrogen-bonding interaction between Lys199 and the carboxylate would be anticatalytic. Thus, during the subsequent hydride transfer step, the interaction between the carboxylate and Lys199 must be eliminated. The crystallographically observed conformational change in the nicotinamide ring may provide an explanation as to how the hydrogen bond between Lys199 and the β-carboxyl of malate may be eliminated. A mechanism incorporating the structural data obtained in the present study is shown in Scheme 1. Malate is bound such that its α-carboxylate is hydrogen-bonded to the guanidinium of Arg181 and coordinated to Mg2+. The β-carboxylate of malate is proposed to hydrogen-bond to Lys199, and the β-hydroxyl of malate is hydrogen-bonded to Asp295 and coordinated to Mg2+. The nicotinamide ring of NAD+ is bound with its carboxamide side chain hydrogen-bonded to a backbone NH and carbonyl and to the amide side chain of Asn479. The distance between the pyridinium nitrogen of NAD+ and the pyrophosphate moiety of the cofactor is about 5.7 Å. Hydride transfer from C-2 of malate to C-4 of the nicotinamide ring occurs and is partly driven by the positively charged pyridinium ring and general base catalysis by Asp295. The reduction of the nicotinamide ring results in a rotation by 198° about the N-glycosidic bond, placing the carboxamide side chain within hydrogen-bonding distance to Asp295 and Arg181. The rotation is thought to result, at least partly, from loss of the ionic interaction between the pyridinium nitrogen of NAD+ and the pyrophosphate moiety of the cofactor. The movement of the cofactor is proposed to be reversible but with the equilibrium position favoring that shown in the structure (Fig. 2). The movement of the nicotinamide ring along with the sp3 to sp2 hybridization change at C-2 that occurs as oxalacetate is formed is proposed to shift the position of the bound oxalacetate such that 1) the β-carboxylate moves away from Lys199 and 2) the C-3–C-4 bond to the β-carboxylate is now orthogonal to the C-2–C-3 plane of oxalacetate, favoring decarboxylation. Decarboxylation then occurs facilitated by the Lewis acidity of the Mg2+ and with Asp295 acting as a general acid. Finally, tautomerization occurs aided by general base-general acid catalysis via Asp295-Lys199 pair. The products pyruvate and NADH are then released. Final confirmation of the above hypothesis should come from the structure of a ternary complex of the enzyme with NADH and an analogue of malate or oxaloacetate. Of interest is the change in mechanism observed for the malic enzyme, from “stepwise” to “concerted,” when the dinucleotide substrate is changed to more oxidizing dinucleotides acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, thio-NAD+, or pyridine aldehyde adenine dinucleotide (30Karsten W.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The change in mechanism probably reflects a difference in the binding of the pyridine ring of the alternative substrates, which results in a difference in the conformation of the bound malate. A proposed link between the conformation of the bound nicotinamide ring and malate/oxalacetate was made above. It is not difficult to imagine a difference in the bound conformation of the pyridine ring, given the interaction of the carboxamide side chain of NAD+ with Asn479. In all cases, the side chains of the alternative dinucleotide substrates differ with respect to the hydrogen-bonding capability, size, and hydrophobicity in comparison with the carboxamide side chain of NAD+. In order to examine whether the active site of human enzyme could accommodate such a conformational change in the nicotinamide ring, NADH was modeled into the active site of the open structure of the human enzyme (14Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) such that the nicotinamide ring was rotated by 198° relative to its position in NAD molecule. The new conformation was indeed feasible without any steric hindrance, and the contact distances between the nicotinamide ring and the corresponding enzyme residues were similar to those observed in ascarid enzyme. The Tartronate Binding Site and Regulatory Mechanism— Tartronate, a dicarboxylic analogue of malate and fumarate, is tightly bound in an allosteric site via hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chains of two arginines (Arg105 and Arg81) and a glutamine (Gln78). All of the residues shown are homologous to those in the fumarate allosteric site depicted in the recent structure of the human enzyme-ATP complex (Fig. 5, A and B) (13Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure. 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The human mitochondrial ME is allosterically activated by fumarate. Although many of the residues that bind fumarate in human ME are homologous or functionally similar to those involved in tartronate binding in Ascaris ME, the binding modes of these ligands differ significantly between the two enzymes. A multiple sequence alignment for malic enzymes from selected species (Fig. 6) shows conservation of all of the above residues. It is interesting to note that fumarate activation has not been reported in all of the species that have the conserved residues under consideration. The Ascaris malic enzyme is also allosterically activated by fumarate with an activation constant of 40 μm (9Landsperger W.J. Harris B.G. J. Biol.

Activation is expressed as a decrease in the off-rate for bound malate (10Lai C.-J. Harris B.G. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the activation by fumarate under conditions of saturating NAD+ and Mg2+ is only 2-fold (9Landsperger W.J. Harris B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3599-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with reactants maintained at estimated physiologic concentrations, the activation is 15-fold. 3W. E. Karsten, J. E. Pais, G. S. J. Rao, B. G. Harris, and P. F. Cook, unpublished observations. Thus, the allosteric site where tartronate is bound is most likely an activator site for fumarate. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the R105A mutant of the Ascaris malic enzyme, which has a V/E t value identical to that of the wild type enzyme, is no longer activated by fumarate, consistent with tartronate being bound to the fumarate activator site. 3W. E. Karsten, J. E. Pais, G. S. J. Rao, B. G. Harris, and P. F. Cook, unpublished observations. The distance between the active site and the tartronate allosteric site is ∼30 Å. However, there are structural relationships between the sites, which could allow for transmission of the allosteric signal. Within a subunit, Arg105 participates in binding tartronate. The backbone oxygen of the adjacent residue, Asp104, is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Lys143, which is part of a coil sequence (residues 140–142) that connects the A and B domains of a subunit (Fig. 5A). This coil is also directly involved in forming the second tartronate binding site within the dimer interface via Tyr141 (Fig. 5A). The amino-terminal end of this coil is linked to the αA6 helix (residues 37–144), which contributes active site residue Tyr126. Thus, the tartronate-binding site is linked to the coil connecting the A and B domains of a monomer (residues 140–143). It is interesting to note that the conformation of this coil differs significantly from that of the corresponding coil in human ME (residues 126–129) despite almost identical sequences (Figs. 5B and 6). In particular, there is no interaction corresponding to the Asp104-Lys143 pair, and the positions of the homologous residues Arg142 (Ascaris) and Arg128 (human) differ. In addition, in place of Tyr141 in the Ascaris enzyme, the human enzyme has a phenylalanine (Phe127). Overall, the evidence presented in this study identifies an allosteric site and provides new insights into the mechanism of allosteric activation of the A. suum malic enzyme. However, the structure of the Ascaris malic enzyme with fumarate bound to this allosteric site will further confirm the identity of this site and enhance our understanding of the allosteric mechanism.

It was suggested that because apo(a) competes with plasminogen for binding to fibrin, causing inhibition of fibrinolysis, it could also promote atherothrombosis. Because the fibrin(ogen) αC-domains bind plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator with high affinity in a Lys-dependent manner, we hypothesized that they could also bind apo(a). To test this hypothesis, we studied the interaction between the recombinant apo(a) A10 isoform and the recombinant αC-fragment (Aα-(221–610)) corresponding to the αC-domain by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance. Both methods revealed a high affinity interaction (Kd = 19–21 nm) between the immobilized αC-fragment and apo(a), indicating that the former contains an apo(a)-binding site. This affinity was comparable to that of apo(a) for fibrin. At the same time, no interaction was observed between soluble fibrinogen and immobilized apo(a), suggesting that, in the former, this and other apo(a)-binding sites are cryptic. Further experiments with truncated recombinant variants of the αC-fragment allowed localization of the apo(a)-binding site to the Aα-(392–610) region. The presence of ϵ-aminocaproic acid only slightly inhibited binding of apo(a) to the αC-fragment, indicating the Lys-independent nature of their interaction. In agreement, the influence of plasminogen or tissue-type plasminogen activator on binding of apo(a) to the αC-fragment was minimal. These results indicate that the αC-domains contain novel high affinity apo(a)-binding sites that may provide a Lys-independent mechanism for bringing Lp(a) to places of fibrin deposition such as injured vessels or atherosclerotic lesions.

Numerous in vivo experiments with transgenic animals directly proved involvement of Lp(a) and fibrinogen in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. It was demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing human apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), a protein component of Lp(a), are more susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis (4Lawn R.M. Wade D.P.

It was also shown that in apo(a)-transgenic rabbits, in which apo(a) is efficiently assembled into Lp(a), the latter substantially increases the development of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis and accelerates formation of advanced atherosclerotic lesions (7Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Marcovina S. Honda K. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Ichikawa T. Unoki H. Sun H. Shimoyamada H.

Finally, it was found that fibrinogen deficiency in apo(a) transgenic mice reduces accumulation of apo(a) in the vessel walls and lesion development, suggesting that fibrin(ogen) may provide one of the major sites to which apo(a) binds to the vessel wall and participates in the generation of atherosclerosis (10Lou X.J.

Although the mechanism through which Lp(a) and fibrin-(ogen) may contribute to the atherogenic processes is still not clearly understood, it seems to be connected with their structure and their ability to interact with each other. Lp(a) is a lipoprotein particle composed of a lipid core and two disulfide-linked apolipoproteins, apoB-100 and apo(a). The lipid core and apoB-100 are shared with low density lipoprotein, the major transporter of cholesterol in human plasma; at the same time, apo(a), which shows a high degree of homology to plasminogen, confers unique properties on Lp(a) (11Eaton D.L. Fless G.M. Kohr W.J. McLean J.W. Xu Q.T. Miller C.G. Lawn R.M. Scanu A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3224-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 12McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E.

Because of these structural similarities, Lp(a) was implicated in the delivery of cholesterol to injured blood vessels (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1987; 330: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and in competition with plasminogen for binding to fibrin and cellular surfaces (14Anglés-Cano E. de la Pena D.A. Loyau S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); interaction between Lp(a) and fibrin may play a critical role in both cases. It has been established that both plasminogen and apo(a) contain Lys-binding sites (15Wiman B. Wallen P. Thromb. Res. 1977; 10: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Guevara Jr., J. Jan A.Y. Knapp R. Tulinsky A. Morrisett J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 758-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that binding of plasminogen to fibrin via these sites is important for its conversion into an active enzyme, plasmin (17Wiman B. Collen D. Nature. 1978; 272: 549-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 18Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that Lp(a) and apo(a) also interact with fibrin(ogen) via their Lys-binding sites and compete effectively with plasminogen for its interaction with fibrin (14Anglés-Cano E. de la Pena D.A.

It was suggested that such competition inhibits generation of active plasmin on fibrin associated with atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in inhibition of fibrinolysis and thereby promoting atherogenesis. Apo(a) is a one-chain multidomain glycoprotein consisting of a number of kringle domains and a serine protease domain, which are highly homologous to the corresponding domains of plasminogen (11Eaton D.L. Fless G.M. Kohr W.J. McLean J.W. Xu Q.T. Miller C.G. Lawn R.M. Scanu A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3224-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 12McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E.

The COOH-terminal protease-like domain of apo(a) shares 94% sequence homology with that of plasminogen and contains the same catalytic triad; however, the Arg-Val activation cleavage site present in plasminogen is replaced with Ser-Ile in apo(a) (12McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The kringle domain of apo(a) adjacent to the protease-like domain is highly homologous to plasminogen kringle domain V, whereas the remaining multiple kringle domains share 61–75% homology with plasminogen kringle domain IV. There are 10 different types of kringle domain IV, one of which appears in a variable number generating isoforms of apo(a) of different sizes (25Lackner C. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Kringle domain IV type 10 of apo(a) contains a Lys-binding site, which may be responsible for its interaction with fibrin(ogen) (26Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen is also a multidomain glycoprotein. It consists of two identical subunits, each of which is formed by three polypeptide chains, Aα, Bβ, and γ (27Henschen A. McDonagh J. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. Blood Coagulation. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1986: 171-241Google Scholar). Both the subunits and the chains are linked together by disulfide bonds and form a number of distinct independently folded domains grouped into several structural regions, the central E-region, two identical terminal D-regions, and the αC-domains (27Henschen A. McDonagh J. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. Blood Coagulation. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1986: 171-241Google Scholar, 28Privalov P.L. Medved L.V. J. Mol.

Each D-region is formed by the COOH-terminal portions of the Bβ- and γ-chains and a middle portion of the Aα-chain, whereas each αC-domain is formed by the COOH-terminal portion of the Aα-chain (Aα-(221–610)) (27Henschen A. McDonagh J. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. Blood Coagulation. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1986: 171-241Google Scholar, 30Weisel J.W. Medved L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Both the D-regions and the αC-domains contain Lys-dependent plasminogen-binding sites (32Nieuwenhuizen W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Tsurupa G. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Medved L. Nieuwenhuizen W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which may potentially be involved in the interaction with apo(a) kringle domains. The existence of Lys-dependent apo(a)-binding sites in the plasminogen-binding D-regions has been demonstrated recently using the yeast two-hybrid system (35Klose R. Fresser F. Kochl S. Parson W. Kapetanopoulos A. Fruchart-Najib J. Baier G. Utermann G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38206-38212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); nothing is known about the involvement of the αC-domains in interaction with apo(a). Because the αC-domains bind plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in a Lys-dependent manner and with high affinity, which is comparable to that for the interaction between apo(a) and fibrin (22Rouy D. Koschinsky M.L. Fleury V. Chapman J. Anglés-Cano E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6333-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Tsurupa G. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that they could also bind apo(a) and that the latter could compete for binding with plasminogen and possibly tPA. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interaction between the recombinant apo(a) A10 isoform and the recombinant αC-domain. We also examined the way in which that interaction is influenced by plasminogen, tPA, and ϵ-aminocaproic acid (ϵ-ACA), a synthetic analog of Lys. We found that the αC-domain bound apo(a) with high affinity; however, this binding was inhibited only slightly by excess plasminogen, tPA, or ϵ-ACA, indicating that it occurs mainly through a novel Lys-independent binding site. This site was further localized to the COOH-terminal half of the αC-domain (residues 392–610). Proteins—Plasminogen-depleted human fibrinogen was purchased from Calbiochem. It also did not contain factor XIII because its incubation with thrombin resulted in non-cross-linked fibrin as revealed by SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions. Recombinant single chain tPA was a Genentech product. Human Glu-plasminogen (form II) was prepared from citrated human plasma by affinity chromatography on Lys-Sepharose 4B (36Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences). Bovine α-thrombin was from Sigma, and bovine serum albumin was from Calbiochem. Antibodies—The sheep anti-tPA and goat anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. The peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep and anti-goat polyclonal antibodies were from Sigma. The sheep anti-apo(a) antibodies and monoclonal antibody A10.2 directed against the lysine-binding site of kringle domain IV type 10 of apo(a) were obtained as described (37Kang C. Dominguez M.

Anglés-Cano E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1548: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant αC-fragments corresponding to the human fibrinogen αC-domain (Aα-(221–610)) and its NH2- and COOH-terminal halves (Aα-(221–391) and Aα-(392–610), respectively) were produced in Escherichia coli using the pET-20b expression vector as described earlier (33Tsurupa G. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). They were purified and then refolded according to the procedures described (31Tsurupa G. Tsonev L. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6449-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Tsurupa G. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recombinant apo(a) A10 was produced in adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with the pCMV-A10 expression plasmid and cultured in a hollow fiber bioreactor as described (39Anglés-Cano E. Loyau S. Cardoso-Saldana G. Couderc R. Gillery P. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 354-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium was supplemented with serine protease inhibitors (20 kallikrein-inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, 1 mmol/liter aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3, final concentrations) and was used for the isolation of recombinant apo(a) by affinity chromatography on Lys-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and serine protease inhibitors. After sample application and washing, the column was equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 80 mm NaCl and serine protease inhibitors. To isolate human recombinant apo(a) from adsorbed fetal calf plasminogen present in the culture medium, a stepwise elution procedure was used. Plasminogen was first eluted with 2mm ϵ-ACA. The column was then washed, and recombinant apo(a) was eluted with 20 mm ϵ-ACA in the same buffer. Fractions containing recombinant apo(a) were pooled, concentrated on dried polyethylene glycol 20,000 (Serva), and dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 80 mm NaCl and 2 mmol/liter EDTA. The recombinant apo(a) preparation was >99% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE and NH2-terminal sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems microsequenator equipped with a Model 610A data analysis system. Purified recombinant apo(a) A10 consisted of a serine protease-like region, kringle domain V, and nine kringle domain IV repeats representing each of the kringle domain IV types (type 1 and types 3–10) except type 2. Solid-phase Binding Assay—Solid-phase binding was performed in plastic microtiter plates using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microtiter plate wells (Fisher) were coated overnight with 100 μl/well of 10 μg/ml fibrinogen, αC-fragment, or its truncated variants in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 9.5). To convert fibrinogen into fibrin, the wells with adsorbed fibrinogen were treated with 100 μl/well of a mixture of thrombin (1 NIH unit/ml) and aprotinin (400 units/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h as described previously (40Makogonenko E. Tsurupa G. Ingham K. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7907-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The wells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl). Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20, the indicated concentrations of apo(a) in the same buffer were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Bound apo(a) was measured by the reaction with the sheep anti-apo(a) polyclonal antibody and the peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep polyclonal antibody. A 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine microwell peroxide substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc.) was added to the wells, and the amount of bound ligand was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 1, A=Amax/(1+Kd/[L])(Eq. 1) where A represents absorbance of the oxidized substrate, which is assumed to be proportional to the amount of ligand bound; A max is the absorption at saturation; [L] is the molar concentration of ligand; and Kd is the dissociation constant. Biosensor Assay—The interaction of apo(a) with the αC-fragment and its variants was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using the IAsys biosensor (Fisons, Cambridge, UK), which measures association/dissociation of proteins in real time (41Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The αC-fragment or its variants were covalently coupled to the aminosilane surface of the cuvette using the glutaraldehyde cross-linking chemistry recommended by the manufacturer. Binding experiments were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.02% Tween 20 (binding buffer). The association between the immobilized fragments and the added proteins was monitored as the change in the SPR response. The dissociation of the complex was initiated by substitution with the same buffer lacking ligand and monitored in the same manner. To regenerate the surface, complete dissociation of the complex was achieved by adding 10 mm HCl for 1 min following re-equilibration with binding buffer. The traces of the association processes were recorded, and the data were analyzed using the FASTfit™ kinetics analysis software supplied with the instrument as previously described in detail (42Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Altin J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29633-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the association curves at each concentration of ligand were fitted to the pseudo first-order equation to derive the observed rate constant, k obs (termed on-rate constant in FASTfit). Then, the concentration dependence of k obs was fitted to Equation 2, kobs=kd+ka[ligand](Eq. 2) to find the association rate constant (ka) from the slope and the dissociation rate constant (kd) from the intercept. The dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) was calculated as Kd = kd /ka. The values were examined for self-consistency of the data as described (43Schuck P. Minton A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 458-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interaction of Apo(a) A10 with the αC-Fragment—To check whether the fibrinogen αC-domains are involved in binding of apo(a), we studied the interaction between the recombinant apo(a) A10 variant and the recombinant αC-fragment (Aα-(221–610)) corresponding to the αC-domain; in control experiments, we tested the interaction between apo(a) and fibrinogen. Prior to binding experiments, all three species (the αC-fragment, fibrinogen, and fibrin) were treated with carboxypeptidase B according to the protocol described (44Ellis V. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4806-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove possible COOH-terminal Lys residues that could contribute to binding of apo(a). In ELISA, when increasing concentrations of apo(a) A10 were added to the immobilized αC-fragment, a dose-dependent binding was observed (Fig. 1). The binding was of high affinity with an apparent Kd of 19 nm (Table I). This Kd was very close to that obtained in the same assay for the interaction between apo(a) A10 and immobilized fibrin (Fig. 1 and Table I). This high affinity interaction was confirmed in SPR experiments, in which apo(a) A10 bound to the immobilized αC-fragment in a dose-dependent manner with a Kd of 21 nm (Fig. 2 and Table I). All these results indicate that the αC-fragment (and the αC-domain) contains a high affinity apo(a)-binding site. It should be noted that when either the immobilized αC-fragment or fibrin was cross-linked with factor XIIIa, the binding curves obtained by ELISA and the calculated Kd values were similar to those obtained with the non-cross-linked species (data not shown), suggesting that cross-linking does not impact this binding.Table IDissociation constants for the interaction of apo(a) A10 with immobilized fibrinogen, fibrin, and the recombinant αC-fragment and its subfragments determined by ELISA and SPRProteins/fragmentsKdELISASPRnmαC-fragment (Aα-(221-610))19 ± 421 ± 3Aα-(221-391) fragmentNBNBAα-(392-610) fragment22 ± 424 ± 3Fibrin13 ± 8NDFibrinogen138 ± 16ND Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Analysis of binding of apo(a) A10 to the immobilized αC-fragment by SPR.

The inset shows a plot of the values of k obs determined for each association curve versus ligand concentration to derive ka and kd and thus to determine the dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) presented in Table I.

Nieuwenhuizen W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 45Medved L. Tsurupa G. Yakovlev S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To test whether the apo(a)-binding sites in the fibrinogen αC-domains are also cryptic, we studied the interaction of soluble fibrinogen with immobilized apo(a) A10. In ELISA, when soluble fibrinogen at a high concentration (1 μm) was added to immobilized apo(a) A10, no binding was observed (data not shown), suggesting that the apo(a)-binding sites in fibrinogen (and in its αC-domains) are cryptic. It should be mentioned that, in a reverse ELISA experiment, soluble apo(a) A10 bound to immobilized fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner, although with much lower affinity (Kd = 138 nm) (Fig. 1, inset). However, this binding can be explained by the well established fact that, upon immobilization, fibrinogen undergoes conformational changes resulting in exposure of some fibrin-specific epitopes and binding sites, including those for plasminogen and tPA (45Medved L. Tsurupa G. Yakovlev S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 46Shiba E. Lindon J.N. Kushner L. Matsueda G.R. Hawiger J. Kloczewiak M. Kudryk B.

Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cryptic character of the apo(a)-binding sites in fibrinogen was confirmed by SPR, in which fibrinogen at the same concentration (1 μm) also exhibited no binding to immobilized apo(a) (data not shown). Thus, the above results indicate that apo(a)-binding sites are cryptic in fibrinogen and become exposed upon its immobilization or conversion into fibrin. Further Localization of the Apo(a)-binding Site to the αC-Domain—To further localize the apo(a)-binding site to the αC-domain, we tested binding of apo(a) A10 to the truncated recombinant variants of the αC-domain, the Aα-(221–391) and Aα-(392–610) fragments, corresponding to its NH2- and COOH-terminal halves, respectively. In ELISA, apo(a) A10 bound to the immobilized Aα-(392–610) fragment in a dose-dependent manner, whereas practically no interaction was observed with the immobilized Aα-(221–391) fragment (Fig. 3). This binding occurred with a Kd of 22 nm, very close to that determined for the full-length αC-fragment (Table I). This was confirmed in SPR experiments, in which apo(a) A10 bound to the immobilized COOH-terminal region of the αC-domain in a dose-dependent manner with a very similar affinity (Kd = 24 nm) (Fig. 4 and Table I). These results indicate that the apo(a)-binding site is located in the COOH-terminal half of the αC-domain (Aα-(392–610)), the same region that also binds plasminogen and tPA (33Tsurupa G. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This finding is in agreement with the above-mentioned hypothesis that apo(a) A10 could compete with plasminogen (and/or tPA) for its binding sites in the αC-domain.Fig. 4Analysis of binding of apo(a) A10 to the αC-fragment and its NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments (Aα-(221–392) and Aα-(393–610), respectively) by SPR.

https://openalex.org/W2040334711,"Extensive data indicate that the transcription factor NFκB is activated by signals downstream of oncoproteins such as Ras or breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-ABL. Consistent with this, evidence has been presented that NFκB activity is required for Ras and BCR-ABL to transform cells. However, it remains unclear whether these oncoproteins activate a full spectrum of NFκB-dependent gene expression or whether they may augment or interfere with other stimuli that activate NFκB. The data presented here indicate that BCR-ABL expression in 32D myeloid cells or oncogenic Ras expression in murine fibroblasts blocks the ability of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to activate NFκB. This suppression of NFκB is manifested by an inhibition of TNF-induced inhibitor of NFκB (IKK) activity and NFκB DNA binding potential but not by blocking TNF-induced nuclear accumulation of NFκB/p65. The inhibition of NFκB is not observed in oncogenic Raf-expressing cells and is not fully restored by the suppression of PI3-kinase or MEK pathways. Oncogenic Ras suppresses the ability of TNF to activate the expression of NFκB-dependent genes, such as iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted). These studies suggest that the ability of Ras and BCR-ABL to activate NFκB involves an uncharacterized pathway that does not involve classic IKK activity and that suppresses the TNF-induced IKK pathway through a Raf/MEK/Erk-independent mechanism.

Mechanisms controlling gene-specific transcription downstream of oncoprotein-dependent signaling are poorly understood. Although certain transcription factors, including Ets and NFκB proteins, have been shown to be required for transformation in response to oncoprotein expression (1Langer S.J. Bortner D.M.

In fact, based on the broad range of genes regulated by NFκB, it has been hypothesized that its role in oncogenic transformation would involve induction of a limited set of genes to prevent an effective immunological response against neoplastic cells (4Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). Small GTPases of the Ras family are important signaling molecules in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and survival (5Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Growth factors and other external stimuli lead to transient activation of Ras; however, mutations in Ras alleles, which occur in ∼30% of human tumors, result in a constitutively active protein (6Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Active, GTP-bound Ras signals to a variety of downstream effector pathways. The three most extensively characterized Ras effectors are Raf kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), and RalGDS (7Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J.

Activation of Ras and its downstream signal transduction cascades ultimately leads to activation of transcription factors involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Ras also functions to control downstream signaling of other oncoproteins, such as the fusion protein breakpoint cluster region (BCR) 1The abbreviations used are: BCR, breakpoint cluster region; IκB, inhibitor of κ B; IKK, inhibitor of IκB kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; IL, interleukin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; RLE, rat liver epithelial; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; PI, phosphatidylinositol.-ABL that is associated with acute lymphoblastic and chronic myelogenous leukemia (9Pendergast A.M.

Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). NFκB is a family of dimeric transcription factors involved in immune and inflammatory responses, cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). There are five mammalian NFκB family members: RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105, and p52/p100. All members share homology in a 300-amino acid region called the Rel homology domain. The Rel homology domain is important for dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and binding to the inhibitor of κ B (IκB) family of proteins (18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, IκB proteins localize NFκB dimers in the cytoplasm by masking the nuclear localization sequence of NFκB. Activation of NFκB can occur through various stimuli, including cytokine stimulation, bacterial and viral infection, and oncogenic signals (18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Receptor activation of TNFR1, IL-1R, and various Toll-like receptors initiates signal transduction cascades ultimately leading to activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The IKK complex is composed of three subunits, IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Whereas IKKγ is a regulatory subunit, both IKKα and IKKβ have inducible catalytic activity. Upon activation, the IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα and IκBβ at specific serine residues, which targets IκB for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway. Once IκB is degraded, the nuclear localization sequence of NFκB is unmasked, allowing nuclear accumulation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation of target genes (18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Although nuclear accumulation is an important step in NFκB activation, post-translational modifications on p65 are proposed to be necessary for the transcriptional competence of nuclear NFκB. For example, phosphorylation of p65 on serine 276 is required for stable interactions with the transcriptional coactivator CBP and to stimulate transcriptional activation of NFκB target genes (19Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 20Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Other sites of phosphorylation have also been described that may contribute to the inherent transcriptional activity of NFκB (21Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22Wang D. Westerheide S.D. Hanson J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Evidence has also been presented that Akt, which functions downstream of PI3-kinase, can control the transcriptional activation function of the p65 NFκB subunit through a mechanism dependent on IKK function but in a manner which does promote enhanced DNA binding potential (24Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 25Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of oncoproteins activate NFκB by increasing transcriptional activation function (26Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we have shown that both oncogenic Ras and Raf activate an NFκB-dependent reporter gene in mouse fibroblasts without stimulating enhanced DNA binding of NFκB subunits (3Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 14Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, previous work suggests that BCR-ABL activates an NFκB-dependent reporter but in a manner that did not promote strong DNA binding activity (17Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the ability of BCR-ABL and Ras to modulate cytokine-induced NFκB-dependent responses. Our studies indicate that in murine myeloid cells and fibroblasts, BCR-ABL and Ras, respectively, strongly suppress TNF-induced NFκB activation by blocking both IKK activity and DNA binding. Inhibition of the PI3-kinase and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways could not fully overcome the Ras-induced block on NFκB activation. Additionally, oncogenic Ras suppresses TNF-induced activation of the NFκB-dependent genes iNOS and RANTES. These studies suggest that the ability of Ras and BCR-ABL to activate NFκB involves an uncharacterized pathway that does not involve classic IKK activity and that suppresses the TNF-induced IKK pathway. Cell Culture and Reagents—Spontaneously immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells stably expressing a constitutively active form of H-Ras, H-RasV12, or vector control were obtained by transfection of pZip-H-RasV12 or pZipneo with Polyfect (Qiagen). Cells expressing H-RasV12 were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. Surviving cells were pooled 2 weeks later. NIH 3T3 control and Raf-expressing cells were described previously (3Finco T.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). 32D myeloid cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% Wehi-conditioned medium, and penicillin-streptomycin. Generation of 32D cells expressing BCR-ABL fusion protein p185 was described previously (17Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF (Promega), 5 ng/ml IL-1β (Sigma), 20 μm PD98059 (Alexis Pharmaceuticals), or 10 μm LY294002 (Alexis Pharmaceuticals) where indicated. EMSAs and Western Blot Analysis—Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as previously described (27Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared following TNF stimulation and incubated with an α-32P-labeled DNA probe containing an NFκB consensus from the major histocompatibility complex class I promoter. For supershifts, 1 μl of antibody (described below) was incubated with protein-DNA complexes for 10 min prior to loading gel. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Western blot analysis was performed by preparing nuclear, cytoplasmic, or whole cell extracts and separating proteins by SDS-PAGE. After transferring the separated proteins to nitrocellulose the blots were blocked in TBST with 5% milk and then incubated in primary antibody (IκBα, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p65 (Rock-land), phospho-IκBα Ser-32/36, phospho-c-Jun Ser-73, and phospho-Akt Ser-473 (Cell Signaling), phospho-p42/p44 Thr-202/Tyr-204 (New England Biolabs)) for either 1–2 h or overnight. The membranes were then washed in TBST and incubated for 1 h in anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega) and washed again. Protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase Assay—500 μg of whole cell extracts prepared from cells as previously described (28Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar) was incubated with 25 μl of IKKγ antibody (Upstate) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads washed in whole cell extract buffer were added and incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of pulldown buffer and one time in assay dilution buffer (ADB). Next, the beads were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 μl of 1× ADB plus 4 μg of GST-IκBα, MgCl2, and ATP. 30 μl of 2× sample buffer was added, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotting for phospho-IκBα serine 32/36 (New England Biolabs) was performed. Luciferase Assays—Control and H-RasV12-transformed cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate. 24 h later 100 ng of pGl4-κB luciferase, 200 ng of β-actin LacZ, and 200 ng of empty vector or 100 ng of Gal4-luciferase, 50 ng of Gal4-p54, and 350 ng of empty vector DNA was transfected into the cells with Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h post-transfection the cells were harvested in 100 μl of M-PER buffer (PIERCE) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. All data are represented as luciferase units/β-galactosidase units. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Ribonuclease protection assays were performed on a custom template according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD PharMingen). Briefly, 20 μg of total RNA, isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen), was hybridized overnight to biotinylated RNA probes. Unhybridized RNA and biotinylated probes were then digested with RNase A. The protected RNA complexes were then precipitated and resolved on a 4.75% polyacrylamide urea sequencing gel. The complexes were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After UV cross-linking, the membrane was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Protected complexes were visualized by autoradiography after incubation with luminal/enhancer solution. BCR-ABL and H-RasV12 Expression Inhibits TNF–induced NFκB Activation—Previous reports indicate that oncogenic Ras and BCR-ABL can activate NFκB transactivation function independent of enhanced DNA binding. However, little is known about how oncoprotein-induced signaling may affect the ability of other stimuli to activate NFκB. To determine whether oncogenic Ras or BCR-ABL have an effect on TNF-induced NFκB activation, immortalized MEFs transformed with H-RasV12 or 32D cells expressing the p185 BCR-ABL fusion protein were examined. Transformed cells (H-Ras or BCR-ABL-expressing) and control cells (MEFs or 32D cells) were stimulated with TNF for 15, 30, or 60 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and NFκB DNA binding activity was determined by EMSA. As expected, TNF rapidly induces NFκB DNA binding activity by 15 min in control cells; however, this activation is greatly reduced in both H-RasV12-transformed MEFs (Fig. 1A) and BCR-ABL-expressing 32D cells (Fig. 1B). Super-shift analysis of the MEF control 30′ time point revealed that the NFκB DNA binding complex I contains p65 and p50 subunits, while complex II is shifted by the c-Rel antibody (Fig. 1A, right panel). BCR-ABL transformation is dependent on its kinase function and on its ability to utilize Ras-dependent downstream signaling (9Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N.

McLaughlin J. Afar D.E. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 981-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We have previously published that BCR-ABL-induced NFκB activation is dependent on BCR-ABL-induced Ras activation (17Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the remaining experiments, we have focused largely on the ability of oncogenic Ras to modulate TNF-induced NFκB activation. H-RasV12 Blocks TNF-induced IKK Activity—To determine the mechanism by which H-RasV12 inhibits TNF-induced NFκB activation, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation were examined. Control and Ras-transformed MEFs were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF for 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, and whole cell extracts were prepared. These extracts were analyzed for the induction of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. As observed in Fig. 2A, Ras-transformed cells exhibit reduced levels of IκBα phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36 in response to TNF treatment. Consistent with this result, Ras-transformed MEFs exhibit significantly reduced IκBα degradation (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Similar results were also obtained in BCR-ABL-transformed myeloid cells (data not shown). To determine whether other downstream signaling components associated with TNF receptor activation are affected in Ras-transformed cells, we examined the phosphorylation status of c-Jun. In control MEFs, TNF-inducible phosphorylated c-Jun levels were detected. Although phosphorylated c-Jun levels are higher in Ras-transformed cells, TNF stimulation further increases phosphorylated c-Jun (Fig. 2A, lower panel). These data suggest the TNF-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling pathway is not affected in Ras-transformed MEFs. Because IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation are controlled by IKK, the activity of IKK was examined in control and Ras-transformed MEFs. IKK assays were performed by treating MEFs with TNF for the indicated times, harvesting whole cell extracts, and immunoprecipitating the IKK complex with an antibody to IKKγ. The immunoprecipitated complex was then incubated with GST-IκBα as a substrate in an in vitro kinase assay. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis for phospho-IκBα Ser-32/36 was performed. As expected, TNF rapidly activates the IKK complex in control MEFs, whereas no activation of the complex by TNF is observed in Ras-transformed MEFs (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, in Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts with antibodies to phospho-IκBα Ser-32/36 (Fig. 2A), minimal phosphorylation is detected in the H-RasV12-transformed MEFs, whereas the results from the kinase assay suggest that IKK activation was completely blocked (Fig. 2B). One possible explanation is that the IKK assay may not be as sensitive as protein immunoblotting for phosphorylated IκBα. Alternatively, it is possible that another IκB kinase activity, not associated with IKKγ, is activated by TNF and is able to phosphorylate IκB in vivo. Currently, it is proposed that IκBα degradation controls the ability of NFκB to accumulate in the nucleus following cytokine treatment. Therefore we examined whether the inhibition of NFκB in BCR-ABL- and Ras-transformed cells results in a defect in nuclear accumulation of NFκB subunits. Whereas TNF induces nuclear accumulation of p65 in 32D cells, nuclear levels of p65 are very high in unstimulated BCR-ABL-transformed 32D cells and remain high following TNF treatment (Fig. 2C, upper panel). Unexpectedly, the ability of TNF to stimulate nuclear accumulation of the p65 subunit appears unaffected in Ras-transformed cells, whereas nuclear accumulation of c-Rel is blocked (Fig. 2D, lower panel). Nuclear levels of RelB and p52 are unaffected by TNF treatment in control and Ras-transformed MEFs. Overall, these data indicate that IKK-directed IκBα phosphorylation is not required for nuclear accumulation of p65 but is required for optimal NFκB DNA binding activity and gene expression. Alternatively, expression of Ras may bypass this requirement. Notably, basal levels of nuclear NFκB p65 subunit are modestly elevated in Ras-transformed cells and even higher in BCR-ABL-transformed 32D cells, suggesting that in the absence of external stimuli, oncoprotein-induced signaling pathways promote the nuclear accumulation of the p65 subunit. Together these data indicate that oncogenic Ras and BCR-ABL do not inhibit TNF-induced nuclear translocation of p65; however, H-RasV12 does inhibit TNF-induced c-Rel nuclear translocation. H-RasV12 Does Not Inhibit IL-1β-induced NFκB Activation—A variety of different cytokines are known to activate NFκB. To determine whether oncogenic Ras inhibits NFκB activation by other cytokines, control and H-RasV12-transformed MEFs were treated with 5 ng/ml IL-1β for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA and Western blot, respectively. EMSA analysis revealed no defect in IL-1β-induced NFκB DNA binding activity (Fig. 3, upper panel). Furthermore, IL-1β-induced IκBα phosphorylation is equivalent in control and H-RasV12-transformed MEFs (Fig. 3, lower panel). These data suggest that oncogenic Ras specifically inhibits TNF-induced NFκB activation but not IL-1β-induced NFκB activation. The signaling components involved in TNF and IL-1β receptor activation are well established. Although activation of both receptors results in NFκB activation, the signaling molecules that lead to IKK activation are different for these two pathways (29Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The differences in these signaling pathways suggest that oncogenic Ras may inhibit a component of the TNF pathway that does not overlap with the IL-1β pathway. However, Western blot analysis for TNF signaling components (TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, RIP, MEKK3, IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ) shows no changes in protein levels between control and Ras-transformed MEFs (data not shown). Inhibition of TNF-induced NFκB Activation Requires Multiple Ras Effector Pathways—Ras proteins activate a variety of downstream effectors that ultimately lead to activation of transcription factors involved in cellular growth control. The most extensively studied effector pathways of Ras are controlled by PI3 kinase, Raf, and RalGEFs (7Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 8Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that normal rat kidney cells expressing an inducible, constitutively active Raf-1 suppressed TNF- and IL-1β-induced NFκB activation (30Liu Q. Fan J. McMahon M. Prince A.M. Zhang P. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2001; 4: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ras inhibition of TNF signaling could be because of the ability of Ras to activate the Raf-1 kinase pathway. To determine whether the effect observed in Ras-transformed murine fibroblasts is due solely to activated Raf, control and Raf-transformed 3T3 cells were treated with TNF, and NFκB DNA binding potential was analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 4). This experiment demonstrates that NFκB DNA binding is not impaired in Raf-transformed 3T3 cells. In fact, the expression of Raf appears to augment the ability of TNF to activate NFκB as measured by EMSA. These data show Ras activation of Raf is not sufficient to inhibit TNF-induced NFκB DNA binding. To further analyze Ras signaling pathways involved in NFκB inhibition, pharmacological inhibitors of the MEK/Erk and PI3 kinase pathways, PD98059 (PD) and LY294002 (LY), respectively, were used. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of the treated control and Ras-transformed cells were prepared to determine whether the inhibitors have an effect on TNF-induced NFκB DNA binding potential. In control cells the inhibitors have no effect on NFκB DNA binding (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, the PD and LY compounds alone or in combination (data not shown) have minimal effects on NFκB DNA binding potential in Ras-transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 10–12). Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts for phospho-p42/p44 clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the PD compound (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Immunoblotting for phospho-Akt demonstrates that the LY compound is capable of inhibiting TNF-induced phosphorylation of Akt in control MEFs and decreasing basal levels of phospho-Akt in Ras-transformed MEFs. The LY compound, however, does not completely block TNF-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig 4C, lower panel). A slight increase in TNF-induced NFκB DNA binding in Ras-transformed MEFs treated with the LY compound is observed, and further investigation is needed to determine whether complete inhibition of TNF-induced phosphorylation of Akt would further enhance TNF-indu"

Degranulation was stimulated by intracellular application of calcium, and GTPγS or guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate at different concentrations via the patch pipette. Degranulation was quantified by measuring the delay time between the beginning of intracellular perfusion and the first exocytotic event, determining the distribution of time intervals between fusion events and the capacitance step size distributions under the different conditions. The degranulation dynamics could be well reproduced using a computer model assuming three independent rate constants for granule-plasma membrane fusion, granule fusion with already exocytosed granules, and intracellular granule-granule fusion. The rate of granule-plasma membrane fusion is sensitive to both, the GTP analog and [Ca2+]i. The rate of granule-exocytosed granule fusion is sensitive to [Ca2+]i but insensitive to the GTP analogs, and the rate of granule-to-granule fusion is sensitive to the GTP analog but insensitive to [Ca2+]i. Granule fusions with the three different target compartments thus involve different regulatory mechanisms.

Granule fusions with the three different target compartments thus involve different regulatory mechanisms. In many cell types release of preformed materials stored in secretory vesicles or granules occurs by the mechanism of exocytosis, i.e. by fusion of the perigranular membrane with the plasma membrane. Eosinophils play an important role in killing of multicellular parasites (1Butterworth A.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1977; 77: 127-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). After contact with the parasite surface the cytotoxic proteins stored within the secretory granules are released onto the parasite surface. Following adherence the appearance of large cytoplasmic vacuoles was thought to reflect multigranular compounds formed by granule-granule fusion directing the contents of many granules to a single release site (2McLaren D.J. Mackenzie C.D. Ramalho-Pinto J.F. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1977; 30: 105-118PubMed Google Scholar, 3McLaren D.J. Ramalho-Pinto F.J. Smithers S.R.

Using simultaneous fluorescence imaging and whole-cell membrane capacitance measurements and electron microscopy we have shown that in eosinophils focal release of granular contents is achieved by intracellular granule-granule fusion followed by compound exocytosis and also by cumulative fusion of granules with the membrane of a granule that had already fused with the plasma membrane (35Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44920-44927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A number of experiments indicate that in addition to their capability to fuse with the plasma membrane, secretory granules are also able to perform homotypic fusion among themselves. High intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) stimulates fusion among cortical granules from sea urchin eggs (6Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and fusion among chromaffin granules was obtained in the presence of high calcium, annexins, and arachidonic acid (7Drust D. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Fusion among dense core vesicles was observed in pituitary nerve terminals in the presence of 50-100 μm [Ca2+]i (8Lindau M. Rosenboom H. Nordmann J.J. Stjärne L. Greengard P. Grillner S. Hökfelt T. Ottoson D. Molecular and Cellular Mechansisms of Neurotransmitter Release. Raven Press, New York1994: 173-187Google Scholar), and extensive fusion among secretory granules was stimulated by intracellular application of 80-160 μm GTPγS in eosinophils (9Lindau M. Hartmann J. Scepek S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 710: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Granulegranule fusion has recently been directly imaged in pituitary lactotrophs (11Angleson J.K. Cochilla A.J. Kilic G. Nussinovitch I. Betz W.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and patch clamp and amperometric techniques provided evidence for compound exocytosis in neutrophils (13Lollike K. Lindau M. Calafat J. Borregaard N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 973-980PubMed Google Scholar) and β-cells (14Bokvist K. Holmqvist M. Gromada J. Rorsman P. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 634-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Evidence for cumulative fusion of granules with the membrane of previously exocytosed granules has been found in eosinophils (10Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44920-44927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as well as pituitary lactotrophs (12Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and pancreatic acinar cells (15Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the three different types of fusion events occurring during eosinophil degranulation, namely granule-plasma membrane fusion, and granule-granule fusion and granule-fused granule fusion, are differentially controlled by intracellular second messengers and that granule-granule fusion is selectively stimulated by extracellular stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). 1The abbreviations used are: ConA, concanavalin A; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; t-SNARE, target soluble NSF attachment protein receptors. Cell Preparation—Horse eosinophils were isolated from fresh blood from the jugular vein of horses and purified over discontinuous Percoll gradients as described (10Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were suspended in Medium 199 containing 4 mm glutamine, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, and penicillin/streptomycin, pH 7.3-7.4, stored at room temperature, and used within 2-4 days. Patch Clamp Experiments—About 50-100 μl of the cell suspension were transferred into a Petri dish with a coverslip as bottom. After a few minutes to allow the cells to settle on the glass, the dish was perfused with standard external saline (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10-20 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2-7.3). The whole-cell configuration with the contact between the cytosol and the solution inside the micropipette was used to internally perfuse the cells. The internal solution contained 125 mm potassium-l-glutamate, 10 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2-7.3. CaCl2, EGTA, GTPγS, and guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) were varied as follows. For experiments at high intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), the pipette solutions contained 5 mm EGTA and 4.5 mm CaCl2, the resulting [Ca2+]i was calculated to be 1.5 μm. In the solutions with low [Ca2+]i (<10 nm) 7 mm EGTA was added and CaCl2 was omitted. The osmolarity of the external solution was adjusted with D(+)glucose until it exceeded the internal solution by a few mosmol. All experiments were done at room temperature. Capacitance Measurements—The change of cell membrane capacitance was measured as the imaginary component of the admittance change of the cell using a lock-in amplifier and a EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany). Command voltage signal was an 800 Hz, 20 mV (root mean square) sine wave, and the current output signal was analyzed by a 2-phase lock-in amplifier (5210, EG&G PAR, Princeton, NJ) (16Lindau M. Neher E. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and sampled by the computer every 22 ms. After attaining the whole-cell configuration the bulk capacitance of the cell was compensated. During the measurement of the capacitance the phase error of the lock-in was determined using the phase tracking technique (17Fidler N. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1153-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Quantification of Capacitance Changes—The delay, time intervals, and step size ΔCm of a distinct capacitance increase in consequence of a fusion of a granule with the plasma membrane were determined by visual examination of the capacitance traces on the computer screen using cursor lines (Fig. 1). To calculate the percentage of capacitance increase generated by steps in a certain range (bin), the number of steps in that bin was multiplied with the step size corresponding to the center of the bin and divided by the total capacitance increase generated by the sum of all steps in the distribution. Computer Simulation of Degranulation—Computer simulations were performed assuming resting cells with 50 granules, each of them formed by the fusion of 1 to 21 unit granules with a capacitance of 6 fF. The size of the granules, expressed in numbers of fused unit granules, was normally distributed with a maximum at 11 unit granules, similar to the distribution observed experimentally (18Hartmann J. Scepek S. Lindau M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 483: 201-209Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The model uses three different rate constants for granule-plasma membrane fusion (k gp), granule-exocytosed granule fusion (k ge), and intracellular granule-granule fusion (k gg). The individual probability for the fusion of a particular single granule was assumed to be proportional to its membrane area. The granules were polled 6000 times in 150 ms intervals to determine whether a fusion event occurred during this time interval. For each cell the degranulation is therefore simulated for a duration of 15 min. The simulation yields a capacitance trace with steps according to the size of the fused granules and separated by the corresponding time intervals analogous to experimental recordings but free of noise. In addition, the computer program tracks the number of degranulation sacs for each cell. For each set of parameters, k gp, k ge, and k gg, 30 simulations were carried out and the simulated capacitance traces were analyzed to determine delay, time intervals between steps, and step sizes, exactly like the experimental recordings. High [Ca2 + ] i Facilitates Exocytotic Fusion, but Not Granuleto-Granule Fusion—In mast cells (19Fernandez J.M. Neher E. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1984; 312: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), neutrophils (20Nüsse O. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and eosinophils (21Nüsse O. Lindau M. Cromwell O. Kay A.B. Gomperts B.D. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) intracellular application of GTPγS stimulates degranulation. The kinetics of exocytosis is modulated by the intracellular free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i (20Nüsse O. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Nüsse O. Lindau M. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test whether both exocytosis and granule-granule fusion in eosinophils are influenced by [Ca2+]i in the same way, cells were internally dialyzed with pipette solutions containing either 7 mm EGTA ([Ca2+]i < 10 nm) or 5 mm EGTA and 4.5 mm CaCl2 ([Ca2+]i ∼ 1.5 μm) in the presence of GTPγS. To characterize the dynamics of degranulation three parameters were analyzed: i) the delay between patch rupture and the first capacitance step (Fig. 1A), indicating the time between beginning of internal dialysis and the first fusion of a specific granule with the plasma membrane; ii) the time intervals between consecutive capacitance steps indicating the time intervals between exocytotic fusion events (Fig. 1B); and iii) the capacitance step size distributions indicating the extent of granulegranule fusion preceding exocytosis of granules or multigranular compounds (Fig. 1B). The mean delays obtained under the different experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 2A as the shaded bars. At a given GTPγS concentration the delay is about 3-fold longer at low [Ca2+]i than at high [Ca2+]i. The prolongation is 3.1-fold with 20 μm and 2.6-fold with 80 μm GTPγS. The delay also tends to be shorter at the higher GTPγS concentration. Even when the stimulation conditions are kept constant, the delay observed in individual degranulations varied substantially from one cell to another. We formally calculated the standard deviations to quantify the scatter (Fig. 2B , solid lines), although the distributions of delays were not gaussian. The frequency distributions of the time intervals between two subsequent fusion events obtained for the different experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 3A. The distributions decay exponentially, and the corresponding rates of exocytosis were determined by single exponential fits. The time constants at high [Ca2+]i were 4.8 s (exocytotic rate k = 0.21 s-1 at 20 μm GTPγS) and 4.5 s (k = 0.22 s-1 at 80 μm GTPγS). At low [Ca2+]i the time constant was 11.1 s at both GTPγS concentrations (exocytotic rate k = 0.09 s-1 at 20 and 80 μm GTPγS). The exocytotic rate during degranulation is thus independent of the GTPγS concentration but at [Ca2+]i ∼ 1.5 μm the rate of exocytotic fusion events is ∼2.4-fold higher compared with that at [Ca2+]i < 10 nm. As in other secretory systems (24Howell T.W. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and as for transducin (25Yamanaka G. Eckstein F. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6149-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and GS (26Pfeuffer T. Eckstein F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 67: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), another poorly hydrolyzable GTP-analog, Gpp(NH)p, is expected to be also stimulatory but with lower potency. When cells were internally dialyzed with a solution containing Gpp(NH)p complete degranulation was induced as well. However, compared with GTPγS about 10 times higher concentrations of Gpp(NH)p were required to attain similar delays, rates of exocytotic events, and step size distributions (data not shown). Besides exocytotic fusion, GTPγS at high concentrations stimulates intracellular granule-granule fusion as indicated by the occurrence of very large capacitance steps (10Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and as demonstrated directly by fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy (35Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44920-44927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The number and size of large steps depends on the ratio of the rates at which granule-to-granule fusion and exocytotic fusion occur (9Lindau M. Hartmann J. Scepek S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 710: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). If [Ca2+]i had a similar effect on both rates, then the step size distributions should not be affected by [Ca2+]i. However, if [Ca2+]i accelerates only the exocytotic rate and has no effect on the rate of intracellular granule-granule fusion, then the steps should become larger at low [Ca2+]i because more time would remain for the granules to fuse with each other before the compounds fuse with the plasma membrane. Indeed the number of steps <200 fF decreases and more large steps occur in experiments with low [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3B). Simulation of the Degranulation—To determine whether the change in step sizes is quantitatively explained by a [Ca2+]i dependence of the exocytotic rate alone, degranulation was simulated using a model with three distinct rate constants for three different fusion processes (9Lindau M. Hartmann J. Scepek S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 710: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). In this model we allow a granule to fuse either directly with the plasma membrane (rate k gp), with another granule (rate k gg), or with the membrane of an already exocytosed granule (rate k ge). All three rate constants are defined per unit area of membrane such that the probabilities for fusion are proportional to the surface areas of the fusing compartments. Using combined fluorescence imaging and equivalent circuit analysis we have shown that during degranulation of eosinophils a degranulation sac is formed by cumulative fusion events (35Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44920-44927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Granule-plasma membrane fusion is thus a rare event during eosinophil degranulation, and the rate of exocytotic events during degranulation is thus dominated by the rate of granule-exocytosed granule fusion k ge. The delay exclusively depends on the rate k gp because the target compartment for granule-exocytosed granule fusion does not exist before the first exocytotic event occurs. Accordingly, the value of k gp was estimated from the experimentally observed delays. The rate constant k ge for fusion of a granule with already exocytosed granules was deduced from the exocytotic rate that depends on [Ca2+]i. The resulting step size distribution essentially depends only on the ratio of k gg versus the exocytotic rates k ge and k gp. Examples of simulated traces for two different sets of rate constants are shown in Fig. 4B. Due to the stochastic simulation method, each simulated trace was different even when the same set of rate constants was used, just as in experiments where the exact time course of degranulation of one cell is never repeated by a second cell. The simulated traces were statistically analyzed in the same way as the experimentally measured traces. Using the rate constants given in Table I good correspondence between simulated degranulations and the experimental results was obtained for the four different experimental conditions.Table IParameters used to simulate the degranulations[Ca2+]iGTPγSk gpk gek gg<10 nM20 μM3.2 × 10—84.6 × 10—61.1 × 10—61.5 μM20 μM8.2 × 10—81.2 × 10—51.1 × 10—6<10 nM80 μM5.6 × 10—84.6 × 10—61.8 × 10—61.5 μM80 μM1.5 × 10—71.2 × 10—51.8 × 10—6 Open table in a new tab The mean values of the delays occurring in the simulations are shown in Fig. 2A as the unshaded bars. The data are in very good agreement with those obtained from experimental recordings. In addition, also the standard deviations of the delays obtained in the simulations (Fig. 2B , dashed lines) are similar to the experimentally observed standard deviations (solid lines). The frequency distributions of the time intervals between successive capacitance steps in the simulations are shown in Fig. 5A. As for the experimental data, the distributions are well fitted by single exponentials, and the fits gave the same apparent rates as those obtained experimentally (Fig. 3A). Fig. 5B shows the step size distributions obtained in the simulations. As in the experiments, the number of small steps decreases and additional large steps occur in simulations using parameters for low [Ca2+]i. The simulations provide an interesting result. The rate k gg depends only on the GTPγS concentration, k ge depends only on [Ca2+]i, and k gp depends on both [Ca2+]i and GTPγS concentration (Table I). Concanavalin A Stimulates Granule-to-Granule Fusion—Using electron microscopy it was observed that the lectin ConA induces the emergence of large vacuoles inside eosinophils (27Tai P.-C. Spry C.J.F. Br. J. Hematol. 1981; 49: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test if this observation reflects stimulation of granule-togranule fusion in intact cells, we performed capacitance measurements on cells preincubated with ConA. Cells incubated with 20 μg/ml ConA for one hour had an initial capacitance Ci = 3.1 ± 0.4 pF (S.D., n = 19), indistinguishable from that of control cells with Ci = 3.0 ± 0.4 (S.D., n = 27). Thus, the plasma membrane area had not increased during incubation. When the cells were internally dialyzed with a solution containing 5 μm GTPγS ([Ca2+]i ∼ 1.5 μm), the cell capacitance increased by 3.9 ± 0.9 pF (S.D., n = 18), not significantly different from control cells not incubated with ConA (4.0 ± 0.9, S.D., n = 27). These results indicate, that ConA did not stimulate degranulation during the one hour incubation because plasma membrane area did not increase, and the same amount of granules is present inside the cells after incubation with ConA and can be stimulated to be exocytosed by GTPγS. Fig. 6A shows the effect of the ConA incubation on the step size distribution. After incubation with ConA many large steps of up to 700 fF capacitance occur in the presence of only 5 μm GTPγS, whereas at this GTPγS concentration no steps >300 fF were seen in control cells (Fig. 6A). The exocytotic rates determined from the frequency distributions of time intervals between exocytotic events (Fig. 6B) were similar in ConA-treated cells and control cells. These results indicate that ConA does not stimulate exocytosis, but stimulates intracellular granulegranule fusion. The thus formed multigranular compounds then fuse with the plasma membrane, when exocytosis is stimulated by intracellular GTPγS. In eosinophils three different fusion processes of secretory granules have been identified (35Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44920-44927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar): exocytotic fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane, cumulative fusion of granules with the membrane of already exocytosed granules, and intracellular fusion among cytoplasmic granules. The dynamics of degranulation can be well reproduced using a simple model assuming three distinct rate constants for the fusion events with the three different target membranes. We have shown here that the different rate constants are differently affected by [Ca2+]i or the type or concentration of the poorly hydrolyzable GTP analog used. Uniqueness of the Model—The first important question to be asked is if the set of parameters given in Table I is unique or if other values for the different rates under certain experimental conditions would reproduce the data as well. The first parameter is the rate for granule-plasma membrane fusion k gp. This rate alone determines the delay. For a given total area of granule membrane and plasma membrane, which does not vary much among cells, the rates k gp that provide delays in the simulation that agree with the experimentally observed delays are unique. The delays that come from the model are completely independent of the choices for k ge and k gg. The independence of k ge is obvious because the target compartment does not exist before the first fusion event occurs. The reason for the independence of k gg is that the fusion probability for a granule or compound is assumed to be proportional to its total membrane area. Thus, the probability for the first fusion event to occur is the same when all granules are still individual ones or when some or even all of them have fused into a large compound. The rates at which exocytotic events occur, once the first granule or compound was exocytosed, is dominated by the rate k ge. Combined fluorescence imaging and admittance analysis have shown that once exocytosis has occurred, granules preferentially fuse with previously exocytosed granules leading to an enlarging degranulation sac (10Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Hartmann J. Scepek S. Hafez I. Lindau M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44920-44927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The experimentally observed independence of the rate at which exocytotic events occur following the delay of the GTPγS concentration requires that the rate k ge that dominates this parameter is independent of the GTPγS concentration. Again, the exocytotic rate is independent of the degree of granule-granule fusion because the fusion rate of a compound or granule is expected to be proportional to its membrane area. Once these rates are determined, the rate k gg must then be varied such that the observed capacitance step size distributions that are measured under certain experimental conditions are reproduced. This variation must be done without varying k gp and k ge because any variations of these would change the delay or the rate of exocytotic events and these changes cannot be compensated by changes of k gg. The sets of parameters for the rates k gp, k gg, and k ge are thus unique. The only assumption made in the model is that the fusion probability of a granule or compound is proportional to its membrane area. We consider this the most likely possibility because the number of potential fusion sites or fusion machines should be directly proportional to the membrane area. Ca2 + Regulates Granule-Plasma Membrane Fusion and Granule-exocytosed Granule Fusion—[Ca2+]i affects the delay and the time intervals between exocytotic fusion events. This observation fits well with previous results obtained for mast cells and neutrophils where degranulation can also be stimulated by intracellular application of poorly hydrolyzable GTP-analogs, even when [Ca2+]i is buffered below resting levels (20Nüsse O. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Barrowman M.M. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In mast cells the exocytotic rate increases during transient elevations of [Ca2+]i (22Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and in neutrophils the delay becomes longer and the exocytotic rate decreases when [Ca2+]i is buffered below resting levels (23Nüsse O. Lindau M. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to the exocytotic rates k gp and k ge, the rate of intracellular granule-granule fusion k gg is not significantly affected by [Ca2+]i but is strongly dependent on the type and concentration of the GTP analog used. This result is in line with a report showing that in macrophages intracellular granule-phagosome fusion is a calcium-independent event (29Zimmerli S. Majeed M. Gustavsson M. Stendahl O. Sanan D.A. Ernst J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon Exocytosis the Granule Membranes Become Highly Fusogenic—Following the first exocytotic events, granules fuse preferentially with the membrane of already exocytosed granules. In our model, the marked transition in fusion competence, which occurs in the granule membrane upon its exocytosis, is assumed to be instantaneous. Thus, a rapid change must occur, the nature of which remains to be elucidated. Upon exocytotic fusion the granular membrane potential is rapidly discharged and the intragranular milieu changes its pH and composition. This may lead to a change in membrane tension but could also result in specific changes in transmembrane proteins that might be involved in the fusion process. Evidence for cumulative fusion of granules with granules already fused with the plasma membrane has recently been obtained in pituitary lactotrophs (12Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the ribbon synapse (30Parsons T.D. Sterling P. Neuron. 2003; 37: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and pancreatic acini (15Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It was suggested that cumulative granule-fused granule fusion may be dependent on a diffusible factor in the membrane (possibly a t-SNARE) that moves from the plasma membrane to the first fused granule and subsequently into the membrane of other granules fused with the exocytotic structure making the membranes fusion competent (15Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, in eosinophils intracellular homotypic granule-granule fusion does occur indicating that the granules contain functional t-SNAREs and diffusion of a t-SNARE from the plasma membrane into membranes of exocytosed granules may not be required. In fact, granule plasma membrane fusion is a rare event in eosinophils suggesting that the enhanced fusion competence of the membranes of exocytosed granules is not based on t-SNARE diffusion from the plasma membrane. GTPγS Modulates Granule-Plasma Membrane Fusion but Not Granule-exocytosed Granule Fusion—We found that in eosinophils the rate of granule-exocytosed granule fusion is completely insensitive to the type and concentration of GTP analogs. It may be possible that granule fusion with exocytosed granules would even occur in the absence of any poorly hydrolyzable GTP analog, but this possibility could not be tested because in the absence of GTPγS or Gpp(NH)p the target compartment does not exist. If activation of granule-exocytosed granule fusion also involves GTP binding proteins, then these must have much higher sensitivity to the GTP analogs and must thus be different from those GTP binding proteins mediating the rates k gp and k gg. In pituitary lactotrophs, growing exocytotic sites were observed by fluorescence imaging, suggesting that this mechanism may actually involve cumulative fusion (12Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Forskolin, which increases intracellular cAMP, was found to stimulate compound exocytosis whereas granule-plasma membrane fusion was unchanged (12Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This data also points to a differential regulation of granule-plasma membrane fusion and granuleexocytosed granule fusion. Evidence for compound exocytosis and in particular cumulative fusion has come from studies on pancreatic acinar cells (15Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), pituitary lactotrophs (12Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the ribbon synapse (30Parsons T.D. Sterling P. Neuron. 2003; 37: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In all these cell types secretion is directed toward a certain site that is pre-defined by the tissue morphology, and it appears that a mechanism of cumulative fusion effectively targets granular contents to focal sites. In eosinophils focal release is also an important feature of exocytosis for effective parasite killing. In contrast to tissue cells, however, the site of release is not pre-defined in circulating granulocytes but is defined by the stimulus, the contact with the parasite surface. Cumulative fusion thus appears to be a widely conserved mechanism of focal release from several granules in a wide variety of cell types. Intracellular Granule-Granule Fusion Is Modulated by GTP Analogs but Not by Ca2 + —There is clear evidence for homotypic granule-granule fusion and compound exocytosis for several granule types including chromaffin granules (7Drust D. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), sea urchin egg cortical granules (6Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 634-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), granules of pituitary lactotrophs (11Angleson J.K. Cochilla A.J. Kilic G. Nussinovitch I. Betz W.J. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and pancreatic acinar cell zymogen granules (33Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In eosinophils, the rate of granule-granule fusion is not affected by [Ca2+]i but is strongly dependent on the type and concentration of the GTP analog used. It is possible that relocation of SNAP-23 (soluble NSF attachment protein of 23 kD molecular weight) from the cell surface to granule membranes is involved in this mechanism (34Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Homotypic zymogen granule-granule fusion also was found to have a markedly lower Ca2+ sensitivity than zymogen granule-plasma membrane fusion (33Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We found no [Ca2+]i dependence of granule-granule fusion between 10 nm and 1.5 μm in eosinophils. Due to the [Ca2+]i dependence of the exocytotic fusion rates compound exocytosis is actually less prominent at 1.5 μm than at 10 nm [Ca2+]i. The pronounced effects of GTP analogs on granule-granule fusion suggest that the main regulatory mechanisms for granule-granule fusion differs from that of exocytotic fusion. The regulation of granule-granule fusion by GTP-binding proteins may be specific for granulocytes as granule-granule fusion seemed unaffected by GTPγS in alveolar type II cells (32Mair N. Haller T. Dietl P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L376-L382PubMed Google Scholar). What is the functional significance of homotypic fusion among secretory granules in eosinophils? We have shown here that stimulation of intact cells with the lectin ConA induces granule-to-granule fusion without activating exocytosis. ConA presumably exerts its effect via receptor cross-linking in the plasma membrane. The selective activation of granule-granule fusion by a cross-linker suggests that the extent of cross-linking may be the mechanism controlling the degranulation mode. Following adherence of the cell to a large parasite surface, discharge of all granular contents at the attachment site is desirable and massive granule-to-granule fusion followed by exocytosis of the compound would be most efficient to perform this task. In eosinophils homotypic granule-granule fusion thus appears to be an essential cellular process, which may be important in targeting the contents of many secretory granule to a single release site (10Scepek S. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Differential regulation of the different types of fusion events as described here are essential to modulate the degranulation mode depending on the type of stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1968582802,"Isopropyl alcohol dehydrogenase (iPDH) is a dimeric mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), so far detected within the Trypanosomatidae only in the genus Phytomonas. The cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of the two gene alleles of the enzyme revealed that it is a zinc-dependent medium-chain ADH. Both polypeptides have 361 amino acids. A mitochondrial targeting sequence was identified. The mature proteins each have 348 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 37 kDa. They differ only in one amino acid, which can explain the three isoenzymes and their respective isoelectric points previously found. A phylogenetic analysis locates iPDH within a cluster with fermentative ADHs from bacteria, sharing 74% similarity and 60% identity with Ralstonia eutropha ADH.

They are classified into three major categories: NAD(P)-dependent enzymes, NAD(P)-independent enzymes, and irreversible alcohol oxidases. NAD(P)-dependent ADHs are subdivided into groups according to their metal dependence: medium-chain zinc-dependent, short-chain zinc-independent, and iron-activated enzymes (1Reid M.F. Fewson C.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 13-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).Zinc-dependent medium-chain dehydrogenases constitute a large superfamily of enzymes widely found in vertebrates, plants, fungi, and bacteria, including polyol dehydrogenases, threonine dehydrogenase, quinone oxidoreductases, and other proteins (2Persson B. Zigler Jr., J.S. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Currently, they can be divided into tetrameric (as NAD-dependent ADHs from fungi or some bacterial NADP-dependent enzymes) and dimeric NAD-linked ADH families. The last, in turn, are divided into the classes found in vertebrates (I–VII) or plants (III, C and P), according to substrate preference and amino acid identity (3Duester G. Farrés J. Felder M.R. Holmes R.S. Höög J-O. Parés X. Plapp B.V. Yin S-J. Jörnvall H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Shafqat J. El-Ahmad M. Danielsson O.

A. 1996; 93: 5595-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Although it is not uncommon for ADHs to exhibit a broad substrate spectrum, as a rule they are specific either for primary or for secondary alcohols. One interesting exception is the tetrameric multifunctional Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus) ADH. This enzyme is able to use both primary and secondary alcohols, polyols such as 2,3-butanediol, acetaldehyde, acetone, diacetyl, or acetoin as substrates and to use NAD(H) or NADP(H) as cosubstrate (5Steinbüchel A. Schlegel H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Few trypanosomatid ADHs have been described. These are the cytosolic NADPH-linked aldehyde reductases from Leishmania donovani (6Keegan F.P. Blum J.J. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1995; 42: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and Trypanosoma cruzi (7Arauzo S. Cazzulo J.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 58: 283-286Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which use n-propyl alcohol as the preferred substrate or the NADH-dependent ADH from Crithidia fasciculata (8Cazzulo J.J. Franke de Cazzulo B.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 81: 1019-1022Google Scholar). Unfortunately, neither sequence information nor sufficient biochemical data are available to correctly classify these enzymes.We have previously described the purification and characterization of the mitochondrial ADH from Phytomonas, a trypanosomatid isolated from the laticiferous plant Euphorbia characias. It is a dimeric NAD-linked enzyme able to use a broad range of both primary and secondary alcohols. We have named the enzyme isopropyl alcohol dehydrogenase (iPDH) because of its high affinity and specific activity with this substrate (9Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To understand the physiological role of the enzyme and its peculiar properties, we decided to clone the genes and to express the corresponding proteins in a heterologous system. To our knowledge, this is the first trypanosomatid ADH so far sequenced. Both its sequence and kinetic parameters suggest that the Phytomonas iPDH is the result of an event of horizontal gene transfer from a strictly aerobic bacterium to a trypanosomatid. The possible physiological role of this multifunctional ADH is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The Phytomonas strain was isolated in France from E. characias (10Dollet M. Cambrony D. Gargani D. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1982; 295: 547-550Google Scholar). Phenyl-Sepharose and blue Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, d,l-3-hydroxybutanoate, acetoacetate, and N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) were obtained from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Hybond-N nylon membrane was obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Purification of Enzymes—Natural iPDH was purified from 1 liter of Phytomonas culture, as described (9Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, a method was used involving hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose followed by affinity chromatography on blue Sepharose, both at pH 7.8.Enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli were purified from 1 liter of bacterial culture. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Extracts were prepared by using a French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g). Ammonium sulfate and Triton X-100 were added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1 m and 0.05% (w/v), respectively, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g, loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.4 × 25 cm), and equilibrated in 1 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml of the same buffer and then with 50 ml of buffer B (50 mm ammonium sulfate in buffer A) and eluted with a gradient of ethylene glycol from 0 to 70% (v/v) in buffer B (300 ml). Fractions of 7 ml were collected, and those containing activity were pooled. The ethylene glycol concentration was adjusted to 45% (v/v) before loading the pooled active fractions onto a blue Sepharose column (1 × 7 cm) equilibrated with ethylene glycol 45% (v/v in buffer B). The column was washed with the same buffer followed by a 60-ml gradient of NAD+ (0–2 mm).Protein Determination—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.SDS-PAGE—Analytical SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% polyacrylamide gels (w/v) according to Chua (12Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-446Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Protein was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining.Partial Amino Acid Sequence Determination—The mitochondrial iPDH was purified by SDS-PAGE. Bands were cut from the gel, concentrated in an agarose-based gel concentration system, and digested with trypsin (13Rider M.H. Puype M. van Damme J. Gevaert K. de Boeck S. D'Alayer J. Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Peptides were analyzed by nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Briefly, 2 μl of the acidified and desalted trypsin digest was injected to an LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) fitted with a nanoelectrospray probe (14Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). Spectra were taken in full MS and zoom scan mode to determine parent masses and their charge state. Selected peptides were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation to generate tandem mass spectra. Peptide sequences were derived de novo from tandem MS spectra by following the fragmentation paths of y-ion and b-ion series.Cloning and Sequencing of Isopropyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase—Available zinc-dependent medium-chain ADH amino acid sequences were aligned, and two consensus sequences were established. Consensus GHE(G/A)(A/G)G was used to design primer UP2 (5′-ggicaygarggigcigg), and consensus E(V/Y)FIDFT found on fungi ADHs was used for primer DW1 (5′-gtraartcratiaagta). Primer UP1 (5′-gtrccsgtbccsaa) was designed on peptide P1 (DEKPVPVPK) obtained from amino acid sequencing of purified iPDH. A DNA fragment of 600 bp was obtained by PCR on genomic DNA from Phytomonas using primers UP1 and DW1. The fragment was cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), sequenced, and used as a hybridization probe to a Southern blot, which was carried out with Hybond-N membranes on 4 μg of total DNA from Phytomonas sp. digested with different restriction enzymes. A limited genomic library was made with Phytomonas total DNA digested with PstI. After electrophoresis in an agarose gel, a portion of the gel corresponding to the region of 3–4 kb was cut based on Southern blot information, and DNA was recovered by standard procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Recovered genomic fragments were ligated to vector pUC18 digested with PstI and introduced into E. coli XL1 blue by electroporation. 378 colonies were screened by colony hybridization (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the same probe. Two positive clones (215 and 345) were identified and isolated. Plasmid DNA was obtained from them, digested with different restriction enzymes, and subjected to Southern blot analysis using the same probe. Plasmids from clones 215 and 345 were totally or partially sequenced, respectively.Determination of iPDH Isoenzyme Number—Based on bacterial and Phytomonas protein ADH sequence multiple alignment, two highly conserved peptide sequences were selected. The corresponding DNA sequences were used to design oligonucleotides UP3 (5′-atyacsaccaccac) and DW2 (5′-cgcatgcgytcctt). Amplification of genomic DNA from Phytomonas was performed with these primers using total DNA from Sinorhizobium meliloti as a positive control and Trypanosoma brucei and E. coli DNA as negative controls. Amplified fragments from Phytomonas of ∼800 bp were cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector, and eight clones were totally sequenced. Sequences were compared with those from clones 215 and 345.Phylogenetic Analyses—Available zinc-dependent medium-chain ADH protein sequences were aligned with the program ClustalX (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar). Positions with gaps were removed, and pairwise distances were calculated by using a correction for multiple hits and back mutations according to Kimura (17Kimura M. J. Mol. Evol. 1980; 16: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22811) Google Scholar) as implemented in the Protdist program (18Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), Version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out by the neighbor-joining method using the programs Neighbor and Consense (18Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), Version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar) with 10,000 bootstrap samplings, or by maximum likelihood with 1000 quartet puzzle steps using the program TreePuzzle version 5.0 (19Strimmer K. von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2270) Google Scholar) and the JTT matrix as the evolutionary model. Both methods gave similar but not identical tree topologies.Expression in E. coli—Isopropyl alcohol dehydrogenase genes were amplified by PCR from clones 215 and 345 DNA using the oligonucleotide 5′-ggaattccatatgcttcgccgttccacc, which contains a 5′-NdeI artificial restriction site (underlined) followed by 18 nucleotides that correspond to the 5′ end of the genes, and oligonucleotide 5′-cgggatccttatggcttgatagctacctt, which has 21 nucleotides complementary to the 3′ end, including the TAA stop codon and an artificial BamHI restriction site. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned in the pT7–7.1 expression vector (20Allert S. Ernest I. Poliszczak A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and digested with NdeI and BamHI. The sequences were verified before introduction into E. coli BL-21 (DE3) containing the plasmid pCRF1 (21Ferreyra R.G. Soncini F.C. Viale A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1514-1523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown at 30 °C in Luria Bertani medium (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). Expression was induced at an A 600 nm of 0.6 by adding isopropyl, β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and growth was continued overnight.Kinetic Characterization—Dehydrogenases were assayed spectrophotometrically by following the ketone-dependent oxidation of NADH or the alcohol-dependent reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm and 25 °C. Optimal pH and buffers for forward and reverse reactions were used as described previously (9Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min at 25 °C. Relative specific activity with different substrates was referred to that with d-2,3-butanediol for the forward reaction and that with acetoin for the reverse reaction.Gas Chromatography-Mass Analysis—NADH-dependent reduction of acetoacetate (initial concentration = 1 mm) was followed spectrophotometrically, as indicated before, up to the exhaustion of the substrate. The reaction mixture (1 ml) was acidified with 200 μl of 3 n HCl and extracted twice with one volume of ethyl acetate. Organic phases were collected and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Pyridine (100 μl) and BSTFA (100 μl) were added and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h. 1 μl was injected into an AutoSystem XL gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a PE1 column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gas chromatographic analysis was performed at 180 °C isothermically. Gas chromatography-MS was carried out with a TurboMass mass detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) operated at an ionization voltage of 70 eV with a scan range of 20–500 Da. Retention times and mass spectra of peaks were compared with those of standards (Sigma) and information available in the data base NBS75K (National Bureau of Standards).RESULTSPartial Amino Acid Sequence Determination of Purified Mitochondrial iPDH—Mitochondrial iPDH was purified from Phytomonas cells as described (9Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After gel purification, concentration in agarose, and trypsin digestion, peptides were analyzed by nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem MS. This allowed the sequencing of two tryptic peptides (see Fig. 3, P1 and P2). In an initial search of the GenBank™ data base, only peptide P1 showed similarity with ADHs, specially with those from yeasts (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Multiple alignment of zinc-dependent ADHs. A limited number of available sequences and only the relevant regions of high similarity are shown. P1 indicates tryptic peptide P1, obtained from purified Phytomonas iPDH; UP1, UP2, and DW1 indicate regions used to design degenerate oligonucleotides.

This was based on our previous estimation of the subunit relative molecular mass of the purified enzyme (37–40 kDa), its absolute dependence on NAD(H) for enzymatic activity, and the inhibitory effect of Hg2+ (9Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, 2 mm pyrazole completely inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 of 67 μm. Culture media containing 50–100 mm ZnSO4 stimulated the expression of iPDH in Phytomonas (data not shown). These properties are characteristic of zinc-dependent ADHs (22Brändén C-I. Jörnvall H. Eklund H. Furugren B. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol. 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 103-190Google Scholar). Based on this information, a multiple sequence alignment was created with available protein sequences of zinc-dependent ADHs from plants, bacteria, vertebrates, and yeasts. This allowed us to determine two consensus sequences useful for the design of degenerate oligonucleotides (UP2 and DW1). A partial alignment (Fig. 1) indicates the position of these consensus sequences and the region of similarity with peptide P1 on which primer UP1 was based. PCR amplifications on genomic Phytomonas DNA were carried out using these primers. Amplification of a 600-bp fragment was possible only when using UP1 and DW1 as primers. Sequencing the resulting fragment revealed a high similarity with ADHs from a small group of bacteria. This fragment was used as a hybridization probe in a Southern blot of Phytomonas genomic DNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the putative ADH appears to be present in Phytomonas in one copy per haploid genome and is contained in a PstI restriction fragment of 3.5 kb. A limited size library was made by using PstI-restricted genomic DNA and screened by using the same probe. Two positive clones with identical restriction patterns (Fig. 2B) were isolated. The PstI insert of clone 215 was completely sequenced and was found to contain 3493 bp. Only one open reading frame of 1086 bp was detected, which encodes a putative protein of 361 amino acids (allele 1 or iPDH1). A hypothetical N-terminal mitochondrial transit peptide was also detected (Fig. 3). This peptide contains 13 amino acids and has a high content of basic amino acids and a high degree of similarity with other mitochondrial transit peptides reported for trypanosomatids (23Häusler T. Stierhof Y-D. Blattner J. Clayton C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 240-251PubMed Google Scholar). A central region of the 3.5-kb insert of clone 345 (from the first NdeI to the second EcoRI site, Fig. 2B) was sequenced. It contained an open reading frame that is 99% identical to that present in clone 215. The inferred protein (iPDH2) differs only in one amino acid; lysine instead of the glutamic acid at position 60 in iPDH1 (Fig. 3). When the trypanosomatid sequences were compared with the bacterial ADHs, a high degree of similarity was always observed, starting from the methionine at position 14 in the iPDHs. Assuming that Met14 is the N terminus of the mature proteins, the calculated isoelectric points are 6.7 and 7.5 for iPDH1 and iPDH2, respectively, with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. This result is in good agreement with the estimated M r by SDS-PAGE and with pI values obtained for the three dimeric isoenzymes previously isolated from crude extracts of Phytomonas sp. (9Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Southern blot analysis and restriction map of the iPDH genomic region. A, Phytomonas total DNA was digested with the indicated restriction enzymes. After electrophoresis in an agarose gel followed by Southern blotting, membranes were hybridized with a radiolabeled probe consisting of a 600-bp fragment obtained by PCR on genomic DNA using oligonucleotides UP1 and DW1. B, restriction map of the 3.5-kb PstI fragment containing iPDH. The gray rectangle indicates the open reading frame coding for iPDH. The black bar indicates the 600-bp fragment used as a probe.

After PCR amplification on genomic DNA from Phytomonas and cloning of an 800-bp fragment, eight clones were chosen at random and sequenced. Five clones contained a sequence identical to that of allele 1, and three others were identical to allele 2. This result supports the notion that only two allelic variants of iPDH are present in the genome of Phytomonas sp.Phylogenetic Relationship between iPDH and Zinc-dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases—The multiple alignment containing 19 sequences served to create a phylogenetic tree using both distance and maximum likelihood methods (Fig. 4). The Phytomonas iPDH appeared to be robustly monophyletic with the ADHs from Mycoplasma penetrans and several proteobacteria with which it shared between 60 and 66% identical residues. This clustering is supported by the fact that the Phytomonas sequence shared with the other members of this clade the presence of a unique Thr4 tract at positions 67–70 in the alignment, as well as a deletion at position 78. The presence of the Phytomonas sequence within this bacterial clade can only be explained by a horizontal gene transfer event. Interestingly, a similar event of horizontal gene transfer can be observed in the other robust clade (100% supported by bootstrap analysis) of (facultative) anaerobes. Here again, a prokaryote must have provided the ADH1 gene for the anaerobic protists Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica. The two protist enzymes, which share 77% identical residues, also share between 60 and 66% identical residues with the bacterial ADH sequence of this clade.Fig. 4Multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree of ADHs. A multiple alignment of homologous ADH sequences was constructed by using the Phytomonas iPDH, 17 sequences of which were most closely related to the iPDH in a BlastP search and the sequence of Methylobacter marinus formaldehyde dehydrogenase. A, a section from the multiple alignment containing the Thr4 tract (boxed) as present in the Phytomonas iPDH and its eight homologous sequences. B, maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining trees constructed from the complete alignment from which all regions with insertions and deletions were removed. The tree was rooted by using the sequence of M. marinus formaldehyde dehydrogenase as an outgroup. The horizontal bar represents 10 accepted amino acid substitutions per 100 residues. Numbers at the nodes represent quartet-puzzle frequencies (maximum likelihood, 1000 quartet-puzzling steps) and bootstrap values (neighbor-joining method, 10,000 samplings), respectively. Where only one value is given at a branch point, it means that the branch point was not the preferred one in neighbor-joining.

We used an E. coli strain harboring the plasmid pCRF1, which allows the co-expression of the GroESL chaperonin system from Chromatium vinosum (21Ferreyra R.G. Soncini F.C. Viale A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1514-1523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although 80% of the expressed protein was trapped in inclusion bodies, a 2-fold increase in specific activity of iPDH was measured in crude extracts of transformed E. coli/pCRF1 as compared with commonly used E. coli expression strains.Enzymatic Characterization of Bacterially Expressed and Natural iPDH—Enzymes purified from E. coli presented specific activities of 9.7 and 12.5 units/mg of protein for iPDH1 and iPDH2, respectively. Activity with ethanol for iPDH1 and iPDH2 was 20 ± 2- and 11 ± 2-fold less than with isopropyl alcohol, respectively. These respective ratios were highly reproducible and therefore could be useful in isoenzyme identification. For the enzyme purified from cultured Phytomonas, the ratio of isopropyl/ethyl alcohol activity was much more variable and ranged from 15 to 21, which is suggestive of a variable expression level of one or both alleles.The relative specific activity with and affinity for different substrates for both natural and bacterially expressed iPDHs were compared with the data available from the multifunctional fermentative ADH of R. eutropha (5Steinbüchel A. Schlegel H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, a similar pattern of relative activities with the various substrates was found for the Phytomonas and R. eutropha enzymes. Significant differences were found for the reverse reaction only with acetone as substrate, with iPDH showing the higher relative activity. The Phytomonas enzymes also appear to oxidize acetaldehyde, indicating that iPDH is a multifunctional enzyme able to dismutate this substrate, similar to what has been described for the R. eutropha ADH (5Steinbüchel A. Schlegel H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Table IComparison of relative activities among R. eutropha ADH, iPDH purified from Phytomonas, and bacterially expressed iPDHsRelative activitySubstrateR. eutropha ADHPhytomonas iPDHiPDH1iPDH2%ReductionAcetoin100100100100Acetone46.4123106109Acetaldehyde133170124117Diacetyl118.610295111Acetoacetate10911194Oxidationd-2,3-Butanediol100100100100n-Butyl alcohol0.30.1102.4Sec-butyl alcohol257.2240.4273204Isobutyl alcohol94.24.630.1n-Propyl alcohol8.314.110.824.3Isopropyl alcohol114.3190218161Ethanol3.911.11114.6Methanol0.40.650.950.63dl-3-HO-butanoate00.30.270.43Acetoin00.30.10.2Acetaldehyde183.15.01.9 Open table in a new tab The apparent affinities for the various substrates, although more variable, are still comparable.
