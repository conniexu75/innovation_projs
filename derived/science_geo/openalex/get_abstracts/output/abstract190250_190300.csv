https://openalex.org/W1998538734,Current Investigation on the molecular weights of enzymic digests of insulin prompted the redetermination of the sedimentation and diffusion constants of the untreated crystalline protin. This work has given results which differ considerably from the previously published figures for this substance1.

https://openalex.org/W2010409768,"RECENT investigations1 of the mechanism of the transmission of myxomatosis of rabbits by mosquitoes have brought to our attention certain clear-cut differences between the transmission by mosquitoes of those diseases in which a ‘biological cycle’ occurs in the insect vector, and those in which carriage is purely mechanical. Among the animal viruses, it is only in fowlpox2,3 and myxomatosis1,4 that mosquito transmission has been conclusively shown to be mechanical in nature. In all the other mosquito-transmitted virus diseases that have been adequately studied (dengue, yellow fever, the viral encephalitides, and Rift Valley fever), there is a ‘biological cycle’ in the mosquito. Certain implications of these contrasting modes of transmission are summarized in the accompanying table."

https://openalex.org/W2090137355,"DURING the period of proliferation of the embryonic disk of the scorpion (Buthus quinquestriatus (H.E.)), an amnio-serosal fold appears at the anterior periphery (Fig. 1). The posterior margin of the embryonic disk up to this stage does not show any trace of either the serosa or the amnion. This is contrary to the findings of Kowalevsky and Schulgin1, who claimed that the amnio-serosal fold, in Androctonus ornatus, arises simultaneously around the whole margin of the embryonic disk."

https://openalex.org/W2080159755,"THERE are few reports of rat tissue cultures producing growth comparable to that from other mammalian species or from chick explants. Martinovitch1, working with rat pituitary and rat ovary in watch-glass cultures, was able to keep the tissues alive in vitro for a considerable length of time; but cell outgrowth was comparatively slight. Abercrombie and Harkness2 cultured regenerating rat liver. Fibro-blasts or bile duct epithelium rarely grew from normal liver cultures, but appeared sporadically in cultures of regenerating material, the outgrowth varying with the state of liver regeneration. Only lymphocytes and granulocytes occurred in cultures regularly and in similar numbers regardless of the state of regeneration. The only case of rat pituitary tissue producing vigorous growth in vitro is that reported by Haymaker and Anderson3."
