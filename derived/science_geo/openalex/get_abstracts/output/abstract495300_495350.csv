Recently, adoptive T cell therapies have taken advantage of this: T cells specific for mutations in tumors are infused into patients to generate an antitumor immune response. Although therapeutic benefit has been seen for melanomas, effectiveness against more common epithelial tumors is unclear. Using whole-exome sequencing, Tran et al. (p. 641 ) identified tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells specific for a mutated antigen expressed by a tumor from a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. Infusion of this patient with an expanded-population, mutation-specific T cell resulted in tumor regression and stabilization of disease."

https://openalex.org/W2098188264,"Study of monogenic mitochondrial cardiomyopathies may yield insights into mitochondrial roles in cardiac development and disease. Here, we combined patient-derived and genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with tissue engineering to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the cardiomyopathy of Barth syndrome (BTHS), a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutation of the gene encoding tafazzin (TAZ). Using BTHS iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), we defined metabolic, structural and functional abnormalities associated with TAZ mutation. BTHS iPSC-CMs assembled sparse and irregular sarcomeres, and engineered BTHS 'heart-on-chip' tissues contracted weakly. Gene replacement and genome editing demonstrated that TAZ mutation is necessary and sufficient for these phenotypes. Sarcomere assembly and myocardial contraction abnormalities occurred in the context of normal whole-cell ATP levels. Excess levels of reactive oxygen species mechanistically linked TAZ mutation to impaired cardiomyocyte function. Our study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome, suggests new treatment strategies and advances iPSC-based in vitro modeling of cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2040414192,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature in neurodegeneration and aging. We identify mitochondrial dysfunction in xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), a nucleotide excision DNA repair disorder with severe neurodegeneration, in silico and in vivo. XPA-deficient cells show defective mitophagy with excessive cleavage of PINK1 and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. The mitochondrial abnormalities appear to be caused by decreased activation of the NAD(+)-SIRT1-PGC-1α axis triggered by hyperactivation of the DNA damage sensor PARP-1. This phenotype is rescued by PARP-1 inhibition or by supplementation with NAD(+) precursors that also rescue the lifespan defect in xpa-1 nematodes. Importantly, this pathogenesis appears common to ataxia-telangiectasia and Cockayne syndrome, two other DNA repair disorders with neurodegeneration, but absent in XPC, a DNA repair disorder without neurodegeneration. Our findings reveal a nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk that is critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial health."
https://openalex.org/W2078141613,"Upon ligand binding, RIPK1 is recruited to tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) complexes promoting prosurvival and inflammatory signaling. RIPK1 also directly regulates caspase-8-mediated apoptosis or, if caspase-8 activity is blocked, RIPK3-MLKL-dependent necroptosis. We show that C57BL/6 Ripk1(-/-) mice die at birth of systemic inflammation that was not transferable by the hematopoietic compartment. However, Ripk1(-/-) progenitors failed to engraft lethally irradiated hosts properly. Blocking TNF reversed this defect in emergency hematopoiesis but, surprisingly, Tnfr1 deficiency did not prevent inflammation in Ripk1(-/-) neonates. Deletion of Ripk3 or Mlkl, but not Casp8, prevented extracellular release of the necroptotic DAMP, IL-33, and reduced Myd88-dependent inflammation. Reduced inflammation in the Ripk1(-/-)Ripk3(-/-), Ripk1(-/-)Mlkl(-/-), and Ripk1(-/-)Myd88(-/-) mice prevented neonatal lethality, but only Ripk1(-/-)Ripk3(-/-)Casp8(-/-) mice survived past weaning. These results reveal a key function for RIPK1 in inhibiting necroptosis and, thereby, a role in limiting, not only promoting, inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W1987186266,"Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1 is involved in RIPK3-dependent and -independent signaling pathways leading to cell death and/or inflammation. Genetic ablation of ripk1 causes postnatal lethality, which was not prevented by deletion of ripk3, caspase-8, or fadd. However, animals that lack RIPK1, RIPK3, and either caspase-8 or FADD survived weaning and matured normally. RIPK1 functions in vitro to limit caspase-8-dependent, TNFR-induced apoptosis, and animals lacking RIPK1, RIPK3, and TNFR1 survive to adulthood. The role of RIPK3 in promoting lethality in ripk1(-/-) mice suggests that RIPK3 activation is inhibited by RIPK1 postbirth. Whereas TNFR-induced RIPK3-dependent necroptosis requires RIPK1, cells lacking RIPK1 were sensitized to necroptosis triggered by poly I:C or interferons. Disruption of TLR (TRIF) or type I interferon (IFNAR) signaling delayed lethality in ripk1(-/-)tnfr1(-/-) mice. These results clarify the complex roles for RIPK1 in postnatal life and provide insights into the regulation of FADD-caspase-8 and RIPK3-MLKL signaling by RIPK1."
https://openalex.org/W2164550220,"The reprogramming of parental methylomes is essential for embryonic development. In mammals, paternal 5-methylcytosines (5mCs) have been proposed to be actively converted to oxidized bases. These paternal oxidized bases and maternal 5mCs are believed to be passively diluted by cell divisions. By generating single-base resolution, allele-specific DNA methylomes from mouse gametes, early embryos, and primordial germ cell (PGC), as well as single-base-resolution maps of oxidized cytosine bases for early embryos, we report the existence of 5hmC and 5fC in both maternal and paternal genomes and find that 5mC or its oxidized derivatives, at the majority of demethylated CpGs, are converted to unmodified cytosines independent of passive dilution from gametes to four-cell embryos. Therefore, we conclude that paternal methylome and at least a significant proportion of maternal methylome go through active demethylation during embryonic development. Additionally, all the known imprinting control regions (ICRs) were classified into germ-line or somatic ICRs."

https://openalex.org/W2074915491,"A new level of chromosome organization, topologically associating domains (TADs), was recently uncovered by chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques. To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1986429623,"Posttranslational modification of cell-cycle regulators with ubiquitin chains is essential for eukaryotic cell division. Such chains can be connected through seven lysine residues or the amino terminus of ubiquitin, thereby allowing the assembly of eight homogenous and multiple mixed or branched conjugates. Although functions of homogenous chain types have been described, physiological roles of branched structures are unknown. Here, we report that the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) efficiently synthesizes branched conjugates that contain multiple blocks of K11-linked chains. Compared to homogenous chains, the branched conjugates assembled by the APC/C strongly enhance substrate recognition by the proteasome, thereby driving degradation of cell-cycle regulators during early mitosis. Our work, therefore, identifies an enzyme and substrates for modification with branched ubiquitin chains and points to an important role of these conjugates in providing an improved signal for proteasomal degradation."

Aging of the hematopoietic system is associated with many changes, including diminished lymphoid potential, elevated autoimmunity, reduced regenerative potential, and onset of a spectrum of hematopoietic diseases including myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemias. Mounting evidence suggests that aging-associated changes in hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) autonomously contribute to many of these age-related phenotypes through diverse mechanisms involving diminution of regenerative potential (Dykstra et al., 2011Dykstra B.

It has been postulated that tissue-specific stem cells, including HSCs, must possess cyto- and geno-protective mechanisms in order to ensure their long-term functional potential. Consistent with this idea, HSCs are imbued with a number of protective properties that are believed to contribute to the preservation of their activity. For example, the high levels of expression of certain ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including ABCG2, confer xenobiotic efflux activity on HSCs (Krishnamurthy et al., 2004Krishnamurthy P.

The aging dependent exacerbation of functional deficits in several DNA-repair-deficient mice suggested that the physiologic process of aging may be associated with progressive DNA damage accrual in HSCs (Nijnik et al., 2007Nijnik A.

Deficiencies in DNA damage repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age.Nature. 2007; 447: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Indeed, this idea has been supported by immunohistochemical evidence of γH2AX accumulation, an indicator of DNA damage response (DDR), in HSCs isolated from old mice (Rossi et al., 2007aRossi D.J. Bryder D. Seita J. Nussenzweig A. Hoeijmakers J. Weissman I.L. Deficiencies in DNA damage repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age.Nature. 2007; 447: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) and aged humans (Rübe et al., 2011Rübe C.E. Fricke A. Widmann T.A. Fürst T. Madry H. Pfreundschuh M. Rübe C. Accumulation of DNA damage in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during human aging.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17487Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that diminished DNA repair capacity may underlie this age-associated DNA damage accrual (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers S.M. Shaw C.A. Gatza C. Fisk C.J. Donehower L.A. Goodell M.A. Aging hematopoietic stem cells decline in function and exhibit epigenetic dysregulation.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e201Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, Rübe et al., 2011Rübe C.E.

Accumulation of DNA damage in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during human aging.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17487Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), although this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Herein, we present direct evidence of DNA damage accumulation in HSCs during aging. We report that, among diverse hematopoietic progenitor cells, age-associated DNA damage accrual measured by comet assays of DNA strand breaks is greatest within the HSC compartment. However, when HSCs are brought into cycle, the accrued damage does not result in measurable cell death, inability to produce hematopoietic colonies in vitro, or failure to reconstitute blood cells in vivo. Utilizing microarray expression analysis, we show that multiple DDR and repair pathways are broadly attenuated in quiescent, but not cycling, HSCs. We show that HSCs stimulated to enter cell-cycle upregulate multiple DNA response and repair pathways and concomitantly repair accumulated DNA damage. Altogether, our results refute the doctrine that HSCs are uniquely geno-protected during aging and instead demonstrates that stem cell quiescence attenuates DNA repair and response pathways in HSCs leading to DNA damage accumulation in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment during aging. Immunostaining of γH2AX in human and murine hematopoietic progenitors has provided indirect evidence that DNA strand breaks may accrue in HSCs during aging (Rossi et al., 2007aRossi D.J. Bryder D. Seita J. Nussenzweig A. Hoeijmakers J. Weissman I.L. Deficiencies in DNA damage repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age.Nature. 2007; 447: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, Rübe et al., 2011Rübe C.E. Fricke A.

However, it remains possible that the observed γH2AX foci in aged stem cells may mark cellular processes distinct from DNA damage. Therefore, we sought to directly evaluate and quantify DNA damage in HSCs and progenitors during aging. To this end, we used alkaline comet assays (Figure S1 available online) (Olive and Banáth, 2006Olive P.L. Banáth J.P. The comet assay: a method to measure DNA damage in individual cells.Nat.

A simple technique for quantitation of low levels of DNA damage in individual cells.Exp.

HSCs subjected to gamma irradiation were assayed in parallel as a positive control. Analysis of the two most reliable DNA damage measurements, Olive moment and percent tail DNA (Kumaravel and Jha, 2006Kumaravel T.S. Jha A.N. Reliable Comet assay measurements for detecting DNA damage induced by ionising radiation and chemicals.Mutat. Res. 2006; 605: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), showed significantly elevated levels of DNA damage in HSCs purified from old mice in comparison to young HSCs (Figures 1B and 1C). These data were verified in six independent experiments in which a cumulative total of 4,940 young and 3,186 old HSCs with the immunophenotype of LSKCD34−Flk2− were scored in a blinded fashion. In two additional experiments, we assayed comets of over 2,000 young and old HSCs purified with an alternative cell-surface marker combination for HSCs: LSKCD150+CD48− (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). In all experiments, a highly significant increase in DNA breaks was observed in old HSCs (Table S1). Interestingly, we consistently observed that young HSCs are not impervious to DNA damage, and 33% showed evidence of single- or double-strand breaks, defined here as having greater than 10% DNA in their comet tails (Figures 1C and S1). In contrast, ∼70% of old HSCs scored as damaged (Figure 1C). Furthermore, tail DNA analysis revealed that, although young and old HSCs showed comparable frequencies of cells presenting evidence of modest DNA damage (classified as 10%–30% tail DNA), cells showing evidence of significant DNA damage (>30% tail DNA) were much more prevalent in HSCs purified from old (42%) in comparison to young (9%) mice (Figure 1C). Nonetheless, the fact that over 30% of old HSCs showed no evidence of strand breaks indicates that the HSC population as a whole does not comprehensively accrue strand breaks during aging. To address the specificity of aging-associated damage in hematopoietic progenitor cells, we analyzed strand breaks in HSCs in comparison to their downstream progenitor progeny from young and old mice. Purified multipotent (MPPFlk2− and MPPFlk2+) and oligopotent progenitors (granulocyte-macrophage progenitor [GMP] and common lymphoid progenitor [CLP]), along with HSCs, were analyzed in single-cell comet assays. Analysis of the Olive tail moment of each downstream progenitor populations in comparison to HSCs isolated from young mice showed no significant differences (Figures 2A and 2B ), although CLPs displayed slightly elevated Olive tail moments, possibly because of immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity and joining gene segment rearrangements actively occurring in this population. Consistent with this, the percent tail DNA of the young progenitor populations and HSCs was comparable, and the majority of scored cells (>70% in all populations) had no measurable DNA damage (<10% tail DNA; Figure 2C). In contrast, analysis of these same stem and progenitor populations from old mice (Figure 2D) demonstrated that the amount of damage accrued in the HSC compartment was significantly greater in comparison to all of the downstream progenitors by either Olive tail moment (Figure 2E) or percent tail DNA (Figures 2F and S2A). Furthermore, we analyzed the Olive tail moment of the stem and progenitor populations by comparing cells isolated from young to those purified from old mice. As we observed previously (Figure 1B), HSCs from old mice consistently showed a significant increase of DNA breaks in comparison to young (Figures S2B and S2C). Interestingly, despite the fact that all progenitor populations from old mice showed significantly reduced levels of DNA damage in comparison to aged HSCs (Figures 2E and S2A), the majority of these aged progenitors nonetheless showed evidence of significantly greater levels of DNA breaks than their young counterparts (Figures S2B and S2C). Altogether, these experiments show that HSCs and their progenitors accumulate DNA breaks during aging, yet the greatest amount of damage accrual is found within the stem cell compartment. To establish whether old damaged HSCs could resolve accrued DNA damage, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify young and old HSCs and assayed them for strand breaks by comet assays either immediately after purification (steady state) or 24 hr after culturing them in a cytokine-rich media, which stimulates the quiescent cells into cycle. As we previously observed (Figures 1, 2, and S2), HSCs at steady state from both young and old mice presented evidence of DNA breaks with significantly more damage observed in the old HSCs (Figure 3A). However, young and old HSCs assayed 24 hr postculture stimulation showed very similar comet profiles, and the old cells showed significantly reduced numbers of damaged cells in comparison to steady state (Figure 3A). To examine how old damaged HSCs would respond to induced cycling in vivo, we injected aged animals with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an agent that kills cycling cells (Van Zant, 1984Van Zant G. Studies of hematopoietic stem cells spared by 5-fluorouracil.J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and drives the quiescent HSCs into cycle (Harrison and Lerner, 1991Harrison D.E. Lerner C.P. Most primitive hematopoietic stem cells are stimulated to cycle rapidly after treatment with 5-fluorouracil.Blood. 1991; 78: 1237-1240PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were dosed two times at 3-week intervals, and, 3 weeks after the final 5-FU injection, the animals were sacrificed, HSCs were purified, and alkaline comet assays performed. These experiments revealed that old HSCs driven into cycle by this treatment showed a significant decrease in the levels of DNA damage in comparison to aged control HSCs derived from mice that received PBS injections (Figure 3B). However, it is possible that the 5-FU may differentially affect damaged HSCs, so we performed an additional in vivo experiment whereby we competitively transplanted 100 HSCs purified from either young or old mice into lethally irradiated recipients and performed comet assays 12 months posttransplant. This analysis showed no significant differences in the DNA damage burden of HSCs derived from either the young or old donor HSCs (Figure 3C). This suggests that HSCs driven into cycle by transplantation repaired their accumulated DNA damage, resetting both the young and old HSCs to a nondamaged status, and that both young and old HSCs acquired similar levels of DNA damage over the time course of the experiment. Nonetheless, examination of donor-derived reconstitution from old HSCs was significantly lower in comparison to the young HSCs with a marked myeloid bias lineage output (Figure S3), which was consistent with previous reports (Beerman et al., 2013Beerman I. Bock C. Garrison B.S. Smith Z.D. Gu H. Meissner A. Rossi D.J.

The combined results of these experiments demonstrating reduced amounts of DNA damage in aged cells stimulated to cycle could be explained by two possibilities: (1) DNA breaks accrued at steady state were repaired upon entry into cycle or (2) damaged HSCs underwent apoptosis and were not scored poststimulation. To discriminate between these possibilities, we quantified the rate of apoptotic attrition of young and old HSCs at a single-cell level after stimulation into cycle. To this end, we cloned sorted HSCs from young (318 cells) and old (337 cells) mice and scored their viability 24 hr postplating (Table S2). These experiments revealed that all HSCs survived the first 24 hr in culture regardless of age (Figure 4A). These data support the idea that old HSCs repair accrued strand breaks upon entry into cycle and do not undergo cell death during the first 24 hr poststimulation. To further investigate the clonal potential of young and old HSCs, we continued to assay viability and cell division kinetics over 6 days of culturing (Figures 4A–4C) and then scored their colony-forming potential on day 12 (Figures 4D and 4E). Over the 12-day course of the experiment, each of the 318 young HSCs assayed survived (Figures 4A and 4B) and underwent division by 48 hr (Figure 4C), with the majority of single HSCs giving rise to colonies of >30 cells by day 6 (Figure 4B) and large colonies by day 12 (Figure 4D). Old HSCs exhibited a similar cell division kinetic (Figure 4C), with the majority of clones giving rise to colonies of >30 cells by"
https://openalex.org/W2074114726,"The global shortening of messenger RNAs through alternative polyadenylation (APA) that occurs during enhanced cellular proliferation represents an important, yet poorly understood mechanism of regulated gene expression. The 3' untranslated region (UTR) truncation of growth-promoting mRNA transcripts that relieves intrinsic microRNA- and AU-rich-element-mediated repression has been observed to correlate with cellular transformation; however, the importance to tumorigenicity of RNA 3'-end-processing factors that potentially govern APA is unknown. Here we identify CFIm25 as a broad repressor of proximal poly(A) site usage that, when depleted, increases cell proliferation. Applying a regression model on standard RNA-sequencing data for novel APA events, we identified at least 1,450 genes with shortened 3' UTRs after CFIm25 knockdown, representing 11% of significantly expressed mRNAs in human cells. Marked increases in the expression of several known oncogenes, including cyclin D1, are observed as a consequence of CFIm25 depletion. Importantly, we identified a subset of CFIm25-regulated APA genes with shortened 3' UTRs in glioblastoma tumours that have reduced CFIm25 expression. Downregulation of CFIm25 expression in glioblastoma cells enhances their tumorigenic properties and increases tumour size, whereas CFIm25 overexpression reduces these properties and inhibits tumour growth. These findings identify a pivotal role of CFIm25 in governing APA and reveal a previously unknown connection between CFIm25 and glioblastoma tumorigenicity."

We analyzed 89 complete genomes of polar bear and brown bear using population genomic modeling and show that the species diverged only 479-343 thousand years BP. We find that genes on the polar bear lineage have been under stronger positive selection than in brown bears; nine of the top 16 genes under strong positive selection are associated with cardiomyopathy and vascular disease, implying important reorganization of the cardiovascular system. One of the genes showing the strongest evidence of selection, APOB, encodes the primary lipoprotein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL); functional mutations in APOB may explain how polar bears are able to cope with life-long elevated LDL levels that are associated with high risk of heart disease in humans."

Here we show that the mtROS signal is relayed by the conserved, mitochondria-associated, intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway (CED-9/Bcl2, CED-4/Apaf1, and CED-3/Casp9) triggered by CED-13, an alternative BH3-only protein. Activation of the pathway by an elevation of mtROS does not affect apoptosis but protects from the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction by triggering a unique pattern of gene expression that modulates stress sensitivity and promotes survival. In vertebrates, mtROS induce apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway to protect from severely damaged cells. Our observations in nematodes demonstrate that sensing of mtROS by the apoptotic pathway can, independently of apoptosis, elicit protective mechanisms that keep the organism alive under stressful conditions. This results in extended longevity when mtROS generation is inappropriately elevated. These findings clarify the relationships between mitochondria, ROS, apoptosis, and aging.

This results in extended longevity when mtROS generation is inappropriately elevated. These findings clarify the relationships between mitochondria, ROS, apoptosis, and aging. The observed association of the aging process with the biology of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular ROS originating from mitochondria (mtROS), has led to the formulation of the oxidative stress theory of aging. Recently, however, more nuanced interpretations have been proposed to explain the basic observations that led to the formulation of the theory (Lapointe and Hekimi, 2010Lapointe J. Hekimi S. When a theory of aging ages badly.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Sena and Chandel, 2012Sena L.A. Chandel N.S. Physiological roles of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 158-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). One possibility is that ROS damage is not causally involved in the aging process but that ROS levels are correlated with the aged phenotype because they modulate signal transduction pathways that respond to cellular stresses brought about by aging (Hekimi et al., 2011Hekimi S. Lapointe J. Wen Y. Taking a “good” look at free radicals in the aging process.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 569-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In other words, ROS generation may be enhanced by the aging process because, in their role as signaling molecules, ROS help to alleviate the cellular stresses caused by aging. This hypothesis is supported by findings in a variety of organisms, in particular in C. elegans where changes in ROS generation or detoxification can be uncoupled from any effect on lifespan (Doonan et al., 2008Doonan R.

In addition, the pro-longevity effects of both dietary restriction (Schulz et al., 2007Schulz T.J. Zarse K. Voigt A. Urban N. Birringer M. Ristow M. Glucose restriction extends Caenorhabditis elegans life span by inducing mitochondrial respiration and increasing oxidative stress.Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), and reduced insulin signaling in C. elegans (Zarse et al., 2012Zarse K.

Such observations are not limited to C. elegans. For example, mtROS signaling can act to extend chronological lifespan of the yeast S. cerevisiae (Pan et al., 2011Pan Y. Schroeder E.A. Ocampo A.

The longevity phenotype of isp-1(qm150) (Feng et al., 2001Feng J. Bussière F. Hekimi S. Mitochondrial electron transport is a key determinant of life span in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and nuo-6(qm200) (Yang and Hekimi, 2010bYang W. Hekimi S. Two modes of mitochondrial dysfunction lead independently to lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans.Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) mutants is most unequivocally connected to mtROS generation (Yang and Hekimi, 2010aYang W. Hekimi S. A mitochondrial superoxide signal triggers increased longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). isp-1 encodes the “Rieske” iron sulfur protein, one of the major catalytic subunits of mitochondrial complex III, and nuo-6 encodes the mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFB4. The qm150 and qm200 mutations are missense mutations that do not lead to a full loss of protein function. Mitochondria isolated from both mutants show elevated superoxide generation, as measured by fluorescence sorting of purified mitochondria incubated with the dye MitoSox (Yang and Hekimi, 2010aYang W. Hekimi S. A mitochondrial superoxide signal triggers increased longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This is a very specific phenotype that is not accompanied by an increase in overall mitochondrial oxidative stress, nor by a measurable increase in overall oxidative damage. The long-lived phenotype can also be phenocopied by treatment of the wild-type with a very low level (0.1 mM) of the superoxide generator paraquat (PQ). In contrast, treatment of the mitochondrial mutants with PQ has no effect, suggesting that treatment with PQ extends lifespan by the same mechanisms as the mitochondrial mutations (Yang and Hekimi, 2010aYang W. Hekimi S. A mitochondrial superoxide signal triggers increased longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Increased longevity can also result from induction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein stress response (mtUPR), which can be triggered by RNA interference knockdown of mitochondrial components (Dillin et al., 2002Dillin A. Hsu A.L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C.

Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). This response is however distinct from the response to elevated mtROS as the lifespan increases produced by the elevated mtROS in the mutants and by the activated mtUPR are fully additive (Yang and Hekimi, 2010bYang W. Hekimi S. Two modes of mitochondrial dysfunction lead independently to lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans.Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). How might elevated mtROS promote longevity? ROS are well known to act as modulators in signal transduction pathways, and it is as such that they might be enhancing longevity. One candidate signaling pathway that could include potential mtROS sensors as well as a mechanism of downstream signaling is the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Apoptosis is a highly controlled process that in mammals is sensitive to mitochondrial function, including mtROS, via the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway (Wang and Youle, 2009Wang C. Youle R.J. The role of mitochondria in apoptosis∗.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). In C. elegans the intrinsic apoptotic machinery consists of the BH3-only protein EGL-1, CED-9 (Bcl2-like), CED-4 (Apaf1-like), and CED-3 (Casp9-like). CED-9 is tethered to the outer mitochondrial membrane and binds CED-4. However, in contrast to vertebrates, there is no evidence for any role for mtROS in regulating apoptosis in C. elegans. Interestingly, the individual proteins or pairs of interacting proteins of the apoptotic signaling machinery appear to be able to carry out apoptosis-independent functions. For example, EGL-1 and CED-9 affect mitochondrial dynamics (Lu et al., 2011Lu Y. Rolland S.G. Conradt B. A molecular switch that governs mitochondrial fusion and fission mediated by the BCL2-like protein CED-9 of Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: E813-E822Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), CED-4 and CED-3 promote neuronal regeneration (Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012Pinan-Lucarre B. Gabel C.V. Reina C.P. Hulme S.E.

Patel A.M. Scott B.A. Crowder C.M. Hypoxic preconditioning requires the apoptosis protein CED-4 in C. elegans.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1954-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and S-phase checkpoint regulation (Zermati et al., 2007Zermati Y. Mouhamad S. Stergiou L. Besse B. Galluzzi L. Boehrer S. Pauleau A.L. Rosselli F. D’Amelio M. Amendola R. et al.Nonapoptotic role for Apaf-1 in the DNA damage checkpoint.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 624-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These and similar findings in other organisms (Galluzzi et al., 2008Galluzzi L. Joza N. Tasdemir E. Maiuri M.C. Hengartner M. Abrams J.M. Tavernarakis N. Penninger J. Madeo F. Kroemer G. No death without life: vital functions of apoptotic effectors.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) suggest that the proteins of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway have bona fide signal transduction activities in other processes. However, in no case to date has the full pathway, from a BH3-only protein to a caspase, been found to be involved in a process distinct from apoptosis. Here, we show that the isp-1 and nuo-6 mutations and 0.1 mM PQ treatment induce a unique pattern of changes in gene expression. Strikingly, we found that mutations in the conserved intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway (ced-9, ced-4, and ced-3) suppress the longevity of isp-1 and nuo-6 mutants, independently of inhibition of apoptosis. Moreover, unlike apoptosis, which requires the BH3-only protein EGL-1, the suppression of isp-1 and nuo-6 requires the BH3-only protein CED-13, which is not required for apoptosis. Treatment with PQ can bypass the need for CED-13, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS acts directly on activation of the pathway, possibly by acting on CED-9 and CED-4, which are associated with mitochondria. Loss of apoptotic signaling also suppresses most of the other phenotypes of isp-1 and nuo-6, such as slow development, slow behaviors, altered gene expression, and sensitivity to heat, but not the primary defects of low oxygen consumption and low ATP levels. The finding that the hypometabolic and hypersensitive phenotypes can be suppressed at the same time as longevity, without suppression of the low oxygen consumption and ATP concentration, indicates that these phenotypes are actively induced by mtROS to protect from mitochondrial dysfunction. The effects of isp-1(qm150) and nuo-6(qm200) mutations on longevity are not additive, and a low dose of PQ (0.1 mM) increases the lifespan of the wild-type, but not of either of the mutants, (Yang and Hekimi, 2010aYang W.

Hekimi S. Two modes of mitochondrial dysfunction lead independently to lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans.Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that a common mechanism underlies the increased longevity in all three conditions. To test this further, we used Affymetrix C. elegans microarrays to characterize patterns of gene expression in the two mutants and in wild-type PQ-treated worms. The lists of genes with significantly altered expression overlap considerably (Table S1 available online); 621 genes were upregulated and 1,161 were downregulated in all three conditions (Figure 1A). This confirms that PQ treatment and the two mutations induce common changes in worm physiology. However, the only feature revealed by Gene Ontology (GO)-term analysis was a downregulation of large families of kinases and phosphatases whose expression is linked to the production of sperm (Reinke et al., 2000Reinke V. Smith H.E. Nance J. Wang J. Van Doren C. Begley R. Jones S.J. Davis E.B. Scherer S. Ward S. Kim S.K. A global profile of germline gene expression in C. elegans.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). GO-term analysis did not reveal any obvious pattern pointing to a specific biological process that could be responsible for the slow aging phenotype (Table S2). In particular, the list of genes upregulated in all three conditions is not significantly enriched in ROS-detoxifying activities or ROS-damage repair activities (Table S3). This strongly suggests that the longevity increase under the three conditions is not the result of an over-compensatory increase in oxidative defenses in response to increased levels of mtROS. We compared the lists of gene with similar lists obtained by genome-wide expression studies of other mutants and treatments related to the aging process (Table S4). The overlaps were from 1% to 20% for upregulated genes and from 0% to 33% for downregulated genes. The highest overlap was with the short-lived gas-1(fc21) mutant. Although gas-1 is short-lived, it encodes a subunit of a mitochondrial complex I, which is likely the source of the similarities. However, the comparison did not identify a particular process by GO-term analysis (Table S2). Finally, in contrast to a recent study in yeast where mitochondrial ROS signaling ultimately resulted in the specific silencing at subtelomeric loci (Schroeder et al., 2013Schroeder E.A. Raimundo N. Shadel G.S. Epigenetic silencing mediates mitochondria stress-induced longevity.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 954-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we found a uniform distribution of the downregulated loci across all chromosomes (Figure S1). Taken together our findings suggest that the pattern of gene expression induced by elevated mtROS is unique, which is consistent with the observation that PQ treatment is fully or partially additive to the pro-longevity effects of mutations in daf-2, eat-2, and clk-1, and is not fully suppressed by mutations in daf-16, aak-2, wwp-1, hif-1, skn-1, or hsf-1 (Yang and Hekimi, 2010aYang W. Hekimi S. A mitochondrial superoxide signal triggers increased longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the relevance for lifespan of the observed changes in gene expression, we focused on a small group of genes. The possibility that genome instability is important in determining lifespan remains a strong hypothesis in biogerontology. Furthermore, there are strong links between DNA damage and general stress responses (Ermolaeva et al., 2013Ermolaeva M.A. Segref A. Dakhovnik A. Ou H.L. Schneider J.I. Utermöhlen O. Hoppe T. Schumacher B. DNA damage in germ cells induces an innate immune response that triggers systemic stress resistance.Nature. 2013; 501: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We tested 16 upregulated genes belonging to this group (Figures 1B, S2 and S3). All numerical values and statistics for survival data presented in the paper are provided in Table S5. The knockdown of 3 of the genes in isp-1 mutants only had a very small effect on lifespan. The knockdown of the 13 other genes had a much larger effect on the mutant than on the wild-type and the knockdown of 7 of these had virtually no effect on the wild-type but strongly suppressed the longevity of the mutants (Figures 1B, S2 and S3). The fact that the knockdown of at least some of the upregulated genes limits the longevity of isp-1 without affecting the wild-type strongly suggest that at least some and probably many of the changes in gene expression we observed are necessary for the longevity resulting from mtROS signaling.Figure S3Additional RNAi Experiments of Genes Found to Be Downregulated in isp-1, nuo-6 and Treatment with Paraquat Suppresses isp-1 Lifespan, Related to Figure 1Show full captionNumerical values and statistical analyses for all lifespan experiments are presented in Table S5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Numerical values and statistical analyses for all lifespan experiments are presented in Table S5. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which uses conserved signaling proteins, is physically associated with mitochondria, and in vertebrates is sensitive to mitochondrial oxidative stress. We therefore tested whether this pathway was involved in the pro-longevity signal in worms by scoring the lifespan of double mutants of isp-1 and nuo-6 with ced-9gf, ced-4, and ced-3 mutations (Figures 2A–2B, S4A–S4D ). The mutations in all three ced genes significantly suppressed the longevity of both isp-1 and nuo-6, without having any significant effects on lifespan by themselves. The suppression by ced-4(n1162) was consistently the most robust. The suppression by ced-9(n1950) was somewhat less effective, possibly because it is a gain-of-function allele and might therefore not be fully equivalent to a loss of ced-4(n1162). The somewhat lesser suppression by ced-3(n717) suggests that CED-4 recruits other effectors as well.Figure S4ced Mutants Suppress isp-1 and nuo-6 Lifespan but Do Not Affect Other Longevity Pathways, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) ced-9(n1950 gf) suppresses isp-1 and nuo-6 lifespan.(C and D) ced-3(n717lf) partially suppresses isp-1 and nuo-6 lifespan.(E and F) Lifespan extension by RNAi against isp-1 and nuo-6.

Numerical values and statistical analyses for all lifespan experiments are presented in Table S5. We tested possible effects of ced-4 on other lifespan mutants that had previously been shown to be genetically distinct from isp-1/nuo-6, including eat-2, clk-1, daf-2, and glp-1. For this, we tested lifespan in double-mutant combination with ced-4, but no effects on the lifespan of these mutants were detected (Figures S4E–S4H). In addition, previous findings had suggested that RNAi against subunits of the ETC prolong lifespan by a mechanism that is distinct from that of the genomic mutants isp-1 and nuo-6 (Yang and Hekimi, 2010bYang W. Hekimi S. Two modes of mitochondrial dysfunction lead independently to lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans.Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We therefore tested RNAi against isp-1 and nuo-6 on ced-4 mutants and, as predicted, ced-4 did not suppress the longevity induced by the RNAi treatments (Figures S4I and S4J). We conclude that the intrinsic apoptotic signaling machinery uniquely mediates the longevity of isp-1 and nuo-6. As ced-9gf, ced-4, and ced-3 affect apoptosis, we scored embryonic and pharyngeal apoptosis in isp-1 and nuo-6 mutants as well as in ced-4, isp-1 ced-4, and nuo-6;ced-4 double mutants (Table S6). The pattern of apoptosis in the mitochondrial mutants was indistinguishable from the wild-type, and the pattern of apoptosis in the double mutants with ced-4 was indistinguishable from that produced by the ced-4 mutation alone, that is, most cell deaths were eliminated. These findings indicated that isp-1 and nuo-6 do not affect normal or mutant apoptosis, but they cannot establish whether the normal pattern of apoptosis is necessary for the mutants’ increased longevity. For this we turned to the BH3-only protein EGL-1, which is required for all apoptosis in C. elegans. We scored both apoptosis and lifespan in egl-1 mutants as well as in egl-1;isp-1 and egl-1;nuo-6 double mutants. As expected, the egl-1 mutation, like the ced-4 mutation, abolished apoptosis in all three genotypes (Table S6). However, in contrast to ced-4, ced-9, and ced-3, egl-1 had no effect at all on lifespan (Figures 2C and 2D). Thus it is not the absence of apoptosis in the intrinsic pathway mutants that suppresses the lifespan of the mitochondrial mutants. For canonical apoptotic signaling, the intrinsic pathway requires stimulation by a BH3-only protein. CED-13 is the only other protein in C. elegans to possess a BH3 domain (Schumacher et al., 2005Schumacher B. Schertel C. Wittenburg N. Tuck S. Mitani S. Gartner A. Conradt B. Shaham S. C. elegans ced-13 can promote apoptosis and is induced in response to DNA damage.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CED-13 has been shown to be able to have some effect on somatic apoptosis when overexpressed and is also able to interact with CED-9 in vitro in a way that is similar to that of EGL-1 (Fairlie et al., 2006Fairlie W.D. Perugini M.A. Kvansakul M. Chen L. Huang D.C. Colman P.M. CED-4 forms a 2 : 2 heterotetrameric complex with CED-9 until specifically displaced by EGL-1 or CED-13.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, loss of CED-13 has very limited effects and only on DNA damage-induced germline apoptosis. We found however that the ced-13(sv32) mutation suppressed the longevity of isp-1 and nuo-6 mutants as efficiently as the mutations in the genes of the core pathway (Figures 2E and 2F). We verified whether CED-13 acted indeed in the same pathway as the other CED proteins by testing whether the effects of ced-13(sv32) were additive to those of ced-4(n1162) for suppression of the lifespan of isp-1. We found that the lifespan of the triple mutants isp-1 ced-4;ced-13 and nuo-6;ced-4;ced-13 were indistinguishable from those of the double mutants isp-1 ced-4 and nuo-6;ced-4, respectively (Figures 2G and 2I), indicating that ced-13 acts in the same pathway as ced-4. As expected, egl-1 had no effect either in triple combinations (Figures 2H and 2J). Thus, rather than EGL-1, CED-13 is the BH3-only protein that is required for pro-longevity signaling through the intrinsic pathway. We first determined if treatment with 0.1 mM PQ (which does lengthen wild-type lifespan) or with 0.5 mM PQ (which is too toxic to lengthen wild-type lifespan) had any effect on apoptosis (Table S6). No effect was found at either concentration, which is consistent with mtROS being capable of regulating the CED-13-dependent activation of the pathway and not apoptosis. We then treated mutants of all four genes (ced-13, ced-9gf, ced-4, and ced-3) with 0.1 mM PQ. The effect of PQ on lifespan was almost completely suppressed by ced-4 and ced-9, partially by ced-3 but not at all by ced-13 and egl-1 (Figure 3). This suggested that PQ (and thus mtROS) act downstream of CED-13. As the ced-13 mutation is capable of suppressing the lifespan of isp-1 and nuo-6 mutants, its inability to suppress the longevity induced by PQ suggests that the level of mtROS is insufficient in the isp-1 and nuo-6 mutants"
https://openalex.org/W2048135890,"Transit-amplifying cells (TACs) are an early intermediate in tissue regeneration. Here, using hair follicles (HFs) as a paradigm, we show that emerging TACs constitute a signaling center that orchestrates tissue growth. Whereas primed stem cells (SCs) generate TACs, quiescent SCs only proliferate after TACs form and begin expressing Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). TAC generation is independent of autocrine SHH, but the TAC pool wanes if they can't produce SHH. We trace this paradox to two direct actions of SHH: promoting quiescent-SC proliferation and regulating dermal factors that stoke TAC expansion. Ingrained within quiescent SCs' special sensitivity to SHH signaling is their high expression of GAS1. Without sufficient input from quiescent SCs, replenishment of primed SCs for the next hair cycle is compromised, delaying regeneration and eventually leading to regeneration failure. Our findings unveil TACs as transient but indispensable integrators of SC niche components and reveal an intriguing interdependency of primed and quiescent SC populations on tissue regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2162730852,"Tumor cells of epithelial origin present rampant DNA damage but do not undergo apoptosis due to inactivation of TP53. Understanding the mechanisms by which tumor cells are protected from cell death is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets. Cottini et al. report that hematological malignancies also present DNA damage and a distinct, TP53-independent mechanism for evading cell death: low levels of the Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 prevent apoptosis induced by nuclear relocalization of ABL1 triggered by DNA damage. A serine-threonine kinase, STK4, downregulates YAP1 levels; notably, STK4 inhibition increases YAP1 and related p73-mediated apoptosis in hematological malignancies. Oncogene-induced DNA damage elicits genomic instability in epithelial cancer cells, but apoptosis is blocked through inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53. In hematological cancers, the relevance of ongoing DNA damage and the mechanisms by which apoptosis is suppressed are largely unknown. We found pervasive DNA damage in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia, which leads to activation of a p53-independent, proapoptotic network centered on nuclear relocalization of ABL1 kinase. Although nuclear ABL1 triggers cell death through its interaction with the Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 in normal cells, we show that low YAP1 levels prevent nuclear ABL1-induced apoptosis in these hematologic malignancies. YAP1 is under the control of a serine-threonine kinase, STK4. Notably, genetic inactivation of STK4 restores YAP1 levels, triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo. Our data therefore identify a new synthetic-lethal strategy to selectively target cancer cells presenting with endogenous DNA damage and low YAP1 levels."

Here, we show that the circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, which is associated with bipolar disorder, impacts midbrain dopamine production and mood-related behavior in mice. Genetic deletion of the Rev-erbα gene or pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBα activity in the ventral midbrain induced mania-like behavior in association with a central hyperdopaminergic state. Also, REV-ERBα repressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene transcription via competition with nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (NURR1), another nuclear receptor crucial for dopaminergic neuronal function, thereby driving circadian TH expression through a target-dependent antagonistic mechanism. In conclusion, we identified a molecular connection between the circadian timing system and mood regulation, suggesting that REV-ERBα could be targeting in the treatment of circadian rhythm-related affective disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2048506716,"It is widely believed that perinatal cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation blocks cytokinesis, thereby causing binucleation and limiting regenerative repair after injury. This suggests that heart growth should occur entirely by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy during preadolescence when, in mice, cardiac mass increases many-fold over a few weeks. Here, we show that a thyroid hormone surge activates the IGF-1/IGF-1-R/Akt pathway on postnatal day 15 and initiates a brief but intense proliferative burst of predominantly binuclear cardiomyocytes. This proliferation increases cardiomyocyte numbers by ~40%, causing a major disparity between heart and cardiomyocyte growth. Also, the response to cardiac injury at postnatal day 15 is intermediate between that observed at postnatal days 2 and 21, further suggesting persistence of cardiomyocyte proliferative capacity beyond the perinatal period. If replicated in humans, this may allow novel regenerative therapies for heart diseases."

As gibberellin levels then fall, the next phase of flowering factors is released from gibberellin repression. By regulating inflorescence branching separately from flowering, this system determines overall seed yield."
https://openalex.org/W2010397653,"Spermatozoa must leave one organism, navigate long distances, and deliver their paternal DNA into a mature egg. For successful navigation and delivery, a sperm-specific calcium channel is activated in the mammalian flagellum. The genes encoding this channel (CatSpers) appear first in ancient uniflagellates, suggesting that sperm use adaptive strategies developed long ago for single-cell navigation. Here, using genetics, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, and phosphoproteomics, we investigate the CatSper-dependent mechanisms underlying this flagellar switch. We find that the CatSper channel is required for four linear calcium domains that organize signaling proteins along the flagella. This unique structure focuses tyrosine phosphorylation in time and space as sperm acquire the capacity to fertilize. In heterogeneous sperm populations, we find unique molecular phenotypes, but only sperm with intact CatSper domains that organize time-dependent and spatially specific protein tyrosine phosphorylation successfully migrate. These findings illuminate flagellar adaptation, signal transduction cascade organization, and fertility."
https://openalex.org/W1967630725,"Recordings from monkeys during motor learning suggest that durations of complex-spike (CS) responses to climbing-fibre inputs are meaningful signals correlated across the Purkinje-cell population during motor learning; longer climbing-fibre bursts lead to longer-duration CS responses, larger synaptic depression and stronger learning, thus forming a graded instruction. Neuronal plasticity in the cerebellum is central to behavioural learning. It is known that motor error signals from the climbing fibres drive cerebellar learning by modulating long-term depression of synapses from parallel fibres to Purkinje cells. Yan Yang and Stephen Lisberger studied the plasticity caused by a single complex spike in a single Purkinje cell in a monkey participating in a motor learning task and find that the magnitude of the plasticity as well as the motor learning depends on the duration of the complex spike in this climbing-fibre input. This graded instruction differs from the 'all-or-none' view previously thought to describe this input. Behavioural learning is mediated by cellular plasticity, such as changes in the strength of synapses at specific sites in neural circuits. The theory of cerebellar motor learning1,2,3 relies on movement errors signalled by climbing-fibre inputs to cause long-term depression of synapses from parallel fibres to Purkinje cells4,5. However, a recent review6 has called into question the widely held view that the climbing-fibre input is an ‘all-or-none’ event. In anaesthetized animals, there is wide variation in the duration of the complex spike (CS) caused in Purkinje cells by a climbing-fibre input7. Furthermore, the amount of plasticity in Purkinje cells is graded according to the duration of electrically controlled bursts in climbing fibres8,9. The duration of bursts depends on the ‘state’ of the inferior olive and therefore may be correlated across climbing fibres8,10. Here we provide a potential functional context for these mechanisms during motor learning in behaving monkeys. The magnitudes of both plasticity and motor learning depend on the duration of the CS responses. Furthermore, the duration of CS responses seems to be a meaningful signal that is correlated across the Purkinje-cell population during motor learning. We suggest that during learning, longer bursts in climbing fibres lead to longer-duration CS responses in Purkinje cells, more calcium entry into Purkinje cells, larger synaptic depression, and stronger learning. The same graded impact of instructive signals for plasticity and learning might occur throughout the nervous system."

We therefore generated a microbial microarray containing defined antigens isolated from a broad range of microbial flora to examine adaptive and innate immunity. Serological studies with this microarray show that immunoglobulins from multiple mammalian species have unique patterns of reactivity, whereas exposure of animals to distinct microbes induces specific serological recognition. Although adaptive immunity exhibited plasticity toward microbial antigens, immunological tolerance limits reactivity toward self. We discovered that several innate immune galectins show specific recognition of microbes that express self-like antigens, leading to direct killing of a broad range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes. Thus, host protection against microbes seems to represent a balance between adaptive and innate immunity to defend against evolving antigenic determinants while protecting against molecular mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W2048049362,"Multiple cancers may arise from within a clonal region of preneoplastic epithelium, a phenomenon termed 'field change'. However, it is not known how field change develops. Here we investigate this question using lineage tracing to track the behaviour of scattered single oesophageal epithelial progenitor cells expressing a mutation that inhibits the Notch signalling pathway. Notch is frequently subject to inactivating mutation in squamous cancers. Quantitative analysis reveals that cell divisions that produce two differentiated daughters are absent from mutant progenitors. As a result, mutant clones are no longer lost by differentiation and become functionally immortal. Furthermore, mutant cells promote the differentiation of neighbouring wild-type cells, which are then lost from the tissue. These effects lead to clonal expansion, with mutant cells eventually replacing the entire epithelium. Notch inhibition in progenitors carrying p53 stabilizing mutations creates large confluent regions of doubly mutant epithelium. Field change is thus a consequence of imbalanced differentiation in individual progenitor cells."

FMRP is present predominantly in the cytoplasm, where it regulates translation of proteins that are important for synaptic function. We identify FMRP as a chromatin-binding protein that functions in the DNA damage response (DDR). Specifically, we show that FMRP binds chromatin through its tandem Tudor (Agenet) domain in vitro and associates with chromatin in vivo. We also demonstrate that FMRP participates in the DDR in a chromatin-binding-dependent manner. The DDR machinery is known to play important roles in developmental processes such as gametogenesis. We show that FMRP occupies meiotic chromosomes and regulates the dynamics of the DDR machinery during mouse spermatogenesis. These findings suggest that nuclear FMRP regulates genomic stability at the chromatin interface and may impact gametogenesis and some developmental aspects of fragile X syndrome."

The basis of this vulnerability is not understood. To explore possible physiological determinants, we studied LC neurons using electrophysiological and optical approaches in ex vivo mouse brain slices. We found that autonomous activity in LC neurons was accompanied by oscillations in dendritic Ca(2+) concentration that were attributable to the opening of L-type Ca(2+) channels. This oscillation elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress and was attenuated by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. The relationship between activity and stress was malleable, as arousal and carbon dioxide increased the spike rate but differentially affected mitochondrial oxidant stress. Oxidant stress was also increased in an animal model of PD. Thus, our results point to activity-dependent Ca(2+) entry and a resulting mitochondrial oxidant stress as factors contributing to the vulnerability of LC neurons."

Many obligate substrates of GroEL share the (βα)8 TIM-barrel fold, but how the chaperonin promotes folding of these proteins is not known. Here, we analyzed the folding of DapA at peptide resolution using hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry. During spontaneous folding, all elements of the DapA TIM barrel acquire structure simultaneously in a process associated with a long search time. In contrast, GroEL/ES accelerates folding more than 30-fold by catalyzing segmental structure formation in the TIM barrel. Segmental structure formation is also observed during the fast spontaneous folding of a structural homolog of DapA from a bacterium that lacks GroEL/ES. Thus, chaperonin independence correlates with folding properties otherwise enforced by protein confinement in the GroEL/ES cage. We suggest that folding catalysis by GroEL/ES is required by a set of proteins to reach native state at a biologically relevant timescale, avoiding aggregation or degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2084456277,"We previously demonstrated that low biosynthesis of ω-3 fatty acid-derived proresolution mediators, termed protectins, is associated with an impaired global resolution capacity, inflammation and insulin resistance in obese high-fat diet-fed mice. These findings prompted a more direct study of the therapeutic potential of protectins for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Herein we show that protectin DX (PDX) exerts an unanticipated glucoregulatory activity that is distinct from its anti-inflammatory actions. We found that PDX selectively stimulated the release of the prototypic myokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) from skeletal muscle and thereby initiated a myokine-liver signaling axis, which blunted hepatic glucose production via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated transcriptional suppression of the gluconeogenic program. These effects of PDX were abrogated in Il6-null mice. PDX also activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); however, it did so in an IL-6-independent manner. Notably, we demonstrated that administration of PDX to obese diabetic db/db mice raises skeletal muscle IL-6 levels and substantially improves their insulin sensitivity without any impact on adipose tissue inflammation. Our findings thus support the development of PDX-based selective muscle IL-6 secretagogues as a new class of therapy for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes."

However, structures and mechanism that determine temperature directionality (cold versus heat) are not established. Here we screened 12,000 random mutant clones of the cold-activated mouse TRPA1 ion channel with a heat stimulus. We identified three single-point mutations that are individually sufficient to make mouse TRPA1 warm activated, while leaving sensitivity to chemicals unaffected. Mutant channels have high temperature sensitivity of voltage activation, specifically of channel opening, but not channel closing, which is reminiscent of other heat-activated TRP channels. All mutations are located in ankyrin repeat six, which identifies this domain as a sensitive modulator of thermal activation. We propose that a change in the coupling of temperature sensing to channel gating generates this sensitivity to warm temperatures. Our results demonstrate that minimal changes in protein sequence are sufficient to generate a wide diversity of thermal sensitivities in TRPA1."

Here, we integrated global gene expression and proteomic analyses and identified a molecular signature suggesting a central role for AS in maintaining human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) self-renewal. We demonstrate that the splicing factor SFRS2 is an OCT4 target gene required for pluripotency. SFRS2 regulates AS of the methyl-CpG binding protein MBD2, whose isoforms play opposing roles in maintenance of and reprogramming to pluripotency. Although both MDB2a and MBD2c are enriched at the OCT4 and NANOG promoters, MBD2a preferentially interacts with repressive NuRD chromatin remodeling factors and promotes hPSC differentiation, whereas overexpression of MBD2c enhances reprogramming of fibroblasts to pluripotency. The miR-301 and miR-302 families provide additional regulation by targeting SFRS2 and MDB2a. These data suggest that OCT4, SFRS2, and MBD2 participate in a positive feedback loop, regulating proteome diversity in support of hPSC self-renewal and reprogramming. Alternative RNA splicing (AS) regulates proteome diversity, including isoform-specific expression of several pluripotency genes. Here, we integrated global gene expression and proteomic analyses and identified a molecular signature suggesting a central role for AS in maintaining human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) self-renewal. We demonstrate that the splicing factor SFRS2 is an OCT4 target gene required for pluripotency. SFRS2 regulates AS of the methyl-CpG binding protein MBD2, whose isoforms play opposing roles in maintenance of and reprogramming to pluripotency. Although both MDB2a and MBD2c are enriched at the OCT4 and NANOG promoters, MBD2a preferentially interacts with repressive NuRD chromatin remodeling factors and promotes hPSC differentiation, whereas overexpression of MBD2c enhances reprogramming of fibroblasts to pluripotency. The miR-301 and miR-302 families provide additional regulation by targeting SFRS2 and MDB2a. These data suggest that OCT4, SFRS2, and MBD2 participate in a positive feedback loop, regulating proteome diversity in support of hPSC self-renewal and reprogramming. The transcription factors OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 are master regulators of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (De Los Angeles et al., 2012De Los Angeles A. Loh Y.-H. Tesar P.J. Daley G.Q.

ESCs are indispensable models of early development, whereas iPSCs hold great promise as cell-based therapeutics that circumvent the immunologic and ethical hurdles of embryo-derived cells. As a result, significant effort has been invested in elucidating the mechanisms that underlie stem cell function, with a particular emphasis on these core pluripotent genes. Despite the requirement of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in stem cell function (De Los Angeles et al., 2012De Los Angeles A. Loh Y.-H. Tesar P.J. Daley G.Q. Accessing naïve human pluripotency.Curr. Opin.

Doi A. Wen B. Ng K. Zhao R. Cahan P. Kim J. Aryee M.J. Ji H. Ehrlich L.I.R. et al.Epigenetic memory in induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2010; 467: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar), illustrate that the molecular network balancing self-renewal, pluripotency, and lineage commitment is not yet resolved. Recently, functional genomics and molecular profiling approaches have been used to explore the broader role of the core pluripotent factors in stem cell biology. These studies expanded the set of genes that support pluripotency (Chia et al., 2010Chia N.-Y. Chan Y.-S. Feng B. Lu X. Orlov Y.L. Moreau D. Kumar P. Yang L. Jiang J. Lau M.-S. et al.A genome-wide RNAi screen reveals determinants of human embryonic stem cell identity.Nature. 2010; 468: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and defined a biochemical network centered around OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 that is highly enriched for genes essential for development and stem cell function (Kim et al., 2008Kim J.

Furthermore, use of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L.

In parallel, genome-scale molecular measurement technologies have been used to quantify differences in epigenetic modifications (Gifford et al., 2013Gifford C.A. Ziller M.J. Gu H. Trapnell C.

These data provide a rich resource of molecular information, although it remains challenging to generate specific hypotheses from these disparate data types or establish mechanistic links between these molecular profiles and the core pluripotent factors. Recently, alternative splicing (AS) has garnered attention as a possible means by which stem cells regulate the expression of gene and protein isoforms in order to support pluripotency and self-renewal. Indeed, functional roles for alternatively spliced gene products of NANOG, FOXP1, and Tcf7l1 have been demonstrated (Das et al., 2011Das S. Jena S. Levasseur D.N.

USA. 2010; 107: 10514-10519Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, the muscleblind-like family of RNA binding proteins was found to repress pluripotency by mediating expression of several somatic cell-specific protein isoforms, including FOXP1 (Han et al., 2013Han H. Irimia M. Ross P.J. Sung H.-K. Alipanahi B. David L. Golipour A. Gabut M. Michael I.P. Nachman E.N. et al.MBNL proteins repress ES-cell-specific alternative splicing and reprogramming.Nature. 2013; 498: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These data illustrate a general role for AS in pluripotent cells; however, the specific splicing factors and mechanistic links to the core pluripotent genes, which work in concert to reinforce a ground state of self-renewal, remain unresolved. The splicing factor SFRS2 (also known as SC35) is essential for embryonic development (Xiao et al., 2007Xiao R. Sun Y. Ding J.-H. Lin S. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Fu X.-D. Li X. Splicing regulator SC35 is essential for genomic stability and cell proliferation during mammalian organogenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5393-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and regulates transcription (Lin et al., 2008Lin S. Coutinho-Mansfield G. Wang D. Pandit S. Fu X.-D. The splicing factor SC35 has an active role in transcriptional elongation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although several splicing substrates have been identified (Lin et al., 2008Lin S. Coutinho-Mansfield G. Wang D. Pandit S. Fu X.-D. The splicing factor SC35 has an active role in transcriptional elongation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), no pluripotency-specific role has been established for SFRS2. The methyl-DNA binding protein methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) comprises two predominant isoforms, MBD2a and MBD2c (Hendrich and Bird, 1998Hendrich B. Bird A. Identification and characterization of a family of mammalian methyl-CpG binding proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), that share the same MBD domain but differ in the C-terminal region as a result of AS. MBD2 silences gene expression by binding to methylated DNA and recruiting the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex (Zhang et al., 1999Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Analysis of the NuRD subunits reveals a histone deacetylase core complex and a connection with DNA methylation.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Although NuRD has well-established roles in development (Reynolds et al., 2012Reynolds N. Latos P. Hynes-Allen A. Loos R. Leaford D. O’Shaughnessy A. Mosaku O. Signolet J. Brennecke P. Kalkan T. et al.NuRD suppresses pluripotency gene expression to promote transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage commitment.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the function of MBD2 in stem cells is not well understood. In fact, data from two recent studies are inconsistent with respect to the impact of MBD2 in somatic cell reprogramming (Lee et al., 2013Lee M.R. Prasain N. Chae H.-D. Kim Y.-J. Mantel C. Yoder M.C. Broxmeyer H.E. Epigenetic regulation of NANOG by miR-302 cluster-MBD2 completes induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 666-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Onder et al., 2012Onder T.T. Kara N. Cherry A. Sinha A.U. Zhu N. Bernt K.M. Cahan P. Marcarci B.O. Unternaehrer J. Gupta P.B. et al.Chromatin-modifying enzymes as modulators of reprogramming.Nature. 2012; 483: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), although the possibility of isoform-specific function was not considered. In this study, we establish mechanistic links between OCT4 and SFRS2 and demonstrate that these factors work in concert to regulate AS of MBD2. Expression of specific MBD2 isoforms is further regulated by the microRNA (miRNA) machinery, and we find that the resulting gene products play opposing functional roles with respect to self-renewal of human PSCs (hPSCs) and reprogramming of fibroblasts. Consistent with these observations, MBD2 isoforms target the promoters of OCT4 and NANOG in human ESCs (hESCs) but differ dramatically in their ability to biochemically interact with chromatin remodeling proteins. Collectively, our results suggest a positive feedback loop comprised of OCT4, SFRS2, and splice products of MBD2 that regulates proteome diversity in order to support a self-renewing ground state. First, we sought to identify a molecular signature for pluripotency that integrated gene and protein expression, in addition to protein phosphorylation in cells representing a broad range of genetic backgrounds and cell fates (Figures S1A and S2 and Table S1 available online). Independent hierarchical clustering of each data type revealed that hPSCs from different tissue types exhibit protein phosphorylation, gene transcription, and protein expression profiles that are clearly distinct from differentiated fibroblasts (DFs; Figure 1A), and each molecular class contributes a subset of unique genes to the signature (Figure S1B). Notably, the molecular divergence observed between pluripotent cells and DFs was considerably higher than it was in hPSCs (Figure S1C); in addition we confirmed that the phosphorylation signature was strongly linked to cell type rather than specific culture conditions (Figure S1D). As is typical of high-throughput measurements (Brill et al., 2009Brill L.M. Xiong W. Lee K.-B. Ficarro S.B. Crain A. Xu Y. Terskikh A. Snyder E.Y. Ding S. Phosphoproteomic analysis of human embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 204-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, Phanstiel et al., 2011Phanstiel D.H.

Surani M.A. Tracing the derivation of embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass by single-cell RNA-Seq analysis.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 468-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), classification of gene function within the pluripotency signature based on gene ontology (GO) biological process revealed enrichment of several disparate pathways (Figure 1B, left). There is growing appreciation that the principles of network theory are applicable to human physiology whereby extended physical, genetic, or metabolic relationships between biomolecules may have predictive power with respect to biological outcomes (Balázsi et al., 2011Balázsi G. van Oudenaarden A. Collins J.J. Cellular decision making and biological noise: from microbes to mammals.Cell. 2011; 144: 910-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, Vidal et al., 2011Vidal M. Cusick M.E. Barabási A.-L. Interactome networks and human disease.Cell. 2011; 144: 986-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we next asked whether interpretation of our molecular signature data within the context of physical interaction networks would highlight specific cellular functions that support self-renewal. Accordingly, we assessed the number of physical interactions between constituent genes of the pluripotency signature and three positive reference sets (PRSs) of pluripotent factors derived from (1) literature survey, (2) a recent functional genomics study, and (3) proteins defined as biochemical interactors of Oct4 or Nanog (Figure S1E, Supplemental Experimental Procedures, and Table S2). This analysis revealed that only members of the RNA splicing pathway are consistently enriched across each measurement class (Figure 1B, right, and Table S3). Additional analysis (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) of the splicing factors in our pluripotent molecular signature suggested that the splicing factor SFRS2 might be an important mediator of pluripotency (Figure 1C and Table S3). Given the role of SFRS2 in AS, we next compared the levels of spliced isoforms for 16,084 genes in hESCs and DFs and found that the spliced products from 2,974 genes differed between these cell types (Figure S3A and Table S4). Strikingly, we observed that 1,424 of these were not otherwise represented in the set of pluripotency signature genes (Figure S3A). As with other molecular classes of the pluripotent signature (Figure 1B), gene products subject to AS in hESCs are enriched for physical interactions with the PRSs (Figure 1D and Table S3). Extension of this analysis to GO annotation revealed a consistent enrichment of factors related to transcription regulation and chromatin modification (Figure S3B and Table S3); in total, we observed 236 alternatively spliced genes that spanned these pathways. Within the exon junction microarray data (Table S4), MBD2 had the highest prediction score for AS between hESCs and DFs (Figure 1E and Table S4). Next, we sought to establish specific links between SFRS2, MBD2, and the machinery supporting pluripotency. Depletion of endogenous SFRS2 disrupted self-renewal in hESCs as gauged by cell morphology (Figure 2A), expression of OCT4 and NANOG (Figure 2B), alkaline phosphatase staining (Figure S4A), and cell colony integrity (Figure S4B). We observed a coordinate decrease in expression level of SFRS2 upon OCT4 depletion in hESCs (Figure 2C); importantly, this effect was specific to SFRS2 and not observed for other splicing factors (Figure S4C). Furthermore, we found that OCT4 bound directly to the promoter of SFRS2 in hESCs (Figure 2D) and drove expression of luciferase downstream of the native SFRS2 promoter in vitro (Figure 2E). The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by mutation or deletion within the predicted OCT4 binding site of the SFRS2 promoter (Figure 2F). These data provide evidence for functional and genetic links between OCT4 and SFRS2 in hPSCs. MBD2 comprises multiple isoforms (Hendrich and Bird, 1998Hendrich B. Bird A. Identification and characterization of a family of mammalian methyl-CpG binding proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). We detected preferential gene- and protein-level expression of the MBD2c and MBD2a isoforms in H1 ESCs and BJ DFs, respectively (Figures 3B and 3C). Interestingly, depletion of endogenous SFRS2 or OCT4 in hESCs led to a dramatic increase in expression of MBD2a and a reduction in MBD2c (Figures 3D and S4D). Next, we probed for a direct biochemical interaction between SFRS2 and MBD2 pre-mRNA by assaying RNA that coprecipitated with exogenously expressed SFRS2-FLAG-HA. We observed that SFRS2 bound to MBD2 pre-mRNA specifically at intron 2, preceding exon 3, which is unique to the ESC-predominant MBD2c isoform (Figure 3E), suggesting that SFRS2 may mediate alternative splicing of this methyl-DNA binding protein in hPSCs. In addition, close inspection of the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of SFRS2 and MBD2a (but not MBD2c) revealed potential binding motifs for miR-301 and miR-302, miRNA families that are functionally associated with lineage commitment and self-renewal (Figure S4E) (Bar et al., 2008Bar M. Wyman S.K. Fritz B.R. Qi J. Garg K.S. Parkin R.K. Kroh E.M. Bendoraite A. Mitchell P.S. Nelson A.M. et al.MicroRNA discovery and profiling in human embryonic stem cells by deep sequencing of small RNA libraries.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 2496-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We confirmed that overexpression of miR-301b and miR-130b reduced luciferase driven by the wild-type SFRS2 3′ UTR, whereas mutation of the miR-301 motif restored luciferase expression (Figure 3F). Similarly, miR-302 specifically targeted the 3′ UTR of MBD2a (Figure 3G) but not that of MBD2c (Figure 3H). Indeed, we confirmed that exogenous expression of miR-302 reduced levels of MBD2a in vivo (Figure 3I). These data suggest that the miR-301 and miR-302 families may independently regulate SFRS2 and MBD2 in order to fine-tune the expression of MBD2 isoforms. Next, we investigated the functional roles of MBD2 isoforms in hPSCs. Overexpression of MBD2a (Figures 4A and 4B ) disrupted pluripotency, as evidenced by cell morphology (Figure 4C) in addition to reduced expression of OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 (Figure 4D). In contrast, increased MBD2c levels had no effect in hESC on the basis of these measures. However, the addition of the ESC-specific MBD2c isoform (Figure 4E) to a cocktail of reprogramming factors enhanced reprogramming efficiency in BJ DFs, whereas exogenous expression of MBD2a had no effect (Figures 4F and 4G). These data suggested that MBD2a and MBD2c play opposing roles in pluripotency. ChIP indicated that MBD2a and MBD2c were enriched at OCT4 and NANOG promoter regions in 293T cells as well as H1 ESCs (Figure 4H). Interestingly, co- and reverse immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting (Figures 4I and 4J) revealed that the somatic cell-specific MBD2a isoform exhibits much higher affinity for interaction with members of the transcriptionally repressive NuRD complex, including HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, MTA2, and Mi-2 (Zhang et al., 1999Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Analysis of the NuRD subunits reveals a histone deacetylase core complex and a connection with DNA methylation.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The specificity of the MBD2a-NURD interaction was further confirmed by probing for SIN3A, a corepressor (Zhang et al., 2005Zhang Y. Fatima N. Dufau M.L. Coordinated changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications regulate silencing/derepression of luteinizing hormone receptor gene transcription.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7929-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) independent of NuRD that did not biochemically interact with either MBD2 isoform (Figure 4I). PSCs are phenotypically well defined but exhibit significant molecular heterogeneity (Cahan and Daley, 2013Cahan P. Daley G.Q. Origins and implications of pluripotent stem cell variability and heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the core pluripotent factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG must balance a stochastic transcriptional ground state but yet respond rapidly to exogenous cues in order to properly orchestrate the cell lineages required for life, all from a relatively modest number of protein-coding genes (Wu et al., 2010Wu J.Q. Habegger L. Noisa P. Szekely A. Qiu C. Hutchison S. Raha D. Egholm M. Lin H. Weissman S. et al.Dynamic transcriptomes during neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells revealed by short, long, and paired-end sequencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5254-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing represents a likely pathway whereby the core pluripotency factors can dynamically regulate proteome diversity to support high-fidelity lineage commitment (Wang et al., 2008Wang E.T. Sandberg R. Luo S. Khrebtukova I. Zhang L. Mayr C. Kingsmore S.F. Schroth G.P. Burge C.B. Alternative isoform regulation in human tissue transcriptomes.Nature. 2008; 456: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). Although several examples of alternatively spliced gene products have been functionally validated in pluripotent cells (Das et al., 2011Das S. Jena S. Levasseur D.N.

USA. 2010; 107: 10514-10519Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), a general framework that mechanistically links OCT4, NANOG, or SOX2 with specific splicing factors, pre-mRNA substrates, and canonical regulators of gene transcription has yet to be described. We found that the splicing factor SFRS2 was strongly represented within the pluripotent molecular signature and, moreover, that OCT4 bound to SFRS2 promoters in vivo and drove luciferase expression in vitro. These data establish interdependent genetic and functional links between OCT4 and SFRS2 in hPSCs. We confirmed a cell-type-specific expression pattern for MBD2 isoforms, and found that SFRS2 biochemically targets the pre-mRNA of this methyl-DNA binding protein. We also observed a reciprocal link between OCT4 and MBD2a, manifested at the level of gene expression and pluripotent phenotype. Interestingly, hESCs displayed distinct morphologies in response to depletion of SRFR2 or overexpression of MBD2a, suggesting that the splicing factor most likely targets additional gene products; indeed, it is intriguing to speculate that the pool of pluripotent-specific, alternatively spliced transcripts in our exon-junction microarray data may be rich in previously unrecognized gene isoforms that support self-renewal. Similarly, use of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies may provide an exhaustive set of pluripotent-specific gene isoforms and splicing factor gene targets. Notwithstanding a comprehensive analysis of SFRS2 gene targets, our current results provide compelling mechanistic evidence that the functional role of OCT4 in pluripotent cells extends to the pathways that regulate gene splicing. Although the editing of pre-mRNA transcripts can be reconstituted in vitro, it has become clear that gene splicing in vivo is intimately linked to transcription, chromatin structure, and histone modifications (Braunschweig et al., 2013Braunschweig U.

NuRD is a chromatin remodeling complex that is thought to promote lineage commitment of ESCs via silencing of pluripotency genes (Reynolds et al., 2012Reynolds N. Latos P. Hynes-Allen A. Loos R.

https://openalex.org/W2069224830,"Crystal structures of human and prokaryotic ribosomal oxygenases reported here, with and without their ribosomal protein substrates, support their assignments as hydroxylases, and provide insights into the evolution of the JmjC-domain-containing hydroxylases and demethylases. Christopher Schofield and colleagues present a comprehensive structural study of a recently discovered family of 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenases termed ribosomal oxygenases (ROXs). They have solved 13 new structures of human and bacterial ROXs with or without substrate. While the analysis confirms their assignment as hydroxylases, comparison with JmjC-domain-containing hydroxylases and demethylases provides an understanding of the evolution of these related families of proteins, in part driven by flexibility in the coordination position. The general binding mode of the hydroxylated residues is conserved between prokaryotic and human ROXs. 2-Oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenases have important roles in the regulation of gene expression via demethylation of N-methylated chromatin components1,2 and in the hydroxylation of transcription factors3 and splicing factor proteins4. Recently, 2OG-dependent oxygenases that catalyse hydroxylation of transfer RNA5,6,7 and ribosomal proteins8 have been shown to be important in translation relating to cellular growth, TH17-cell differentiation and translational accuracy9,10,11,12. The finding that ribosomal oxygenases (ROXs) occur in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans8 raises questions as to their structural and evolutionary relationships. In Escherichia coli, YcfD catalyses arginine hydroxylation in the ribosomal protein L16; in humans, MYC-induced nuclear antigen (MINA53; also known as MINA) and nucleolar protein 66 (NO66) catalyse histidine hydroxylation in the ribosomal proteins RPL27A and RPL8, respectively. The functional assignments of ROXs open therapeutic possibilities via either ROX inhibition or targeting of differentially modified ribosomes. Despite differences in the residue and protein selectivities of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ROXs, comparison of the crystal structures of E. coli YcfD and Rhodothermus marinus YcfD with those of human MINA53 and NO66 reveals highly conserved folds and novel dimerization modes defining a new structural subfamily of 2OG-dependent oxygenases. ROX structures with and without their substrates support their functional assignments as hydroxylases but not demethylases, and reveal how the subfamily has evolved to catalyse the hydroxylation of different residue side chains of ribosomal proteins. Comparison of ROX crystal structures with those of other JmjC-domain-containing hydroxylases, including the hypoxia-inducible factor asparaginyl hydroxylase FIH and histone Nε-methyl lysine demethylases, identifies branch points in 2OG-dependent oxygenase evolution and distinguishes between JmjC-containing hydroxylases and demethylases catalysing modifications of translational and transcriptional machinery. The structures reveal that new protein hydroxylation activities can evolve by changing the coordination position from which the iron-bound substrate-oxidizing species reacts. This coordination flexibility has probably contributed to the evolution of the wide range of reactions catalysed by oxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W2015383066,"How sulphur is incorporated into sulphur-containing secondary metabolites is poorly understood; here, the bacterium Amycolatopsis orientalis is shown to co-opt sulphur-carrier proteins from primary metabolic pathways to facilitate the biosynthesis of sulphur-containing natural products. The sulphur atom is present in many secondary metabolites but it is not clear how it is incorporated into these natural products. Hung-wen Liu and colleagues identify a thiazole synthase homologue, BexX, that participates in the biosynthesis of the 2-thiosugar-containing antibiotic BE-7585A. BexX catalyses the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 2-thioglucose by — as the BE-7585A biosynthetic gene cluster does not contain a gene for a sulphur carrier — co-opting sulphur-carrier proteins from the cysteine or molybdopterin biosynthetic pathways. The hijacking of sulphur transfer systems from primary metabolism pathways to facilitate biosynthesis of a natural product represents an unusual link between primary and secondary metabolism. Sulphur is an essential element for life and is ubiquitous in living systems1,2. Yet how the sulphur atom is incorporated into many sulphur-containing secondary metabolites is poorly understood. For bond formation between carbon and sulphur in primary metabolites, the major ionic sulphur sources are the persulphide and thiocarboxylate groups on sulphur-carrier (donor) proteins3,4. Each group is post-translationally generated through the action of a specific activating enzyme. In all reported bacterial cases, the gene encoding the enzyme that catalyses the carbon–sulphur bond formation reaction and that encoding the cognate sulphur-carrier protein exist in the same gene cluster5. To study the production of the 2-thiosugar moiety in BE-7585A, an antibiotic from Amycolatopsis orientalis, we identified a putative 2-thioglucose synthase, BexX, whose protein sequence and mode of action seem similar to those of ThiG, the enzyme that catalyses thiazole formation in thiamine biosynthesis6,7. However, no gene encoding a sulphur-carrier protein could be located in the BE-7585A cluster. Subsequent genome sequencing uncovered a few genes encoding sulphur-carrier proteins that are probably involved in the biosynthesis of primary metabolites but only one activating enzyme gene in the A. orientalis genome. Further experiments showed that this activating enzyme can adenylate each of these sulphur-carrier proteins and probably also catalyses the subsequent thiolation, through its rhodanese domain. A proper combination of these sulphur-delivery systems is effective for BexX-catalysed 2-thioglucose production. The ability of BexX to selectively distinguish sulphur-carrier proteins is given a structural basis using X-ray crystallography. This study is, to our knowledge, the first complete characterization of thiosugar formation in nature and also demonstrates the receptor promiscuity of the A. orientalis sulphur-delivery system. Our results also show that co-opting the sulphur-delivery machinery of primary metabolism for the biosynthesis of sulphur-containing natural products is probably a general strategy found in nature."

https://openalex.org/W1966100254,"Adult Ibsp-knockout mice (BSP−/−) display shorter stature, lower bone turnover and higher trabecular bone mass than wild type, the latter resulting from impaired bone resorption. Unexpectedly, BSP knockout also affects reproductive behavior, as female mice do not construct a proper ""nest"" for their offsprings. Multiple crossing experiments nonetheless indicated that the shorter stature and lower weight of BSP−/− mice, since birth and throughout life, as well as their shorter femur and tibia bones are independent of the genotype of the mothers, and thus reflect genetic inheritance. In BSP−/− newborns, µCT analysis revealed a delay in membranous primary ossification, with wider cranial sutures, as well as thinner femoral cortical bone and lower tissue mineral density, reflected in lower expression of bone formation markers. However, trabecular bone volume and osteoclast parameters of long bones do not differ between genotypes. Three weeks after birth, osteoclast number and surface drop in the mutants, concomitant with trabecular bone accumulation. The growth plates present a thinner hypertrophic zone in newborns with lower whole bone expression of IGF-1 and higher IHH in 6 days old BSP−/− mice. At 3 weeks the proliferating zone is thinner and the hypertrophic zone thicker in BSP−/− than in BSP+/+ mice of either sex, maybe reflecting a combination of lower chondrocyte proliferation and impaired cartilage resorption. Six days old BSP−/− mice display lower osteoblast marker expression but higher MEPE and higher osteopontin(Opn)/Runx2 ratio. Serum Opn is higher in mutants at day 6 and in adults. Thus, lack of BSP alters long bone growth and membranous/cortical primary bone formation and mineralization. Endochondral development is however normal in mutant mice and the accumulation of trabecular bone observed in adults develops progressively in the weeks following birth. Compensatory high Opn may allow normal endochondral development in BSP−/− mice, while impairing primary mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2081241850,"Cancer stem cells or tumour-propagating cells (TPCs) have been identified for a number of cancers, but data pertaining to their existence in lymphoma so far remain elusive. We show for the first time that a small subset of cells purified from human anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive and -negative, anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell lines and primary patient tumours using the side population (SP) technique have serial tumour-propagating capacity both in vitro and in vivo; they give rise to both themselves and the bulk tumour population as well as supporting growth of the latter through the production of soluble factors. In vivo serial dilution assays utilising a variety of model systems inclusive of human cell lines, primary human tumours and nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK-induced murine tumours demonstrate the TPC frequency to vary from as many as 1/54 to 1/1336 tumour cells. In addition, the SP cells express higher levels of pluripotency-associated transcription factors and are enriched for a gene expression profile consistent with early thymic progenitors. Finally, our data show that the SP cells express higher levels of the NPM-ALK oncogene and are sensitive to an ALK inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1982755610,"Development of endocrine resistance during tumor progression represents a major challenge in the management of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive breast tumors and is an area under intense investigation. Although the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood, many studies point towards the ‘cross-talk’ between ERα and MAPK signaling pathways as a key oncogenic axis responsible for the development of estrogen-independent growth of breast cancer cells that are initially ERα+ and hormone sensitive. In this study we employed a metastatic breast cancer xenograft model harboring constitutive activation of Raf-1 oncogenic signaling to investigate the mechanistic linkage between aberrant MAPK activity and development of endocrine resistance through abrogation of the ERα signaling axis. We demonstrate for the first time the causal role of the Aurora-A mitotic kinase in the development of endocrine resistance through activation of SMAD5 nuclear signaling and down-regulation of ERα expression in initially ERα+ breast cancer cells. This contribution is highly significant for the treatment of endocrine refractory breast carcinomas, because it may lead to the development of novel molecular therapies targeting the Aurora-A/SMAD5 oncogenic axis. We postulate such therapy to result in the selective eradication of endocrine resistant ERαlow/− cancer cells from the bulk tumor with consequent benefits for breast cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W2087363589,"A novel glucose biosensor was fabricated. The first layer of the biosensor was polythionine, which was formed by the electrochemical polymerisation of the thionine monomer on a glassy carbon electrode. The remaining layers were coated with chitosan-MWCNTs, GOx, and the chitosan-PTFE film in sequence. The MWCNTs embedded in FAD were like “conductive wires” connecting FAD with electrode, reduced the distance between them and were propitious to fast direct electron transfer. Combining with good electrical conductivity of PTH and MWCNTs, the current response was enlarged. The sensor was a parallel multi-component reaction system (PMRS) and excellent electrocatalytic performance for glucose could be obtained without a mediator. The glucose sensor had a working voltage of −0.42 V, an optimum working temperature of 25°C, an optimum working pH of 7.0, and the best percentage of polytetrafluoroethylene emulsion (PTFE) in the outer composite film was 2%. Under the optimised conditions, the biosensor displayed a high sensitivity of 2.80 µA mM−1 cm−2 and a low detection limit of 5 µM (S/N = 3), with a response time of less than 15 s and a linear range of 0.04 mM to 2.5 mM. Furthermore, the fabricated biosensor had a good selectivity, reproducibility, and long-term stability, indicating that the novel CTS+PTFE/GOx/MWCNTs/PTH composite is a promising material for immobilization of biomolecules and fabrication of third generation biosensors."

The primary aim of this work was to determine if HPV4 dosing compliance differs between females who receive doses at rural vs. urban core safety net health care locations.Females exclusively receiving health care in the Truman Medical Center (TMC) safety net system at the urban core and rural locations were identified by their HPV4 vaccine records. Dates and number of HPV4 doses as well as age, gravidity, parity and race/ethnicity were recorded from the electronic medical record (EMR). Appropriate HPV4 dosing intervals were referenced from the literature.1259 females, 10-26 years of age, received HPV4 vaccination at either the rural (23%) or urban core location (77%). At the rural location, 23% received three doses on time, equal to the 24% at the urban core. Females seen in the urban core were more likely to receive on-time doublet dosing than on-time triplet dosing (82% vs. 67%, p<0.001). Mistimed doses occurred equally often among females receiving only two doses, as well as those receiving three doses.Compliance with on-time HPV4 triplet dose completion was low at rural and urban core safety net health clinics, but did not differ by location."
