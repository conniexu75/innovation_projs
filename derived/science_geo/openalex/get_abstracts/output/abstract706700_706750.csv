https://openalex.org/W4313306213,"Aim To describe the occurrence of carbapenem resistance among multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens in Accra using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Methodology The study was cross-sectional, involving 144 clinical MDR E . coli and K . pneumoniae isolates recovered from the Central Laboratory of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH). The isolates were re-cultured bacteriologically, identified using standard biochemical tests, and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer method. Carbapenem resistance was determined based on imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem zones of inhibition, as well as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Carbapenemase production was determined phenotypically by modified Hodge test (MHT) and modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM), and genotypically with multiplex PCR targeting the blaKPC , blaIMP , blaNDM , blaVIM , and blaOXA -48 genes. Results Of the 144 MDR isolates, 69.4% were E . coli , and 30.6% were K . pneumoniae . The distribution of antimicrobial resistance rates among them was ampicillin (97.2%), cefuroxime (93.1%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (86.8%), tetracycline (85.4%), cefotaxime and cefpodoxime (77.1% each), amoxicillin-clavulanate (75%), ceftriaxone (73.6%), ciprofloxacin (70.8%), levofloxacin (66.0%), cefepime (65.3%), ceftazidime (64.6%), gentamicin (48.6), piperacillin-tazobactam (40.3%), cefoxitin (14.6%), amikacin (13.9%), ertapenem and meropenem (5.6% each), and imipenem (2.8%). In total, 5.6% (8/144) of them were carbapenem-resistant (carbapenem MIC range = 0.094–32.0 μg/ml), with 75% (6/8) of these testing positive by the phenotypic tests and 62.5% (5/8) by the genotypic test (of which 80% [4/5] carried blaOXA -48 and 20% (1/5) blaNDM ). The blaVIM , blaIMP , and blaKPC genes were not detected. Conclusion Although the rates of antibiotic resistance among the isolates were high, the prevalence of carbapenemase producers was low. The finding of blaOXA -48 and blaNDM warrants upscaling of antimicrobial resistance surveillance programmes and fortification of infection prevention and control programmes in the country."

In addition, the population of Lactobacillus in the vagina declines, increasing the risk of atrophic vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, and genitourinary symptoms in the postmenopausal women. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Lactobacillus-containing feminine hygiene products on vaginal microbiome and genitourinary symptoms in pre- and postmenopausal women. This was a pilot randomized controlled trial in 35 premenopausal and 35 postmenopausal healthy women. For 4 weeks, treatment 1 group (14 premenopausal and 16 postmenopausal women) used the Lactobacillus-containing feminine soap and cream, and treatment 2 group (15 premenopausal and 14 postmenopausal women) used Lactobacillus-containing feminine gel in addition to soap and cream. The remaining 6 premenopausal and 5 postmenopausal women served as controls without using any products. We then compared the changes in the vaginal microbiota, genitourinary symptoms, and other related biomarkers after completion of treatment. Vaginal pH and pathogenic flora were reduced in both treatment groups compared to control group, which was more significant in the treatment 2 group of postmenopausal women. Genitourinary symptoms significantly improved in 60% of premenopausal women in treatment 1 group and 81.3% of postmenopausal women in treatment 2 group, compared to control group (0%, p = 0.043 and p<0.01 respectively). Overactive bladder symptom scores were significantly improved after using the products in eleven out of twelve postmenopausal women suspected of having overactive bladder. The use of Lactobacillus-containing feminine products was associated with improved vaginal ecosystem and urogenital health compared to control group, especially in those women using feminine gel."
https://openalex.org/W4313315915,"Gastric cancer is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Gastric atrophy (GA) and gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the mucosa of the stomach have been found to increase the risk of gastric cancer and are considered precancerous lesions. Therefore, the early detection of GA and IM may have a valuable role in histopathological risk assessment. However, GA and IM are difficult to confirm endoscopically and, following the Sydney protocol, their diagnosis depends on the analysis of glandular morphology and on the identification of at least one well-defined goblet cell in a set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -stained biopsy samples. To this end, the precise segmentation and classification of glands from the histological images plays an important role in the diagnostic confirmation of GA and IM. In this paper, we propose a digital pathology end-to-end workflow for gastric gland segmentation and classification for the analysis of gastric tissues. The proposed GAGL-VTNet, initially, extracts both global and local features combining multi-scale feature maps for the segmentation of glands and, subsequently, it adopts a vision transformer that exploits the visual dependences of the segmented glands towards their classification. For the analysis of gastric tissues, segmentation of mucosa is performed through an unsupervised model combining energy minimization and a U-Net model. Then, features of the segmented glands and mucosa are extracted and analyzed. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology we created the GAGL dataset consisting of 85 WSI, collected from 20 patients. The results demonstrate the existence of significant differences of the extracted features between normal, GA and IM cases. The proposed approach for gland and mucosa segmentation achieves an object dice score equal to 0.908 and 0.967 respectively, while for the classification of glands it achieves an F1 score equal to 0.94 showing great potential for the automated quantification and analysis of gastric biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W4313307831,"Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic in Nigeria. Improved surveillance and testing capacity have revealed in an increased number of reported cases and apparent geographic spread of Lassa fever in Nigeria. We described the recent four-year trend of Lassa fever in Nigeria to improve understanding of its epidemiology and inform the design of appropriate interventions.We analysed the national surveillance data on Lassa fever maintained by the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) and described trends, sociodemographic, geographic distribution, and clinical outcomes. We compared cases, positivity, and clinical outcomes in the period January 2018 to December 2021.We found Lassa fever to be reported throughout the year with more than half the cases reported within the first quarter of the year, a recent increase in numbers and geographic spread of the virus, and male and adult (>18 years) preponderance. Case fatality rates were worse in males, the under-five and elderly, during off-peak periods, and among low reporting states.Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria with a recent increase in numbers and geographical distribution. Sustaining improved surveillance, enhanced laboratory diagnosis and improved case management capacity during off-peak periods should remain a priority. Attention should be paid to the very young and elderly during outbreaks. Further research efforts should identify and address specific factors that determine poor clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4313307258,"The Indonesian rice production balance has managed to show a slightly consistent surplus recently, in the period of 2010 to 2021, but the country has continued to import rice to secure its rice reserve. The country has also made some efforts to increase its domestic rice production and, at the same time, faced ecological, socio-cultural, economic, institutional, and technological sustainability challenges. Previous studies on rice sustainability have shown varied results on the sustainability statuses and sensitive factors in Indonesia, yet there have been limited studies identifying key factors systematically. To provide more solid empirical evidence on this subject, a study to expand the scope to other sites with an additional analysis of the key factors is perceivably needed. This study aims to verify the sustainability status and identify sensitive factors as well as key factors for increasing rice production. The primary data were collected by interviewing officials from various agencies at the central and regional levels and several discussion groups of 40 participants, including farmers. In addition, secondary data were also collected from various ministries/agencies at the central and regional levels. Data analyses use a set of indicators, i.e., the Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) approach and the Matrix of Cross Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification (MICMAC) approach. The results show that the multidimensional sustainability status of increasing rice production in Bandung district is moderate, whereas sustainability status per dimension shows variations from poor to moderate. Fourteen out of 50 attributes are identified as sensitive factors influencing the sustainability of rice production. Six key factors are found to influence the sustainability of rice production. The study concludes that the sustainability status of increasing rice production in Bandung district is moderate, with variation across dimensions. The sustainability of increasing rice production in the study site is influenced by those 14 sensitive factors and those six key factors. This study recommends a number of major policies/programs to increase the sustainability of rice production, which are as follows: implementation of the Regional Spatial Plan, promotion of the application of best practices of farming management (organic fertilizers and pesticides), promotion of the use of agricultural machinery, and provision of farmer assistance for pre-harvest and postharvest production facilities, as well as farm financing. Future research should expand study sites to some other rice production centers with different attributes to enrich our understanding of the subject of rice sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W4313315773,"Due to maternal inheritance and minimal rearrangement, the chloroplast genome is an important genetic resource for evolutionary studies. However, the evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetic performance of chloroplast genomes in closely related species are poorly characterized, particularly in taxonomically complex and species-rich groups. The taxonomically unresolved Ficus sarmentosa species complex (Moraceae) comprises approximately 20 taxa with unclear genetic background. In this study, we explored the evolutionary dynamics, hotspot loci, and phylogenetic performance of thirteen chloroplast genomes (including eleven newly obtained and two downloaded from NCBI) representing the F . sarmentosa complex. Their sequence lengths, IR boundaries, repeat sequences, and codon usage were compared. Both sequence length and IR boundaries were found to be highly conserved. All four categories of long repeat sequences were found across all 13 chloroplast genomes, with palindromic and forward sequences being the most common. The number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci varied from 175 ( F . dinganensis and F . howii ) to 190 ( F . polynervis ), with the dinucleotide motif appearing the most frequently. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis indicated that codons ending with A/T were prior to those ending with C/T. The majority of coding sequence regions were found to have undergone negative selection with the exception of ten genes ( accD , clpP , ndhK , rbcL , rpl20 , rpl22 , rpl23 , rpoC1 , rps15 , and rps4 ) which exhibited potential positive selective signatures. Five hypervariable genic regions ( rps15 , ycf1 , rpoA , ndhF , and rpl22 ) and five hypervariable intergenic regions ( trnH-GUG - psbA , rpl32 - trnL-UAG , psbZ - trnG-GCC , trnK-UUU - rps 16 and ndhF - rpl32 ) were identified. Overall, phylogenomic analysis based on 123 Ficus chloroplast genomes showed promise for studying the evolutionary relationships in Ficus , despite cyto-nuclear discordance. Furthermore, based on the phylogenetic performance of the F . sarmentosa complex and F . auriculata complex, the chloroplast genome also exhibited a promising phylogenetic resolution in closely related species."
https://openalex.org/W4313315838,"Multiple approaches have been used to investigate how musical cues are used to shape different emotions in music. The most prominent approach is a perception study, where musical stimuli varying in cue levels are assessed by participants in terms of their conveyed emotion. However, this approach limits the number of cues and combinations simultaneously investigated, since each variation produces another musical piece to be evaluated. Another less used approach is a production approach, where participants use cues to change the emotion conveyed in music, allowing participants to explore a larger number of cue combinations than the former approach. These approaches provide different levels of accuracy and economy for identifying how cues are used to convey different emotions in music. However, do these approaches provide converging results? This paper's aims are two-fold. The role of seven musical cues (tempo, pitch, dynamics, brightness, articulation, mode, and instrumentation) in communicating seven emotions (sadness, joy, calmness, anger, fear, power, and surprise) in music is investigated. Additionally, this paper explores whether the two approaches will yield similar findings on how the cues are used to shape different emotions in music. The first experiment utilises a production approach where participants adjust the cues in real-time to convey target emotions. The second experiment uses a perception approach where participants rate pre-rendered systematic variations of the stimuli for all emotions. Overall, the cues operated similarly in the majority (32/49) of cue-emotion combinations across both experiments, with the most variance produced by the dynamics and instrumentation cues. A comparison of the prediction accuracy rates of cue combinations representing the intended emotions found that prediction rates in Experiment 1 were higher than the ones obtained in Experiment 2, suggesting that a production approach may be a more efficient method to explore how cues are used to shape different emotions in music."
https://openalex.org/W4313315904,"The main objective of this study was to examine how homelessness and housing instability is captured across data sources in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Data from 2021 were extracted from three data repositories, including the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), the Homeless Operations Management System (HOMES), and the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). Using these three data sources, we identified the number of homeless and unstably housed veterans across a variety of indicators. The results showed that the use of diagnostic codes and clinic stop codes identified a large number of homeless and unstably housed veterans, but the use of HOMES and HMIS data identified additional homeless and unstably housed veterans to provide a complete count. A total of 290,431 unique veterans were identified as experiencing homelessness or housing instability in 2021 and there was regional variability in how homelessness and housing stability were captured across data sources, supporting the need for more uniform ways to operationalize these conditions. Together, these findings highlight the and encourage use of all available indicators and data sources to identify homelessness and housing instability in VHA. These methodologies applied to the largest healthcare system in the U.S. demonstrate their utility and possibilities for other healthcare systems. Transparent practices about data sources and indicators used to capture homelessness and housing instability should be shared to increase uniform use."
https://openalex.org/W4313315919,"Remdesivir (RDV) is the only antiviral drug approved for COVID-19 therapy by the FDA. Another drug LAGEVRIO™ (molnupiravir) though has not been approved yet by FDA but has been authorized on December 23, 2021, for emergency use to treat adults with mild-to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options are not clinically appropriate. The fact is that the efficacy of RDV is, however, limited in vivo though it is highly promising in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this paper we are focusing on the action mechanism of RDV and how it can be improved in vivo. The stability of RDV alone and on encapsulation with our platform technology based polymer NV-387 (NV-CoV-2), were compared in presence of plasma in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a non-clinical pharmacology study of NV-CoV-2 (Polymer) and NV CoV-2 (Polymer encapsulated Remdesivir) in both NL-63 infected and uninfected rats was done. In addition, the antiviral activity of NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R was compared with RDV in a cell culture study. The results are (i) NV-CoV-2 polymer encapsulation protects RDV from plasma-mediated catabolism in both in vitro and in vivo, studies; (ii) Body weight measurements of the normal (uninfected) rats after administration of the test materials (NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R) showed no toxic effects. (iii) Body weight measurements and survival rates of the NL-63 infected rats were similar to the uninfected rats after treatment with NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R. Overall, the efficacy as an antiviral regimens were found in this order as below; NV-CoV-2-R > NV-CoV-2 > RDV. Our platform technology based NV-387-encapsulated-RDV (NV-CoV-2-R) drug has a dual effect against different variants of the coronaviruses. First, NV-CoV-2 is an antiviral regimen. Secondly, RDV is protected from plasma-mediated degradation in transit. All together, NV-CoV-2-R is the safest and efficient regimen against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4313316060,"Tillage and crop residue management play an imperative role in soil physico-chemical properties that eventually affects crop productivity. The objective of the study to find out a compatible combination of tillage and crop residue management for achieving sustainable food production by improving soil properties, providing favorable environment to crop plants. Secondly, managing crop residues effectively to reduce environmental pollution arising due to crop residue burning. With this aim, a field experiment was conducted on six years continued running experiment under conservation agricultural practices during rabi season of 2019-20 on chickpea. The experiment was comprised of five tillage operations with or without crop residue in main plot and three levels of nutrients in sub plots laid out in split plot design with three replications. Reduced Tillage with 60cm residue height (RT60) was recorded higher growth and yield attributes over conventional tillage practice that attributed to economic yield enhancement. The percent yield increment under NT and RT with 30 and 60cm height residue retention varied from 6.91% to 9.67% over conventional tillage. Maximum grain (2380 kg ha-1) and biological output (5762 kg ha-1) was recorded under RT60 (T4), which ascribed to higher net return (Rs 60551 ha-1) and benefit-cost ratio (2.97). The augmentation in net monetary benefit among tillage systems was lies between 24.32% to 37.78% over conventional tillage. The seed protein content ranged between 20.38 to 21.69% among the treatments. Moreover, total N uptake was maximum under RT60, while total P and K uptake was higher in No Tillage with 30cm residue height (T1). No-Tillage with 60cm residue height (NT60) recorded relatively higher soil moisture content (SMC) (22.71 and 15.40%). Treatment NT30 accrued relatively higher value of soil bulk density (1.42 Mg m-3) followed by NT60 and RT60 in comparison to conventional tillage (1.34 Mg m-3). In conclusion, NT and RT with 60cm residue height along with STCR (N3) nutrient dose was found effective for sustainable food production."
https://openalex.org/W4313307218,"Background It is widely accepted that maternal healthcare is vital for improving maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Furthermore, the continuum of care–the integrated delivery of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care–has been shown to be particularly important. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest neonatal and maternal mortality rates in the world; significant improvements in the provision and utilisation of the continuum are urgently needed, therefore the barriers preventing access need to be better understood. This study aimed to identify key factors associated with the utilisation of maternal healthcare, in the Mchinji District of Malawi. Methods 4,244 pregnant women from the Mchinji District of Malawi were interviewed between March and December 2013. The overall utilisation of maternal healthcare was calculated by combining the use of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care into one variable—continuum of care. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the factors associated with utilisation of maternal healthcare. Results Utilisation of maternal healthcare in the Mchinji District was inadequate; only 24% of women received the recommended package. Being further from a healthcare facility (OR = 0.2, 95%CI = 0.04–0.96), having at least one live child (OR = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.84–0.99), previous experience of miscarriage (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.50–0.82) or abuse (OR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.69–0.95) reduced utilisation, whereas being in the richest 20% (OR = 1.33 95%CI = 1.08–1.65), having a planned pregnancy (OR = 1.3, 95%CI = 1.11–1.51) or more control over decisions (OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.80–1.49) increased utilisation. Conclusion Seven groups of women were identified as having an increased risk of low utilisation of maternal healthcare; women living &gt;5km from a healthcare facility, within the poorest socio-economic group, experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, with at least one live child, experience of a previous miscarriage, no control over their healthcare decisions or experience of abuse. Policy makers should pay extra attention to these high-risk groups when designing and delivering strategies to improve maternal healthcare utilisation."
https://openalex.org/W4313307766,"Problematic internet use (PIU) can cause mental and physical harm to individuals and may be an emerging factor contributing to unsafe work behavior. In this study, the relationship between PIU and safety behavior was investigated. Moreover, it was hypothesized that safety climate can moderate the relationship between PIU and safety behavior. Participants were employees from a mining industry in Iran. Three validated questionnaires were distributed to gather the required data regarding PIU, safety climate, and safety behavior. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to assess the moderating effect of safety climate on the relationship between PIU and safety behavior. The size of moderation effect was assessed using f2 index. Four hundred eighty-five employees participated in this study. The results demonstrated a negative relationship between PIU and safety behavior. The moderating effect of safety climate on the relationship between PIU and safety behavior was supported. The f2 index was 0.027 which demonstrates a small moderation effect. In conclusion, PIU has a significant negative effect on the safety behavior of employees. Providing a strong safety climate can be a long-term solution for reducing the negative effect of PIU on safety behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4313315749,"The accurate characterization of structural variation is crucial for our understanding of how large chromosomal alterations affect phenotypic differences and contribute to genome evolution. Whole-genome sequencing is a popular approach for identifying structural variants, but the accuracy of popular tools remains unclear due to the limitations of existing benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of these tools for predicting variants in non-human genomes is less certain, as most tools were developed and benchmarked using data from the human genome. To evaluate the use of long-read data for the validation of short-read structural variant calls, the agreement between predictions from a short-read ensemble learning method and long-read tools were compared using real and simulated data from Caenorhabditis elegans. The results obtained from simulated data indicate that the best performing tool is contingent on the type and size of the variant, as well as the sequencing depth of coverage. These results also highlight the need for reference datasets generated from real data that can be used as 'ground truth' in benchmarks."

https://openalex.org/W4313315922,"An estimated 22 million Ethiopian women between the ages of 15 and 49 are affected by cervical cancer each year, with 7095 cases and 4732 fatalities. Cervical cancer screening is one of the prevention methods, although Ethiopia has a low coverage rate. Furthermore, data on the use of cervical cancer screening services in the country is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to assess cervical cancer screening practices and its associated factors among females of reproductive age in Durame, Southern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted using a multi-stage sampling technique among 460 females of reproductive age from March to April 2020. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 20. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were carried out to determine the association between independent and dependent variables. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a P-value < 0.05 were used to declare the statistical association.We found that cervical cancer screening practice in this study was 13.8% [95% CI:(10.4-17.2)]. Having a positive attitude [AOR = 5.2, 95% CI:(1.4, 20.0)], having a good knowledge [AOR = 5.4, 95% CI:(1.5,19.5)], being informed about cervical cancer by health professionals [AOR = 3.5, 95% CI:(1.3,9.8)], average monthly income greater than 3000 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) [AOR = 4.9, 95% CI:(1.1, 22)], and having a history of sexually transmitted infections [AOR = 4.2, 95% CI:(1.4,12.85)] were the factors associated with cervical cancer screening practice.The practice of cervical cancer screening was found to be very low, being influenced by women's attitudes, knowledge, having health professionals as sources of information, monthly income, and history of sexually transmitted infections. Thus, it is necessary to increase awareness and knowledge about cervical cancer and improve attitudes toward cervical screening services to improve the uptake of the screening. Health professionals also have to play a pivotal role in properly addressing information about cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4313364480,"To ensure that students continued receiving adequate yet safe clinical exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Faculty of Medicine at Universitas Indonesia (FMUI) created the Module of COVID-19 Self-Isolation Monitoring which aims to equip students with the knowledge and skill to monitor confirmed and close contact cases of COVID-19. Module development, divided into four phases: preparation, orientation, implementation, and evaluation phase, started as soon as the delta wave of COVID-19 cases forced medical students to halt their offline clinical rotations. A quantitative secondary data were obtained from student and patient satisfaction questionnaires and on students’ performance and reflection. We analyzed the distribution of module evaluation, the student’s discussion score during the module, the students’ interest in participating as Covid-19 volunteers before and after the module’s deployment, and the correlation between learning outcomes and satisfaction. A total of 372 patients were monitored by 208 students during the 4-week module. The response rates were above 80%, with the majority agreeing that students found this module well-organized and fulfilled their expectations. There was a significant increase in discussion scores from weeks 1 to 4, a significant difference in the proportion of students interested in COVID-19 volunteering before and after the module completion as well as a significant low correlation between the patient’s monitoring score sheet and the reflection essay towards the patient’s satisfaction. We should still improve tutors’ time management, tutors’ provision of triggering questions for critical thinking skills, and tutors’ feedback for students. The module met patient expectations and is expected to assist tutors in providing feedback and examples of doctor–patient communication, thus accelerating students’ competence in patient interaction. Further evaluation is needed regarding knowledge transfer, the impact on community health, and the faculty development program, especially regarding how tutors fulfill their roles as medical educators."
https://openalex.org/W4313364656,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used diagnostic that observes the heart activities of patients to ascertain a heart abnormality diagnosis. The artifacts or noises are primarily associated with the problem of ECG signal processing. Conventional denoising techniques have been proposed in previous literature; however, some lacks, such as the determination of suitable wavelet basis function and threshold, can be a time-consuming process. This paper presents end-to-end learning using a denoising auto-encoder (DAE) for denoising algorithms and convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory (ConvBiLSTM) for ECG delineation to classify ECG waveforms in terms of the PQRST-wave and isoelectric lines. The denoising reconstruction using unsupervised learning based on the encoder-decoder process can be proposed to improve the drawbacks. First, The ECG signals are reduced to a low-dimensional vector in the encoder. Second, the decoder reconstructed the signals. The last, the reconstructed signals of ECG can be processed to ConvBiLSTM. The proposed architecture of DAE-ConvBiLSTM is the end-to-end diagnosis of heart abnormality detection.As a result, the performance of DAE-ConvBiLSTM has obtained an average of above 98.59% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score from the existing studies. The DAE-ConvBiLSTM has also experimented with detecting T-wave (due to ventricular repolarisation) morphology abnormalities.The development architecture for detecting heart abnormalities using an unsupervised learning DAE and supervised learning ConvBiLSTM can be proposed for an end-to-end learning algorithm. In the future, the precise accuracy of the ECG main waveform will affect heart abnormalities detection in clinical practice."

We analyzed relationships between GLS (cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) and monocyte activation (flow cytometry) among 20 WWH and 14 women without HIV.WWH had lower GLS compared to women without HIV (WWH vs. women without HIV: 19.4±3.0 vs. 23.1±1.9%, P<0.0001). Among the whole group, HIV status was an independent predictor of lower GLS. Among WWH (but not among women without HIV), lower GLS related to a higher density of expression of HLA-DR on the surface of CD14+CD16+ monocytes (ρ = -0.45, P = 0.0475). Further, among WWH, inflammatory monocyte activation predicted lower GLS, even after controlling for CD4+ T-cell count and HIV viral load.Additional studies among WWH are needed to examine the role of inflammatory monocyte activation in the pathogenesis of lower GLS and to determine whether targeting this immune pathway may mitigate risks of heart failure and/or adverse heart failure outcomes.Clinical trials.gov registration: NCT02874703."
https://openalex.org/W4313307103,"Although studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 on mental health, few studies have attempted to compare the prevalence of depression/anxiety symptoms among U.S. adults before and after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. We examined the prevalence and association between depression/anxiety symptoms and COVID-19 pandemic declaration among U.S. adult population and subgroups.A nationally representative cross-sectional study of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, Cycle 4) assessing health-related information and behaviors in U.S. adults aged ≥18 years from February through June 2020. The primary dependent variable was current depression/anxiety derived from Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The main independent variable was responses before and after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration in addition to sexual identity heterosexual identity, /race/ethnicity and rural-urban commuting areas. Covariates were sociodemographic factors, and health risk behaviors. Weighted percentages, multivariable logistic regression, and Chi-square tests were used to establish the prevalence and association between current depression/anxiety and the independent variables and covariates.A total of 3,865 participants completed the survey and included 35.3% of the participants before the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Most of the sample were aged 50-64 years [33.0%]; males [51.0%]; and non-Hispanic Whites [70.1%]). The post-pandemic declaration included participants, aged 35-49 years [27.0%]; females [52.6%]; and non-Hispanic Whites [59.6%]). The prevalence of depression/anxiety was higher after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration (32.2%) than before the declaration (29.9%). Higher risks of depression/anxiety symptoms after the declaration were associated with being a sexual minority ([adjusted odds ratio] AOR, 2.91 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-6.14]) and having fair/poor general health (AOR, 2.91 [95% CI, 1.76-4.83]). The probability of experiencing depression/anxiety symptoms after the declaration was highest among homosexuals/lesbians/gays (65.6%) compared to bisexuals (39.6%), and heterosexuals (30.1%).In this study, young adults, non-Hispanic Whites, and those with fair/poor general health had a higher burden of depression/anxiety symptoms after the pandemic declaration. The development of psychological support strategies to promote wellbeing during the pandemic may reduce psychological distress in the population, especially among at-risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W4313307320,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked with increased reports of depression, anxiety, and stress. Stay-at-home directives during the pandemic-imposed lifestyle changes, including eating and sedentary behaviors that can further undermine mental health outcomes. Physical activity is a vital component for metabolic health, as well as for mental health by serving as an active coping strategy to manage stress and promote resilience. Global reports of increased sedentary leisure behaviors have been associated with feelings of depression and anxiety, but it unclear whether the relationship between physical activity and depression or anxiety persists over time. In this longitudinal study, we investigated (i) whether physical activity at the onset of the pandemic was related to feelings of depression or anxiety over time and (ii) whether this relationship was mediated by stress appraisals during the pandemic. We surveyed 319 adults living in Canada or the United States to assess physical activity, stress appraisals, and mental health outcomes at two time points over a 6-month period. We found a reduction in leisure-time physical activity that was linked to subsequent feelings of depression. Furthermore, individuals with lower levels of physical activity were more likely to appraise their COVID-19 situation to be uncontrollable at pandemic onset and as the pandemic continued. Stress appraisals of threat and uncontrollability were also positively related to feelings of depression. Modelling these three factors together showed that appraising a situation as uncontrollable mediated the relationship between initial physical activity and subsequent depressive feelings. Although correlational, these data highlight the protective role of leisure-time physical activity against worsened mental health outcomes during periods of prolonged stress."
https://openalex.org/W4313307332,"Movement behaviors have been associated with mental health. The purposes of this study were to examine the association between movement behaviors and scores of depression/anxiety among adolescents and to determine the difference in depression/anxiety associated with reallocating time between different movement behaviors. This cross-sectional study included 217 Brazilian adolescents (15 to 18 years old, 49.3% female). Adolescents wore an accelerometer for one week to assess the four-movement behaviors which include sleep, sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The depression/anxiety score was calculated by factor analysis using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Compositional data analyses were used to examine the association between movement behavior and the depression/anxiety score. Compositional isotemporal substitution models estimated the change in depression/anxiety score associated with reallocating 10, 30, and 60 min between movement behaviors. The composition of movement behaviors was significantly associated with depression/anxiety scores (p < 0.05). Replacing time from SB to LPA was associated with improvement in the depression/anxiety score, while the inverse was associated with an increase in this score. Replacing time of LPA with MVPA was associated with worsening in the depression/anxiety score. The 24-h time distribution of the day may play a crucial role in mental health. Compositions with more time spent in LPA at the expense of less SB are associated with improvement in the scores of depression/anxiety. The type of MVPA may moderate its effects on depression/anxiety in adolescents. Holistic interventions including the full range of movement behaviors may be a gateway to reduce the levels of depression/anxiety in adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W4313307574,"The study of nutraceuticals and their connection to immunity is an expanding field of research. The use of nutraceuticals to alleviate stress and enhance immunity in adverse aquaculture environments have been examined to a certain extent. To elucidate the understanding, we focused on the immunological effect of membrane-separated 13% anthocyanin standardized elderberry (EB) extract with maltodextrin excipient, widely used first-line nutraceuticals to augment the immunity, in aquaculture fish, Nile tilapia. To evaluate the potential of EB-extract, we assessed their capability to enhance lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 production in an in-vitro condition using spleen and thymus lymphocytes. The experiments on spleen and thymus T-cells demonstrated significantly higher T-cell proliferation by EB-extract when lectin mitogen Con A was present as a stimulator. Likewise, our spleen B-cell proliferation result reveals a significant effect of EB-extracts, along with B-cell stimulator non-lectin mitogen LPS. Further, the quantification of IL-2 indicates elevated IL-2 levels when spleen T-cells were cultured with EB-extracts and with Con A present as a stimulator. These suggest that 13% anthocyanin standardized EB-extracts can aggrandize fish cells' cellular and humoral immune responses. With further research, elderberry extracts could be used to supplement commercial feed in aquaculture to reduce stress and stimulate the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W4313307763,"The treatment of diabetic wound is a focus issue. At present, the Nocardia rubra cell wall skeleton (Nr-CWS) has been proved proven to promote angiogenesis and wound repair. Unfortunately, the high-glucose diabetic wound environment makes many drugs unable to be released effectively, and soon be removed. Smart thermosensitive poloxamer hydrogel (TH) is an ideal and adjustable drug delivery platform compatible with most living tissues. Here, a multifunctional composite thermosensitive hydrogel was developed. A mixture of poloxamers 407 and 188 as the gel matrix, and then it was physically mixed with Nr-CWS. The delivery vehicle not only controlled its release stably, preventing degradation in vitro, but also showed good affinity in vitro. In vivo, compared with thermosensitive poloxamer hydrogel alone or the direct use of Nr-CWS, the thermosensitive poloxamer hydrogel loaded with Nr-CWS promoted the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells effectively, resulting in increased expression of derma-related structural proteins and enhanced angiogenesis and wound healing. This study indicated that the angiogenesis and skin regeneration brought by Nr-CWS hydrogel are related to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and protein kinase B, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4313307779,"Beyond physical and zootechnical characteristics, the process of animal domestication has also altered how domesticated individuals, compared to their wild counterparts, perceive, process, and interact with their environment. Little is known, however, on whether and how domestication altered the perception of conspecific calls on both domesticated and wild breeds. In the present work, we compared the vigilance behavior of domestic and captive-born wild fowl following the playback of chicken alarm calls and contentment calls (control). The playback tests were performed on four different breeds/lines. We first compared the behavioral reaction of domesticated White Leghorn (WL, a breed selected for egg production) and Red Junglefowl (RJF) hens (ancestor of domestic chickens). We also compared the behavior of Red Junglefowl hens selected for high or low fear of humans (RJF HF and RJF LF, respectively), a proxy to investigate early effects of domestication. Contrary to our expectations, no breed/line reacted accordingly to the calls, as the increase in vigilance behavior after the playback calls was similar for both alarm and contentment calls. Although no call discrimination differences were found, breeds did differ on how they reacted/habituated to the calls. Overall, WL were more vigilant than RJF, and birds from the RJF LF line decreased their vigilance over testing days, while this was not the case for the RJF HF line. These results suggest that birds under commercial-like conditions are unable to discriminate between alarm and contentment calls. Interestingly, domestication and selection for low fear of humans may have altered how birds react to vocal stimuli. It is important to consider that farmed animals may interpret and be affected by the vocalizations of their conspecifics in unexpected ways, which warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4313307780,"Tractor rollover is regarded as the most fatal incident in agricultural production, but some of which can be avoided by timely anti-rollover warning and active control. There have been a lot of researches on the tractor rollover model building and rollover protective structure designing but few on the anti-rollover control. The purpose of this study is to develop a cheaper and practical anti-rollover control system based on active steering technique and to prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme for the wheeled tractors. A three-degree-of-freedom rollover dynamics model including automatic steering system is established. A control scheme by adjusting the roll angle to keep the stability based on the adaptive sliding mode control is proposed with the estimated lateral velocity according to the feedback correction principle. Front wheel angle tracking controller is designed adopting internal model control (IMC) theory. Simulation results exhibit that the active anti-rollover control can calculate the stability index in real time and can keep it within the stable range by adjusting the front steering wheel angle. It is prospective for the proposed scheme to provide a valuable reference to reduce tractor rollover accidents."
https://openalex.org/W4313307787,"The Extended Crosswise Model (ECWM) is a randomized response model with neutral response categories, relatively simple instructions, and the availability of a goodness-of-fit test. This paper refines this model with a number sequence randomizer that virtually precludes the possibility to give evasive responses. The motivation for developing this model stems from a strategic priority of WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) to monitor the prevalence of doping use by elite athletes. For this model we derived a maximum likelihood estimator that allows for binary logistic regression analysis. Three studies were conducted on online platforms with a total of over 6, 000 respondents; two on controlled substance use and one on compliance with COVID-19 regulations in the UK during the first lockdown. The results of these studies are promising. The goodness-of-fit tests showed little to no evidence for response biases, and the ECWM yielded higher prevalence estimates than direct questions for sensitive questions, and similar ones for non-sensitive questions. Furthermore, the randomizer with the shortest number sequences yielded the smallest response error rates on a control question with known prevalence."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of breakthrough VH secondary to PCV. Data of patients receiving pars plana vitrectomy for breakthrough VH secondary to PCV (VH group) were evaluated retrospectively and compared statistically to data of age and sex-matched PCV patients without breakthrough VH (control group). Among PCV patients, 36 eyes with breakthrough VH and 62 eyes without VH were included. Compared with baseline, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was worse in the VH group ( P &lt; 0.001), and improved postoperatively (P &lt; 0.001). Percentages of pigmented epithelial detachment (PED), hemorrhagic PED, massive subretinal hemorrhage, hemorrhagic retinal detachment (RD), and hemorrhagic choroidal detachment (CD) (P = 0.007) were higher in the VH group ( P &lt; 0.001). Incidence of choroidal vascular hyperpermeability ( P &lt; 0.001), massive subretinal hemorrhage ( P = 0.001), hemorrhagic retinal detachment ( P = 0.001) and hemorrhagic type PCV ( P = 0.001) was higher in patients with pachychoroid PCV, while fibrovascular type had lower incidence ( P &lt; 0.001). Better initial BCVA ( P &lt; 0.001), higher frequency of anti-VEGF treatment ( P = 0.009), and previous photodynamic therapy ( P = 0.017) showed better visual outcomes. Breakthrough VH risk is higher in PCV patients with massive subretinal hemorrhage, hemorrhagic PED and hemorrhagic RD. BCVA and hemorrhagic complications improve significantly postoperatively. Higher frequency of anti-VEGF treatment and previous photodynamic therapy are associated with better visual prognosis in PCV patients with breakthrough VH."
https://openalex.org/W4313307858,"Bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontitis have been the subject of many studies. However, the relationship between skull (including mandible) BMD and periodontitis has not been extensively studied. An objective of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between skull BMD and periodontitis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for 2011-2012 and 2013-2014.From NHANES 2011-2014, 3802 participants aged 30-59 were selected. We divided the skull BMD level into quartiles to check the distribution of variables. Periodontitis was defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Association of Periodontology (AAP) in 2012. Multivariate logical regression analysis was used to explore the independent relationship between skull BMD and periodontitis. The generalized additive model (GAM), smooth curve fitting (penalty spline) and threshold effect analysis was used to evaluate dose-response relationship between skull BMD and periodontitis and the potential nonlinear relationship between skull BMD and periodontitis. Finally, subgroup analysis and interaction test were conducted to determine the role of covariates between skull BMD and periodontitis.The overall average skull BMD of 3802 participants was 2.24g/cm2, the average age was 43.94 years, and the prevalence of periodontitis was 41.03%. In the fully adjusted logistic regression model, skull BMD and periodontitis showed an independent negative correlation (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.90, P = 0.0032) and a linear relationship. Compared with the lowest quartile array (Q1:1.22-1.98) of skull BMD, the highest quartile array(Q4: 2.47-3.79) had a significantly lower risk of periodontitis (OR 0.70,95% CI 0.56-0.87, P = 0.0014). Subgroup analysis showed a highly consistent negative correlation between skull BMD and periodontitis. In the interaction test, people with moderate poverty income ratio (1.57-3.62) and those who had more than 12 alcohol drinks in the past year had a lower risk of periodontitis.This result suggested that periodontal disease can be related to low skull BMD, for those people, oral hygiene and health care should be more closely monitored. Validation of our findings will require further research."
https://openalex.org/W4313315522,"Improving culture and tourism integration efficiency is an important way to promote the high-quality development of cultural tourism. According to the inherent requirements of high-quality development, this paper constructed an evaluation indicator system for culture and tourism integration efficiency. Then, the culture and tourism integration efficiency of 16 cities in Shandong Province, China during the period from 2010 to 2019 was measured with the benevolent DEA cross-efficiency model. On the basis of exploratory spatial data analysis and dynamic spatial Durbin model, we explored the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and influencing factors of culture and tourism integration efficiency in Shandong Province. The results show that from 2010 to 2019, the culture and tourism integration efficiency in Shandong Province has experienced three stages of ""rapid growth-rapid decline-stable rise period"". The spatial pattern has changed from ""high in the east and low in the west"" to ""high in the central and low in the north and south"", and regions with high integration efficiency are mainly concentrated in Jiaodong Peninsula. The level of economic development significantly promotes the culture and tourism integration efficiency in local and neighboring cities in the short and long term, while policy environment has a significant negative impact. Traffic conditions and human capital only promote the culture and tourism integration efficiency in local cities. The level of information development and openness degree only have a long-term effect on the culture and tourism integration efficiency, without short-term effect. The research results are of great significance to improve the growth quality and sustainable development of cultural tourism in Shandong Province. Our work could provide a scientific basis for maximizing the allocation benefits of cultural and tourism resources in similar regions in the world."
https://openalex.org/W4313315664,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated potential in detecting tuberculosis (TB) associated abnormalities from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Thus, they might provide a solution to radiologist shortages in high TB burden countries. However, the cost of implementing computer-aided detection (CAD) software has thus far been understudied. In this study, we performed a costing analysis of CAD software when used as a screening or triage test for pulmonary TB, estimated the incremental cost compared to a radiologist reading of different throughput scenarios, and predicted the cost for the national scale-up plan in Pakistan.For the study, we focused on CAD software reviewed by the World Health Organization (CAD4TB, Lunit INSIGHT CXR, qXR) or listed in the Global Drug Facility diagnostics catalogue (CAD4TB, InferRead). Costing information was obtained from the CAD software developers. CAD4TB and InferRead use a perpetual license pricing model, while Lunit and qXR are priced per license for restricted number of scans. A major implementer in Pakistan provided costing information for human resource and software training. The per-screen cost was estimated for each CAD software and for radiologist for 1) active case finding, and 2) facility based CXR testing scenarios with throughputs ranging from 50,000-100,000 scans. Moreover, we estimated the scale-up cost for CAD or radiologist CXR reading in Pakistan based on the National Strategic Plan, considering that to reach 80% diagnostic coverage, 50% of TB patients would need to be found through facility-based triage and 30% through active case finding (ACF).The per-screen cost for CAD4TB (0.25 USD- 2.33 USD) and InferRead (0.19 USD- 2.78 USD) was lower than that of a radiologist (0.70 USD- 0.93 USD) for high throughput scenarios studied. In comparison, the per-screen cost for Lunit (0.94 USD- 1.69 USD) and qXR (0.95 USD-1.9 USD) were only comparable with that of the radiologists in the highest throughput scenario in ACF. To achieve 80 percent diagnostic coverage at scale in Pakistan, the projected additional cost of deploying CAD software to complement the current infrastructure over a four-year period were estimated at 2.65-19.23 million USD, whereas Human readers, would cost an additional 23.97 million USD.Our findings suggest that using CAD software could enable large-scale screening programs in high TB-burden countries and be less costly than radiologist. To achieve minimum cost, the target number of screens in a specific screening strategy should be carefully considered when selecting CAD software, along with the offered pricing structure and other aspects such as performance and operational features. Integrating CAD software in implementation strategies for case finding could be an economical way to attain the intended programmatic goals."
https://openalex.org/W4313315758,"Inter-row vegetation in vineyards is classified as a service crop as it provides many ecosystem services. The vegetation is often removed but maintaining them can mitigate the negative effects on the environment. However, the type of species or mixture choice can affect their success. A field trial was conducted in an organically-managed vineyard of Cabernet sauvignon Vitis vinifera L. cultivars in north-eastern Italy, in which three blends of grass species ( Shedonorus arundinaceus , Lolium perenne and Festuca rubra ) and two grass-legume mixtures were grown in the inter-rows and compared with resident vegetation and regularly tilled bare soil. Each vegetation type, including resident vegetation, was subjected to mulching and non-mulching treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of seeded species or mixtures in the inter-row spaces of the vineyard in north-Italy as an alternative management to resident vegetation and tilled soil. The experiment was conducted over two years to monitor the persistence of the sown vegetation and the influence of vegetation types on vine performance and grape composition, and on soil compaction and erosion. The relative abundances of each species, vegetation height, percentage green cover and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), vine shoot length, number of leaves per vine shoot, leaf area, bunch weight, vine NDVI, soil compaction and erosion, and depth and width of tractor tyre prints were measured. Over time, weed invasion altered the botanical composition of all vegetation types except for the S . arundinaceus blend, which remained stable throughout the study period. Our results showed that vine parameters were not affected by the type of vegetation in the inter-rows, nor were there differences between the grassed and bare soil inter-rows. Soil compaction and erosion, and tractor tyre prints were not directly affected by the type of vegetation cover, but they were affected by tillage in the plots with bare soil in the inter-rows or where it was used to prepare the soil for sowing. Soil compaction and erosion were related to the percentage vegetation cover. Mulching did not affect any of the parameters measured. Therefore, species selection plays a crucial role in inter-row vegetation management and in minimising environmental impacts. S . arundinaceus gave high protection against soil erosion due to its high persistence throughout the year and had the lowest growth rate thus requiring fewer cuttings."

Relevant data on patient such as clinical/biological characteristics and sample handling are also collected. For this, our aim was to establish a Quality Management System (QMS) to meet the reliability and quality requirements necessary for its scientific exploitation.The COMET QMS includes: (1) Quality Assurance to standardize all stages of the biobanking process, (2) Quality Controls on samples from the first patients included in order to validate the sample management process and ensure reproducible quality; and 3) ""in process"" Quality Controls to ensure the reliability of the storage procedures and the stability of the samples over time.For serum and plasma, several corrective actions, such as temperature handling and centrifugation conditions, were made to the protocol and led to improvement of the volume and quality of samples. Regarding DNA, all samples evaluated achieved a satisfactory level of purity and integrity and most of them yielded the required DNA quantity. All frozen tissue samples had RNAs of good purity. RNA quality was confirmed by RIN, achieving values in most cases over 7 and efficient amplification of housekeeping genes by RT-qPCR, with no significant differences among samples from the same tissue type. In the ""in process"" Quality Controls, DNA, RNA, and histological integrity of tissues showed no differences among samples after different preservation times.Quality Control results have made it possible to validate the entire biobank process and confirm the utility of implementing QMS to guarantee the quality of a biospecimen collection."
https://openalex.org/W4313307075,"Small teleosts have recently been established as models of human diseases. However, measuring heart rate by electrocardiography is highly invasive for small fish and not widely used. The physiological nature and function of vertebrate autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of the heart has traditionally been investigated in larvae, transparent but with an immature ANS, or in anesthetized adults, whose ANS activity may possibly be disturbed under anesthesia. Here, we defined the frequency characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) modulated by the ANS from observations of heart movement in high-speed movie images and changes in ANS regulation under environmental stimulation in unanesthetized adult medaka (Oryzias latipes). The HRV was significantly reduced by atropine (1 mM) in the 0.25-0.65 Hz and by propranolol (100 μM) at 0.65-1.25 Hz range, suggesting that HRV in adult medaka is modulated by both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems within these frequency ranges. Such modulations of HRV by the ANS in adult medaka were remarkably suppressed under anesthesia and continuous exposure to light suppressed HRV only in the 0.25-0.65 Hz range, indicating parasympathetic withdrawal. Furthermore, pre-hatching embryos did not show HRV and the power of HRV developed as fish grew. These results strongly suggest that ANS modulation of the heart in adult medaka is frequency-dependent phenomenon, and that the impact of long-term environmental stimuli on ANS activities, in addition to development of ANS activities, can be precisely evaluated in medaka using the presented method."
https://openalex.org/W4313307080,"We experimentally created a particle size dataset that is based on reduction sequences and raw materials typical of the Middle and Later Stone Age in southern Africa. The reason for creating this new dataset is that current particle size frameworks are based, almost exclusively, on flint and western European knapping methods. We produced the dataset using knapping methods and raw materials frequently encountered in the southern African archaeological record because we wanted to test whether it has the same distribution as particle size datasets experimentally created in Europe, and to initialise the production of a database for use in the analysis of lithic assemblages from southern African Late Pleistocene deposits. We reduced 117 cores of quartz, quartzite, jasper, chalcedony, hornfels, and rhyolite. The knapping methods selected were unidirectional, discoidal, Levallois recurrent and bipolar flaking. In this article we compare this new particle size distribution dataset with the results obtained from previous experiments. We found that the southern African dataset shows a wider size range distribution, which seems to be explained by differences in knapping methods and raw materials. Our results show that there is overlap between the distribution of the southern African experimental knapping dataset and the sorting experiment conducted by Lenoble on flint artefacts in a runoff context. This article shows that a particle size analysis is not sufficient on its own to assess the perturbation of an archaeological assemblage and must be coupled with other analytical tools."
https://openalex.org/W4313307110,"Rescue centres play an important role in the protection of raptors living in the wild by caring for injured or debilitated animals and abandoned young with the aim of returning them to the wild. A total of 22,538 raptors were admitted to 34 rescue centres in the Czech Republic in the years 2010-2019, with an increasing trend during the monitored period (rSp = 0.7333, p < 0.05). The most frequent reasons for their admission were other injuries and fractures (26.52%), the admission of young (22.98%), and the admission of raptors injured by electric shock injuries (20.51%). It proved possible to release 42.45% of admitted raptors back into the wild, the majority of which (91.05%) were released using the hard-release method. Foster parents were used in 1% of cases and a replacement nest in 0.2% of cases involving the rearing of young. In spite of all the care provided at rescue centres, a total of 39.97% of raptors admitted either died or had to be euthanized. Among them, most raptors were euthanized or died due to injuries caused by collision with a vehicle, electric shock injuries, and other injuries. This generally occurred shortly after admission (a median of two days). The importance of the work of rescue centres lies not merely in returning injured raptors back into the wild (which proves possible in around half of all cases), but also in obtaining information about the factors endangering raptors in the wild and contributing toward a decline in their populations. The findings provide information about human-wildlife interactions in the Czech Republic and their implications for conservation as well as on the effectiveness of rescue centres to successfully treat and subsequently release raptors back into the wild."
https://openalex.org/W4313307177,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by extreme mood shifts during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (MC) due to abnormal sensitivity to neurosteroids and unbalanced neural excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio. We hypothesized that in women with PMDD in the luteal phase, these factors would alter the frequency of magnetoencephalographic visual gamma oscillations, affect modulation of their power by excitatory drive, and decrease perceptual spatial suppression. Women with PMDD and control women were examined twice–during the follicular and luteal phases of their MC. We recorded visual gamma response (GR) while modulating the excitatory drive by increasing the drift rate of the high-contrast grating (static, ‘slow’, ‘medium’, and ‘fast’). Contrary to our expectations, GR frequency was not affected in women with PMDD in either phase of the MC. GR power suppression, which is normally associated with a switch from the ‘optimal’ for GR slow drift rate to the medium drift rate, was reduced in women with PMDD and was the only GR parameter that distinguished them from control participants specifically in the luteal phase and predicted severity of their premenstrual symptoms. Over and above the atypical luteal GR suppression, in both phases of the MC women with PMDD had abnormally strong GR facilitation caused by a switch from the ‘suboptimal’ static to the ‘optimal’ slow drift rate. Perceptual spatial suppression did not differ between the groups but decreased from the follicular to the luteal phase only in PMDD women. The atypical modulation of GR power suggests that neuronal excitability in the visual cortex is constitutively elevated in PMDD and that this E/I imbalance is further exacerbated during the luteal phase. However, the unaltered GR frequency does not support the hypothesis of inhibitory neuron dysfunction in PMDD."
https://openalex.org/W4313307594,"With the rapid development of global technology, many firms have entered the product-sharing market, where business-to-consumer (B2C), peer-to-peer (P2P), and hybrid rental services are the three most common business models. The difference between these models lies in the product provider. The product provider in B2C mode is enterprises, while in P2P mode, individuals provide the products, and both enterprises and individuals provide the products in hybrid mode. We employ a game model to analyze the influence of a B2C platform introducing P2P sharing service by comparing the profit of the platform and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) under each of the three models. Our findings indicate that introducing P2P service always benefits the B2C platform but sometimes harms the OEM. Our findings also indicate that as the quality of the platform’s products improves, the profit improvement brought to the B2C platform by introducing P2P sharing decreases. We find that the impact of introducing P2P service also varies with consumer behaviors. For example, with increasing consumer usage level, the B2C platform’s profit improvement brought by introducing P2P sharing increases. Furthermore, we determine the optimal pricing strategies of the OEM and sharing platform in B2C mode and in hybrid mode."
https://openalex.org/W4313307642,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly metastatic and of poor prognosis. Metastasis involves coordinated actin filament dynamics mediated by cofilin and associated proteins. Activated androgen receptor (AR) is believed to contribute to TNBC tumorigenesis. Our current work studied roles of activated AR and cofilin phospho-regulation during migration of three AR+ TNBC cell lines to determine if altered cofilin regulation can explain their migratory differences. Untreated or AR agonist-treated BT549, MDA-MB-453, and SUM159PT cells were compared to cells silenced for cofilin (KD) or AR expression/function (bicalutamide). Cofilin-1 was found to be the only ADF/cofilin isoform expressed in each TNBC line. Despite a significant increase in cofilin kinase caused by androgens, the ratio of cofilin:p-cofilin (1:1) did not change in SUM159PT cells. BT549 and MDA-MB-453 cells contain high p-cofilin levels which underwent androgen-induced dephosphorylation through increased cofilin phosphatase expression, but surprisingly maintain a leading-edge with high p-cofilin/total cofilin not found in SUM159PT cells. Androgens enhanced cell polarization in all lines, stimulated wound healing and transwell migration rates and increased N/E-cadherin mRNA ratios while reducing cell adhesion in BT549 and MDA-MB-453 cells. Cofilin KD negated androgen effects in MDA-MB-453 except for cell adhesion, while in BT549 cells it abrogated androgen-reduced cell adhesion. In SUM159PT cells, cofilin KD with and without androgens had similar effects in almost all processes studied. AR dependency of the processes were confirmed. In conclusion, cofilin regulation downstream of active AR is dependent on which actin-mediated process is being examined in addition to being cell line-specific. Although MDA-MB-453 cells demonstrated some control of cofilin through an AR-dependent mechanism, other AR-dependent pathways need to be further studied. Non-cofilin-dependent mechanisms that modulate migration of SUM159PT cells need to be investigated. Categorizing TNBC behavior as AR responsive and/or cofilin dependent can inform on decisions for therapeutic treatment."

Women in the reproductive age group, and by extension their unborn babies may therefore be at increased risk. The prevalence of Rubella virus specific IgM and IgG antibodies, including IgG avidity, was determined in pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at a Teaching Hospital in Ghana.One hundred and forty-five women in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy from the outpatient clinic were recruited over a period of 2 months after written informed consent was obtained. Study participants completed a questionnaire and venous blood drawn for IgM, IgG, and avidity testing using SERION ELISA (SERION® Immunologics, Würzburg, Germany). Babies of mothers with positive or indeterminate IgM and low avidity IgG antibodies were offered specialist cardiological, ophthalmological or hearing assessment during follow up.One hundred and twenty-eight (88.3%) had only IgG antibodies, 5 (3.4%) had IgM and IgG antibodies, while 12 (8.3%) had no antibodies. No patient had IgM antibodies alone. Ten women (6.9%) had indeterminate levels of IgM antibodies. Majority of the women had high avidity IgG antibodies, while 5 (3.4%) had low avidity antibodies. No patient had IgM with low avidity antibodies. There was no statistical association between socio-demographic factors and the presence of IgM, IgG (low or high avidity) antibodies. Of all the children followed, none had the clinical definition of CRS.Consistent with the World Health Organization elimination strategy for measles and rubella viruses, non-immune women in the reproductive age group should be vaccinated. The immunization programme should be expanded to include teenagers and adults. Though Congenital Rubella Syndrome was not detected, the risk still remains."
https://openalex.org/W4313307762,"Background Corona (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. The World Health Organization has recommended several preventive measures for COVID-19 and African countries, including Ethiopia had accepted and engaged in the recommended preventive measures. Adherence to COVID-19 prevention measure is still a big problem; however, the level of adherence to preventive measures had not reported in Ethiopia among students and there is an information gap, therefore, this study conducted to fill the information gap on level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures among students. Objective This study aimed to assess the level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures and its associated factors among high school students in Jimma Town public High Schools in southwest Ethiopia, 2021. Methods sand materials An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 404 systematically selected high school students from Jimma town from July 15 to August 2, 2021. The sample size was determined using a single-population proportion formula, and data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured and pretested questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi-data manager 4.4.2.1 then exported to Stata 14 for cleaning and analysis. Bivariate and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were declared to identify significant variables. Finally; significant factors were determined at a significance level of &lt;0.05. Results Of 388 students included in the analysis, approximately 14.7% (95%CI: 11.51–18.60) of students had good level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures.Only 6.9%of participants had good knowledge where as approximately half of the respondents had favorable attitude toward COVID-19 preventive measures. Factors such as Female gender (AOR = 1.03(95%CI: 1.01–1.74), access to water and soap (AOR = 2.11(95%CI: 1.06–4.19) andattitude (AOR = 4.36(95%CI: 2.69–7.08)) were found to have a statistically significant association with level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. Conclusion Adherence to COVID-19preventive measures among students wasunexpectedly lower than in other studies. Female gender, lack of access to water and soap, and attitudes were factors associated with adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. Therefore, to ensure maximal adherence to preventive measures for COVID-19, special messages and efforts targeting males, increasing access to water and soap, trainingto improve attitude toward COVID-19 preventive measures should be implemented at schools."

In this study, we explore the change point detection problem in the SVR-ARMA-GARCH model using the residual-based CUSUM test. For this task, we propose an alternating recursive estimation (ARE) method to improve the estimation accuracy of residuals. Moreover, we suggest using a new testing method with a time-varying control limit that significantly improves the detection power of the CUSUM test. Our numerical analysis exhibits the merits of the proposed methods in SVR-ARMA-GARCH models. A real data example is also conducted using BDI data for illustration, which also confirms the validity of our methods."
https://openalex.org/W4313307825,"Adolescent pregnancy and motherhood have been linked to several factors stemming from social, cultural and to a large extent economic issues. This study examined the socio-economic factors associated with adolescent pregnancy and motherhood in Ghana.This was a secondary analysis of the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey, which was a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. Data from 4785 adolescents aged between 15-19 years were included in the analysis. Adolescent pregnancy was defined as adolescents who have ever been pregnant, whiles adolescent motherhood was defined as adolescents who have ever given birth. Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association between the socio-economic variables and adolescent pregnancy and motherhood.Of the 25062 women aged between 15 and 49 years included in the 2017 maternal health survey, 4785 (19.1%) were adolescents between 15-19 years. Adolescent pregnancy was reported in 14.6% (CI:13.2% -16.1%) of the respondents, whereas 11.8% (CI: 10.5% -13.1%) of the respondents had ever given birth. In the multivariate regression analysis, zone (p<0.001), wealth index (p<0.001), age (p<0.001), marital status (p<0.001) and level of education (p<0.001) were all significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy and motherhood. The odds of pregnancy and motherhood were significantly higher in the Middle and Coastal zones (p<0.001), and among older adolescents (p<0.001). However, the odds of pregnancy and motherhood was significantly lower among adolescents from households with the highest wealth index (p<0.001), among those who were never married (p<0.001) and among adolescents who had secondary/higher education (p<0.001).Several socio-economic variables including education, household wealth, marital status and zone of residence were significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy and adolescent motherhood. Sexual and reproductive health education should be intensified among these populations. Adolescent friendly corners should be made available and accessible to all adolescents in Ghana irrespective of where they live or their age."

We aimed to determine whether pancreatic fat negatively affects β-cell function and insulin secretion in women with overweight or obesity but without T2DM. Methods 20 women, with normo- or dysglycaemia based on fasting plasma glucose levels, and low (&lt; 4.5%) vs high (≥ 4.5%) magnetic resonance (MR) quantified pancreatic fat, completed a 1-hr intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) which included two consecutive 30-min square-wave steps of hyperglycaemia generated by using 25% dextrose. Plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide were measured, and insulin secretion rate (ISR) calculated using regularisation deconvolution method from C-peptide kinetics. Repeated measures linear mixed models, adjusted for ethnicity and baseline analyte concentrations, were used to compare changes during the ivGTT between high and low percentage pancreatic fat (PPF) groups. Results No ethnic differences in anthropomorphic variables, body composition, visceral adipose tissue (MR-VAT) or PPF were measured and hence data were combined. Nine women (47%) were identified as having high PPF values. PPF was significantly associated with baseline C-peptide (p = 0.04) and ISR (p = 0.04) in all. During the 1-hr ivGTT, plasma glucose (p&lt;0.0001), insulin (p&lt;0.0001) and ISR (p = 0.02) increased significantly from baseline in both high and low PPF groups but did not differ between the two groups at any given time during the test (PPF x time, p &gt; 0.05). Notably, the incremental areas under the curves for both first and second phase ISR were 0.04 units lower in the high than low PPF groups, but this was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion In women with overweight or obesity but without T2DM, PPF did not modify β-cell function as determined by ivGTT-assessed ISR. However, the salient feature in biphasic insulin secretion in those with ≥4.5% PPF may be of clinical importance, particularly in early stages of dysglycaemia may warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4313315713,"Advances in tracking technology have helped elucidate the movements of the planet's largest and most mobile species, but these animals do not represent faunal diversity as a whole. Tracking a more diverse array of animal species will enable testing of broad ecological and evolutionary hypotheses and aid conservation efforts. Small and sedentary species of the tropics make up a huge part of earth's animal diversity and are therefore key to this endeavor. Here, we investigated whether modern satellite tracking is a viable means for measuring the fine-scale movement patterns of such animals. We fitted five-gram solar-powered transmitters to resident songbirds in the rainforests of New Guinea, and analyzed transmission data collected over four years to evaluate movement detection and performance over time. Based upon the distribution of location fixes, and an observed home range shift by one individual, there is excellent potential to detect small movements of a few kilometers. The method also has clear limitations: total transmission periods were often short and punctuated by lapses; precision and accuracy of location fixes was limited and variable between study sites. However, impending reductions in transmitter size and price will alleviate many issues, further expanding options for tracking earth's faunal diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4313315740,"The relationship between particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM 2.5 ) and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and mortality in the US is unclear. Prior studies are limited to studying the effects of daily PM 2.5 exposure on HF hospitalizations in specific geographic regions. Because PM 2.5 can vary by geography, this study examines the effects of annual ambient PM 2.5 exposure on HF hospitalizations and mortality at a county-level across the US. A cross-sectional analysis of county-level ambient PM 2.5 concentration, HF hospitalizations, and HF mortality across 3135 US counties nationwide was performed, adjusting for county-level demographics, socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, and healthcare-associated behaviors. There was a moderate correlation between county PM 2.5 and HF hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries (r = 0.41) and a weak correlation between county PM 2.5 and HF mortality (r = 0.08) (p-values &lt; 0.01). After adjustment for various county level covariates, every 1 ug/m 3 increase in annual PM 2.5 concentration was associated with an increase of 0.51 HF Hospitalizations/1,000 Medicare Beneficiaries and 0.74 HF deaths/100,000 residents (p-values &lt; 0.05). In addition, the relationship between PM 2.5 and HF hospitalizations was similar when factoring in metropolitan status of the counties. In conclusion, increased ambient PM 2.5 concentration level was associated with increased incidence of HF hospitalizations and mortality at the county level across the US. This calls for future studies exploring policies that reduce ambient particulate matter pollution and their downstream effects on potentially improving HF outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4313315871,"Elevated levels of suicidality, ADHD, mental ill-health and substance disorders are reported among college students globally, yet few receive treatment. Some faculties and courses appear to have more at-risk students than others. The current study aimed to determine if students commencing college in different academic disciplines were at a heightened risk for psychopathology, substance use disorders and suicidal behaviour, and examined variations in help-seeking behaviour.The study utilised data collected from 1,829 first-year undergraduate students as part of the Student Psychological Intervention Trial (SPIT) which commenced in September 2019 across four Ulster University campuses in Northern Ireland and an Institute of Technology, in the North-West of Ireland. The SPIT study is part of the World Mental Health International College Student Initiative (WMH-ICS) which uses the WMH-CIDI to identify 12-month and lifetime disorders.Students from Life and Health Sciences reported the lowest rates of a range of psychological problems in the year prior to commencing college, while participants studying Arts and Humanities displayed the highest levels (e.g. depression 20.6%; social anxiety 38.8%). However, within faculty variations were found. For example, psychology students reported high rates, while nursing students reported low rates. Variations in help seeking behaviour were also revealed, with male students less likely to seek help.Detecting specific cohorts at risk of psychological disorders and suicidality is challenging. This study revealed that some academic disciplines have more vulnerable students than others, with many reluctant to seek help for their problems. It is important for educators to be aware of such issues and for colleges to provide information and support to students at risk. Tailored interventions and prevention strategies may be beneficial to address the needs of students from different disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W4313315913,"StarD7 belongs to START protein family involved in lipid traffic, metabolism, and signaling events. Its precursor, StarD7.I which is important for mitochondrial homeostasis, is processed to the StarD7.II isoform that lacks the mitochondrial targeting sequence and is mainly released to the cytosol. StarD7 knockdown interferes with cell migration by an unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that StarD7 silencing decreased connexin 43 (Cx43), integrin β1, and p-ERK1/2 expression in the non-tumoral migratory HTR-8/SVneo cells. StarD7-deficient cells exhibited Golgi disruption and reduced competence to reorient the microtubule-organizing center. The migratory capacity of StarD7-silenced cells was reestablished when Cx43 level was resettled, while p-ERK1/2 expression remained low. Importantly, ectopic expression of the StarD7.II isoform not only restored cell migration but also ERK1/2, Cx43, and integrin β1 expression. Thus, StarD7 is implicated in cell migration through an ERK1/2/Cx43 dependent mechanism but independent of the StarD7.I function in the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W4313316071,"Niemann-Pick Type C is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the cellular accumulation of cholesterol within endosomal and lysosomal compartments. 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) containing polyrotaxanes represent an attractive approach for treating this disease due to their ability to circulate in the blood stream for longer periods of time as a prodrug form of HP-β-CD. Once inside the cell, the macromolecular structure is thought to break down into the Pluronic precursor and the active cyclodextrin agent that promotes cholesterol mobilization from the aberrant accumulations within NPC-deficient cells. We now report that both cholesterol and decaarginine (R10) endcapped polyrotaxanes are able to remove cholesterol from NPC1 patient fibroblasts. R10 endcapped materials enter these cells and are localized within endosomes after 16 h. The cholesterol mobilization from endo-lysosomal compartments of NPC1 cells by the polyrotaxanes was directly related to their extent of endcapping and their threading efficiency. Incorporation of 4-sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) significantly improved cholesterol mobilization due to the improved solubility of the compounds. Additionally, in our efforts to scale-up the synthesis for preclinical studies, we prepared a library of polyrotaxanes using a solid phase synthesis method. These compounds also led to significant cholesterol mobilization from the cells, however, cytotoxicity studies showed that they were substantially more toxic than those prepared by the solvent-assisted method, thus limiting the therapeutic utility of agents prepared by this expedited method. Our findings demonstrate that complete endcapping of the polyrotaxanes and improved solubility are important design features for delivering high copy numbers of therapeutic β-CD to promote enhanced sterol clearance in human NPC1-deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W4313318640,"In this work, we explore and develop a method that uses Raman spectroscopy to measure and differentiate radiation induced toxicity in murine lungs with the goal of setting the foundation for a predictive disease model.Analysis of Raman tissue data is achieved through a combination of techniques. We first distinguish between tissue measurements and air pockets in the lung by using group and basis restricted non-negative matrix factorization. We then analyze the tissue spectra using sparse multinomial logistic regression to discriminate between fibrotic gradings. Model validation is achieved by splitting the data into a training set containing 70% of the data and a test set with the remaining 30%; classification accuracy is used as the performance metric. We also explore several other potential classification tasks wherein the response considered is the grade of pneumonitis and fibrosis sickness.A classification accuracy of 91.6% is achieved on the test set of fibrotic gradings, illustrating the ability of Raman measurements to detect differing levels of fibrotic disease among the murine lungs. It is also shown via further modeling that coarser consideration of fibrotic grading via binning (ie. 'Low', 'Medium', 'High') does not degrade performance. Finally, we consider preliminary models for pneumonitis discrimination using the same methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W4313365034,"Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) remain a public-health problem worldwide, including in countries of the Lower Mekong subregion. Increases in human migration from neighboring countries might cause reemerging parasitic infections, leading to spread of parasites in the landscape. Here, we conducted a cross-sectional study to identify the prevalence of IPIs in migrant workers from Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Cambodia who were dwelling in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, northeastern Thailand. The identification of Strongyloides species and genetic differentiation of worms from migrant workers with different countries of origin was also assessed. Fresh stool samples were collected from 338 migrant workers and examined for evidence of IPIs using agar plate culture (APC) and the formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT). Among those nine samples positive for nematodes by APC, the Strongyloides or hookworm species present was confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by DNA sequencing. This revealed eight cases of Strongyloides stercoralis infection and one of Necator americanus. Fifty-one out of 338 individuals (15.09%) were positive for IPIs using FECT and APC. Eggs of Opisthorchis-like flukes were the most common parasite (11.83% of samples), followed by S. stercoralis (2.37%), Entamoeba coli (1.50%), hookworm (0.89%), Taenia sp. (0.60%) and Hymenolepis nana (0.30%). The genetic differentiation of S. stercoralis recovered from migrant workers with different countries of origin was analyzed. Specimens of S. stercoralis isolated from workers from Lao PDR, Cambodia and Myanmar were genetically similar to those sequenced from Thailand. However, there were population-genetic differences between S. stercoralis from these Southeast Asian countries and other regions of the world. This study demonstrated that IPIs were prevalent in migrant workers in the northeastern region of Thailand. Our findings provided molecular confirmation of the presence of S. stercoralis and explored the genetic differentiation of S. stercoralis from those infected migrant workers. An effective anti-parasitic drug should be provided for migrant workers and its administration enforced."
