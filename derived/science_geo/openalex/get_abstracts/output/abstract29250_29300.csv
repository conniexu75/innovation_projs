https://openalex.org/W2082895851,"The Wilms' tumor locus (WTL) at 11p13 contains a gene that encodes a zinc finger-containing protein that has characteristics of a DNA-binding protein. However, binding of this protein to DNA in a sequence-specific manner has not been demonstrated. A synthetic gene was constructed that contained the zinc finger region, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was used to identify a specific DNA binding site from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. The binding sites obtained were similar to the sequence recognized by the early growth response-1 (EGR-1) gene product, a zinc finger-containing protein that is induced by mitogenic stimuli. A mutation in the zinc finger region of the protein originally identified in a Wilms' tumor patient abolished its DNA-binding activity. These results suggest that the WTL protein may act at the DNA binding site of a growth factor-inducible gene and that loss of DNA-binding activity contributes to the tumorigenic process."
https://openalex.org/W1591057067,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (vEGF) is a recently discovered mitogen for endothelial cells. It is also a potent angiogenic factor. We have characterized the vEGF receptors of endothelial cells using both binding and cross-linking techniques. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding experiments revealed two types of high-affinity binding sites on the cell surfaces of bovine endothelial cells. One of the sites has a dissociation constant of 10(-12) M and is present at a density of 3 x 10(3) receptors/cell. The other has a dissociation constant of 10(-11) M, with 4 x 10(4) receptors/cell. A high molecular weight complex containing 125I-vEGF is formed when 125I-vEGF is cross-linked to bovine endothelial cells. This complex has an apparent molecular mass of 225 kDa. Two other faintly labeled complexes with apparent molecular masses of 170 and 195 kDa also are detected. Reduction in the presence of dithiothreitol causes a substantial increase in the labeling intensity of the 170- and 195-kDa complexes, suggesting that these complexes are derived from the 225-kDa complex by reduction of disulfide bonds. The labeling of the vEGF receptors was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled vEGF but not by high concentrations of several other growth factors. Suramin and protamine, as well as several species of lectins, inhibited the binding. The expression of functional vEGF receptors was inhibited when the cells were preincubated with tunicamycin, indicating that glycosylation of the receptor is important for the expression of functional vEGF receptors. Pretreatment with swainsonine on the other hand, did not prevent formation of functional receptors. However, the mass of the 225-kDa complex is decreased by 20 kDa when 125I-vEGF is cross-linked to swainsonine-treated endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486414742,"Activation of the phagocytic cell superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase requires interaction of cytosolic and membrane-associated components. With most stimuli activation of the oxidase is accompanied by multisite phosphorylation of the 47-kDa cytosolic oxidase factor (p47) which translocates from cytosol to membranes. Native p47 is a highly basic protein that undergoes stepwise charge shifts with successive phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation of p47 was studied by immunoprecipitation from neutrophil cytosol and membrane fractions followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In the resting cell p47 was not phosphorylated. In the cytosol of phorbol myristate acetate-activated neutrophils eight distinct p47 phosphoproteins were present. The membrane fraction from these activated cells contained a family of p47 phosphoproteins of electrophoretic mobilities identical to those seen in cytosol plus an additional, more acidic p47 phosphoprotein not present in cytosol. Very early after activation (30 s) only the four most acidic p47 phosphoproteins were present in the membrane fraction. Only at later times (5-15 min) was the full spectrum of p47 phosphoproteins present in the membrane fraction. In contrast, the full spectrum of p47 phosphoproteins was present in the cytosol over the entire time course we studied. In neutrophils from patients with cytochrome b558-deficient chronic granulomatous disease p47 phosphorylation was incomplete and p47 translocation to membrane did not occur. These studies demonstrated that the cytochrome was essential for formation of the three most acidic p47 phosphoproteins and greatly augmented formation of the fourth most acidic p47 phosphoprotein found in normal neutrophils. The temporal correlation between specific p47 phosphorylation events and p47 translocation to membrane is consistent with a model of oxidase activation in which a series of p47 phosphorylation events which occurs in cytosol precedes and may be required for p47 interaction with membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1487878375,"Using high performance liquid chromatography we have successfully purified four core histones from mature human sperm chromatin. The H2A variants present in sperm (H2A.X and limited H2A.Z) have been shown previously to be minor variants in somatic chromatin. The histones are highly modified as evidenced by extensive acetylation and an as yet uncharacterized multicharge modification of H2B. Based on our data, we conclude that histone proteins are a minor component of each mature spermatozoa. Given the unique nature of the histone variants present in sperm, we propose that this chromatin component has a specific function and may possibly facilitate the programming of genes which will be active in early development."
https://openalex.org/W1561974851,"The major cell surface glycoconjugate of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania major is a heterogeneous lipophosphoglycan. It has a tripartite structure, consisting of a phosphoglycan (Mr 5,000-40,000), a variably phosphorylated hexasaccharide glycan core, and a lysoalkylphosphatidylinositol (lysoalkyl-PI) lipid anchor. The structures of the phosphoglycan and the hexasaccharide core were determined by monosaccharide analysis, methylation analysis, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional 500-MHz (correlated spectroscopy (COSY), homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy (HOHAHA] 1H NMR spectroscopy, and exoglycosidase digestions. The phosphoglycan consists of eight types of phosphorylated oligosaccharide repeats which have the general structure, [formula: see text] where R = H, Galp(beta 1-3), Galp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3), Arap(alpha 1-2)Galp(beta 1-3), Glcp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3), Galp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3), Arap(alpha 1-2)Galp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3), or Arap(alpha 1-2)Galp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3)Galp(beta 1-3), and where all the monosaccharides, including arabinose, are in the D-configuration. The average number of repeat units/molecule (n) is 27. Data are presented which suggest that the nonreducing terminus of the phosphoglycan is capped exclusively with the neutral disaccharide Manp(alpha 1-2)Manp alpha 1-. The structure of the glycan core was determined to be, [formula: see text] where approximately 60% of the mannose residues distal to the glucosamine are phosphorylated and where the inositol is part of the lysoalkyl-PI lipid moiety containing predominantly 24:0 and 26:0 alkyl chains. The unusual galactofuranose residue is in the beta-configuration, correcting a previous report where this residue was identified as alpha Galf. Although most of the phosphorylated repeat units are attached to the terminal galactose 6-phosphate of the core to form a linear lipophosphoglycan (LPG) molecule, some of the mannose 6-phosphate residues may also be substituted to form a Y-shaped molecule. The L. major LPG is more complex than the previously characterized LPG from Leishmania donovani, although both LPGs have the same repeating backbone structure and glycolipid anchor. Finally we show that the LPG anchor is structurally related to the major glycolipid species of L. major, indicating that some of these glycolipids may have a function as precursors to LPG."
https://openalex.org/W1510421758,"Several mutants of the human estrogen receptor (ER) were transiently expressed in Cos 7 cells in order to determine the regions involved in the formation of complexes with the heat shock protein Mr approximately 90,000 (hsp 90). The formation of the cytosol non-DNA binding 8-9 S complexes (8-9 S ER) was monitored by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. It was established that the N-terminal region of the receptor, including the two zinc fingers of the DNA binding domain (DBD), is not required for the formation of the 8-9 S ER complexes. Conversely, deletion of the entire ligand binding domain (LBD) produced truncated receptor mutants that are constitutive transcriptional activators and did not form 8-9 S ER complexes, confirming results obtained previously with the glucocorticosteroid receptor (Pratt, W.B., Jolly, D.J., Pratt, D.V., Hollenberg, S.M., Giguerre, V., Cadepond, F., Schweizer-Groyer, G., Catelli, M.G., Evans, R.M., and Baulieu, E.E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 267-273). However, no limited subregion of the LBD was found to be uniquely involved in hsp 90 binding. A highly positively charged region situated at the C-terminal extremity of the DBD (between amino acids 251 and 271) also appeared to be implicated. Although not sufficient, this sequence is necessary for the formation of the 8-9 S ER; it also corresponds to the NL1 nuclear localization domain of steroid receptors. Taken together, these results suggest that the formation of complexes with hsp 90 involves several receptor regions, and they are consistent with the proposal that hsp 90 inhibits receptor function and can be released by hormone binding to the LBD."
https://openalex.org/W2059352674,"The current studies were designed to determine whether chronic overexpression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver would protect mice from the increase in plasma LDL-cholesterol that is induced by high-fat diets. A line of transgenic mice was studied that express the human LDL receptor gene in the liver under control of the transferrin promoter. When fed a diet containing cholesterol, saturated fat, and bile acids for 3 weeks, the transgenic mice, in contrast to normal mice, did not develop a detectable increase in plasma LDL. The current data indicate that unregulated overexpression of LDL receptors can protect against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1602194500,"In the DNA-binding domain of the c-myb protooncogene product (c-Myb) which consists of three repeats of 51-52 amino acids, there are 3 perfectly conserved tryptophans in each repeat. Site-directed mutagenesis of these tryptophans showed that any single or multiple mutations of to hydrophilic residues or alanine abolished or greatly reduced the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity, but mutations to hydrophobic amino acids retained considerable activity. Raman spectroscopic study showed that these tryptophans were buried in the protein core. These 3 tryptophans are proposed to form a cluster in the hydrophobic core in each repeat. This hypothetical structure is referred to as the tryptophan cluster, and it may represent a characteristic property of a group of DNA-binding proteins including the myb- and ets-related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1980190722,"Borna disease virus (BDV) causes a rare neurological disease in horses and sheep. The virus has not been classified because neither an infectious particle nor a specific nucleic acid had been identified. To identify the genome of BDV, a subtractive complementary DNA expression library was constructed with polyadenylate-selected RNA from a BDV-infected MDCK cell line. A clone (B8) was isolated that specifically hybridized to RNA isolated from BDV-infected brain tissue and BDV-infected cell lines. This clone hybridized to four BDV-specific positive strand RNAs (10.5, 3.6, 2.1, and 0.85 kilobases) and one negative strand RNA (10.5 kilobases) in BDV-infected rat brain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the clone suggested that it represented a full-length messenger RNA which contained several open reading frames. In vitro transcription and translation of the clone resulted in the synthesis of the 14- and 24-kilodalton BDV-specific proteins. The 24-kilodalton protein, when translated in vitro from the clone, was recognized by antibodies in the sera of patients (three of seven) with behavioral disorders. This BDV-specific clone will provide the means to isolate the other BDV-specific nucleic acids and to identify the virus responsible for Borna disease. In addition, the significance of BDV or a BDV-related virus as a human pathogen can now be more directly examined."
https://openalex.org/W2153114024,"The small keratan sulfate-substituted proteoglycan (fibromodulin) from articular cartilage was shown to contain keratan sulfate linked to the core protein through N-glycosidic linkages to residues Asn-109, Asn-147, Asn-182, and Asn-272. Biosynthetic experiments with articular chondrocytes in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked oligosaccharide synthesis, demonstrated a specific inhibition of [35S]SO4 incorporation into fibromodulin. Under the same conditions no effect on the addition of keratan sulfate to the large aggregating proteoglycan was detected. Fibromodulin substituted with keratan sulfate was purified from bovine articular cartilage extracts by density gradient centrifugation, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel-permeation chromatography. Isolation of glycosylated peptides from tryptic digests of fibromodulin by ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed four separate hexosamine-rich species, that were also immunoreactive with monoclonal antibody 5D4. Sequence analysis of these glycopeptides gave blank cycles at positions which corresponded to Asn followed by X-Ser/Thr in the sequence derived from cDNA (Oldberg, A., Antonsson, P., Lindblom, K., and Heinegard, D. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 2601-2604). Hence, all four Asn residues in the leucine-rich region of the fibromodulin core protein can serve as acceptor sites for keratan sulfate addition."
https://openalex.org/W1548258669,"Abstract Transcription of the serine protease inhibitor (Spi) 2.1 gene, a member of the serine protease inhibitor family, is induced by growth hormone (GH) in rat liver. To further study the mechanism involved in this process, we have isolated and characterized the Spi 2.1 gene from a rat genomic library. Examination of the 5'-flanking region of the Spi 2.1 gene from normal animals revealed the presence of a DNase I hypersensitive site within 500 base pairs of the transcriptional initiation site, which was not detectable in hypophysectomized animals. Portions of the 5'-flanking region of the Spi 2.1 gene were fused to a heterologous promoter and reporter gene and introduced into primary rat hepatocytes by lipofection. Spi 2.1 sequences from -275 to -54 gave a 2-3-fold induction of reporter gene activity in cells grown in the presence of GH, similar to the level of induction of the endogenous Spi 2.1 mRNA in isolated hepatocytes. Further definition of the essential sequences revealed that a segment from -147 to -102 could confer GH responsiveness when linked in tandem copies in front of a heterologous promoter. Using the gel shift assay, a nuclear factor(s) from normal rat liver was identified which could interact with this minimal response fragment. The importance of this activity to GH regulation was suggested by the fact that it was absent in hypophysectomized animals but reappeared by 1 h after treatment of such animals with GH. The appearance of this activity was not blocked by pretreatment of animals with an inhibitor of protein synthesis, suggesting a preexisting factor is modified by GH to yield an activity which interacts with the Spi 2.1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1520137283,"Crystallographic studies suggest that Arg-127 is a key amino acid in the hydrolysis of peptides and esters by carboxypeptidase A. The guanidinium group of Arg-127 is hypothesized to stabilize the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate formed by the attack of water on the scissile carbonyl bond. We have replaced this amino acid in rat carboxypeptidase A1 with lysine (R127K), methionine (R127M), and alanine (R127A), in order to define the role of Arg-127 in carboxypeptidase catalyzed hydrolysis. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed in yeast and purified. Kinetic studies show that Arg-127 substitution decreases kcat for both ester and amide substrates, whereas Km is relatively unchanged; for R127M and R127A this corresponds to a 6 kcal/mol decrease in transition state stabilization of the rate-limiting step. The binding affinity for the phosphonate transition state analog, Cbz-Phe-Ala(P)-OAla, was decreased by 5.4 kcal/mol, whereas binding affinity for the ground state inhibitor, DL-benzylsuccinic acid, was decreased by only 1.7 kcal/mol for R127M. Electrostatic calculations employing a finite difference solution to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation predict that the positive charge of Arg-127 should stabilize the transition state by 6-8 kcal/mol. Therefore, the experimental and theoretical data suggest that the primary role of Arg-127 is stabilization of the transition state through electrostatic interaction with the oxyanion."
https://openalex.org/W1922570495,"We have previously reported that the cytochrome b6/f complex may be involved in the redox activation of light harvesting chlorophyll-a/b protein complex of photosystem II (LHCII) kinase in higher plants (Gal, A., Shahak, Y., Schuster, G., and Ohad, I. (1987) FEBS Lett. 221, 205-210). The aim of this work was to establish whether a relation between the cytochrome b6/f and LHCII kinase activation can be demonstrated in vitro. Preparations enriched in cytochrome b6/f obtained from spinach thylakoids by detergent extraction and precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by different procedures of purification, contained various amounts of LHCII kinase activity. Analysis of the cytochrome b6/f content and kinase activity of fractions obtained by histone-Sepharose and immunoaffinity columns, immunoprecipitation and sucrose density centrifugation, indicate functional association of kinase and cytochrome b6/f. Phosphorylation of LHCII by fractions containing both cytochrome b6/f and kinase was enhanced by addition of plastoquinol-1. LHCII phosphorylation and kinase activation could be obtained in fractions prepared by use of beta-D-octyl glucoside but not when 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate was used as the solubilizing detergent. Kinase activity could be inhibited by halogenated quinone analogues (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone and 2,3-diiodo-5-t-butyl-p-benzoquinone) known to inhibit cytochrome b6/f activity. However, kinase activity was inhibited by these analogues in all preparations including those which could not phosphorylate LHCII. We thus propose that the redox activation of LHCII phosphorylation is mediated by kinase interaction with cytochrome b6/f while the deactivation may be related to a distinct quinone binding site of the enzyme molecule."

(1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 127, 175-181). The enzyme catalyzing the formation of Compound X has been purified about 600-fold from the cell extract of the flavinogenic yeast Candida guilliermondii by chromatographic procedures. The purified protein appeared homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and consisted of a single polypeptide of 24 kDa. The committed substrate of the enzyme was identified as D-ribulose 5-phosphate. The enzyme yields two products which were identified as L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate and formate by NMR and CD spectroscopy. Mg2+ is required for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1521069367,"The cDNA encoding mouse ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase, EC 4.99.1.1) was isolated from a mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell cDNA library in lambda gt11 expression vector, by immunoscreening with a polyclonal antibody. Two full-length clones containing cDNA inserts of 2.2 and 2.90 kilobases were obtained. These clones have the same entire enzyme coding region, but alternative putative polyadenylation sites in the 3'-noncoding regions. From the deduced primary structure, a putative leader sequence of 53 amino acid residues resulted in a precursor protein of 420 amino acid residues (Mr 47,130) and a mature protein of 367 residues (Mr 41,692). The cDNA allows for the expression of active ferrochelatase by transfected culture cells. RNA blot analysis showed two species of ferrochelatase mRNA consistent with findings of two polyadenylation sites. Both the mRNAs increased by treatment of the MEL cells with dimethyl sulfoxide. The band pattern of the RNA of the mouse liver was the same as that of the MEL cells. Based on these results, we deduce that ferrochelatase in erythroid and hepatic cells can be only of one type."
https://openalex.org/W1552225029,"Methionine aminopeptidase (MAP), which catalyzes the removal of NH2-terminal methionine from proteins, was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme was purified 472-fold to apparent homogeneity. The Mr of the native enzyme was estimated to be 36,000 +/- 5,000 by gel filtration chromatography, and the Mr of the denatured protein was estimated to be 34,000 +/- 2,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has a pH optimum near 7.0, and its pI is 7.8 as determined by chromatofocusing on Mono P. The enzyme was inactivated by metalloprotease inhibitors (EDTA, o-phenanthroline and nitrilotriacetic acid), sulfhydryl-modifying reagents (HgCl2 and p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid), and Zn2+. Yeast MAP failed to cleave methionine p-nitroanilide. Among 11 Xaa-Ala-Ser analogues (Xaa = Ala, Asp, Gln, Glu, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, and Ser), MAP cleaved only Met-Ala-Ser. MAP also cleaved methionine from other tripeptides whose penultimate amino acid residue is relatively small and/or uncharged (e.g. Pro, Gly, Val, Thr, or Ser) but not when bulky and/or charged (Arg. His, Leu, Met, or Tyr). Yeast MAP displayed similar substrate specificities compared with those of Escherichia coli (Ben-Bassat, A., Bauer, K., Chang, S.Y., Myambo, K., Boosman, A., and Chang, S. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 751-757) and Salmonella typhimurium MAP (Miller, C., Strauch, K. L., Kukral, A. M., Miller, J. L., Wingfield, P. T., Mazzei, G. J., Werlen, R. C., Garber, P., and Movva, N. R. (1987) Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 2718-2722). In general, the in vitro specificity of yeast MAP is consistent with the specificity observed in previous in vivo studies in yeast (reviewed in Arfin, S. M., and Bradshaw, R. A. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7979-7984)."
https://openalex.org/W1487070368,"Female moths produce blends of odorant chemicals, called pheromones. These precise chemical mixtures both attract males and elicit appropriate mating behaviors. To locate females, male moths must rapidly detect changes in environmental pheromone concentration. Therefore, the regulation of pheromone concentration within antennae, their chief organ of smell, is important. We describe antennal-specific aldehyde oxidases from the moths Antheraea polyphemus and Bombyx mori that are capable of catabolizing long chain, unsaturated aldehydes such as their aldehyde pheromones. These soluble enzymes are associated uniquely with male and female antennae and have molecular masses of 175 and 130 kDa, respectively. The A. polyphemus aldehyde oxidase has been localized to the olfactory sensilla which contain the pheromone receptor cell dendrites. These same sensilla contain a previously described sensilla-specific esterase that degrades the acetate ester component of A. polyphemus pheromone. We propose that sensillar pheromone-degrading enzymes modulate pheromone concentration in the receptor space and hence play a dynamic role in the pheromone-mediated reproductive behaviors of these animals."
https://openalex.org/W1564289398,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role played by Arg191, Arg193, and Arg194 of the fusion toxin DAB486-IL-2 in the intoxication of high affinity interleukin-2 receptor-bearing T-lymphocytes. These arginine residues are positioned in the proteolytically sensitive 14-amino acid loop subtended by the disulfide bond between Cys187 and Cys202 in this fusion toxin. DAB486-IL-2 was formed by the genetic substitution of the native diphtheria toxin receptor binding domain with human interleukin-2 (Williams, D.P., Parker, K., Bacha, P., Bishai, W., Borowski, M., Genbauffe, F., Strom, T.B., and Murphy, J.R. (1987) Protein Eng. 1, 493-498). We demonstrate that substitution of Arg194 with Gly results in a 1000-fold loss of DAB486-IL-2 potency. Since trypsin nicking of the Gly194 mutant restores biologic activity, we conclude that Arg194 is required for the cellular processing of the fusion toxin which results in the release of fragment A into the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1551043353,"Sporamin, the tuberous root storage protein of the sweet potato, which is localized in vacuoles, is synthesized as a prepro-precursor with an N-terminal sequence of amino acids that includes a signal peptide and an additional pro-segment of 16 amino acids. A full-length cDNA for sporamin was placed downstream of the 35 S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and introduced into tobacco and sunflower genomes by Ti plasmid-mediated transformation. A polypeptide of nearly the same size as mature sporamin from the sweet potato was detected in transformed calli of tobacco and sunflower, as well as in the leaves, stems, and roots of regenerated, transgenic tobacco plants. Amino acid sequence analysis of the nearly mature-sized form of sporamin from the transformed tobacco cells revealed that it is actually longer by three amino acids at its N terminus than authentic sporamin purified from the sweet potato. By pulse labeling of suspension-cultured tobacco cells with [35S]methionine, the pro-form of the precursor to sporamin, but not the prepro-precursor, was detected. The 35S-labeled proform was chased to the nearly mature-sized form via an intermediate form which is slightly larger than the nearly mature-sized form. Analysis by Edman degradation of the intermediate form that was labeled in vivo with [3H]histidine suggested that it is longer by two amino acids at its N terminus than the nearly mature-sized form of sporamin. These results suggest that at least two steps of posttranslational processing of the pro-form occurs sequentially in tobacco cells. The posttranslational processing of the pro-form of the precursor to sporamin was inhibited by monensin, suggesting that this step takes place in the acidic compartment, probably in the vacuole. All of the sporamin polypeptides synthesized in transformed tobacco cells were retained inside the cell and sporamin was localized in the vacuole, as judged from results of subcellular fractionation. These results indicate that sporamin is appropriately targeted to the vacuole in tobacco cells."
https://openalex.org/W1583534975,"beta-Globin mRNA and alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) RNA 4, two naturally capped mRNAs, and satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA, a naturally uncapped mRNA, were prepared by in vitro transcription with and without a 5' m7G cap structure (m7G(5')ppp(5')N). The translation of the capped and uncapped forms of these mRNAs was measured in a crude S30 system and a partially purified system from wheat germ. In the S30 system the uncapped forms of beta-globin mRNA and AMV RNA 4 are much less active (greater than or equal to 10%) than their capped forms, whereas the uncapped and capped forms of STNV RNA are equally active. The low activity of uncapped beta-globin mRNA and AMV RNA 4 in the S30 system is due, in part, to inactivation of the uncapped mRNAs in this system. Additional studies, carried out in the partially purified system in which very little inactivation of the mRNAs occurs, show that the uncapped and capped forms of beta-globin mRNA or AMV RNA 4 differ markedly with respect to the amount of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F required for translation. For beta-globin mRNA the absence of the 5' cap structure increases the concentration of eIF-4F required for half-maximal translation about 6-fold (from 10 to 60 nM) and for AMV RNA 4 it increases the concentration of eIF-4F about 12-fold (from 5 to 60 nM). The concentrations of eIF-3, eIF-4A, and eIF-4B required for half-maximal translation of the uncapped forms of beta-globin mRNA and AMV RNA 4 are either the same or only slightly higher (1.5- to 2-fold) than the concentrations required for the capped forms. With STNV RNA the concentration of eIF-4F required for half-maximal translation of either uncapped or capped STNV RNA is 3 nM, and the concentrations of eIF-3, eIF-4A, and eIF-4B required for the two forms are also the same. The translation of the capped and uncapped forms of beta-globin mRNA and AMV RNA 4 is inhibited strongly by low concentrations of m7GTP in the partially purified system containing low concentrations of eIF-4F. Under the same conditions, the translation of capped or uncapped STNV RNA is inhibited only slightly by m7GTP. These findings suggest the possibility that the mechanism by which eIF-4F interacts and initiates translation with naturally uncapped mRNAs may not be identical to the mechanism by which eIF-4F interacts and initiates translation of naturally capped mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1527594560,"The complete structure of the mouse 68-kDa neurofilament (NF-L) gene was elucidated. We cloned cDNAs corresponding to 3.5- and 2.3-kb NF-L mRNA, including their polyadenylation sites. Sequence analysis revealed that these NF-L mRNAs arose from the alternative use of two polyadenylation sites in exon 4. Promoter analysis using NF-L promoter-beta-galactosidase fusion plasmids determined regions responsible for its basic promoter activity, which were located between -328 and -36 base pairs from the transcription initiation site. These promoter fusion plasmids induced a significant level of beta-galactosidase in NF-nonproducing C6 cells as well as in NF-producing PC12h cells. The in vitro transcription assay using HeLa cell extract also showed that this promoter exhibited strong transcriptional activity. Little difference in NF-L mRNA stability was observed between the two cells. However, nuclear run-off assay revealed that the NF-L gene was not transcribed in NF-nonproducing C6 cells. These data suggest that the strong promoter activity of the NF-L gene is repressed in vivo at the transcription initiation level in a tissue-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1555392021,"A cDNA for the hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP) of larval Manduca sexta has been cloned and sequenced. The JHBP was purified to homogeneity from fifth instar larval hemolymph using gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies, generated in response to this protein, were used to identify and isolate JHBP cDNAs from a fat body expression library in bacteriophage lambda ZAPII. Eleven putative JHBP cDNA clones were isolated and subcloned into Bluescript plasmid; cDNA inserts were approximately 750 base pairs in length. A 36-kDa immunoreactive protein was expressed from these plasmids; this beta-galactosidase fusion protein, like the authentic 32-kDa JHBP, was specifically photoaffinity labeled with [3H] epoxyhomofarnesyl diazoacetate (EHDA). Single-stranded DNA from one clone was sequenced by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide method, using deletion and custom primer techniques. A mature translation product was identified which had 226 amino acid residues, a molecular mass of 25,111 daltons, and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 5.40. The cDNA correctly predicts the N-terminal amino acid sequence and the amino acid composition of an authentic M. sexta hemolymph JHBP. A computer search of protein and nucleic acid data bases failed to reveal any related sequences. Thus, M. sexta hemolymph JHBP appears to be the first member of a new superfamily of insect hormone binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1556305625,"Abstract A 10-50-fold, biphasic increase in the rate of 32Pi labeling of eIF-4E was closely correlated with the induction of protein and glycoprotein biosynthesis when resting murine splenic B lymphocytes (B cells) were activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or the combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. The fraction of eIF-4E which was phosphorylated only increased from 46% in resting cells to 83% in lipopolysaccharide-activated cells. This discrepancy between the increase in the fraction of phosphorylated eIF-4E and the increase in 32Pi labeling suggested that the phosphoryl group of eIF-4E turns over slowly in resting B cells compared with activated cells. The turnover rate for the eIF-4E phosphate moiety in lipopolysaccharide-activated cells was rapid (t1/2 = 2 h) in comparison to the eIF-4E polypeptide chain, which did not turn over detectably in 6 h. Neither protein kinase C nor a cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase appeared to be involved in eIF-4E phosphorylation in B cells, based on the observations that the metabolic labeling of eIF-4E by 32Pi was insensitive to the protein kinase inhibitors H-7 and HA1004, and that maximal labeling occurred after protein kinase C activity was down-regulated to very low levels in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-activated cells. Dephosphorylation in vivo was blocked by okadaic acid (IC50 = 200 nM). These results indicate that a rapid phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of eIF-4E is associated with high translation rates during the activation of B cells, and implicate protein phosphatase-1 (or possibly-2A) in the dephosphorylation of the initiation factor."
https://openalex.org/W1592193524,"The rat pyruvate kinase L (PKL) gene produces the L- and R-type isozymes by alternative transcription that is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. To investigate which DNA elements are involved in hepatocyte-specific expression of the L-type isozyme, we performed transient DNA transfer experiments with PKL/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes. We found three positive regulatory regions required for expression of the L-type isozyme in adult rat hepatocytes by functional analyses of a series of 5' and internal deletion constructs of the fusion genes. These regions, designated as PKL-I, PKL-II, and PKL-III, were located between nucleotides -76 and -94, -126 and -149, and -150 and -170, respectively. PKL-I showed enhancer-like activity alone, whereas PKL-II and PKL-III did not have any independent effect. Combinations of L-I + L-II and L-II + L-III, but not of L-I + L-III, showed synergistic enhancer activities when oriented in the same direction. The inclusion of all three elements oriented in the same direction had the maximum synergistic effect, indicating that these elements function as a unit. This unit enhanced expression from heterologous as well as homologous promoters in a manner that was independent of its orientation and position relative to the cap site. The activity of the unit was not detected in HeLa cells or K562 erythroleukemia cells, suggesting that this unit possessed cell-type specificity. PKL-I consists of a palindrome sequence 5'-CTGGTTATACTTTAACCAG-3', which contain a sequence homologous to the LF-B1-binding site. PKL-II contains the sequence 5'-TTCCTGGACTCTGGCCCCCAGTGT-3', which is similar to that of the LF-A1-binding site. PKL-III contains a palindrome sequence 5'-CCACGGGGCACTCCCGTGG-3', which include a sequence homologous to the binding site of the adenovirus major late transcription factor. Gel retardation assay indicated that the different trans-acting factors interacted with three elements and that the transacting protein bound to PKL-I was in fact LF-B1. However, the trans-acting factors bound to PKL-II and PKL-III were different from LF-A1 and major late transcription factor, respectively. Thus, we conclude that three cis-acting elements are very important for specific expression of the PKL gene in hepatocytes and that LF-B1 and two unknown factors bound to these elements interact with each other to cause a synergistic effect."
https://openalex.org/W1520476387,"It is well established that hydrophobic signal sequences direct proteins into or across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes and cell membranes in prokaryotes. Although it is recognized that eukaryote proteins are efficiently secreted by bacterial systems, the export of bacterial proteins by eukaryotes has received little attention. To investigate membrane translocation of bacterial proteins by mammalian cells, the secretion of a bacterial endoglucanase (endoglucanase E) from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells has been examined. We report that a functional endoglucanase is secreted when fused to prokaryote or eukaryote signal peptides. Furthermore, the endoglucanase was post-translationally modified before secretion. Data presented in this paper suggest that secretion of bacterial proteins by eukaryote cells may be a general phenomenon and infer that there are no specific requirements with respect to the origin of the signal sequences."

We have purified the protein recognized by a Golgi-specific monoclonal antibody 53FC3 (Burke, B., Griffiths, G., Reggio, H., Louvard, D., and Warren, G. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 1621-1628). Peptide microsequencing suggested that this antigen is mannosidase II, which was confirmed by cross-immunoprecipitation with an anti-mannosidase II antibody and by precipitation of mannosidase activity with the monoclonal antibody. Mannosidase II was found to exist normally as a disulfide-linked dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1597763685,"Fumarate reductase (FRD) of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit membrane-bound complex that is synthesized during anaerobic growth when fumarate is available as a terminal oxidant. The two subunits that comprise the catalytic domain, FrdA and FrdB, are anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane surface by two small hydrophobic polypeptides, FrdC and FrdD, which are also required for the enzyme to interact with quinone. To better define the individual roles of the FrdC and FrdD polypeptides in FRD complex formation and quinone binding, we selectively mutagenized the frdCD genes. Frd- strains were identified by their inability to grow on restrictive media, and the resulting mutant FRD complexes were isolated and biochemically characterized. The majority of the frdC and frdD mutations were identified as single base deletions that caused premature termination in either FrdC or FrdD and resulted in the loss of one or more of the predicted transmembrane helices. Two additional frdC mutants were characterized that contained single base changes resulting in single amino acid substitutions. All mutant enzyme complexes were incapable of oxidizing the physiological electron donor, menaquinol-6, in the presence of fumarate. Additionally, the ability of the mutant complexes to oxidize reduced benzyl viologen or reduce the ubiquinone analogue 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-pentyl-1,4-benzoquinone and phenazine methosulfate with succinate as electron donor were also affected but to varying degrees. The separation of oxidative and reductive activities with quinones suggests there are two quinone binding sites in the fumarate reductase complex and that electron transfer occurs in two le- steps carried out at these separate sites."
https://openalex.org/W1546526949,"The binding of caldesmon and its actin-binding fragments to actin was studied by using peptide antibodies directed against two actin sites implicated in actomyosin interactions. Antibodies against residues 1-7 on skeletal alpha-actin strongly inhibited the binding of caldesmon to actin and perturbed to a smaller extent the interaction between actin and the actin binding fragments. Carbodiimide coupling of ethylenediamine to the NH2-terminal acidic residues on actin inhibited the binding of caldesmon and its fragments to actin to a similar extent as the (residues 1-7) antibodies. Antibodies against residues 18-28 showed only limited competition with caldesmon for the binding to actin. These results lead to the following conclusions. (i) The NH2-terminal residues on actin play an important role in the binding of caldesmon to actin, (ii) residues 18-28 on actin do not form a major caldesmon interaction site, and (iii) the actin-binding fragments do not contain the full actin-binding interface. These conclusions and other literature data suggest that caldesmon regulates the actomyosin ATPase by competing with myosin.ATP for the NH2-terminal segment on actin."
https://openalex.org/W1510401137,"We have isolated a subclonal cell line of PC12, PC12h-R, which is characterized by its rapid response to nerve growth factor (NGF) in extending its neurites. The mRNA levels of the 68-kDa neurofilament (NF-L) increased severalfold as early as 3 h after the addition of NGF, but this was not accompanied by an increase in the transcription rate. Analysis of the stabilities of 3.5- and 2.3-kilobase (kb) NF-L mRNAs using actinomycin D revealed that 2.3-kb mRNA was degraded much faster than the 3.5-kb species and that NGF apparently stabilized NF-L mRNAs. These results show that the NF-L gene can be regulated posttranscriptionally, a finding that may be important in responding to the acute demand for neurofilament syntheses."
https://openalex.org/W115321703,"cDNA clones comprising the entire coding region of two out of the seven heterogeneous subunits of hemocyanin from the tarantula, Eurypelma californicum, were isolated from four cDNA libraries constructed from total RNA from the heart tissue of single spiders. Hybridization was first carried out using a tarantula hemocyanin subunit e partial cDNA, and several positive clones were isolated, including one containing a 2.2-kilobase full-length cDNA (lambda M1). The cDNA comprises an open reading frame for 623 amino acids, 34 nucleotides of the 5'noncoding region, and 286 nucleotides of the 3'-noncoding region. To select for other hemocyanin subunits, two 17-mer oligonucleotide mixtures, corresponding to the conserved regions in the copper A and copper B oxygen-binding site of chelicerate hemocyanins, were used as probes. Among the positive clones obtained, full-length cDNAs coding for subunit a were identified. The cDNA sequence determined from clone lambda K1 provides an open reading frame coding for 630 amino acids and includes the 5'- and 3'-noncoding regions. Northern blot analysis revealed single transcripts for subunits a and e, each 2.3 kilobases long. The cDNAs for subunits a and e were both found to lack any leader peptide sequence. This supports the idea that the mature protein accumulates in the cytoplasm and is released by cell rupture."
https://openalex.org/W1601282960,"The terminal differentiation of Schwann cells is dependent on contact with basement membrane. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in mediating Schwann cell responses to extracellular matrix contact. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-releasable cell surface HSPGs purified from cultures of neonatal rat Schwann cells were subjected to affinity chromatography on immobilized laminin and fibronectin. Binding of the HSPG to both affinity matrices was observed. The strength of the association, however, was sensitive to the ionic strength of the buffer. In 0.1 M Tris-HCl, HSPG binding was essentially irreversible whereas in physiological ionic strength buffer (e.g. 0.142 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris), weaker binding was detected as a delay in elution of the HSPG from the affinity columns. Further studies of HSPG-laminin binding suggested that the binding was mediated by the glycosaminoglycan chains of the proteoglycans. Results of equilibrium gel filtration chromatography provided additional evidence for a reversible association of the HSPG and laminin with a Kd of approximately 1 x 10(-6) M. When Schwann cells were plated on plastic dishes coated with laminin, the cells attached and extended long slender processes. Inclusion of heparin, but not chondroitin sulfate, in the assay medium resulted in partial inhibition of process extension, but at concentrations of heparin which were higher than that needed to disrupt laminin-HSPG association in vitro. Addition of anti-integrin receptor antibodies resulted in more extensive inhibition of laminin-dependent process extension. Anti-integrin antibodies plus heparin essentially totally inhibited laminin-dependent process extension. These results demonstrate that cell surface HSPGs are capable of reversible association with extracellular matrix molecules and suggest that HSPG-laminin interactions play a role in laminin-dependent Schwann cell spreading."
https://openalex.org/W1503689428,"Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and purified by counterflow centrifugation elutriation. Membrane-localized carboxylesterase (CBE) was extracted with nonionic detergent (Triton X-100) and purified by ion exchange (DEAE-cellulose), gel filtration (Sephacryl S-300), hydroxylapatite column, and high performance liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme migrated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single protein band with a molecular weight of 60,000. Under nondenaturing conditions, monocyte CBE formed a trimer and eluted from a gel filtration column as a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 200,000. Electrophoretic patterns of the enzyme on polyacrylamide gels run a neutral pH did not vary during enzyme purification. At least four major isoenzymes of human monocyte CBE were observed with isoelectric points between 7.5 and 7.8. Pure human monocyte CBE hydrolyzed short chain alpha-naphthyl, o-nitrophenyl, and p-nitrophenyl esters. Amide esters and thioesters were not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Short chain alcohols activated the enzyme and organophosphorus compounds, diphenyl carbonate, sodium fluoride, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited the enzyme. EDTA and sulfhydryl reagents had no effect on enzyme activity. The amino acid content of the enzyme was consistent with other CBEs. Inhibitors reacted either with the active or effector site of the enzyme. Purified enzyme now permits the characterization of CBE structure and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1581773394,"The inner mitochondrial membranes from bovine heart, rat liver, and Morris hepatoma 7777 all bound the mitochondrial isozymes of aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase with comparable affinities and binding ratios (mg of enzyme bound per mg of membrane protein). A low molecular weight fraction separated from a detergent extract of the heart membrane by chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 contained most of the binding activity of the extract for the aminotransferase and had a dissociation constant for the aminotransferase of 0.2 microM. The protein component of the membrane binding sites for the aminotransferase was apparently present in this fraction because binding activity was largely eliminated by proteolysis with trypsin. When this fraction was chromatographed on an aminotransferase affinity column, only the portion that was bound and eluted by 0.25 M KCl associated with added aminotransferase. Unlike the membrane, which was markedly inhibited by the non-ionic detergent Genapol but was inhibited only 20% by trypsin, the binding activity of this subfraction was completely inhibited by trypsin but not by Genapol. This suggests, on the membrane, that the aminotransferase binds to the binding protein and is then transferred to lipids specifically associated with the binding protein. These putative lipids are presumably removed on the affinity column. Although the yield of the binding protein was low, there is probably ample binding protein in mitochondria to accommodate the aminotransferase. In every case, binding of the aminotransferase to the membrane inactivated the malate dehydrogenase binding site whereas malate dehydrogenase had little effect on the binding of the aminotransferase and only associated with the higher molecular weight fractions from the Sephacryl column that contained Complex I activity. Inactivation of the malate dehydrogenase site by the aminotransferase, but not vice versa, could result from aminotransferase associating with the binding protein and malate dehydrogenase with Complex I followed by association of the enzymes with lipids located in the same region of the membrane. However, since aminotransferase is more cationic, it is not displaced readily from the lipids by malate dehydrogenase. The relevance of these interactions to the organization of the enzymes is discussed."

Besides the disaccharide Man beta 1-4GlcNAc as the major component, a sialic acid-containing compound was detected in an amount of 10% compared to that of Man beta 1-4GlcNAc. Structural characterization of the oligosaccharide and of its reduced analogue by sugar composition analysis, methylation analysis, gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy gave conclusive evidence for a novel urinary constituent: NeuAc alpha 2-6Man beta 1-4GlcNAc. This linear trisaccharide can be considered as the result of an alpha 2-6-sialylation of the major accumulating compound, Man beta 1-4GlcNAc. The hitherto unknown linkage between sialic acid and mannose was shown to be susceptible to sialidase digestion."
https://openalex.org/W72576449,"The periplasmic histidine transport system (permease) of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is composed of a soluble, histidine-binding receptor located in the periplasm and a complex of three membrane-bound proteins of which one, HisP, was shown previously to bind ATP. These permeases are energized by ATP. HisP is a member of a family of membrane transport proteins which is conserved in all periplasmic permeases and is presumed to be involved in coupling the energy of ATP to periplasmic transport. In this paper the nature of the ATP-binding site of HisP has been explored by identification of some of the residues that come into contact with ATP. HisP was derivatized with 8-azido-ATP (N3ATP). Both the underivatized and the derivatized forms of HisP were solubilized, purified, and digested with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptides were resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography, and peptides modified by N3ATP were isolated and sequenced. Two peptides, X and Z, spanning amino acid residues 16-23 and 31-45, were found to contain sites of N3ATP attachment at His19 and Ser41, respectively. Both peptides are close to the amino-terminal end of HisP; peptide Z is located in one of the well conserved regions comprising the nucleotide-binding consensus motifs of the energy-coupling components of these permeases. These consensus motifs are found in many purine nucleotide-binding proteins. The relationship between the location of these residues and the overall structure of the ATP-binding site is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1554443816,"Abstract The cloned argininosuccinate synthetase gene from a citrullinemia patient's fibroblast cell line revealed a single base substitution (G to C) within the splice acceptor site of the last intron. The mutation abolished normal RNA splicing, and, by cDNA analysis, three abnormal splicing pathways were demonstrated. The major pathway involved the activation of a cryptic acceptor site in the last exon that resulted in a deletion of seven nucleotides in the mature RNA. Another pathway involved a downstream cryptic acceptor site, that is 388 nucleotides downstream from the first cryptic site. Northern blot analysis showed that this second cryptic site is present on the minor 2.7-kilobase mRNA, but not on the major species of argininosuccinate synthetase mRNA, which is 1.7-kilobases in length. Using this aberrant cDNA as a probe, the cDNA of the 2.7-kilobase mRNA was isolated and studied. Sequence analysis suggests that this species of RNA is the one that bypasses the polyadenylation signal employed by the 1.7-kilobase RNA. Since both transcripts encounter the same translation termination codon, both RNAs should encode identical protein. Furthermore, a tract of 22 repeats of d(CA).(GT) is found at the 3' end of the gene and this repeat sequence is present on the 2.7-kilobase RNA. The third pathway of the abnormal splicing revealed a rare class of transcript that has the last intron retained in the mature RNA. This study shows that in human the intron inclusion can occur through a naturally occurring point mutation. All these abnormally spliced RNAs resulted in a protein reading frame shift."
https://openalex.org/W1562521803,"The heparan sulfate proteoglycan/heparin-binding proteins of the human lung carcinoma cell line LX-1 have been identified, partially purified, and characterized. Analysis of the binding of [3H]heparin to membranes isolated from LX-1 cells indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites, with Kd values of approximately 2 x 10(-10) and 4 x 10(-8) M and corresponding Bmax values of 1 x 10(5) and 2 x 10(7) binding sites/cell. Binding was also observed with isolated heparan sulfate chains and with intact heparan sulfate proteoglycan isolated from two different cell types. With each ligand, binding was inhibited by addition of unlabeled heparin. The binding proteins were extracted from LX-1 cell membranes in detergent solution, and two size classes of binding proteins were identified by overlaying transblots of electrophoretically separated proteins with radioactive ligands. These two classes of binding proteins were shown to contain doublets with estimated molecular masses of approximately 16 kDa (HSBP1A and HSBP1B) and approximately 32 kDa (HSBP2A and HSBP2B). The proteins were partially purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography and shown to bind heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. By amino acid composition, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and reactivity with antibody, HSBP1A was shown to be very similar to histone 2B; HSBP1B may also be related to histone 2A. HSBP2A and HSBP2B, however, did not react with antibodies to the major histones and had compositions different from one another and from HSBP1."
https://openalex.org/W1592667008,"A number of transmembrane proteins have been recently reported to be modified by the covalent addition of saturated fatty acids which may contribute to membrane targeting and specific protein-lipid interactions. Such modifications have not been reported in cell-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, although these macromolecules are known to be hydrophobic. Here, we report that a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan is acylated with both myristate and palmitate, two long-chain saturated fatty acids. When colon carcinoma cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid, a significant proportion of the label was shown to be specifically incorporated into the protein core of the proteoglycan. Characterization of fatty acyl moiety in the purified proteoglycan by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed that approximately 60% of the covalently bound fatty acids was myristate. We further show that this relatively rare 14-carbon fatty acid was bound to the protein core via a hydroxylamine- and alkali-resistant amide bond. The remaining 40% was the more common 16-carbon palmitate, which was bound via a hydroxylamine- and alkali-sensitive thioester bond. Palmitate appeared to be added post-translationally and derived in part from intracellular elongation of myristate, a process that occurred within the first two hours and was insensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis. Acylation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan represents a novel modification of this gene product and could play a role in a number of biological functions including specific interactions with membrane receptors and ligand stabilization."

https://openalex.org/W1623633023,"The 5'-flanking region of protein kinase C (PKC) gamma gene was identified from a rat liver genomic library in a bacteriophage lambda Charon 4A. A 3.6-kilobase (kb) genomic fragment containing the 5'-flanking region, first exon, and first intron was isolated and sequenced. The transcriptional initiation site, identified by S1 mapping and primer extension, was located 243 base pairs upstream from the translational initiation site. Promoter activity of a DNA segment spanning the 5'-flanking region was demonstrated by both in vitro transcription using HeLa cell nuclear extracts and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay by transfection of 293 cells with a PKC gamma-CAT fusion construct. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that a fragment of about 0.16 kb from the transcriptional initiation site was sufficient for promoter activity in these cells, and the construct containing up to 1.6 kb from the cap site was expressed at a similar level. This promoter-active fragment contains several regions similar to defined transcriptional elements in other mammalian promoters, such as those for stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1), activator proteins 1 and 2 (AP1, AP2), c-myc, cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB), and enhancer core (EnhC).

https://openalex.org/W1481187966,"The hydrolysis of ester substrates in mixed monolayers with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine by pancreatic carboxylester lipase (CEL) shows an abrupt increase from less than 10 to 100% when substrate abundance exceeds a critical value (Tsujita, T., Muderhwa, J.M., and Brockman, H.L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8612-8618). Adsorption of native CEL to these mixed lipid films under the same conditions shows a monotonic increase with substrate abundance to a maximum of approximately 4 pmol/cm2. In the range of low substrate hydrolysis, bound enzyme reaches 0.6 pmol/cm2 or about one-sixth of an enzyme monolayer. Given the high turnover number of the enzyme, absence of bound catalyst cannot explain the lack of substrate hydrolysis. Similarities of the adsorption data obtained with different substrates suggest a common, area-based mechanism with an excluded area for the phospholipid. Quantitative analysis confirms this and gives an excluded area of 43.5 +/- 1.0 A2/molecule. Comparable studies with the hydrolysis product, oleic acid, replacing each substrate show markedly different results. Up to oleic acid mol fractions of 0.5, bound CEL levels are essentially constant at 0.215 pmol/cm2. This behavior relative to substrate-containing films cannot be ascribed to differences in surface pressure, surface potential, monolayer compressibility, nonexcluded area, CEL denaturation, or oleic acid charge. Together with the ultrasensitive composition dependence of substrate hydrolysis, the data suggest that phospholipid-based organization of the surface is a primary regulator of enzyme binding and catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1533486000,"A survey of carboxypeptidase Y-catalyzed carboxyl-terminal modification of short peptides in the presence of various amino acids revealed that transpeptidation occurred in significant yield only with peptides containing a proline at the penultimate or antepenultimate position. For these peptides, transpeptidation was shown to occur specifically at the carboxyl side of the proline, thus suggesting a determining role of this residue for transpeptidation. Two model peptides, YPFP-GPI and YPFVEPI, were studied in detail. Initial yields of transpeptidation in the presence of various nucleophiles were compared. Among natural amino acids, the highest yield was obtained with methionine, followed by other amino acids bearing hydrophobic side chains. In order to transpose the method of transpeptidation to a protein, a variant of Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase bearing the carboxyl-terminal Glu-Pro-Met sequence was genetically created. Under the conditions optimized for the transpeptidation of YPF-VEPI with methionine, this protein could be labeled specifically at its carboxyl-terminal end. Moreover, the parameters of the labeling reaction were in agreement with those observed in the transpeptidation of the model peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1585765827,"Leghemoglobin shows extreme high affinity behavior in the binding of both oxygen and CO. We have determined the temperature dependence of the rate constants for ligation of oxygen and CO and from these data the thermodynamics (delta G0, delta H0, delta S0) of ligation for the purified components of soybean leghemoglobin. X-ray crystallography has shown that the heme cavity can easily accommodate ligands the size of nicotinate, and analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure data has shown that the Fe atom is in the mean plane of the heme in the leghemoglobin-CO complex. Ligation of oxygen and CO are in accord with this picture in that the Ea for oxygen binding is that expected for a diffusion controlled reaction and delta S0 for the ligation of both CO and oxygen is consistent with the simple immobilization of the ligand at the Fe, with no evidence for significant conformational changes in the protein or changes in solvation. At 20 degrees C the rate constants for oxygen and CO binding vary by 26-44% among the eight leghemoglobin components. For azide binding the variation is a factor of 2. These variations appear to arise from amino acid substitutions outside either the heme cavity or the two major paths for ligand entry to the heme. The distribution of leghemoglobin components varies with the age of the soybean nodule during the growing season. The changes in composition alone, however, would only allow the concentration of free oxygen to vary by about 3%. This finding calls into question models that ascribe a significant functional role to changes in the distribution of leghemoglobin components in regulating oxygen concentration in the nodule."
https://openalex.org/W1675155628,"CaVPT, a target protein of Ca2(+)-vector from amphioxus muscle, was purified from its complex with CaVP after dissociation by 6 M urea and chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose and calmodulin-Sepharose. The amino acid sequence of CaVPT has been determined. The protein is composed of 243 residues and possesses an unblocked N terminus. Its molecular weight is 26,621, distinctly lower than the apparent molecular weight deduced from electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing gels. CaVPT contains a potential Asn-linked glycosylation site, four potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. From the sequence the following three particular domains can be inferred: a collagen-like N-terminal segment, rich in Pro and Ala, that resembles the N-terminal segment of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase; next to it (from residues 33 to 50) is located a strongly amphiphilic and basic alpha-helical segment which likely binds the calcium vector protein since a proteolytic cut after Arg50, occurring occasionally during the purification of CaVPT, impairs the binding to immobilized calmodulin. This segment is followed by two immunoglobulin folds. The two immunoglobulin folds typically belong to the C2 subclass and particularly resemble those present in the neural cell surface adhesion molecules NCAM, L1, F11, MAG, TAG-1, fasciclin II, and amalgam. Recently, the presence of immunoglobulin folds of this type has been reported in some intracellular muscular proteins, namely in smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, striated muscle C protein and titin, as well as in the nematode 600-kDa protein twitchin. From this structural study we can formulate the working hypothesis that CaVPT acts on the structure of the thick filament in muscle or regulates, perhaps via other immunoglobulin fold-containing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1520520076,"Cytochrome b561 transfers electrons across secretory vesicle membranes in order to regenerate intravesicular ascorbic acid. To show that cytosolic ascorbic acid is kinetically competent to function as the external electron donor for this process, electron transfer rates between cytochrome b561 in adrenal medullary chromaffin vesicle membranes and external ascorbate/semidehydroascorbate were measured. The reduction of cytochrome b561 by external ascorbate may be measured by a stopped-flow method. The rate constant is 450 (+/- 190) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.0 and increases slightly with pH. The rate of oxidation of cytochrome b561 by external semidehydroascorbate may be deduced from rates of steady-state electron flow. The rate constant is 1.2 (+/- 0.5) x 10(6) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.0 and decreases strongly with pH. The ratio of the rate constants is consistent with the relative midpoint reduction potentials of cytochrome b561 and ascorbate/semidehydroascorbate. These results suggest that cytosolic ascorbate will reduce cytochrome b561 rapidly enough to keep the cytochrome in a mostly reduced state and maintain the necessary electron flux into vesicles. This supports the concept that cytochrome b561 shuttles electrons from cytosolic ascorbate to intravesicular semidehydroascorbate, thereby ensuring a constant source of reducing equivalents for intravesicular monooxygenases."

Chase experiments of alpha-32P-nucleotide-labeled polypeptides with different nonradiolabeled phosphocompounds and sensitivity to different inhibitors demonstrate that the 86-kDa polypeptide is a phosphoesterase, forming a catalytic intermediate. On the other hand, the comparative slow rate of turnover of the polypeptides of higher molecular mass (130, 120, 110, and 100 kDa) suggests that the bound AMP could play a regulatory rather than a catalytic role. Using the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue [alpha, beta-methylene]ATP and dilution experiments with Triton X-100-solubilized membranes, it has been possible to identify the 130-kDa adenylylated polypeptide as a possible target of an adenylylating system. These polypeptides, except the 86-kDa phosphoesterase, are affected in their electrophoretic mobility in the absence of beta-mercaptoethanol. An intercatenary disulfide bond(s) appear(s) to link the polypeptide(s) of 120 kDa and/or 110 kDa in a dimeric structure of apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa. All five polypeptides labeled with [alpha-32P]ATP are glycoproteins bound to the cell plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1593681810,"The origin of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the urine remains ill defined. The present study documents that [3H]PAF (3.5 mu Ci) injected into the renal artery of isolated control rat kidney preparations perfused at constant pressure with a cell-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was excreted in negligible amounts (0.034%) in the urine, whereas 6% was retained by the kidney. When kidneys were perfused with a BSA-free medium, 0.029 and 71% of the total radioactivity added to the perfusate was recovered in the urine and in the renal tissue, respectively. [3H]PAF urine excretion in proteinuric kidneys from adriamycin-treated rats was still negligible (0.015%). Analysis of the renal tissue-retained radioactivity in control and proteinuric kidneys perfused with 1% BSA indicated metabolism into long chain acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine species, lyso-PAF, glycerols, and intact PAF. Thin layer chromatography analysis of [3H]glycerol fraction in these renal extracts showed two major components comigrating with 1-O-alkylglycerol and 1-O-alkyl-2-fatty acylglycerol. Isolated proximal tubules, but not glomeruli from nephrotic rats exposed to increasing concentrations of BSA (0-4%), had a higher PAF uptake than control tubules for BSA concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.1%. Our findings in the isolated perfused kidneys indicate that, in normal conditions, circulating PAF is excreted in the urine in negligible amounts and that the altered glomerular permeability to proteins does not affect this excretion rate. Moreover, analysis of renal tissue radioactivity documented that the renal metabolism of PAF is comparable in control and nephrotic kidneys."
https://openalex.org/W1591280391,"Dexamethasone strongly stimulates the production of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in rat liver. The regulated expression of AGP in cultured liver cells has been variably ascribed to the activation of AGP gene transcription, to change in the nuclear processing of AGP gene transcripts, or to both. Treatment of HTC cells with dexamethasone proportionally enhanced the rate of AGP gene transcription and the concentration of AGP mRNA. To assess whether hormone treatment is indeed capable of affecting posttranscriptionally the level of rat AGP mRNA, a hormone-independent expression vector containing the rat AGP gene was transiently introduced into HepG2 cells. None of the hormone combinations known to modulate expression of the endogenous AGP influenced the steady-state concentration of mature mRNA that was derived from the transgene. Hence, the existence of a hormone-sensitive posttranscriptional regulatory pathway for rat AGP gene expression could not be substantiated."
https://openalex.org/W104633794,"An acid proteinase was purified to apparent homogeneity from the plasmodia of a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, by a combination of detergent extraction, acid precipitation, and column chromatographies on DEAE-Sephadex, hydroxylapatite, CM-Sephadex, and Sephadex G-100. The enzyme was shown to be composed of two polypeptide chains (a 31-kDa heavy chain and a 23-kDa light chain) cross-linked by disulfide bond(s). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the heavy chain was determined to be Ala-Gly-Val- Asp-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Val-Pro-Tyr-Val-Ile-Phe-Asp-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Ile-Pro-Tyr and that of the light chain to be Ala-Glu-Pro-Pro-Ile. The heavy chain contained carbohydrate moiety composed of mannose, glucosamine, fucose, and glucose. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 1.7 toward hemoglobin as a substrate. Among the proteinase inhibitors tested only diazoacetyl-D,L-norleucine methyl ester, a typical aspartic proteinase inhibitor, inhibited the acid proteinase in the presence of cupric ions. It was insensitive to the other typical aspartic proteinase inhibitors, pepstatin A and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane. The enzyme hydrolyzed Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe(4-NO2)-Arg-Leu at the Phe-Phe(4-NO2) bond, but could not hydrolyze another synthetic pepsin-substrate, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine. The enzyme showed a unique substrate specificity toward oxidized insulin B chain. The major cleavage sites were the bonds Gly8-Ser9, Leu11-Val12, Cya19-Gly20, and Phe24-Phe25, and the Gly8-Ser9 bond was most susceptible. These results indicate that the enzyme is a novel type of intracellular acid proteinase with a unique substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1583362651,"The nuclear protein statin, detectable with specific monoclonal antibodies, is found mostly in nonproliferating cells (Wang, E. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 545-551). In the rat liver a 57-kDa protein designated as rat liver protein 57 (RLp57) was recently identified to carry the epitope for the anti-statin-specific monoclonal antibody, S-44 (Sester, U., Moutsatsos, I. K., and Wang, E. (1989) Exp. Cell Res. 182, 550-558). To characterize further the RLp57 protein, in the present study a polyclonal antibody was raised to the RLp57 protein eluted from polyacrylamide gel. Similar to the anti-statin monoclonal antibody, this polyclonal antibody recognizes a nuclear antigen in nonproliferating fibroblasts and reacts with a 57-kDa protein in rat liver and nonproliferating cells strongly suggesting that RLp57 is a statin protein from rat liver. Two isoforms of RLp57 (isoelectric points between 6.5 and 7.0) were detected after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. RLp57 was purified using multiple chromatographic steps, including ion-exchange and affinity chromatography followed by chromatofocusing. These results show that RLp57, a statin protein found in liver, has two isoelectric variants and can be purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential steps of chromatographic procedures."
