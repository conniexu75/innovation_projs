https://openalex.org/W2111352469,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase is a master growth promoter that nucleates two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Despite the diverse processes controlled by mTOR, few substrates are known. We defined the mTOR-regulated phosphoproteome by quantitative mass spectrometry and characterized the primary sequence motif specificity of mTOR using positional scanning peptide libraries. We found that the phosphorylation response to insulin is largely mTOR dependent and that mTOR exhibits a unique preference for proline, hydrophobic, and aromatic residues at the +1 position. The adaptor protein Grb10 was identified as an mTORC1 substrate that mediates the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase typical of cells lacking tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of mTORC1. Our work clarifies how mTORC1 inhibits growth factor signaling and opens new areas of investigation in mTOR biology."

The integrated circuit operates as a broadband radio-frequency mixer at frequencies up to 10 gigahertz. These graphene circuits exhibit outstanding thermal stability with little reduction in performance (less than 1 decibel) between 300 and 400 kelvin. These results open up possibilities of achieving practical graphene technology with more complex functionality and performance."
https://openalex.org/W2164618834,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been associated with the acquisition of motility, invasiveness, and self-renewal traits. During both normal development and tumor pathogenesis, this change in cell phenotype is induced by contextual signals that epithelial cells receive from their microenvironment. The signals that are responsible for inducing an EMT and maintaining the resulting cellular state have been unclear. We describe three signaling pathways, involving transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling, that collaborate to induce activation of the EMT program and thereafter function in an autocrine fashion to maintain the resulting mesenchymal state. Downregulation of endogenously synthesized inhibitors of autocrine signals in epithelial cells enables the induction of the EMT program. Conversely, disruption of autocrine signaling by added inhibitors of these pathways inhibits migration and self-renewal in primary mammary epithelial cells and reduces tumorigenicity and metastasis by their transformed derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W2016500868,"Neurogenesis and gliogenesis continue in discrete regions of the adult mammalian brain. A fundamental question remains whether cell genesis occurs from distinct lineage-restricted progenitors or from self-renewing and multipotent neural stem cells in the adult brain. Here, we developed a genetic marking strategy for lineage tracing of individual, quiescent, and nestin-expressing radial glia-like (RGL) precursors in the adult mouse dentate gyrus. Clonal analysis identified multiple modes of RGL activation, including asymmetric and symmetric self-renewal. Long-term lineage tracing in vivo revealed a significant percentage of clones that contained RGL(s), neurons, and astrocytes, indicating capacity of individual RGLs for both self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Furthermore, conditional Pten deletion in RGLs initially promotes their activation and symmetric self-renewal but ultimately leads to terminal astrocytic differentiation and RGL depletion in the adult hippocampus. Our study identifies RGLs as self-renewing and multipotent neural stem cells and provides novel insights into in vivo properties of adult neural stem cells."

Here, we asked how mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) leave the pluripotent state and choose between germ layer fates.

Since pluripotency circuit expression is sufficient to block all differentiation (Kim et al., 2008Kim J.B. Zaehres H. Wu G. Gentile L. Ko K. Sebastiano V. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Ruau D. Han D.W. Zenke M.

Here, we study the dynamic regulation of pluripotency circuit components during in vitro differentiation to gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms underlying cell fate selection in this system. By analyzing circuit dynamics during lineage selection, we are able to disentangle the complex network (Figure 1B) and focus on key factors that both regulate pluripotency and control germ layer differentiation. While most pluripotency circuit factors are downregulated or variably expressed during differentiation, Oct4 and Sox2 are not. Oct4 is upregulated in cells choosing the ME fate but repressed in cells choosing the NE fate. Conversely, Sox2 protein level is upregulated in cells choosing the NE and repressed in those choosing the ME fate. Oct4 and Sox2 protein levels provide continuous temporal markers of the cell's progression toward lineage selection before lineage specific markers are activated. The lineage specific regulation of Oct4 and Sox2 is necessary for germ layer fate choice and alters their binding pattern in the genome. The intimate involvement of these key nodes of the pluripotency circuit in initiating differentiation enables the cell to integrate signals and choose between different fates. We identified transcription factors and DNA binding proteins that are expressed in ESCs and studied their regulation in ME and NE progenitor cells (Figure 1C) using published microarray data (Shen et al., 2008Shen X. Liu Y. Hsu Y.J. Fujiwara Y. Kim J. Mao X. Yuan G.C. Orkin S.H. EZH1 mediates methylation on histone H3 lysine 27 and complements EZH2 in maintaining stem cell identity and executing pluripotency.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). We found that many genes (diagonal points in Figure 1C) present in the ESC are downregulated in both ME and NE cells, including Klf4, a pluripotency circuit factor, and Rex1, a commonly used ESC marker (Masui et al., 2008Masui S. Ohtsuka S. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Ko M.S. Niwa H. Rex1/Zfp42 is dispensable for pluripotency in mouse ES cells.BMC Dev. Biol. 2008; 8: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (see the Extended Experimental Procedures available online). However, several genes were present in the ESC and differentially present in either ME or NE progenitors and fell near either axis in Figure 1C. We identified a class of genes that was expressed in ESC and ME progenitors but specifically downregulated in NE progenitor cells (Figure 1C, red points). This ME class of genes contained the pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog, Klf5, Tbx3, and Klf9. Complementarily, a class of genes, we call the NE class, was expressed in ESCs and in NE progenitor cells but downregulated in ME progenitor cells (Figure 1C, green points). This class contained the pluripotency circuit gene Sox2, as well as Foxp1, Rbpj, Dnmt3a, and Zfp532. We classified genes as belonging to the ME or NE class based upon their distance from the diagonal in Figure 1C (a table with distances and p values is in Figure S1C ; see the Extended Experimental Procedures for details). Surprisingly, many of the core pluripotency circuit genes, including Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Klf5, and Tbx3, had signatures of lineage specific regulation, suggesting a deeper connection between pluripotency maintenance and lineage choice. We then developed an experimental system for studying the expression of the ME and NE class genes during lineage choice in single cells. We reconstituted the NE versus ME cell fate decision in vitro and established an experimental system in which we could differentiate a cell population into either the ME or NE lineage by adding Wnt or retinoic acid. We maintained ESCs in the pluripotent state using LIF and BMP in defined conditions without serum or feeder cells using methods described previously (Ying et al., 2003aYing Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A.

The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar) (Extended Experimental Procedures). Cells removed from pluripotency promoting conditions did not immediately respond to NE or ME inducing signals, and this effect has been reported in the literature (Jackson et al., 2010Jackson S.A. Schiesser J. Stanley E.G. Elefanty A.G. Differentiating embryonic stem cells pass through ‘temporal windows’ that mark responsiveness to exogenous and paracrine mesendoderm inducing signals.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, after 48 hr in N2B27, a defined medium that lacks differentiation signals (Extended Experimental Procedures), cells became competent to respond to signals. After 48 hr in N2B27, cells responded to Wnt3a or CHIR, a Wnt agonist, by activating the core mesendodermal regulators Brachyury and Foxa2 (Figure 1D and Figure S1D), with more than 70% of cells expressing Brachyury within 36 hr of signal addition at high levels of signal (e.g., 3 μM CHIR). After 48 hr in N2B27, retinoic acid (RA) or FGF drove NE differentiation and triggered the activation of NE markers, Sox1, Brn2, and Nestin (Figure 1D and Figure S1E). Consistent with the published literature, 70% of cells activated Sox1 within 36 hr of signal addition (Abranches et al., 2009Abranches E. Silva M. Pradier L. Schulz H. Hummel O. Henrique D. Bekman E. Neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells in vitro: a road map to neurogenesis in the embryo.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, Ying et al., 2003bYing Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). In this way, Wnt or retinoic acid signals drove high-efficiency differentiation of ESCs to the ME or NE cell fate, respectively. Even in the presence of Wnt3a or CHIR, a population of cells activated Sox1, the NE regulator, and not Brachyury, the ME regulator. This is presumably due to the paracrine FGF signaling between the cells leading some cells to adopt the NE fate (Ying et al., 2003bYing Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Using a previously validated Sox1-GFP reporter cell line (Ying et al., 2003bYing Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) and Brachyury immunofluorescence, we could detect Sox1 and Brachyury activation in the same cell population (Ying et al., 2003bYing Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). In cell populations treated with Wnt3a or CHIR, Sox1-GFP expression and Brachyury staining were mutually exclusive (Figures 1D and 1E). There are no points on the diagonal of the scatter plot in Figure 1E, illustrating the absence of simultaneous high Sox1 and Brachyury expression in single cells. The “L” shape of the scatter plot shows that cells make a discrete decision to activate either Sox1 or Brachyury in vitro. Our ability to induce and detect Sox1 positive and Brachyury-positive cells under identical conditions provided a defined experimental system for studying the regulation of the pluripotency circuit factors during ME versus NE lineage selection. We validated the differentiation protocol with a variety of cell lines. We used immunofluorescence to measure the levels of the proteins identified in Figure 1C in single cells as we took the cells through the differentiation protocol described in the previous section. We performed immunofluorescence staining under identical conditions in all experiments so that protein levels could be quantitatively compared between different cell populations (Sachs et al., 2005Sachs K.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), in populations of cells growing under pluripotency promoting conditions, pluripotency circuit protein levels were strongly correlated across the cell population (Figures 1F–1I). Cells responded to differentiation signals only 48 hr after the withdrawal of pluripotency-promoting conditions (Figure 2A ). After 48 hr in N2B27, microarrays showed that 87% of genes changed by less than 2-fold, while 9% (including many pluripotency factors) were downregulated by more than 2-fold, and 4% were induced by more than 2-fold after 48 hr, as shown by the histogram in Figure 2B. Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Klf5, and Tbx3 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were 5%, 74%, 30%, 14%, 19%, and 12% of their levels in ESCs (Figure 2B). A small number of genes were induced, including Dnmt3b (Figure 2B) (Lu et al., 2009Lu R. Markowetz F. Unwin R.D. Leek J.T. Airoldi E.M. MacArthur B.D. Lachmann A. Rozov R. Ma'ayan A. Boyer L.A. et al.Systems-level dynamic analyses of fate change in murine embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2009; 462: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Dnmt3b is a de novo DNA methyltransferase that acts with Dnmt3a to methylate the promoters of the pluripotency circuit factors including Nanog during germ layer differentiation (Li et al., 2007Li J.Y. Pu M.T. Hirasawa R. Li B.Z. Huang Y.N. Zeng R. Jing N.H. Chen T. Li E. Sasaki H. Xu G.L. Synergistic function of DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the methylation of Oct4 and Nanog.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8748-8759Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Consistent with the microarray data, the protein levels of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Klf4, Klf5, Tbx3, and Klf9 fell during the transition, while Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were induced up to 3-fold (Figures 2C and 2D and Figure S2A ). In Figure 2C, the mean levels of Oct4 and Sox2 in more than 99% of the cells are below the mean expression levels of these proteins in pluripotency supporting conditions. Cell images (Figure 2C) show that Tbx3 and Klf4 protein levels are severely downregulated upon withdrawal of pluripotency sustaining conditions (compare Figure S2A). Thus, while in ESCs Nanog is expressed at high levels and Dnmt3a at low levels (black scatter plot in Figure 2D), after 48 hr, the cells show a complementary pattern of expression with high levels of Dnmt3a and low levels of Nanog (red scatter plot in Figure 2D; images in Figure 2D), consistent with an antagonistic regulatory relationship between these factors (Li et al., 2007Li J.Y. Pu M.T. Hirasawa R. Li B.Z. Huang Y.N. Zeng R. Jing N.H. Chen T. Li E. Sasaki H. Xu G.L. Synergistic function of DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the methylation of Oct4 and Nanog.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8748-8759Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether a fall in Nanog levels might drive the ESC into the responsive state. We found that the mean Nanog protein level in the cell population fell exponentially in time (half-life 7.5 hr) by 100 fold after 48 hr in N2B27 (Figure 2E), suggesting that Nanog downregulation might be an early and causal event for driving the ESC into the responsive state. Consistently, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Nanog in ESCs growing in pluripotency promoting conditions led to a correlated decrease in Oct4 and Sox2 protein levels (Figure S2). Further, in these conditions, CHIR drove Brachyury activation only in cells that had lost Nanog (Figure 2F). In the presence of Nanog, activation of the Wnt pathway with CHIR or other pathway agonists is known to promote pluripotency (Sato et al., 2004Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P.

Thus, Nanog knock down was necessary and sufficient for Brachyury activation by CHIR. The correlated expression pattern of the pluripotency factors in ESCs (Figure 1F) contrasts sharply with the lineage-specific expression pattern that we observed in our microarray analysis (Figure 1C). We asked whether this change in correlation pattern is reflected in protein levels of pluripotency factors in individual cells during differentiation. After 48 hr of pluripotency condition withdrawal (LIF and BMP), cells were not committed to a lineage and could be driven to either cell fate by signal addition (Figure 2A). We added differentiation signals to cells 48 hr after withdrawal of pluripotency conditions. Upon addition of signal (3 μM CHIR, Figures 1D and 1E), some cells adopted the ME (Brachyury expression) and others the NE (Sox1 expression) lineage. We studied the regulation of genes in the ME class (Oct4, Nanog, Klf5, Tbx3, and Klf9) and NE class (Sox2, Foxp1, Dnmt3a, Rbpj, and Zfp532) defined above to ask how the pluripotency circuit is regulated during lineage selection. In addition to the ME and NE class, we studied the pluripotency factor, Klf4, and the key epigenetic regulator, Jarid2, which controls the targeting of repressive epigenetic modifications to the genome in pluripotent and differentiating ESCs (Peng et al., 2009Peng J.C. Valouev A. Swigut T. Zhang J. Zhao Y. Sidow A. Wysocka J.

Of the genes identified from the microarray analysis as belonging to the ME or NE class, Tbx3, Klf4, Klf9, and Rbpj proteins were absent or present at very low levels in cells entering both the NE and ME lineages and were not reactivated during differentiation (Figure 2C and Figure S3). This suggests that these factors play a role in pluripotency maintenance but not in lineage choice. In contrast, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Jarid2, Klf5, Foxp1, and Dnmt3a proteins were present in the nucleus of differentiating cells (Figure 3), and we classified these factors into groups based on their expression pattern.Figure 3Key ESC Transcription Factors Are Differentially Expressed in ME and NE CellsShow full caption(A–G) Cells were differentiated in conditions (see the Experimental Procedures) where some cells adopted the ME fate (Brachyury positive) and others adopted the NE fate (Sox1-GFP positive).

Oct4 and Klf5 constituted the first group of proteins (Figures 3A and 3B). Oct4 protein was present exclusively in Brachyury-positive (ME) cells but absent in Sox1-positive (NE) cells. Consistently, scatter plots of the protein levels of Oct4 versus Brachyury in single cells correlated positively (Figure 3A, red scatter plot). The scatter plots of Oct4 versus Sox1 levels showed that cells with Sox1 have very low levels of Oct4 (Figure 3A, green scatter plot). Klf5 had a similar pattern of protein expression to Oct4. However, rather than being absent in Sox1-positive cells, Klf5 was confined to a subcellular compartment distinct from the nucleus (Figure 3B). The second group of proteins included only Sox2, which was expressed in a complementary pattern to Oct4 and Klf5 (Figure 3C).

We show that the spatial extent of hypoxia is highly sensitive to small changes in the ocean's O(2) content, with maximum responses at suboxic concentrations where anaerobic metabolisms predominate. In model-based reconstructions of historical oxygen changes, the world's largest suboxic zone, in the Pacific Ocean, varies in size by a factor of 2. This is attributable to climate-driven changes in the depth of the tropical and subtropical thermocline that have multiplicative effects on respiration rates in low-O(2) water. The same mechanism yields even larger fluctuations in the rate of nitrogen removal by denitrification, creating a link between decadal climate oscillations and the nutrient limitation of marine photosynthesis."

Together, they undergo activation and differentiation to regenerate pigmented hair. However, the mechanisms behind this coordinated stem cell behavior have not been elucidated. Here, we identified Wnt signaling as a key pathway that couples the behavior of the two stem cells. EpSCs and McSCs coordinately activate Wnt signaling at the onset of hair follicle regeneration within the sHG. Using genetic mouse models that specifically target either EpSCs or McSCs, we show that Wnt activation in McSCs drives their differentiation into pigment-producing melanocytes, while EpSC Wnt signaling not only dictates hair follicle formation but also regulates McSC proliferation during hair regeneration. Our data define a role for Wnt signaling in the regulation of McSCs and also illustrate a mechanism for regeneration of complex organs through collaboration between heterotypic stem cell populations."

We found that at least a 120-residue-long intrinsically disordered linker was required for the import of membrane proteins carrying a nuclear localization signal for the transport factor karyopherin-α. We propose an import mechanism for membrane proteins in which an unfolded linker slices through the NPC scaffold to enable binding between the transport factor and the FG domains in the center of the NPC.

We show that SXL binding downstream of a short uORF imposes a strong negative effect on major reading frame translation. The underlying mechanism involves increasing initiation of scanning ribosomes at the uORF and augmenting its impediment to downstream translation. Our analyses reveal that SXL exerts its effect controlling initiation, not elongation or termination, at the uORF. Probing the generality of the underlying mechanism, we show that the regulatory module that we define experimentally functions in a heterologous context, and we identify natural Drosophila mRNAs that are regulated via this module. We propose that protein-regulated uORFs constitute a systematic principle for the regulation of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016772236,"The H3K27 histone methyltransferase, Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste 2), is a Polycomb group protein that plays important roles in many biological processes including cellular differentiation, stem cell biology, and cancer development. Up-regulation of Ezh2 is observed in various human cancers consistent with its role in cell proliferation. Thus, understanding the regulation of Ezh2 may reveal how it contributes to the cellular proliferation process. Here, we demonstrate that Ezh2 can be regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK1, which phosphorylates Ezh2 at threonines 345 and 487. Consistent with the cell cycle phase during which CDK1 exhibits peak activity, Ezh2 phosphorylation is enriched in cells arrested in mitosis when compared with S-phase. Phosphorylation of Thr-345 and Thr-487 promotes Ezh2 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Furthermore, expression of T345A/T487A confers a proliferative disadvantage when compared with cells expressing wild-type Ezh2, which suggests that phosphorylation of Ezh2 is important for cell proliferation. Collectively, these results establish a novel function for CDK1-mediated Ezh2 phosphorylation and provide a mechanism by which Ezh2 protein levels can be regulated in cells."

Selenite (a ROS-dependent insult) but not staurosporine (a ROS-independent insult) stimulated an early and persistent increase in tMPT/superoxide flash activity prior to mitochondrial fragmentation and a global ROS rise, independently of Bax translocation and cytochrome c release. Selectively targeting tMPT/superoxide flash activity by manipulating cyclophilin D expression or scavenging mitochondrial ROS markedly impacted the progression of selenite-induced apoptosis while exerting little effect on the global ROS response. Furthermore, the tMPT/superoxide flash served as a convergence point for pro- and anti-apoptotic regulation mediated by cyclophilin D and Bcl-2 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2105345752,"Vision begins with photoisomerization of visual pigments. Thermal energy can complement photon energy to drive photoisomerization, but it also triggers spontaneous pigment activation as noise that interferes with light detection. For half a century, the mechanism underlying this dark noise has remained controversial. We report here a quantitative relation between a pigment's photoactivation energy and its peak-absorption wavelength, λ(max). Using this relation and assuming that pigment activations by light and heat go through the same ground-state isomerization energy barrier, we can predict the relative noise of diverse pigments with multi-vibrational-mode thermal statistics. The agreement between predictions and our measurements strongly suggests that pigment noise arises from canonical isomerization. The predicted high noise for pigments with λ(max) in the infrared presumably explains why they apparently do not exist in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1992501047,"Glucose is catabolized in yeast via two fundamental routes, glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, which produces NADPH and the essential nucleotide component ribose-5-phosphate. Here, we describe riboneogenesis, a thermodynamically driven pathway that converts glycolytic intermediates into ribose-5-phosphate without production of NADPH. Riboneogenesis begins with synthesis, by the combined action of transketolase and aldolase, of the seven-carbon bisphosphorylated sugar sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate. In the pathway's committed step, sedoheptulose bisphosphate is hydrolyzed to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate by the enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SHB17), whose activity we identified based on metabolomic analysis of the corresponding knockout strain. The crystal structure of Shb17 in complex with sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate reveals that the substrate binds in the closed furan form in the active site. Sedoheptulose-7-phosphate is ultimately converted by known enzymes of the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway to ribose-5-phosphate. Flux through SHB17 increases when ribose demand is high relative to demand for NADPH, including during ribosome biogenesis in metabolically synchronized yeast cells."

Negative feedback regulation of ALAS-1 by the end product heme is well documented and provides the foundation for heme treatment of acute porphyrias, a group of diseases caused by genetic defects in the heme biosynthesis pathway and exacerbated by controlled up-regulation of ALAS-1. Heme is known to affect ALAS-1 activity by repressing gene transcription, accelerating mRNA degradation, and impeding pre-ALAS-1 mitochondrial translocation. In the current study, we examined the effect of heme on the rate of mature ALAS-1 protein turnover in human cells and tissues and explored the mediator involved in this new regulatory mechanism. We found that heme and other metalloporphyrins such as CoPP and CrPP decreased mitochondrial ALAS-1 protein through proteolysis. This degradative effect cannot be emulated by iron or free protoporphyrin, two major chemical components of the heme ring, and is independent of oxidative stress. Down-regulating the activity of mitochondrial LONP1, an ATP-dependent protease that controls the selective turnover of mitochondrial matrix proteins, with potent inhibitors and specific siRNA diminished the negative effect of heme on mitochondrial ALAS-1.

The iron-protoporphyrin (heme) macrocycle is a primordial molecule that carries out a myriad of essential functions upon which most aerobic life on earth depends. The essential functions of heme in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood (hemoglobin) and in diverse other tissues (myoglobin, neuroglobin) are well known, as is its essential role in catalyzing and accelerating numerous redox reactions, as an essential prosthetic group for cytochromes, peroxidases, and oxygenases. In most animals, heme is synthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA in a complex pathway involving eight enzymes. The first and normally rate-controlling step is carried out by the mitochondrial enzyme 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS). 3The abbreviations used are: ALAS-15–5-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1BHTbutylated hydroxytolueneCoPPcobalt protoporphyrinCrPPchromium protoporphyrinDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideLONP1Lon peptidase 1MG-262Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-B (OH)2MnPPmanganese protoporphyrinAMC7-amino-4-methylcoumarinPPprotoporphyrin IXVDACvoltage-dependent anion channel. The ubiquitous, housekeeping isoform of ALAS is ALAS-1 (ALAS-1), levels of which can be increased remarkably by numerous drugs and chemicals through interactions with several nuclear receptors (e.g. CAR, PXR, and RXR), which form heterodimers and act as positive transcription factors for the ALAS-1 gene, as well as those of cytochromes P-450, the hemoproteins chiefly responsible for phase I metabolism of numerous endogenous intermediates and xenobiotics (1Bonkovsky H.

Uncontrolled up-regulation of ALAS-1 is a biochemical hallmark and sine qua non of acute attacks of hepatic porphyrias, a group of largely inherited disorders in which variable degrees of deficiency in an enzyme of normal hepatic heme synthesis distal to ALAS-1 (e.g. ALA dehydratase, porphobilinogen deaminase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, or protoporphyrinogen oxidase). Such deficiency, especially when coupled with another factor that increases the need of the liver for heme (e.g. for induction of cytochromes P-450) and/or the rate of hepatic heme breakdown (e.g. suicide substrates of cytochromes P-450), leads to derepression of ALAS-1 and thus to marked increases in ALA, porphobilinogen, and other intermediates proximal to the site of the metabolic block in the heme synthetic pathway (1Bonkovsky H.

In view of the above, it is not surprising that glucose loading and intravenous infusions of heme, which both repress ALAS-1, and, in the case of heme, also restores the normal hepatic heme pools; hence, over the years, these treatments remain the mainstays of therapy of acute porphyric attacks (1Bonkovsky H.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), where the translocation signal sequence on the pre-ALAS-1 protein is cleaved and processed into the mature form. This step is essential for activity of the synthase because succinyl-CoA is synthesized in and present in meaningful concentrations only within the mitochondria. In a previous effort to further extend our understanding of ALAS-1 regulation by heme and non-heme metalloporphyrins, we examined the changes in the ALAS-1 protein level in response to exogenous metalloporphyrin treatment. Our data showed varied protein expression patterns. Heme and cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) significantly decreased the amount of a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to the mature form of ALAS-1, while increasing the level of a higher molecular weight form that matched the size of the precursor protein (19Zheng J. Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Donohue S.E. Bonkovsky H.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2008; 319: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results led us to speculate a new level of regulation by heme that functions on affecting the protein turnover rate. Recently, studies performed in rats provided evidence that heme is also capable of enhancing the rate of disappearance (presumably breakdown) of ALAS-1 in mitochondria (20Yoshino K. Munakata H. Kuge O. Ito A. Ogishima T. J. Biochem. 2007; 142: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of the synthase in human health and disease (the acute porphyrias), and in view of the manifold and still unfolding roles of heme in human biology and pathophysiology, we have assessed the effects of heme and other selected metalloporphyrins on the stability of ALAS-1 in mitochondria from human liver cells. We also have explored the mechanisms whereby heme leads to decreased levels of ALAS-1 in mitochondria.

The fluorescence of AMC is quenched by LLVY, upon cleavage into two separate fragments by the 20 S proteasome, the fluorescence of AMC is recovered and can be quantified. Therefore, relative fluorescence units of AMC is a measurement of 20 S proteasome activity (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 480 nm). Harvested cells or fresh human liver tissue were homogenized gently in the buffer that contained 250 mm sucrose and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) on ice and then were spun down by conventional differential centrifugation with a final spin at 8600 × g. The mitochondria were suspended in 250 mm sucrose and 5 mm MOPS (pH 7.2). Mitochondrial protein was determined using the Pierce Coomassie protein assay reagent kit. The mitochondria-enriched pellets, prepared by differential centrifugation, were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde, stained with osmium tetroxide, sectioned at 1 micron, and examined by electron microscopy. Representative fields were photographed. Protein preparations and Western immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (19Zheng J. Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Donohue S.E. Bonkovsky H.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2008; 319: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, total proteins (75 μg) were separated on 7.5% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoretic transfer onto Immun-Blot PVDF membranes, the membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. The dilutions of the primary antibodies were as follows: 1:5000 for anti-ALAS-1, 1:2000 for VDAC1/porin, 1:1000 for anti-LONP1, 1:1000 for anti-calnexin, and 1:1000 for anti-GAPDH. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution). Finally, the bound antibodies were visualized with the ECL-Plus chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). A Kodak 1DV3.6 computer-based imaging system (Eastman-Kodak, Rochester, NY) was used to measure the relative optical density of each specific band obtained after Western immunoblotting analysis. Data are expressed as percentage of the vehicle control (DMSO). Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times with similar results. All experiments included at least triplicate samples for each treatment group. Representative results from a single experiment are presented. Initial inspection showed that the results were normally distributed. Therefore, parametric statistical procedures were used. Statistical analyses of data were performed with JMP 6.0.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Student's t test for comparisons of two means and analysis of variance (F statistics) for comparisons of more than two, with pair-wise comparisons by the Kruskal-Wallis test were performed when appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Transmission electron micrographs of the subcellular fractions enriched for mitochondria revealed abundant, intact mitochondria with numerous cristae, as well as circular membrane-bound structures of various sizes (Fig. 1A). These fractions contained VDAC1/porin protein and the lower molecular mass (68 kDa) form of ALAS-1 but not the higher molecular mass pre-ALAS-1 (Fig. 1B). They contained no detectable GAPDH (a marker of soluble cytosolic protein) or calnexin (a marker of endoplasmic reticulum/microsomes). Compared with vehicle (DMSO) alone, addition of heme (0.1–10 μm) to mitochondrially enriched fractions led to a temperature- and time-dependent decrease in detectable ALAS-1 (data not shown). The effects were maximal at 1 μm exogenous heme added and increased progressively with length of incubation (0–8 h) (Fig. 2A). The effects observed at 30 °C, the temperature routinely used, were abolished when incubations were performed at 0 °C (results not shown). Effects of heme were similar when mitochondrially enriched fractions of Huh-7, Huh-7.5, or HepG2 homogenates were compared (Fig. 2B). The half-life of ALAS-1 protein was 8.7 h in the absence of heme (DMSO as vehicle) but only 3.4 h (2.5-fold decrease) in the presence of heme 1 μm (Fig. 2C). Depletion of endogenous heme using a heme synthetic inhibitor, 4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid, a potent inhibitor of heme synthesis, increased ALAS-1 protein stability (to 57.1 h). Additionally, heme also markedly decreased ALAS-1 protein levels in mitochondria isolated from human liver biopsies (Fig. 2D). Heme is a porphyrin ring coordinated with an iron molecule. To further dissect the mechanism(s) of action of heme on mitochondrial ALAS-1, we also tested the effect of iron and free protoporphyrin on the fate of ALAS-1; neither affected expression, suggesting the requirement of an intact heme macrocycle for ALAS-1 regulation (Fig. 3A). Mitochondria harbor cellular respiration machinery that is a major source of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Free cellular heme as the main carrier of redox-active iron can synergize with mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species and further promote oxidative stress. To evaluate whether the pro-oxidant property of heme contributes to the observed ALAS-1 down-regulation, we treated mitochondrial preparations with tert-butyl hydroperoxide solution, an oxidant, and BHT, an antioxidant, in the presence or absence of heme. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide solution treatment resulted in decreased ALAS-1 expression (Fig. 3B), whereas BHT alone slightly increased ALAS-1 half-life (Fig. 3C), implying that redox regulation of ALAS-1 may exist. However, BHT did not affect heme-induced ALAS-1 down-regulation (Fig. 3D), strongly suggesting that heme exerts its effect on ALAS-1 through a mechanism independent of oxidative stress. Addition of other metalloporphyrins (1 μm), especially cobalt or chromium protoporphyrin, also led to a decrease in ALAS-1 protein in mitochondrially enriched fractions from Huh-7 cells or human liver tissue (Fig. 3E). A protease inhibitor mixture consisting of aprotinin, leupeptin, bestatin, pepstatin A, and E-64, inhibiting a wide spectrum of protease activity that might be present in the mitochondrial preparations, was used to determine whether protein degradation accounts for reduced ALAS-1 protein expression in mitochondria. The mixture increased the amount of mitochondrial ALAS-1 in the absence of heme and also minimized the down-regulating effect of heme on ALAS-1 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that a proteolytic event is involved in mitochondrial regulation of ALAS-1. CA-074 Me, a selective inhibitor of cathepsin B, produced a profound and durable inhibition of activity of this lysosomal enzyme (supplemental Fig. S1). Nevertheless, even in the presence of such inhibition, heme continued to exert its down-regulatory effect on ALAS-1 protein (Fig. 4B). MG-262 is a potent boron-containing inhibitor of Lon protease. Addition of MG-262 (10 μm), either 4 h prior to, or concurrent with, the addition of heme (1 μm), led to a complete abrogation of the heme effect to accelerate the disappearance of ALAS-1 protein (Fig. 4C). In fact, under both heme and no heme conditions, MG-262 slightly increased the level of ALAS-1 protein compared with null MG-262 treatment, suggesting that the inhibitory function of MG-262 stabilized ALAS-1. The greater selectivity of MG-262 for and the higher potency against 20S proteasome over LONP1 raises concern about the proteasomal involvement in this process. Indeed, we detected residual proteasomal activity in our mitochondrial preparation (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, we used a more specific proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin, which showed no effect on LONP1 activity (22Bayot A. Basse N. Lee I. Gareil M. Pirotte B. Bulteau A.L. Friguet B. Reboud-Ravaux M. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Epoxomicin, at the concentration that significantly decreased the proteasomal activity in our mitochondrial preparation (supplemental Fig. S2), did not affect heme-mediated disappearance of ALAS-1 (Fig. 4D). To further establish the role of LONP1 protease in the heme-induced decrease in mitochondrial ALAS-1, we silenced the endogenous LONP1 protease gene by transfecting hepatocytes with LONP1-specific siRNA pools. As expected, the siRNAs markedly decreased levels of endogenous LONP1 protein (supplemental Fig. S3A) without significant reduction in the steady state protein level of ALAS-1 (Fig. 4E). LONP1 knockdown diminished heme-dependent down-regulation of ALAS-1 protein (Fig. 4E). siRNA transfection did not alter the 20 S proteasomal activity (supplemental Fig. S3B), supporting the notion that proteasome was not responsible for the observed decrease of ALAS-1 by heme. In other experiments, we found that exogenous heme (1 μm for 8 h) did not affect levels of LONP1 protein in mitochondrially enriched fractions (supplemental Fig. S4). Previous studies performed by our group showed that in cell lines of human hepatocellular carcinomas exogenous heme down-regulates the lower molecular weight band of human ALAS-1 protein (19Zheng J. Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Donohue S.E. Bonkovsky H.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2008; 319: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which corresponds to the size of the mature form ALAS-1 located in the mitochondria, suggesting a heme-induced mechanism that controls the fate of the functional form of ALAS-1. In the present study, we further investigated this possibility in isolated mitochondria where pre-ALAS-1 is processed into the mature protein and poised for initiating heme synthesis. Our data indicate that in both human cell lines and liver tissue heme significantly decreases the half-life of mitochondrial ALAS-1, whereas in heme-depleted conditions, generated with 4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid pretreatment, an inhibitor of the second enzyme of the heme biosynthesis pathway, mitochondrial ALAS-1 exhibited prolonged stability. Iron and protoporphyrin did not emulate the effect of heme, and addition of an antioxidant failed to diminish the decrease of ALAS-1. Heme has been known to down-regulate ALAS-1 by a negative feedback loop that involves repression of transcription, acceleration of mRNA degradation, and impairment of mitochondrial import of the protein (1Bonkovsky H. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology: A Textbook of Liver Disease. W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1990: 378-424Google Scholar, 2Meyer U.A. Drug Metab.

Cell. 2005; 122: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated an additional dimension of posttranslational regulation of ALAS-1, adding to the complexity of the heme control of ALAS-1 function. One apparent advantage of such regulation is the control of ALAS-1 activity inside mitochondria, allowing for very rapid response of the heme biosynthetic pathway to intramitochondrial levels of heme. Similar findings in rat liver mitochondria were reported recently (20Yoshino K. Munakata H. Kuge O. Ito A. Ogishima T. J. Biochem. 2007; 142: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting that direct mitochondrial control of ALAS-1 by heme is a conserved regulatory mechanism across species. Treating isolated mitochondria with a protease inhibitor reversed the negative effect of heme on ALAS-1 protein, suggesting that a proteolytic process is involved. We excluded the possible involvement of proteasomal activity in this process by using the proteasome-specific inhibitor epoxomicin. Epoxomicin exerted no effect on heme-mediated degradation of ALAS-1. The turnover of mitochondrial proteins is usually determined by two pathways: 1) lysosomal degradation via autophagy and 2) mitochondria-specific protein quality control system (23Kim I. Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Lemasters J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 462: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 24Langer T. Neupert W. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results with a cathepsin B inhibitor indicated that the lysosomal system made minimum contribution to heme-induced ALAS-1 turnover, suggesting that a mitochondrial protease carried out the degradation. It is well established that mitochondrially located proteins face constant oxidative challenges due to the presence of inevitable reactive oxygen species by-products of aerobic respiration; such stress-induced protein damage and aggregation pose risks to normal biological functions. Therefore, monitoring for and scavenging damaged proteins are needed on a continuous basis. However, compared with the cytosolic protein quality control system, mitochondrial proteases and chaperones are less well characterized. Our data suggest that LONP1, a nuclearly encoded and mitochondrially located stress-responsive protease, is involved in heme-mediated ALAS-1 turnover. Mammalian Lon1 protease is a homologue of bacterial protease La and yeast PIM1 and has been implicated throughout evolution in the degradation of stress-damaged mitochondrial enzymes (25Yan L.J. Levine R.L. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A second ATP-dependent matrix protease identified to date is ClpXP. Thus far, no physiologically significant substrates have been assigned to mammalian ClpXP. We do not exclude the possibility that other mitochondrial protease systems are also involved in heme-ALAS-1 regulation. The molecular mechanism of heme-mediated mitochondrial ALAS-1 degradation also calls for further investigation. How ALAS-1 in presence of heme overload is marked for degradation remains unanswered. The lack of effect of iron or free porphyrin and the observation that the down-regulating activity of heme is separate from redox regulation point to a mechanism by which the entire heme macrocycle is required as a signaling molecule. Heme as a prosthetic group affects the function and fate of many proteins. Noteworthy examples include the important mammalian transcription repressor Bach1 and yeast transcription activator HAP1 (26Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 27Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). ALAS-1 has three CP motifs known as heme regulatory motifs, one in the N terminus of the mature protein and two in the leader sequence of the preprotein. The functional role of these CP motifs in ALAS-1 has been studied in respect to heme regulation of mitochondrial translocation (17Hayashi N. Watanabe N. Kikuchi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Similar CP motifs have been identified in Bach1 and HAP1 and shown to regulate the activity of these proteins. We plan to examine whether the CP motif functions as a heme sensor and mediates the heme effect on mitochondrial ALAS-1. Another aspect that needs to be taken into consideration involves mitochondrial matrix protein processing. Like most mitochondrial matrix proteins, ALAS-1 is synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently transferred across the outer and inner membranes of mitochondria, a process requiring additional processing by peptidases and protection by chaperones for proper folding. Whether heme regulates presequence processing and how that would affect ALAS-1 stability and function are also in need of further examination. Our present experimental system was not designed to address these issues and future research is warranted. Heme infusion is the standard therapy for acute porphyrias but its effect is often short-lived due to the activation of heme oxygenase-1 and sometimes associated with undesirable side effects. Indeed, recent studies in our laboratory show that heme treatment increases mRNA expression of several proinflammatory genes and stress response genes. 4H. L. Bonkovsky, unpublished observations. Many synthetic metalloporphyrins are structurally related to heme but display varied activity toward activating heme oxygenase and inducing adverse reactions. Non-heme metalloporphyrins, therefore, are considered potential alternatives for the effective treatment of porphyria. We also examined the effect of other metalloporphyrins on ALAS-1 protein expression; we found that three transition metal-complexed porphyrins, namely CoPP, CrPP, and MnPP, also down-regulate mitochondrial ALAS-1 to various extents. CoPP and CrPP have been shown to regulate ALAS-1 mRNA levels (19Zheng J. Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Donohue S.E. Bonkovsky H.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2008; 319: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A better understanding of how non-heme metalloporphyrins work is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies.

https://openalex.org/W1965579368,"Many steps in nuclear RNA processing, surveillance, and degradation require TRAMP, a complex containing the poly(A) polymerase Trf4p, the Zn-knuckle protein Air2p, and the RNA helicase Mtr4p. TRAMP polyadenylates RNAs designated for decay or trimming by the nuclear exosome. It has been unclear how polyadenylation by TRAMP differs from polyadenylation by conventional poly(A) polymerase, which produces poly(A) tails that stabilize RNAs. Using reconstituted S. cerevisiae TRAMP, we show that TRAMP inherently suppresses poly(A) addition after only 3-4 adenosines. This poly(A) tail length restriction is controlled by Mtr4p. The helicase detects the number of 3'-terminal adenosines and, over several adenylation steps, elicits precisely tuned adjustments of ATP affinities and rate constants for adenylation and TRAMP dissociation. Our data establish Mtr4p as a critical regulator of polyadenylation by TRAMP and reveal that an RNA helicase can control the activity of another enzyme in a highly complex fashion and in response to features in RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2118223704,"Peroxisomal matrix protein import is facilitated by cycling receptors shuttling between the cytosol and the peroxisomal membrane. One crucial step in this cycle is the ATP-dependent release of the receptors from the peroxisomal membrane. This step is facilitated by the peroxisomal AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) proteins Pex1p and Pex6p with ubiquitination of the receptor being the main signal for its export. Here we report that the AAA complex contains dislocase as well as deubiquitinating activity. Ubp15p, a ubiquitin hydrolase, was identified as a novel constituent of the complex. Ubp15p partially localizes to peroxisomes and is capable of cleaving off ubiquitin moieties from the type I peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) receptor Pex5p. Furthermore, Ubp15p-deficient cells are characterized by a stress-related PTS1 import defect. The results merge into a picture in which removal of ubiquitin from the PTS1 receptor Pex5p is a specific event and might represent a vital step in receptor recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1979221570,"Superfluidity and superconductivity are remarkable manifestations of quantum coherence at a macroscopic scale. The dynamics of superfluids has dominated the study of these systems for decades now, but a comprehensive theoretical framework is still lacking. We introduce a local extension of the time-dependent density functional theory to describe the dynamics of fermionic superfluids. Within this approach one can correctly represent vortex quantization, generation, and dynamics, the transition from a superfluid to a normal phase and a number of other large amplitude collective modes which are beyond the scope of two-fluid hydrodynamics, Ginzburg-Landau and/or Gross-Pitaevskii approaches. We illustrate the power of this approach by studying the generation of quantized vortices, vortex rings, vortex reconnection, and transition from a superfluid to a normal state in real time for a unitary Fermi gas. We predict the emergence of a new qualitative phenomenon in superfluid dynamics of gases, the existence of stable superfluidity when the systems are stirred with velocities significantly exceeding the nominal Landau critical velocity in these systems."
https://openalex.org/W2156457911,"The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine is one of the most potent and frequently used proapoptotic stimuli, although its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here, we show that staurosporine as well as its analog 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) not only trigger the classical mitochondrial apoptosis pathway but, moreover, activate an additional novel intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Unlike conventional anticancer drugs, staurosporine and UCN-01 induced apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells overexpressing the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). Furthermore, activation of this novel intrinsic apoptosis pathway by staurosporine did not rely on Apaf-1 and apoptosome formation, an essential requirement for the mitochondrial pathway. Nevertheless, as demonstrated in caspase-9-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, human lymphoma cells, and chicken DT40 cells, staurosporine-induced apoptosis was essentially mediated by caspase-9. Our results therefore suggest that, in addition to the classical cytochrome c/Apaf-1-dependent pathway of caspase-9 activation, staurosporine can induce caspase-9 activation and apoptosis independently of the apoptosome. Since staurosporine derivatives have proven efficacy in clinical trials, activation of this novel pathway might represent a powerful target to induce apoptosis in multidrug-resistant tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003613639,"Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) is the major enzyme in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that catalyzes the endogenous production of H2S. Phenotypic switching of SMCs is affected by endogenous H2S level and alterations of this switching may result in vascular disorders. To date, the mechanisms underlying the alteration of CSE expression and H2S production in vascular proliferative diseases have been unclear. In the present study, we found that serum deprivation induced SMC differentiation marker gene expressions and increased CSE expression and H2S production in cultured human aorta SMCs (HASMCs). Carotid artery ligation in mice resulted in enhanced neointima formation and down-regulation of CSE expression, suggesting an important role of CSE in SMC differentiation. Transient transfection of HASMCs with human CSE (hCSE) promoter/luciferase reporter revealed that the region between −226 to +140 base pair contains the core promoter for the hCSE gene. Deletion and mutation analysis demonstrated that two specificity protein-1 (Sp1) consensus binding sites were present in the core promoter region of the hCSE gene. Incubation of HASMCs with Sp1 binding inhibitor mithramycin inhibited CSE mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of Sp1 alone was sufficient to increase the activity of the hCSE core promoter and CSE protein expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that the binding of Sp1 to the hCSE promoter was increased in differentiated HASMCs compared with that in proliferated HASMCs. Exogenously applied H2S at 100 μm stimulated SMC differentiation, which was reversed by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580.

Cardiovasc Res. 2010; 86: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that lower endogenous levels of H2S attributable to suppression of CSE expression could be pathogenic in diverse cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms for altered CSE expression in these pathological conditions remain unclear. It is therefore essential to decipher signaling and regulatory pathways for abnormal expression and/or function regulation of CSE/H2S system in these pathological conditions.In the current study, we demonstrated that CSE expression was reduced in proliferated SMCs and ligated carotid arteries accompanying with decreased expression of SMC differentiation marker genes. We also found that transcript factor specificity protein-1 (Sp1) is a critical regulator for CSE expression during SMC phenotype change, and the CSE/H2S system is required for maintenance of differentiated SMC phenotype.DISCUSSIONCell differentiation is a process by which multipotent cells in the developing organism acquire those cell-specific characteristics that distinguish them from other cell types. SMCs within adult blood vessels exhibit very low synthetic activity and express a unique repertoire of contractile proteins and signaling molecules required for the contractile function of the cell (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar, 2Metharom P. Caplice N.M. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2007; 5: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Upon vascular injury, SMCs are able to undergo a phenotypic change from a differentiated (contractile phenotype) to a dedifferentiated (synthetic phenotype) state, and the expressions of SMC differentiation marker genes are reduced (4Yoshida T. Owens G.K. Circ Res. 2005; 96: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 5Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.M. Yet S.F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A similar transition from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype occurs when SMCs are established in culture (18Han M. Wen J.K. Zheng B. Cheng Y. Zhang C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Matsushita T. Rama A. Charolidi N. Dupont E. Severs N.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 86: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Dedifferentiated SMCs are able to change back into the differentiated phenotype, termed rediffereniation, a common cellular event in the recovery from vascular injury and regression of atherosclerosis in vivo (25Orr A.W. Hastings N.E. Blackman B.R. Wamhoff B.R. J. Vasc Res. 2010; 47: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of SMC phenotypic change is still poorly understood.CSE is an inducible enzyme in many types of cells, responsible for the production of H2S (11Wang Y. Zhao X. Jin H. Wei H. Li W.

Wallace J.L. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1210-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The present study confirmed that the expression of CSE mRNA was down-regulated in the ligated carotid artery accompanied by neointimal formation and reduced expressions of SMC differentiation marker genes (Fig. 2). When SMCs were established in culture, CSE expression was reduced significantly compared with that in the tissues of mesentery arteries (Fig. 8D). We hypothesized that SMCs would be mainly responsible for the reduced CSE expression during vascular injury and neointimal formation. As expected, serum withdrawal in cultured HASMCs induced redifferentiation and stimulated CSE expression at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, the expressions of CSE mRNA and protein as well as H2S production were significantly decreased in proliferated HASMCs induced by serum (Fig. 1). Our previous study demonstrated that treatment with H2S significantly reduced neointimal lesion formation by inhibiting SMC proliferation in rats (12Meng Q.H. Yang G. Yang W. Jiang B. Wu L. Wang R. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1406-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All of these findings beg the questions: how is CSE regulated during SMC phenotypic change, and does CSE/H2S play a role in regulating SMC differentiation?Gene expression is finely controlled by the relative promoter sequence containing varying cis-acting elements in the 5′-flanking region. Transcription factors can bind to these specific cis-acting sequences to regulate transcription of the gene by assisting RNA polymerase binding (28Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. (2003) Genome. Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 29Sellak H. Yang X. Cao X. Cornwell T. Soff G.A. Lincoln T. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sp1, a zinc finger protein, is an important component of the eukaryotic cellular transcriptional machinery (30Safe S. Abdelrahim M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2438-2448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrated that Sp1 is a critical regulator of the hCSE gene transcription during SMC phenotypic switching. Firstly, the hCSE gene core promoter contained two Sp1 binding sites, and deletion or mutation of these two Sp1 binding sites markedly decreased hCSE promoter activity (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Secondly, inhibiting Sp1 binding with mithramycin attenuated CSE mRNA expression and the hCSE core promoter activity (Fig. 5). Mithramycin is a drug that binds to GC-rich regions in chromatin and interferes with the transcription of genes that bear GC-rich motifs in their promoters (31Blume S.W. Snyder R.C. Ray R. Thomas S. Koller C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Third, in the absence of Sp1 in SL-2 cells, the hCSE core promoter activity was negligible; but Sp1 overexpression significantly stimulated hCSE core promoter activity in both SL-2 cells and HASMCs (Fig. 6). Fourth, ChIP assay confirmed Sp1 binds to the hCSE promoter at the predicted sites in HASMCs (Fig. 7). Furthermore, compared with proliferated HASMCs, hCSE core promoter activity was significantly higher in differentiated HASMCs, and there were more binding of Sp1 to the hCSE promoter in differentiated HASMCs. These observations suggest that serum withdrawal stabilizes Sp1 binding to the hCSE promoter. Increase in the binding of Sp1 after serum withdrawal could be due to an increase in Sp1 abundance. We therefore evaluated Sp1 protein abundance in differentiated SMCs versus proliferated SMCs. Western blotting analysis showed significant higher Sp1 protein expression in differentiated SMCs compared with that in proliferated SMCs (Fig. 7C). The induction of CSE mRNA and protein expressions after serum withdrawal correlated with the change in Sp1 protein expression. Posttranslational induction of Sp1 in differentiated SMCs may also contribute to transcriptional activation of CSE gene. It has been suggested that DNA binding activity of Sp1 can be modulated either positively or negatively by phosphorylation (32Reisinger K. Kaufmann R. Gille J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The Sp1 protein contains consensus phosphorylation sites for many kinases including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, MAPK, casein kinases 1 and 2, and calmodulin kinases (33Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Burns A. Sinha S. McDonald O.G. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Here, we also found that serum withdrawal stimulated Sp1 phosphorylation in HASMCs. It is likely that different kinases or phosphatases target selected motifs of Sp1 in response to extracellular stimuli and thus alter Sp1 phosphorylation. Sp1 also can influence gene expression by changing its nuclear concentration and interacting with the promoter or by providing architectural support, serving as a co-factor, or by undergoing other chemical modification (35Schäfer D. Hamm-Künzelmann B. Brand K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression change of Sp1 protein and the posttranslational regulation of Sp1 protein during SMC phenotypic switching need to be further explored.The fact that Sp1 increases CSE expression in differentiated SMCs raises the possibility that Sp1 may alter the expressions of multiple genes that contribute to phenotypic switching. Indeed, Sp1 has been shown to increase the expressions of many genes involved in regulating SMC proliferation. PPARα activated p16 gene transcription by interacting with Sp1 at specific proximal Sp1-binding sites of the p16 promoter, which leads to inhibition of SMC proliferation and intimal hyperplasia (36Gizard F. Amant C. Barbier O. Bellosta S. Robillard R. Percevault F. Sevestre H. Krimpenfort P. Corsini A. Rochette J. Glineur C. Fruchart J.C. Torpier G. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3228-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Posttranslational induction of Sp1 DNA-binding activity contributed to the induction of p27 expression and SMC growth arrest at late time points after balloon angioplasty in rats (37Andrés V. Ureña J. Poch E. Chen D. Goukassian D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sp1 is also an important transcriptional modulator of p21 (38Santiago F.S. Ishii H. Shafi S. Khurana R. Kanellakis P. Bhindi R. Ramirez M.J. Bobik A. Martin J.F. Chesterman C.N. Zachary I.C. Khachigian L.M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sp1 overexpression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in SMCs by stimulating the Fas ligand (39Kavurma M.M. Santiago F.S. Bonfoco E. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4964-4971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, others have reported that a proproliferative role for Sp1 in SMCs (40Chan J. Prado-Lourenco L. Khachigian L.M. Bennett M.R. Di Bartolo B.A. Kavurma M.M. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Santiago F.S. Khachigian L.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Various factors, including species- and tissue-specific SMC, SMC growth density, and serum withdrawal time, resulted in these differences (18Han M. Wen J.K. Zheng B. Cheng Y. Zhang C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The contribution of Sp1 to tumor cell differentiation has been the subject of intense investigation (42Ellenrieder V. Anticancer Res. 2008; 28: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar, 43Takeda T. Sakata M. Isobe A. Yamamoto T. Nishimoto F. Minekawa R. Hayashi M. Okamoto Y. Desprez P.Y. Tasaka K. Murata Y.

In contrast to tumor cells, little is known about the role of Sp1 in promoting SMC differentiation. The present study first demonstrated the involvement of Sp1-stimulated CSE expression and H2S production during SMC differentiation. It is worthy noted here, although Sp1 is expressed ubiquitously, there are significant differences in the expression levels of Sp1 in different cell types (46Maruyama I. Zhou L. Sugar J. Yue B.Y. Curr. Eye Res. 2000; 21: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that the level of Sp1 protein in various tissues may contribute to the regulation of lineage-specific genes.Another major finding of this study is the induction of SMC differentiation maker gene expressions by H2S in the presence but not absence of serum (Fig. 8). There were less CSE expression and H2S production in the presence of serum, and exogenous supplementation of H2S would overcome the absence of CSE, leading to increased expressions of SMC differentiation maker genes. H2S inhibited serum-stimulated SMC proliferation, which suggests that H2S may promote coordinated regulation of proliferation and contractile proteins expression to induce the differentiated SMC phenotype. The induction of cell differentiation by H2S in other cell types has been reported. Pronounced genetic differentiation was observed in extremophile fish when exposed to H2S (47Plath M. Hauswaldt J.S. Moll K. Tobler M. García De León F.J. Schlupp I. Tiedemann R. Mol. Ecol. 2007; 16: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). H2S stimulated epithelial cell differentiation by inducing intestinal expression of rhodanese (48Ramasamy S. Singh S. Taniere P. Langman M.J. Eggo M.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Differently, inhibition of CSE activity significantly decreased the expressions of SMC differentiation marker genes, indicating CSE/H2S signaling is essential for the maintenance of the contractile and differentiated SMC phenotype. These data are consistent with a model wherein CSE was listed as a potential cytoplasmic marker of hematopoietic differentiation (49Link D. Drebing C. Glode L.M. Blut. 1983; 47: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Human lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines CEM and Laz-221 contained undetectable CSE protein, corresponding to their behavior as cysteine auxotrophs. In contrast, nonmalignant lymphoblastoid lines contained easily detectable CSE protein, which correlates with their behavior as cysteine prototrophs, suggesting that this enzyme may be a useful marker of cellular differentiation (50Glode L.M. Epstein A. Smith C.G. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2249-2254PubMed Google Scholar, 51Klein C.E. Roberts B. Holcenberg J. Glode L.M. Cancer. 1988; 62: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).One more interesting finding in this study is that blockage of p38 MAPK reversed H2S-stimulated SMC differentiation maker gene expressions in HASMCs (Fig. 8B). The MAPK family represents important signal transduction machinery and occupies a central position in cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis (52Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Previous study has demonstrated that both ERK and p38 MAPK were activated by H2S incubation and down-regulation of ERK activity inhibited H2S-induced apoptosis in SMCs. However, inhibition of p38 MAPK did not alter the apoptotic sensitivity of HASMCs to H2S (16Yang G. Sun X. Wang R. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It was questioned at that time what is the actual role of p38 MAPK stimulated by H2S in HASMCs. Here, we further provided evidence that p38 MAPK was involved in H2S-regulated SMC differentiation. Extensive studies have established the key role of serum response factor in regulating SMC differentiation (53Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 54Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK was shown to be associated with an increase in serum response factor-dependent transcription of SMC differentiation marker genes (53Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 54Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N.

Chem. 2005; 280: 31172-31181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Taking these observations together, it is reasonable to speculate that H2S may increase the interaction of serum response factor and SMC differentiation marker genes by stimulating the activation of p38 MAPK, and p38 MAPK plays a central role in the regulation of SMC phenotypic switching.The transcriptional regulation of mouse CSE gene expression has been studied (56Ishii I. Akahoshi N. Yu X.N. Kobayashi Y. Namekata K. Komaki G. Kimura H. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analysis of the promoter region of mouse CSE gene revealed the presence of a potential Sp1 binding site (5′-GAGGCGGGGC-3′) located within the −155/+27 region of the mouse CSE promoter, and deletion of Sp1 binding sites significantly decreased the basic promoter activity of mouse CSE gene in HEK-293 cells, but not in Cos-7 cells (56Ishii I. Akahoshi N. Yu X.N. Kobayashi Y. Namekata K. Komaki G. Kimura H. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Exposure of HEK-293 cells transfected with a vector containing the mouse CSE core promoter to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibited Sp1 binding to the promoter and abrogated CSE expression (28Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. (2003) Genome. Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Species- and cell type-specific promoter activities have been indicated, and the most comprehensive comparisons for the promoter regions between human and mouse have been made (57Xuan Z. Wang J. Zhang M.Q. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Ounallah-Saad H. Beeri R. Goshen I. Yirmiya R. Renbaum P. Levy-Lahad E. Gene. 2009; 446: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For the genes involved in “stress response,” the promoter sequences were less conserved between human and mouse. Many genes, including APP and TAU genes, were differentially regulated in human and mouse (59Gao L. Tucker K.L. Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2005; 1681: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 60Ge Y.W. Ghosh C. Song W. Maloney B. Lahiri D.K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1432-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The differences in their regulations could indicate pathways relevant to their specific roles in human-specific cognitive processes. Substantial differences exist between the human and mouse CSE promoters, and there is only 10% sequence homology between these two promoters. Although Sp1 stimulated both mouse and human CSE gene core promoter activity, there were two Sp1 binding sites in human CSE gene core promoter but only one in the mouse CSE gene core promoter. It should also be emphasized the regulation of human CSE gene transcription is a complex process, and this present study only indicates the contributions of Sp1 to this process but does not exclude other regulatory factors.In summary, we have identified Sp1 as a critical activator of human CSE expression during SMC phenotypic switching. Serum withdrawal induced both Sp1 protein expression and Sp1 phosphorylation in association with increased CSE expression, and the CSE/H2S system is essential for the maintenance of SMC differentiation. Further investigation into the roles of CSE/H2S system during SMC differentiation, development and dysfunction will provide additional insight into the therapeutic value of H2S for vascular proliferative diseases by controlling SMC phenotype.

Here, through optical imaging, we identified an abnormal interface between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in 9 patients with ESCS. The neural retina leucine zipper transcription factor-knockout (Nrl–/–) mouse model demonstrates many phenotypic features of human ESCS, including unstable S-cone-positive photoreceptors. Using massively parallel RNA sequencing, we identified 6203 differentially expressed transcripts between wild-type (Wt) and Nrl–/– mouse retinas, with 6 highly significant differentially expressed genes of the Pax, Notch, and Wnt canonical pathways. Changes were also obvious in expression of 30 genes involved in the visual cycle and 3 key genes in photoreceptor phagocytosis. Novel high-resolution (100 nm) imaging and reconstruction of Nrl–/– retinas revealed an abnormal packing of photoreceptors that contributed to buildup of photoreceptor deposits. Furthermore, lack of phagosomes in the RPE layer of Nrl–/– retina revealed impairment in phagocytosis. Cultured RPE cells from Wt and Nrl–/– mice illustrated that the phagocytotic defect was attributable to the aberrant interface between ESCS photoreceptors and the RPE.

https://openalex.org/W2039340507,"How complex networks of activators and repressors lead to exquisitely specific cell-type determination during development is poorly understood. In the Drosophila eye, expression patterns of Rhodopsins define at least eight functionally distinct though related subtypes of photoreceptors. Here, we describe a role for the transcription factor gene defective proventriculus (dve) as a critical node in the network regulating Rhodopsin expression. dve is a shared component of two opposing, interlocked feedforward loops (FFLs). Orthodenticle and Dve interact in an incoherent FFL to repress Rhodopsin expression throughout the eye. In R7 and R8 photoreceptors, a coherent FFL relieves repression by Dve while activating Rhodopsin expression. Therefore, this network uses repression to restrict and combinatorial activation to induce cell-type-specific expression. Furthermore, Dve levels are finely tuned to yield cell-type- and region-specific repression or activation outcomes. This interlocked FFL motif may be a general mechanism to control terminal cell-fate specification."
https://openalex.org/W2118926077,"The allele ε4 of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is a key regulator of lipid metabolism, represents a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease. Despite its adverse effects, the allele is common and shows a nonrandom global distribution that is thought to be the result of evolutionary adaptation. One hypothesis proposes that the APOE ε4 allele protects against vitamin D deficiency. Here we present, for the first time, experimental and epidemiological evidence that the APOE ε4 allele is indeed associated with higher serum vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. In APOE4 targeted replacement mice, significantly higher 25(OH)D levels were found compared with those in APOE2 and APOE3 mice (70.9 vs. 41.8 and 27.8 nM, P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate adjusted models show a positive association of the APOE ε4 allele with 25(OH)D levels in a small collective of human subjects (n=93; P=0.072) and a general population sample (n=699; P=0.003). The novel link suggests ε4 as a modulator of vitamin D status. Although this result agrees well with evolutionary aspects, it appears contradictory with regard to chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease. Large prospective cohort studies are now needed to investigate the potential implications of this finding for chronic disease risks."
https://openalex.org/W2115763109,"Elucidating factors regulating Crohn's disease-associated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (Nod2) responses is critical to understanding the mechanisms of intestinal immune homeostasis. Stimulation of primary monocyte-derived macrophages by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component of bacterial peptidoglycan and specific Nod2 ligand, produces cytokines, including IL-1β. We found that IL-1β blockade profoundly inhibits MDP-induced cytokine production in human monocyte-derived macrophages, demonstrating a key role for IL-1β autocrine secretion in Nod2-mediated responses. Importantly, although MAPK activation has previously been attributed directly to Nod2 signaling, we determined that the IL-1β autocrine loop is responsible for the majority of MDP-induced MAPK activation. Because the critical effects of IL-1β autocrine secretion on MAPK activation are observed as early as 10 min after Nod2 stimulation, we hypothesized that secretion of IL-1β from preexisting intracellular pro-IL-1β stores is necessary for optimal MDP-mediated cytokine induction. Consistently, we detected IL-1β secretion within 10 min of MDP treatment. Moreover, caspase-1 inhibition significantly attenuates MDP-mediated early MAPK activation. Importantly, selective JNK/p38 activation is sufficient to rescue the decreased cytokine secretion during Nod2 stimulation in the absence of autocrine IL-1β. Finally, we found that the IL-1β autocrine loop significantly enhances responses by a broad range of pattern recognition receptors. Taken together, MDP stimulation activates Nod2 to process and release preexisting pro-IL-1β stores in a caspase-1-dependent fashion; this secreted IL-1β, in turn, contributes to the majority of MDP-initiated MAPK activation and leads to subsequent cytokine secretion. Our findings clarify mechanisms of IL-1β contributions to Nod2 responses and elucidate the dominant role of IL-1β in MDP-initiated MAPK and cytokine secretion.

Taken together, MDP stimulation activates Nod2 to process and release preexisting pro-IL-1β stores in a caspase-1-dependent fashion; this secreted IL-1β, in turn, contributes to the majority of MDP-initiated MAPK activation and leads to subsequent cytokine secretion. Our findings clarify mechanisms of IL-1β contributions to Nod2 responses and elucidate the dominant role of IL-1β in MDP-initiated MAPK and cytokine secretion.

We found that the IL-1β autocrine loop is a major contributor to MDP-mediated secretion of both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. Importantly, in the absence of the IL-1β autocrine loop, MDP stimulation of MDMs results in minimal activation of MAPK pathways. We found that Nod2 activation leads to rapid caspase-1-dependent secretion of IL-1β and subsequent early MAPK activation and secretion of additional cytokines. Consistent with this, activation of JNK and p38 was sufficient to partially restore cytokine secretion by Nod2 signaling in the absence of the IL-1β loop. These results establish a dominant role for the IL-1β autocrine loop in PRR responses and define mechanisms for how this autocrine loop modifies and amplifies Nod2 signaling. Informed consent was obtained per protocol approved by the Yale University institutional review board. We performed Nod2 genotyping by TaqMan SNP genotyping (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or Sequenom platform (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA). Unless otherwise indicated, we utilized cells from healthy individuals who were not Nod2Leu1007insC homozygote or compound heterozygote carriers. Human MDMs were generated as described previously (19Hedl M. Li J. Cho J.H. Abraham C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19440-19445Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For IL-1β blockade, IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and/or anti-IL-1β-blocking antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added 1 h prior to treatments with MDP (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA), IL-1β (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), lipid A (Peptides International, Louisville, KY), poly(I:C), CpG DNA (Calbiochem), TriDAP, flagellin, or CL097 (Invivogen). For inhibition studies, Ac-YVAD-cmk (Bachem), actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich), or dimethyl sulfoxide control was added 1 h prior to pretreatments. Anisomycin (Calbiochem) was used for JNK and p38 activation. Supernatants were assayed for IL-1β (Pierce), TNF-α, IL-8, or IL-6 (BD Biosciences), or for IL-1Ra and IL-10 (R&D Systems) by ELISA. Phosphorylation of MAPKs was determined by flow cytometry using Alexa Fluor 647-labeled phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK, or phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) along with isotype controls. Following stimulation, total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed, and quantitative PCR was performed as in Ref. 2Li J. Moran T. Swanson E. Julian C. Harris J. Bonen D.K. Hedl M. Nicolae D.L. Abraham C. Cho J.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar on the ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was run in duplicate and normalized to GAPDH. Primer sequences were as follows: IL-1β forward primer, ACAGATGAAGTGCTCCTTCCA; IL-1β reverse primer, GTCGGAGATTCGTAGCTGGAT; IL-8 forward primer, ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT; IL-8 reverse primer, ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT; TNF-α forward primer, CTACTCCCCAGGTCCTCTTCA; TNF-α reverse primer, CAAAGTAGACCTGCCCAGAC; GAPDH forward primer, CATGTTCCAATATGATTCCACC; GAPDH reverse primer, CCTGGAAGATGGTGATGG. Significance with treatment was assessed using a paired one-tailed Student t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. We first sought to define the magnitude of the IL-1β autocrine loop contribution to Nod2-induced cytokines in primary human MDMs from healthy controls. We found that blockade of IL-1β signaling with IL-1Ra and anti-IL-1β upon MDP stimulation of Nod2 results in a dramatic loss of proinflammatory cytokine secretion in human MDMs from healthy individuals (Fig. 1), such that cytokine secretion is ∼10% of the levels observed in the presence of the IL-1β autocrine loop. Antiinflammatory cytokines can be regulated differently than proinflammatory cytokines (26Donnelly R.P. Freeman S.L. Hayes M.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1420-1427PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fiorentino D.F. Zlotnik A. Mosmann T.R. Howard M. O'Garra A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3815-3822PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated secretion of IL-10 and found that the IL-1β autocrine loop also significantly contributes to induction of IL-10 upon MDP treatment of MDM (Fig. 1). In contrast to cells from Nod2 WT healthy controls and Nod2 WT CD patients, MDP stimulation of MDMs from CD-associated homozygote or compound heterozygote Nod2Leu1007insC carriers does not induce cytokines, including IL-1β (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the Nod2-initiated IL-1β autocrine loop does not operate in these individuals. Responses to TLR4 stimulation (lipid A) are intact in these cells (supplemental Fig. 1), demonstrating a specific defect to Nod2 stimulation. To determine whether the IL-1β autocrine loop contributes uniquely to Nod2 signaling in MDM or also participates in Nod2-induced cytokine secretion in other cell types, we examined human epithelial cell lines. We found that the concentration of cytokines secreted from these cells is less than from primary human macrophages. Nevertheless, human epithelial hepatoma HepG2 cells show a significant decrease in IL-8 production upon IL-1R blockade, although not to the same degree as in primary MDMs. This effect is not seen in intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Our results highlight the profound contribution of the IL-1β autocrine loop to overall MDP-induced pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine secretion in human MDMs. To address the mechanism through which the IL-1β autocrine loop contributes to MDP-mediated cytokine secretion, we first asked whether the loop functions upstream of protein induction by enhancing mRNA cytokine expression. We found that IL-1R blockade significantly reduces TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β mRNA levels following MDM stimulation with MDP (Fig. 2), indicating that the IL-1β autocrine loop contributes to Nod2-mediated cytokine induction at the mRNA level. MDP treatment of human and mouse myeloid-derived cells activates the MAPK pathway (4Park J.H. Kim Y.G. McDonald C. Kanneganti T.D. Hasegawa M. Body-Malapel M. Inohara N. Núñez G. J.

Immunol. 2006; 177: 7497-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Given the dramatic role for the IL-1β autocrine loop in MDP-induced cytokine secretion, we questioned whether the MAPK activation observed upon MDP treatment is directly initiated by Nod2 or is caused by the IL-1β autocrine loop. We assessed the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 in the context of Nod2, IL-1R, or IL-1R-independent Nod2 signaling (Nod2 signaling in the absence of the IL-1β autocrine loop). Based on prior reports (22Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nuñez G. Flavell R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar) and our time course experiments (see Fig. 4), we chose 10 min as the optimal time point of MAPK activation upon MDP stimulation. We found that JNK, ERK, and p38 are activated upon MDP and IL-1β stimulation of MDMs, whereas IL-1R signaling blockade upon MDP stimulation dramatically reduced the activation of these MAPKs (Fig. 3). The attenuated MAPK activation upon blocking the IL-1β autocrine loop persists over a prolonged period of time, such that the decrease is not merely one of kinetics (Fig. 4). Taken together, MDP-induced MAPK activation in MDMs is due to MAPK activation mediated by the IL-1β autocrine loop, rather than directly by Nod2.FIGURE 3The IL-1β autocrine loop contributes to the majority of MAPK activation upon MDP treatment of MDMs. Human MDMs from healthy controls (n = 19–23) were stimulated with 100 μg/ml MDP, 10 ng/ml IL-1β, or 100 μg/ml MDP with 0.5 μg/ml IL-1Ra and 1 μg/ml anti-IL-1β antibody for 10 min and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK, or phospho-p38.

On the other hand, processing and secretion of preformed pro-IL-1β can occur by 5 min in mouse macrophages (32Qu Y. Franchi L. Nunez G. Dubyak G.R. J.

J. 2004; 381: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), our results indicate that Nod2 stimulation may be activating caspase-1, leading to the rapid processing of preformed pro-IL-1β, which in turn mediates early MAPK activation. To address this, we inhibited caspase-1 and observed significantly attenuated MAPK activation within the first 10 min following MDP treatment (Fig. 5, A and B), similar to what we observed on blocking the interaction of IL-1β with its receptor (Fig. 3). To verify further that the early IL-1β-dependent activation of MAPKs upon MDP stimulation was due to preexisting IL-1β stores, we stimulated macrophages with MDP while inhibiting transcription. Under these conditions, we still observed intact activation of JNK, ERK, and p38 10 min after MDP stimulation of MDMs (Fig. 5, C and D). Therefore, MDP-induced processing and secretion of existing stores of pro-IL-1β by caspase-1 are critical for early contributions of the IL-1β autocrine loop to MAPK activation upon Nod2 stimulation. In light of the critical role for IL-1β in MDP-induced MAPK activation and downstream cytokine secretion, we sought to verify that IL-1β was secreted prior to other cytokines. Surprisingly, after MDP treatment, IL-1β was not detected at earlier time points in supernatants relative to TNF-α, IL-8, or IL-6 (Fig. 6A). Because IL-1β protein levels in supernatants reflect a combination of secretion and consumption of IL-1β, it is possible that IL-1β is secreted earlier through release of existing stores of pro-IL-1β but that we are unable to detect it due to its rapid consumption. To prevent this consumption, we measured IL-1β secretion 10 min after MDP stimulation in the presence of IL-1R blockade and detected IL-1β secretion prior to other cytokines (Fig. 6B). Given our findings, one would expect that MDP stimulation would require more time to activate MAPKs than would direct IL-1β stimulation because MDP needs to activate Nod2, then caspase-1 and then process and secrete IL-1β. We found that this is, in fact, the case, because IL-1β stimulation leads to increased MAPK activation relative to that of MDP stimulation at an earlier 5-min time point (Fig. 7). This is consistent with the time delay required for IL-1β release upon MDP treatment of MDMs. Taken together, MDP treatment leads to rapid caspase-dependent processing of preformed pro-IL-1β which results in IL-1β secretion prior to other cytokines, IL-1β autocrine signaling, and induction of cytokine expression.FIGURE 7IL-1β stimulation of MDMs demonstrates earlier MAPK activation compared with MDP stimulation. Human MDMs from healthy controls (n = 6–8) were stimulated with 100 μg/ml MDP or 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 5 and 10 min and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK, or phospho-p38.

Therefore, we asked whether selective activation of MAPKs during Nod2 stimulation in the absence of the IL-1β loop is sufficient to restore cytokine induction. For these studies we utilized anisomycin, which selectively activates JNK and p38 (36Rutault K. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6666-6674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that the low level of JNK and p38 phosphorylation upon MDP signaling in the absence of the IL-1β loop was partially restored with anisomycin treatment (Fig. 8A). Importantly, we found that anisomycin treatment of MDP-stimulated MDMs during blockade of the IL-1β loop significantly rescues the decreased cytokine secretion (Fig. 8B). IL-1R-independent Nod2 signaling (MDP signaling in the absence of the IL-1β autocrine loop) led to cytokine secretion at 11% of the concentrations observed relative to that of MDP-stimulated cells; the addition of anisomycin to IL-1R-independent Nod2 signaling increased cytokines to 47% of that of MDP-stimulated cells (Fig. 8B). We verified these results with UV light, which, like anisomycin, activates JNK and p38 (37Klotz L.O. Pellieux C. Briviba K. Pierlot C. Aubry J.M. Sies H. Eur J.

Accordingly, we observed similar rescue of decreased cytokine secretion with MDP stimulation in the absence of the IL-1β autocrine loop upon UV light activation of MDMs (supplemental Fig. 3). Taken together, selective activation of p38 and JNK upon Nod2 signaling in the absence of the IL-1β autocrine loop is sufficient to increase cytokine secretion significantly. As MDMs encounter bacteria, Nod2 is stimulated in the context of multiple PRRs. IL-1R autocrine signaling has not been investigated downstream of other PRRs, with the exception of TLR4 (5Cassatella M.A. Meda L. Bonora S. Ceska M. Constantin G. J. Exp.

We found that IL-1R signaling blockade dramatically decreases TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1β secretion upon stimulation of Nod1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, or TLR9 in MDMs from healthy controls (Fig. 9). Taken together, we established that IL-1R autocrine signaling is critical for cytokine responses through a broad range of PRR, indicating its major importance to innate immunity. In this study, we found that the IL-1β autocrine loop accounts for a dominant component of MDP-initiated pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine secretion. Although a role for IL-1β autocrine signaling in Nod2 cytokine induction has been reported in some (10Hruz P. Zinkernagel A.S. Jenikova G. Botwin G.J. Hugot J.P. Karin M. Nizet V. Eckmann L. Proc.

We found that, in fact, Nod2 stimulation leads to minimal MAPK activation in MDMs and that IL-1β autocrine secretion accounts for most of the MAPK activation observed upon MDP treatment. Thus, Nod2 and IL-1β have distinct roles following MDP stimulation in MDMs: Nod2 initiates caspase-1-dependent processing of preexisting pro-IL-1β stores, and this early secreted IL-1β feeds back in an autocrine fashion to activate MAPK pathways and induce cytokine secretion (Fig. 10). Selective activation of JNK and p38 under conditions of Nod2 signaling in the absence of the IL-1β autocrine loop is sufficient to increase pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine secretion significantly, thereby indicating that a major mechanism of the IL-1β autocrine loop contribution to Nod2-induced cytokines is by enhancing the strength of MAPK signaling. We determined that IL-1R autocrine signaling is critical in not only Nod2, but also Nod1 and TLR2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 7-, and 9-mediated cytokine secretion, indicating a broad role for IL-1R autocrine signaling in optimal responses upon various microbial infections. To understand the mechanisms through which PRRs mediate responses, it is important to dissect which pathways are initiated directly by PRRs and which might be through indirect contributions, such as autocrine loops. Many autocrine loops have been associated with a second, delayed phase of signaling and activation, which is usually less potent than the initial activation peak. For example, TNF-α stimulation of human epithelial cells initiates an autocrine IL-1α loop leading to a 4–24-h delay of NF-κB activation (39Janes K.A. Gaudet S. Albeck J.G. Nielsen U.B. Lauffenburger D.A. Sorger P.K. Cell. 2006; 124: 1225-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the MDP-induced IL-1β autocrine loop observed in our study acts within a very short time period and is the dominant contributor to MDP-mediated MAPK activation. This rapid IL-1β processing is due to Nod2-mediated caspase-1 activation; direct association of Nod2 and caspase-1 has been reported in human THP-1 cells (33Hsu L.C. Ali S.R. McGillivray S. Tseng P.H. Mariathasan S. Humke E.W. Eckmann L. Powell J.J. Nizet V. Dixit V.M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7803-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition to caspase-1 (13Ferwerda G. Kramer M. de Jong D. Piccini A. Joosten L.A. Devesaginer I. Girardin S.E. Adema G.J. van der Meer J.W. Kullberg B.J. Rubartelli A. Netea M.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Nod2 also requires NALP3 and Rip2 to induce IL-1β properly (40Pan Q. Mathison J. Fearns C. Kravchenko V.V. Da Silva Correia J. Hoffman H.M. Kobayashi K.S. Bertin J. Grant E.P. Coyle A.J. Sutterwala F.S. Ogura Y. Flavell R.A. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 82: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The rapid induction of autocrine loops, such as that of IL-1β, can provide for significant early signaling following stimulation of a particular receptor, thereby masking direct effects of the receptor. Given this, the differences in autocrine loops produced in distinct cell types might account for some of the differences in signaling outcomes following receptor stimulation between cell populations. For example, the contribution of the IL-1 autocrine loop to MDP-mediated cytokine induction was modest in epithelial HepG2 cells and absent in epithelial CaCo-2 cells (supplemental Fig. 2); therefore this loop plays a particularly important role in modulating Nod2 signaling in primary MDMs. The dramatic contribution of the IL-1 autocrine loop to PRRs and particularly Nod2 responses (10Hruz P.

Interestingly, impaired IL-1R signaling can lead to increased disease severity in CD patients (17Carter J.D. Valeriano J. Vasey F.B. J. Clin.

This contrasts with the simple interpretation that IL-1R signaling is associated with inflammatory disease. Similarly, deficiencies in MyD88 (41Rakoff-Nahoum S. Paglino J. Eslami-Varzaneh F.

The dramatic decrease in cytokine induction by the CD-associated protein Nod2 (Fig. 1) and by other PRRs (Fig. 9) in the absence of IL-1R autocrine signaling indicates that dysregulation in IL-1R signaling could have deleterious effects for proper regulation of PRR signaling in the context of the intestinal environment. Because blockade of IL-1β and IL-1R is being used as a therapeutic intervention for an increasing number of inflammatory disorders (43Gabay C. Lamacchia C. Palmer G. Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2010; 6: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), one needs to consider the implications and potential adverse consequences of this blockade on a wide array of PRR responses. Our results identify mechanisms through which IL-1R autocrine signaling contributes to cytokine responses by Nod2 in primary human MDMs and provide insight into how these interactions ultimately contribute to intestinal immune homeostasis.

Animal toxins that alter electrophysiological excitability of muscles and neurons often modify sodium channel activation by selectively interacting with domain II and inactivation by selectively interacting with domain IV. This suggests that there may be substantial differences between the toxin-binding sites in these two important domains. Here we explore the ability of the tarantula huwentoxin-IV (HWTX-IV) to inhibit the activity of the domain II and IV voltage sensors. HWTX-IV is specific for domain II, and we identify five residues in the S1–S2 (Glu-753) and S3–S4 (Glu-811, Leu-814, Asp-816, and Glu-818) regions of domain II that are crucial for inhibition of activation by HWTX-IV. These data indicate that a single residue in the S3–S4 linker (Glu-818 in hNav1.7) is crucial for allowing HWTX-IV to interact with the other key residues and trap the voltage sensor in the closed configuration. Mutagenesis analysis indicates that the five corresponding residues in domain IV are all critical for endowing HWTX-IV with the ability to inhibit fast inactivation. Our data suggest that the toxin-binding motif in domain II is conserved in domain IV.

Nine VGSC α subunit subtypes (Nav1.1–1.9) have been cloned and characterized from mammals (1Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Waxman S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). These subtypes are expressed in different excitable tissues and are involved in distinct physiological functions such as neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, secretion, and pain sensation (2Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar, 3Drenth J.P. Waxman S.G. J. Clin.

Pain. 2007; 131: 243-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The nine α subunits share a common four-domain (DI–DIV) structure, in which each domain has six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) (1Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Waxman S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Based on distinct functional behaviors during channel activity, the six transmembrane segments are generally separated into two structural components (5Goldin A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The central pore module is the basis for the ion conduction pathway and is formed by the S5–S6 region of the channel. The voltage sensor modules are formed by the S1–S4 regions and are essentially independent structures that directly respond to changes in the transmembrane potential with conformational alterations that are coupled to opening and closing of the pore module. VGSCs undergo voltage-dependent activation subsequently followed by fast inactivation through successive activities of the voltage sensors in the four domains. The S4 segments in the voltage sensors of DI, DII, and DIII are determinants of channel activation, whereas that of DIV is predominantly involved in channel inactivation (5Goldin A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Cha A. Ruben P.C. George Jr., A.L. Fujimoto E. Bezanilla F.

The four membrane-spanning segments (S1–S4) of the voltage sensors of mammal VGSCs exhibit high sequence similarity in the four domains, but the amino acids and sequence length of the intracellular and extracellular linkers are quite divergent. Because crystal structures of sodium channels are lacking, it remains unknown whether the voltage sensor differences result in altered conformations of the membrane-spanning segments or whether the orientations of amino acid side chains are structurally conserved at corresponding positions in the four different voltage sensors. voltage-gated sodium channel DII, DIII, and DIV, domains I, II, III and IV huwentoxin-IV voltage gated potassium channel voltage sensing domain transmembrane segment n. Because of their high binding affinity and subtype-specific selectivity, animal toxins are powerful tools for investigation of the structure-function relationship of VGSCs (9Blumenthal K.M. Seibert A.L. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 38: 215-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The voltage sensors of DII and DIV are the two most common toxin-binding sites in VGSCs (see Fig. 1A). Scorpion β-toxins bind to the DII voltage sensor to enhance voltage-dependent activation by trapping DIIS4 in the activated state (10Cestèle S. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Qu Y. Sampieri F. Scheuer T.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Scorpion α-toxins bind to the DIV voltage sensor and inhibit fast inactivation by trapping DIVS4 in the closed state (13Rogers J.C. Qu Y. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

These findings seem to suggest that there are substantial differences between the toxin-binding sites on the voltage sensors of DII and DIV. However, we recently demonstrated that ProTx-II, another tarantula toxin, can both inhibit hNav1.7 activation by interacting with DII and impair hNav1.7 inactivation by interacting with DIV (15Xiao Y. Blumenthal K. Jackson 2nd, J.O. Liang S. Cummins T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that there might be conserved molecular determinants of toxin binding in the DII and DIV voltage sensors. Here we used electrophysiology and point mutagenesis to extensively explore the molecular determinants involved in huwentoxin-IV (HWTX-IV) interactions with hNav1.7. HWTX-IV is a voltage sensor modifier from the tarantula Ornithoctonus huwena that interacts with the DII voltage sensor. However, in contrast to scorpion β-toxins, HWTX-IV traps DIIS4 in the closed state and specifically inhibits channel activation (16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27300-27313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Peng K. Shu Q. Liu Z. Liang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47564-47571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that HWTX-IV partially shares the binding site on DII voltage sensor with scorpion β-toxin CssIV, although these two toxins trap DIIS4 in distinct states. We determined that interaction with Glu-818 is key for HWTX-IV to access other important residues in the DII voltage sensor. Interestingly, we find that each of the five residues that we identified in the voltage sensor of DII as being critical for the interaction with HWTX-IV also regulate the ability of the DIV voltage sensor to interact with HWTX-IV. All of the hNav1.7 mutations were constructed using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. The constructs were sequenced to confirm that the appropriate mutations were made. WT and mutant hNav1.7 channels were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (15Xiao Y. Blumenthal K. Jackson 2nd, J.O. Liang S. Cummins T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were carried out at room temperature (∼21 °C) using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Fire-polished electrodes were fabricated from 1.7-mm capillary glass (VWR, West Chester, PA) using a P-97 puller (Sutter, Novato, CA). The standard pipette solution contained 140 mm CsF, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The standard bathing solution was 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. After filling with pipette solution, the access resistance of electrode pipette ranged from 0.7 to 1.3 mΩ. The liquid junction potential for these solutions was <8 mV; data were not corrected to account for this offset. Voltage errors were minimized using 80% series resistance compensation, and the capacitance artifact was canceled using the computer-controlled circuitry of the patch clamp amplifier. Linear leak subtraction, based on resistance estimates from four to five hyperpolarizing pulses applied before the depolarizing test potential, was used for all voltage clamp recordings. Membrane currents were usually filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. The stock solutions for 50 μm CssIV and 1 mm HWTX-IV were made using bathing solution containing 1 mg/ml BSA, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Before use, the solution was diluted to the concentrations of interest with fresh bathing solution. Toxin was diluted into the recording chamber (volume of 300 μl) and mixed by repeatedly pipetting 30 μl to achieve the specified final concentration. The extent of the inhibitory effect of the toxin was typically assessed around 20 min after toxin treatment. Three-dimensional models of hNav1.7 DII-VSD (Phe-728 to Lys-846) were created based on the complete closed state and open state structures of the mammalian Kv1.2 (Ser-158 to Ile-316) provided by Pathak et al. (18Pathak M.M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Agarwal G. Roux B. Barth P. Kohout S. Tombola F. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 2007; 56: 124-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment was conducted using the ClusterW1.8 program, and the alignment of the four transmembrane segments (S1–S4) was then refined manually. Homology modeling was performed using Accelrys Discovery Studio 1.6 software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The models were further refined by energy “minimization” protocol using a CHARMm force field, in which both the minimization algorithm “steepest descent” and “conjugated gradient” were set to 500 steps. The data were analyzed using the Pulsefit (HEKA) and GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software) programs. All of the data points are shown as the means ± S.E. n is presented as the number of experimental cells. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 indicated a significant difference. Steady-state activation and inactivation curves were fitted using the Boltzmann equation: y = 1/(1 + exp((V½ − V)/k), in which V½, V, and k represent midpoint voltage of kinetics, test potential, and slope factor, respectively. Dose-response curves to determine IC50 values were fitted using the Hill equation: y = 1/(1 + exp((logIC50 − X)nH), where X is the toxin dose, nH is the Hill coefficient, and IC50 is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration. In this study, the nH was set to 1 because our mutagenesis data have shown that the toxin had a single high affinity binding site in sodium channels. For HWTX-IV action on fast inactivation of WT and mutant Nav1.7, the nH was also set to 1 because only sodium channel DIV is involved in channel inactivation gating. To explore hNav1.7-HWTX-IV interactions and identify the crucial residues in hNav1.7, we mutated each residue in the extracellular portions of the DII S1–S2 and S3–S4 regions. Mutations were principally designed using the following rules: 1) charged residues were mutated to be neutral, 2) unique residues in the spider VGSC (19Zuo X.P. He H.Q. He M. Liu Z.R. Xu Q. Ye J.G. Ji Y.H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4508-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which is presumably resistant to HWTX-IV, were introduced into hNav1.7, and 3) if an uncharged residue is conserved in hNav1.7 and the spider VGSC, it was substituted by a smaller side chain residue, either Ala or Cys (Fig. 1). We first characterized the electrophysiological properties of WT and mutant Nav1.7 channels, expressed in HEK293 cells, using the whole cell recording configuration and compared the voltage-dependent properties of steady-state activation and inactivation to WT Nav1.7. Consistent with previous reports that the voltage sensor in DII is an important determinant of channel activation (7Cestèle S. Scheuer T. Mantegazza M. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Mantegazza M. Cestèle S. J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), mutations of most amino acid residues significantly altered channel activation (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). In particular, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues in the DIIS4 segment are involved in favoring hNav1.7 in the closed state. Positively charged residues (typically Arg) embedded within the S4 segment are primary contributors to gating charge and voltage sensitivity of ion channels (21Kontis K.J. Rounaghi A. Goldin A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Struyk A.F. Scoggan K.A. Bulman D.E. Cannon S.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8610-8617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the mutations in the voltage sensor of DII, only E753Q substantially shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (by +17.3 mV; Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S1). In our previous work, we demonstrated that an acidic residue in the extracellular DIIS3–S4 region (Glu-818) is critical for interacting with HWTX-IV. The mutation of Glu-818 to Gln and Cys reduced toxin binding affinity for hNav1.7 by 63- and 400-fold, respectively (15Xiao Y. Blumenthal K. Jackson 2nd, J.O. Liang S. Cummins T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27300-27313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because the DII voltage sensor in VGSCs is a mobile structure, we hypothesized that interaction with only Glu-818 would not be sufficient for HWTX-IV to trap the DII voltage sensor in the closed state and that other residues must be involved in the toxin-channel interaction that underlies channel inhibition. In the current study, we found that mutation of four additional amino acid residues (Glu-753 in the DIIS1-S2 region and Glu-811, Leu-814, and Asp-816 in the DIIS3–S4 region) produced substantial decreases in HWTX-IV inhibition of hNav1.7 activation (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A shows typical current traces of WT and these four mutant Nav1.7 channels elicited by a 20-ms depolarization of −10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV. As reported previously, 1 μm HWTX-IV completely blocks WT Nav1.7 (16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27300-27313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of 1 μm HWTX-IV, the amount of current that still could be activated ranged from 6.2 ± 1.3 to 31.1 ± 2.1% of control for these four mutant channels (n = 4–8). The IC50 values for HWTX-IV blocking WT and all 39 mutant hNav1.7 channels tested are summarized in Fig. 3B. These data indicate that the E753Q, E811Q, L814C, and D816A mutations reduced toxin binding affinity by 5-, 18-, 9-, and 13-fold, respectively (Fig. 3B). Although three mutations (V817A, G819P, and S825A) slightly increased HWTX-IV sensitivity for hNav1.7, the IC50 values for these mutations were only ∼2-fold smaller than that for WT channels. Seven of the eight mutations that altered HWTX-IV inhibition (with V817A being the exception) significantly shifted the voltage dependence of activation of hNav1.7 to more positive potentials (Fig. 2B). However, it seems unlikely that changes in HWTX-IV binding affinity result from altering the voltage-dependent gating of the mutant channels, because there was no direct correlation between changes in the voltage dependence of activation and changes in sensitivity to HWTX-IV when all of the mutations are considered. We also examined whether exposure to HWTX-IV had obvious effects on the voltage-dependent properties of the various mutant channels. For WT Nav1.7 and the majority of mutant channels, in the presence of 0.1 (or 1) μm HWTX-IV, there was no apparent change in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (supplemental Fig. S1 and Tables S2 and S3). This lack of an effect most likely reflects that in the presence of HWTX-IV, we are mainly measuring the activity of residual currents from channels that did not interact with HWTX-IV. This is consistent with our previous data showing that in the presence of saturating concentrations of HWTX-IV, no Nav1.7 current can be detected unless the channels are depolarized beyond +100 mV, reflecting a depolarizing shift of ∼200 mV in the voltage dependence of activation of hNav1.7 by HWTX-IV (16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27300-27313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, for three mutations (R827Q/C and L828A) in DIIS4, 0.1 μm HWTX-IV not only shifted the voltage dependence of channel activation (by +7.2, +8.7, and +6.2 mV, respectively), but it also doubled the slope factors for the voltage dependence of channel activation (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S2). HWTX-IV did not affect inactivation properties of either WT or these mutant channels (supplemental Table S3). None of these mutations (R827Q/C or L828A) altered the IC50 for HWTX-IV (Fig. 3B), indicating that neither Arg-827 nor Leu-828 is directly involved in the toxin-channel interaction. Therefore, these three mutations most likely enhance the ability of hNav1.7 channels to activate with HWTX-IV bound by altering the stability of the closed configuration of the DII voltage sensor. Our previous studies have shown that WT rNav1.4 (the skeletal muscle VGSC) is resistant to HWTX-IV and that mutation of Gln-657 in rNav1.4 (which corresponds to Glu-818 in hNav1.7; see Fig. 1) to glutamate greatly increases toxin sensitivity of rNav1.4 (16Xiao Y.

Because three of the other crucial residues that we identified in this study are highly conserved in rNav1.4 and hNav1.7 (Fig. 1), we next asked whether HWTX-IV still binds to WT rNav1.4, even though inhibition of current amplitude is not observed. To test this hypothesis, we designed a simple competitive binding experiment with CssIV (11Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), a typical scorpion β-toxin. CssIV partially shares the binding site on the DII voltage sensor of VGSCs with HWTX-IV because mutations of three residues in rNav1.2a (Glu-779, Glu-837, and Leu-840, corresponding to Glu-753, Glu-811, and Leu-814 in hNav1.7, respectively; Fig. 1) have previously been shown to additively reduce CssIV binding affinity for rNav1.2a by 175-fold (10Cestèle S. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Qu Y. Sampieri F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21332-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to HWTX-IV, CssIV traps the DII voltage sensor in the activated state, thereby shifting the voltage dependence of VGSC activation to more negative potentials. Therefore, we reasoned that if HWTX-IV was able to “silently” bind to WT Nav1.4, HWTX-IV pretreatment would be expected to substantially interfere with CssIV binding to rNav1.4. To test this, a triple-pulse protocol (described in the legend of Fig. 5) was used to assess the fraction of rNav1.4 channels modified by CssIV. In the absence of CssIV and HWTX-IV, the rNav1.4 channels were closed at potentials less than −60 mV, and no current was recorded by the 20-ms depolarizing pulse to −65 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV (Fig. 5A; n = 6). In the presence of 0.5 μm CssIV, inward rNav1.4 current, resulting from the negative shift of channel activation, was evidently induced at the subthreshold potential (−65 mV), and the ratio of the current elicited at −65 mV (I−65 mV) to that elicited at −10 mV (I−10 mV) was 0.035 ± 0.003 (n = 3). This ratio was not altered by additional application of 1 μm HWTX-IV (Fig. 5A, upper panels), the concentration that blocks 77.8 ± 2.0% of the Q657E mutant rNav1.4 channels in our previous work (16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27300-27313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5A (lower panels), 1 μm HWTX-IV by itself did not induce rNav1.4 current at −65 mV, consistent with our previous observation on hNav1.7 (16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27300-27313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additional application of 0.5 μm CssIV in the presence of HWTX-IV still induced inward current at −65 mV, and the ratio of I−65 mV to I−10 mV(control) was 0.035 ± 0.004 (n = 3), which is identical to the value caused by CssIV without HWTX-IV (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate that HWTX-IV did not affect CssIV binding to WT rNav1.4, indicating that HWTX-IV does not bind silently to rNav1.4 in DII. Together with our previous results on specific point mutations in rNav1.4 (Q657E) and in hNav1.7 (E818Q/C) (15Xiao Y. Blumenthal K. Jackson 2nd, J.O. Liang S. Cummins T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27300-27313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), these results suggest that interaction with the acidic residue Glu at position 818 in the DIIS3–S4 linker of hNav1.7 is not only the key determinant of voltage sensor trapping and channel inhibition but is also the key factor for allowing HWTX-IV to access and interact with the other crucial residues. Scorpion toxins that target VGSCs are typically classified as either α-toxins that specifically inhibit inactivation by selectively binding to the extracellular portion of the DIVS3-S4 region or β-toxins that specifically enhance activation by selectively binding to the extracellular portion of the DIIS3–S4 region (10Cestèle S.

This indicates that the extracellular portion of the S3–S4 region of the DII and DIV voltage sensors, also referred to as the voltage sensor paddles, may be structurally distinct. However, the tarantula toxin ProTx-II can reportedly interact with multiple voltage sensor paddles (23Bosmans F. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Swartz K.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and we have recently demonstrated that ProTx-II can inhibit both activation and inactivation of Nav1.7 (15Xiao Y. Blumenthal K. Jackson 2nd, J.O. Liang S. Cummins T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggests that either ProTx-II is relatively promiscuous in its interactions with the voltage sensors of sodium channels or that the DII and DIV voltage sensors are more similar than might be predicted based on the specificity of scorpion toxins. Nav1.7 DIV is resistant to HWTX-IV because the toxin does not inhibit fast inactivation of either WT or E818C mutant channels (15Xiao Y. Blumenthal K. Jackson 2nd, J.O. Liang S. Cummins T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Xiao Y. Bingham J.P. Zhu W. Moczydlowski E. Liang S. Cummins T.R. J. Biol.

Toxicon. 2008; 51: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). However, sequence alignment indicates that three of the five critical residues in Nav1.7 DII are conserved in DIV (Fig. 6A). Although the other two critical residues, Glu-811 and Glu-818, are correspondingly replaced by Gly-1581 and Ile-1588, respectively (Fig. 6A), the four membrane-spanning segments (S1–S4) in DII show relatively high sequence similarity (∼66%) with those in DIV. Therefore, we next asked whether the molecular determinants of toxin binding on the Nav1.7 DII voltage sensor might be conserved in the DIV voltage sensor. To address this question, we constructed six Nav1.7 DIV constructs, containing systemic substitutions of the five residues in DIV that correspond to the five crucial residues in DII (Fig. 6). These channel constructs were generated in the Nav1.7-E818C channel variant because this construct is substantially resistant to inhibition of activation by HWTX-IV, allowing investigation of the effect of HWTX-IV on the DIV mutants. Of the five corresponding residues in DIV (Glu-1524, Gly-1581, Leu-1584, Asp-1586, and Ile-1588), only the second and last amino acids differ from those in DII (Fig. 6A). To simplify the description of the various mutant channels, we will refer to each construct by the five-letter code for the five key residues. In addition, we will capitalize the amino acid residue if it is identical to that found in DII. Thus, the native DIV construct is EgLDi, and the construct where all five match those in DII is EELDE. The electrophysiological properties of these mutant channels, expressed in HEK293 cells, were determined (Fig. 6B and supplemental Table S4). Compared with E818C, additional single mutations shifted the voltage dependence of activation by less than +7 mV, but the voltage dependence of inactivation was more substantially affected (ranging from −13.9 to +12.2 mV). This result is consistent with the general principle that the DIV voltage sensor is predominantly involved in channel inactivation (5Goldin A.L. Curr. Opin.

https://openalex.org/W2057575035,"Existing theories explain why operons are advantageous in prokaryotes, but their occurrence in metazoans is an enigma. Nematode operon genes, typically consisting of growth genes, are significantly upregulated during recovery from growth-arrested states. This expression pattern is anticorrelated to nonoperon genes, consistent with a competition for transcriptional resources. We find that transcriptional resources are initially limiting during recovery and that recovering animals are highly sensitive to any additional decrease in transcriptional resources. We provide evidence that operons become advantageous because, by clustering growth genes into operons, fewer promoters compete for the limited transcriptional machinery, effectively increasing the concentration of transcriptional resources and accelerating recovery. Mathematical modeling reveals how a moderate increase in transcriptional resources can substantially enhance transcription rate and recovery. This design principle occurs in different nematodes and the chordate C. intestinalis. As transition from arrest to rapid growth is shared by many metazoans, operons could have evolved to facilitate these processes."

https://openalex.org/W2083930354,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases in which insoluble fibrillar aggregates of a microtubule-binding protein, Tau, are abnormally accumulated. Pathological Tau fibrils often exhibit structural polymorphisms that differ among phenotypically distinct tauopathies; however, a molecular mechanism to generate polymorphic Tau fibrils remains obscure. Here, we note the formation of a disulfide bond in isoforms of full-length Tau and show that the thiol-disulfide status as well as the isoform composition determines structural and morphological properties of Tau fibrils in vitro. Mainly two regions in a Tau primary sequence are found to act as structural blocks for building a protease-resistant core of Tau fibrils. Interactions among those two blocks for building a core structure depend upon the thiol-disulfide status in each isoform of Tau, which results in the formation of polymorphic fibrils with distinct structural properties. Furthermore, we have found that more diverse structures of Tau fibrils emerge through a cross-seeded fibrillation between heterologous pairs of Tau isoforms. We thus propose that isoform- and disulfide-dependent combinatorial interactions among multiple regions in a Tau sequence endow Tau fibrils with various structures, i.e. polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2139440218,"The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) links the control of mRNA translation, cell growth, and metabolism to diverse stimuli. Inappropriate activation of mTORC1 can lead to cancer. Phorbol esters are naturally occurring products that act as potent tumor promoters. They activate isoforms of protein kinase C (PKCs) and stimulate the oncogenic MEK/ERK signaling cascade. They also activate mTORC1 signaling. Previous work indicated that mTORC1 activation by the phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) depends upon PKCs and may involve MEK. However, the precise mechanism(s) through which they activate mTORC1 remains unclear. Recent studies have implicated both the ERKs and the ERK-activated 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (p90(RSK)) in activating mTORC1 signaling via phosphorylation of TSC2 (a regulator of mTORC1) and/or the mTORC1 component raptor. However, the relative importance of each of these kinases and phosphorylation events for the activation of mTORC1 signaling is unknown. The recent availability of MEK (PD184352) and p90(RSK) (BI-D1870) inhibitors of improved specificity allowed us to address the roles of these protein kinases in controlling mTORC1 in a variety of human and rodent cell types. In parallel, we used specific shRNAs against p90(RSK1) and p90(RSK2) to further test their roles in regulating mTORC1 signaling. Our data indicate that p90(RSKs) are dispensable for the activation of mTORC1 signaling by phorbol esters in all cell types tested. Our data also reveal striking diversity in the requirements for MEK/ERK in the control of mTORC1 between different cell types, pointing to additional signaling connections between phorbol esters and mTORC1, which do not involve MEK/ERK. This study provides important information for the design of efficient strategies to combat the hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling by oncogenic pathways."

Although the Est3 protein is long recognized as an essential telomerase component, how it associates with and functions in the telomerase complex has remained enigmatic. Here we provide the first evidence of a direct interaction between Saccharomyces cerevisiae Est3p and the catalytic protein subunit (Est2p) by demonstrating that recombinant Est3p binds the purified telomerase essential N-terminal (TEN) domain of Est2p in vitro. Mutations in a small cluster of amino acids predicted to lie on the surface of Est3p disrupt this interaction with Est2p, reduce assembly of Est3p with telomerase in vivo, and cause telomere shortening and senescence. We also show that recombinant Est3p stimulates telomerase activity above basal levels in vitro in a manner dependent on the Est2p TEN domain interaction. Together, these results define a direct binding interaction between Est3p and Est2p and reconcile the effect of S. cerevisiae Est3p with previous experiments showing that Est3p homologs in related yeast species influence telomerase activity. Additionally, it contributes functional support to the idea that Est3p is structurally related to the mammalian shelterin protein, TPP1, which also influences telomerase activity through interaction with the Est2p homolog, TERT."

The current study was designed to examine in detail CTT sequence conservation relative to gp120 and the gp41 ectodomain and to examine the conservation of predicted physicochemical and structural properties across a number of divergent HIV clades and groups. Results demonstrate that CTT sequences display intermediate levels of sequence evolution and diversity in comparison to the more diverse gp120 and the more conserved gp41 ectodomain. Despite the relatively high level of CTT sequence variation, the physicochemical properties of the lentivirus lytic peptide domains (LLPs) within the CTT are evidently highly conserved across clades/groups. Additionally, predictions using PEP-FOLD indicate a high level of structural similarity in the LLP regions that was confirmed by circular dichroism measurements of secondary structure of LLP peptides from clades B, C, and group O. Results demonstrate that LLP peptides adopt helical structure in the presence of SDS or trifluoroethanol but are predominantly unstructured in aqueous buffer. Thus, these data for the first time demonstrate strong conservations of characteristic CTT physicochemical and structural properties despite substantial sequence diversity, apparently indicating a delicate balance between evolutionary pressures and the conservation of CTT structure and associated functional roles in virus replication."

Here using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy we study PER stability in the presence of DBT and its short, long, arrhythmic, and inactive mutants in S2 cells. We observe robust PER degradation in a DBT allele-specific manner. With the exception of doubletime-short (DBT(S)), all mutants produce differential PER degradation profiles that show direct correspondence with their respective Drosophila behavioral phenotypes. The kinetics of PER degradation with DBT(S) in cell culture resembles that with wild-type DBT and posits that, in flies DBT(S) likely does not modulate the clock by simply affecting PER degradation kinetics. For all the other tested DBT alleles, the study provides a simple model in which the changes in Drosophila behavioral rhythms can be explained solely by changes in the rate of PER degradation."

How has the development of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) modified the trajectory of stem cell research? Here, coauthorship networks of stem cell research articles and analysis of cell lines used in stem cell research indicate that hiPSCs are not replacing human embryonic stem cells, but instead, the two cell types are complementary, interdependent research tools. Thus, we conclude that a ban on funding for embryonic stem cell research could have unexpected negative ramifications on the nascent field of hiPSCs. Just 5 years ago, the term pluripotence referred to a characteristic feature of only one type of human cell: human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). But when human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) burst upon the scene in 2007, this all changed. hiPSCs are derived by reprogramming somatic cells into an embryo-like state through the expression of specific transcription factors. Like hESCs, hiPSCs are capable of differentiating into any tissue type in the body (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. et al.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (7589) Google Scholar). Thus, hiPSCs have been hailed as groundbreaking because they offer a much clearer path to disease-based modeling and individualized therapies compared to older, more genetically homogeneous hESC lines (Mosher et al., 2010Mosher J.T. Pemberton T.J. Harter K. Wang C.L. Buzbas E.O. Dvorak P. Simon C. Morrison S.J. Rosenberg N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given that generating hiPSCs involves a relatively straightforward reprogramming technique, will hiPSCs “democratize” the stem cell field by bringing pluripotent cells within the reach of many labs that have shied away from the use of more controversial and restricted hESCs? In general, United States policy prohibits research on human embryos and restricts federal funding to hESC lines previously approved and listed on a national registry. This changed dramatically in August 2010 when a federal circuit judge issued an injunction blocking funding for new hESC research. By contrast, hiPSCs are made with somatic cells, not embryos, and therefore are not as controversial as hESCs and not subject to federal restrictions. But what is still not clear is how the emergence of these new pluripotent technologies, combined with these policies, impacts the adoption of new lines, the dissemination of existing lines, and the extent to which hiPSCs are supplanting or augmenting established hESC research. Complicating matters, some investigators now suspect that hiPSCs and hESCs differ significantly, issuing calls for research that uses both types of cells, most especially comparative studies. New findings have underscored these distinctions, provoking debate about the possible use of hiPSCs for disease models and therapies (Pera, 2011Pera M. Nature. 2011; 471: 46-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Lister et al., 2011Lister R. Pelizzola M. Kida Y.S. Hawkins R.D. Nery J.R. Hon G. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. O'Malley R. Castanon R.

Are reprogramming technologies broadening access to pluripotent cell lines and expanding the reach of stem cell research? If so, we hypothesize that we would expect the following: (1) the uptake of hiPSCs in the published literature to be significantly faster than that observed for more restricted hESC lines; (2) the amount of research that uses hiPSCs without also relying on hESC lines to grow, indicating that the new technology obviates the need for scientists to choose embryonic cell lines; (3) scientists working with hiPSCs to report less apprehension about or difficulty with access to research materials and funding than investigators whose research depends wholly on more restricted hESCs; and (4) the use of hiPSCs to increase in labs with little or no experience using hESCs. This Commentary examines these four assertions by mapping the trajectories of hESC and hiPSC technologies. We analyze data collected from 2086 hESC and hiPSC publications and brief face-to-face surveys with 118 active researchers (30.9% of 381 poster presenters at the 2010 ISSCR meeting in San Francisco) to examine how hiPSCs have been used in the years immediately following their discovery. These data allow us to evaluate the impacts that hiPSCs might exert on the more mature field of hESC research. hiPSCs are a young technology, and the field may yet grow in unexpected directions as it matures. Nevertheless, our data offer important insights for contemporary legal and policy debates about the legality and scope of federal funding for hESC research. Our findings strongly suggest that judicial or legislative decisions that bear upon support for human embryonic stem cell research are likely to strongly impact the character and direction of human induced pluripotent stem cell research. In particular, removing or curtailing federal funding for the former will also have disastrous consequences for the latter because research using the two different types of cell lines is deeply, perhaps inextricably, intertwined. If hiPSCs are increasing access to pluripotent cell types, we expect to see relatively quick uptake of the new method. Indeed, tracking the number of publications yearly since 1998 that use human pluripotent stem cells (Figures 1A and 1B) suggests that this is the case. Since the publication of the first two papers on hiPSCs in 2007 through 2010, we see a rapid rise of both hESC and hiPSC publications. Several factors may contribute to the fast emergence of publications on iPSCs, including their ease of use and access, their therapeutic potential, the entrance of new labs and investigators into the field, and the application of previously optimized hESC culture conditions. This increase could also be due to the reaction of established hESC scientists to 8 years of funding restrictions under the Bush administration and the funding uncertainties for hESC lines. On the other hand, the Obama administration has made some new lines eligible for funding since 2009, and thus the rise in hESC use may result from the adoption of these new lines, anticipation of increased federal funding under the new administration, or access to increased sources of state support for hESC research across this time period (Karmali et al., 2010Karmali R.N. Jones N.M. Levine A.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1246-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the uptake of induced pluripotent cell methods is dramatically faster than the rate observed for hESC lines in the 3 years immediately following their discovery in 1999 (Figure 1B). Although labs working with hESCs in the 1990s were claying the scientific groundwork and publishing their results in a growing number of journals, we believe these differences may be due in part to the profound difference in the policy environments surrounding these technologies. Embryonic stem cell researchers in the late 1990s and early 2000s faced not only a restrictive political and regulatory environment but also public controversy surrounding the use of frozen embryos to derive new lines and a complicated and expensive process for accessing existing cell lines protected by patent rights. The chilling effect of George W. Bush-era policies is also clear from Figure 1A, which suggests that it took hESC publications a full 6 years (until 2003) to surpass the number of hiPSC articles published just 2 years after their discovery. In broad strokes, it appears that hiPSC technologies are being adopted much more rapidly than hESCs were. But are hiPSCs complements or substitutes for hESCs? Using information from the body of papers and supplemental material, we characterized the types of pluripotent stem cell lines used in publications from 2008–2010 (Figure 2). We coded the papers as using hiPSCs alone, hESCs alone, or both cell types. We also coded the cell lines used in 381 research posters presented at the June 2010 International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) meeting held in San Francisco, CA. The proportion of papers using hiPSCs and hESCs together is growing faster than those using hiPSCs alone. In 2008, only 5.1% (15) of all papers analyzed used any induced pluripotent cell lines and only 20% (3) of those combined hESCs and hiPSCs in the same research manuscript. By 2010, 28.0% (161 of 574) of all pluripotent cell papers used hiPSC technologies, but 62.1% (100 of 161) of those paired induced and embryonic cell lines. Thus, although induced pluripotent stem cells are quickly becoming an important part of the field, they do not appear to be replacing work using embryonic cell lines. Instead the two types of cells are increasingly used together. Figure 2 suggests that hiPSCs may provide a limited avenue for new investigators to enter the field if established hESC researchers come to dominate in publications using the new technique. On the other hand, we could be witnessing a vetting period for hiPSCs as experienced researchers contrast the true utility of a possible eclipsing technology. In prior work, we have shown that the patterns of research materials used by scientists can be gleaned from analyzing the research literature, but the underlying reasons why researchers chose particular cell lines over others are not always obvious from publications (Scott et al., 2009Scott C.T. McCormick J.B. Owen-Smith J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 696-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Scott et al., 2010Scott C.T. McCormick J.B. DeRouen M.C. Owen-Smith J. Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 866-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To probe this question, we surveyed 118 researchers who presented posters about pluripotent stem cells at the 2010 ISSCR meeting. We scored and categorized the surveys based on two major themes that characterize the field: the “utility of materials” category scored comments about why the lines were used, and the “access to specific materials” category scored comments on how the lines were obtained (for details, see Supplemental Information and Table S1). Investigators using only hESCs manifested the most complicated thinking about access to research materials. Perhaps because embryonic lines are the core of their research programs they evinced greater concerns about access to federal funding and the eventual disposition of particular lines under the Obama policy. They also expressed greater reliance on state funding as an alternative to federal funding and described more diverse routes to access specific lines. Many scientists explained how regulatory uncertainty and funding dilemmas could impede their research. For example, a California researcher who relies on a specific hESC line said, “Bottom line is the ability to work with them. CIRM [California Institute for Regenerative Medicine] gives me confidence because I know I'm funded. I'm glad I'm in California.” The vagaries of federal regulation caused one New Jersey researcher to derive a new line for NIH approval when state funding was dropped for a project using H9. After a 9 month delay, H9 was eventually approved under new NIH guidelines. Another scientist remarked that federal policy has “a huge impact on the study, as our investigation had to give up NIH funding to work on the cell lines.” Geography also played a role. One US investigator moved to Belgium in order to derive new lines. “I work on methods for improved derivation of hESC lines. We created 15 new lines in the process of [our] investigation.” Researchers working in other countries remarked that their ability to derive and use new lines either was not encumbered by restrictions (Sweden) or was handicapped in some fashion (Germany). Researchers accessed hESC lines in numerous ways. Some purchased them from companies whereas others obtained them from collaborators. Others continued to use specific lines because they were repeating previous work or because they were assigned to an ongoing project. Banking, core facilities, and other repositories also played a role. One researcher remarked, “I needed a line and I learned I could get them across the street at the New York Stem Cell Foundation. They gave a vial to me the same day.” In contrast, the remarks by scientists using only iPSCs suggested that access was unproblematic because deriving new cell lines was easy. Most concerns involved whether to derive lines specific to the needs of the lab or to obtain them from collaborators. When investigators volunteered information about the source of somatic cells used for reprogramming, they generally reported easily accessible tissue banks as their sources. There were very few mentions of funding worries and none of policy restrictions. Investigators were split about evenly between those who derived their own lines and those who requested materials from other labs. Researchers who used both iPSC and hESC lines declared less concern with federal funding and access than those using only hESCs but more worries than those who focused only on iPSCs. There was little concern among these scientists about the uncertainty introduced by changes in federal funding rules under the Obama administration and state alternatives to NIH research support. We attribute this to the fact that many of the combinatorial experiments featured federally approved hESC lines, most notably H1, H7, and H9. In some cases, laboratories in this category were experienced hESC users, and thus studies comparing iPSCs and hESCs were the logical next step: “H1, H7, and H9 were already in the [lab],” one researcher said. “…so we used the three lines as controls.” Notably, when asked about access, researchers who used both hESCs and iPSCs almost unanimously replied by describing how they obtained their hESC lines. Although survey respondents reported multiple means to access hESC lines, they focused on informal routes and the legacies of past research. In the 38 interviews with hESC researchers for whom utility was an important theme, 25 (65.8%) mentioned the H1, H7, or H9 lines explicitly. Discussions about the utility of particular research materials thus hinged on determining which line among a small set of available possibilities was the most satisfactory. Investigators using only hESCs evinced different conceptions of utility. Particular lines were considered valuable because they were known quantities (in scientific and regulatory terms) and thus were valuable as references in experiments that used or derived new lines. “We wanted to use H1 because they're less likely to spontaneously differentiate,” a researcher noted. Overwhelmingly, investigators using only iPSCs picked the cells because of the scientific excitement surrounding the technology, for their ease of derivation, and for their therapeutic usefulness. This researcher summed it up: “[We use iPSC] because it is an exciting new technique and it's fascinating to figure out potential therapeutic implications. And, it's a powerful comparison to what we know about hESCs.” Descriptions were framed in reference to particular diseases or markers for specific patient populations or because the disease-based tissue banks were readily available. Somatic cells were sourced in the US, Africa, Italy, Australia, Finland, and Germany, and diseases and disorders included autism, cardiac disease, HIV, TB, and liver failure, suggesting a broad genetic diversity of lines. For researchers using both types of lines, utility was framed in terms of comparing iPSCs to the best-known qualities of hESCs. Only one researcher noted disease as a study aim and then only in the context of obtaining patient-specific lines. Because many of these labs had already studied hESCs, it was only natural that comparative work would follow. “It's always good to use at least H9 as confirmation,” noted one researcher. Another said, “H9 is the standard. It's needed for a positive control.” One scientist noted the conspicuous presence of hESC controls in the literature: “…we haven't seen papers on iPSCs without comparison to ES lines.” In this final section, we analyze networks of coauthorship to determine whether senior researchers who use hiPSC technologies are also deeply embedded in the established field of hESC research. Coauthorship of publications is a key relationship defining scientific disciplines and fields (Moody, 2004Moody J. Am. Sociol. Rev. 2004; 68: 213-238Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar, Newman, 2010Newman M.E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 98: 404-409Crossref Scopus (3187) Google Scholar), and it often encompasses sharing of materials, expertise, goals, and sometimes students and fellows. We treat the last authors on publications as senior representatives of labs, and we do not account in our images for the possibility that joint senior authorship driven by multilab collaborations may be represented by shared corresponding authorship. We present two network figures that portray the penetration of hiPSC research into the hESC field, focusing on the work performed by more senior scientists (Figure 3 and Figure 4). First, we assembled the entire coauthorship network for stem cell articles published between 1998 and 2010 (Figure 3). In this image, nodes represent authors, and ties represent coauthorship on one or more papers. Repeated patterns of coauthorship create a network structure that includes the majority (90.8%) of scientists who have published using hESC and hiPSC lines.Figure 4Network of Last Authors Using hiPSCsShow full captionThis network image represents coauthorship connections among the 69 last authors working with hiPSCS in 2008–2009.

The large network on the left side of the figure includes 33 (47.83%) authors, dominated by researchers at Harvard University and the University of Wisconsin. The “star” in the center contains five last authors connected to Shinya Yamanaka. We color-coded nodes to highlight the activities of last (or senior) authors on papers published in 2008 and 2009. The size of the node reflects the number of papers that an author published in 2008–2009. Large white nodes represent first and middle authors from 2008–2009 publications. Small white nodes overwhelmingly represent authors on pre-2008 stem cell publications who did not publish new articles between 2008 and 2009. The dark gray, blue, and red nodes represent senior authors on papers that used hESC lines only, hiPSC lines only, or both types of lines, respectively. In Figure 3, consider Harvard University's George Daley, who published 12 papers on human pluripotent stem cells during this time with 6 articles listing him as last author. Daley is a rare senior author in our database in that, during 2008–2009, he published papers using hESCs alone, hiPSCs alone, and both cell types. We thus code him as a last author who has used both hESCs and hiPSCs. Daley appears in our network images as a large red circle. Finally, the relative position of nodes in these images is meaningful. The network drawings are optimized using a pair of “spring embedder” algorithms that use the connectivity of a network system to establish the Euclidean distance among nodes (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991Fruchterman T.M.J. Reingold E.M. Softw. Pract. Exper. 1991; 21: 1129-1164Crossref Scopus (3204) Google Scholar, Kamada and Kawai, 1989Kamada T. Kawai S. Inf. Process. Lett. 1989; 31: 7-15Crossref Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). A position in the outer ring of the image represents a collaboration profile that has few ties into the most connected portions of the field. Likewise, scientists who are positioned close together are proximate because they are direct collaborators or they share coauthors in common, creating relatively short indirect network paths between them. Figure 3 represents 90.8% of pluripotent stem cell scientists. If hiPSCs are a widely disseminated technology that allow newcomers to enter the field without recourse to prior working relationships with established hESC investigators, we would expect to see (1) more blue nodes than red nodes, indicating that a large portion of senior authors are using hiPSCs instead of hESCs; (2) red and blue nodes smaller than gray nodes, indicating that those researchers using hiPSCs alone or in concert with hESCs are newer, less prolific investigators; and (3) red and blue nodes nearer the periphery of the image than its center, indicating that senior investigators using hiPSCs are relatively less well connected to the researchers at the established core of the hESC network. Examining Figure 3 suggests that none of these expectations are born out. Red nodes outnumber blue nodes, with 55 senior investigators publishing papers using both hESCs and hiPSCs in 2008–2009 compared to only 14 senior investigators publishing papers using hiPSCs alone. Many red nodes are large, representing prolific authors that use both cell types. Blue nodes tend to be small, suggesting that the last authors on papers with only hiPSCs either are junior in the larger pluripotent field or are senior investigators in allied stem cell disciplines and are experimenting with reprogramming. Finally, although red and blue nodes appear spread across the entire network image in Figure 3, the majority of senior authors using hiPSCs are clustered in a band of large red nodes that crosses the lower left quadrant of the figure. In other words, many of the investigators using hiPSCs are established, prolific hESC scientists who are connected to each other directly or through short indirect paths defined by shared coauthors. Such close indirect connections occur in many fields as senior investigators hire postdoctoral fellows trained in the labs of other established investigators, or as departing scientists carry past collaborations with them to new faculty positions. Figure 4 delves deeper into the relationships between senior authors using hiPSC lines. To create Figure 4, we first extracted all 69 red and blue nodes from Figure 3 and then reoptimized the connections so that the constellations of coauthorship among senior authors become clear. Figure 4 suggests that the clustering of red nodes in Figure 3 results largely from the large set of 33 (47.83%) senior stem cell investigators connected by past and current collaborations. This cluster centers on researchers at Harvard University and the University of Wisconsin, and it contains some of the most prominent scientists working with both hiPSCs and hESCs. It also includes 5 of the 14 (35.7%) senior investigators who have published as last authors using hiPSCs alone. In other words, the most significant cluster of established hESC researchers using hiPSCs is also the source of more than 1/3 of the senior authors who are deploying hiPSC lines alone. Indeed, in Figure 4, the senior authors using only hiPSCs (blue diamonds) appear evenly split between those connected to and those unconnected to senior authors who have used hESCs and hiPSCs together (red circles). Our analyses provide a mixed picture of whether reprogramming technologies have engaged new investigators to reorient the stem cell field. It is clear that iPSCs are not eclipsing hESCs but have instead emerged as a complimentary technology. Although the use of iPSCs is increasing at a rate greater than that observed for hESCs, we believe this is due largely to lower regulatory thresholds, less ethical worry, increased access, and scientific excitement. In terms of who uses specific cell lines, iPSCs may not be lowering barriers to pluripotent stem cell research. A large proportion of early hiPSC adopters are established users of hESCs, which suggests three main conclusions. First, the technology may be facile, but not so easy that a flood of new investigators is entering the pluripotent stem cell field. Experience with hESCs appears to transfer to research that employs induced pluripotent lines. Second, the incentives to use both types of cells in comparative studies are high. Finally, the furious activity we observe on the part of senior hESC researchers may be motivated by scientific curiosity and a dedication to pragmatic choices in uncertain funding environments. Scientists see themselves entering a new era defined by pluripotency, and it is only natural that experience in establishing primary cultures and derivations gives these labs an advantage no matter what cell enters the scene. That reprogrammed cells may unlock the mysteries of human disease is important for these researchers but comprise a different set of objectives."
https://openalex.org/W2047872773,"Oligomerization is an important regulatory mechanism for many proteins, including oncoproteins and other pathogenic proteins. The oncoprotein Bcr-Abl relies on oligomerization via its coiled coil domain for its kinase activity, suggesting that a designed coiled coil domain with enhanced binding to Bcr-Abl and reduced self-oligomerization would be therapeutically useful. Key mutations in the coiled coil domain of Bcr-Abl were identified that reduce homo-oligomerization through intermolecular charge-charge repulsion yet increase interaction with the Bcr-Abl coiled coil through additional salt bridges, resulting in an enhanced ability to disrupt the oligomeric state of Bcr-Abl. The mutations were modeled computationally to optimize the design. Assays performed in vitro confirmed the validity and functionality of the optimal mutations, which were found to exhibit reduced homo-oligomerization and increased binding to the Bcr-Abl coiled coil domain. Introduction of the mutant coiled coil into K562 cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl, reduced cell proliferation, and increased caspase-3/7 activity and DNA segmentation. Importantly, the mutant coiled coil domain was more efficacious than the wild type in all experiments performed. The improved inhibition of Bcr-Abl through oligomeric disruption resulting from this modified coiled coil domain represents a viable alternative to small molecule inhibitors for therapeutic intervention."

Here, we report a successful design of two highly potent chimeric HIV entry inhibitors composed of one CCR5-targeting RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) variant (5P12-RANTES or 5P14-RANTES (Gaertner, H., Cerini, F., Escola, J.

Chimeric inhibitors 5P12-linker-C37 and 5P14-linker-C37 showed extremely high antiviral potency in single cycle and replication-competent viral assays against R5-tropic viruses, with IC50 values as low as 0.004 nm. This inhibition was somewhat strain-dependent and was up to 100-fold better than the RANTES variant alone or in combination with unlinked C37. The chimeric inhibitors also fully retained the antiviral activity of C37 against X4-tropic viruses, and this inhibition can be further enhanced significantly if the target cell co-expresses CCR5 receptor. On human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the inhibitors showed very strong inhibition against R5-tropic Ba-L strain and X4-tropic IIIB strain, with IC50 values as low as 0.015 and 0.44 nm, which are 45- and 16-fold better than the parent inhibitors, respectively. A clear delivery mechanism requiring a covalent linkage between the two segments of the chimera was observed and characterized. Furthermore, the two chimeric inhibitors are fully recombinant and are easily produced at low cost. These attributes make them excellent candidates for anti-HIV microbicides.

Approximately 33 million people are living with HIV, and millions more are infected each year. 2UNAIDS, 2010 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, WHO/UNAIDS. There is currently no vaccine, and treatments usually involve inhibiting viral activity post-infection by inhibiting the HIV protease or reverse transcriptase. More recently, therapies that target other parts of the viral life cycle have been approved, including an HIV integrase inhibitor (3Pace P. Rowley M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2008; 11: 471-479PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most promising areas in the fight against HIV/AIDS has been the development of entry inhibitors, which generally bind to either the viral surface or the human cell surface to stop HIV before it can enter a cell. The HIV surface protein gp120 first makes contact with the human cell surface protein CD4, which causes a conformational rearrangement in gp120, allowing the protein to then bind its co-receptor on the cell surface (either the chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4). During this process, the HIV protein gp41 is exposed, and its fusion peptide enters the cell surface. Toward the end of the infection process, the C-terminal helical trimer folds over to contact the N-terminal trimer of gp41, forming a 6-helix bundle that likely pulls the membranes of the two entities in closer proximity to assist fusion of the virus to the cell (4Root M.J. Steger H.K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1805-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that some of these events may occur in the endosome (6Miyauchi K. Kim Y. Latinovic O. Morozov V. Melikyan G.B. Cell. 2009; 137: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HIV entry can be achieved by blocking one or more of the events that lead to infection. Proteins, particularly lectins that bind to gp120, have been shown to be effective inhibitors (7Wang H.G. Williams R.E. Lin P.F. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1785-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Emau P. Tian B. O'keefe B.R. Mori T. McMahon J.B. Palmer K.E. Jiang Y. Bekele G. Tsai C.C. J. Med.

In particular, the so-called C-peptides that are derived from the C terminus of gp41 effectively bind to the N terminus of gp41 to inhibit infection. One of these peptides, T-20, has been approved for clinical use (10Champagne K. Shishido A. Root M.J. J. Biol.

Considering the stepwise nature of the HIV entry process, there are certain time windows in which multiple targets are simultaneously susceptible to inhibition. Binding of co-receptor inhibitors and fusion inhibitors to their targets can both be achieved after the exposure of gp41 and before gp120 interacts with its co-receptor. Evidence suggests that co-receptor binding is a key factor in the kinetic properties of fusion and that lowered co-receptor density or weakened co-receptor-gp120 binding slows down gp41-mediated cell fusion and prolongs the time window of the intermediate states of gp41 for fusion inhibitors to bind (23Kahle K.M.

We reasoned that a properly engineered chimeric molecule containing one co-receptor inhibitor and one fusion inhibitor can block HIV cell entry at both steps more potently and could overcome the drawbacks of either individual component. We chose to use CCR5 ligand RANTES variants 5P12-RANTES and 5P14-RANTES as the co-receptor inhibitor portion of our chimeric protein. These variants were recently developed by Gaertner and co-workers (1Gaertner H. Cerini F. Escola J.M. Kuenzi G. Melotti A. Offord R. Rossitto-Borlat I. Nedellec R. Salkowitz J. Gorochov G. Mosier D.

In addition to their high potency, they are small proteins that are able to be made recombinantly and are easy to produce at low cost. For the fusion inhibitor part of the chimeric protein, we chose the C-peptide C37. C37 and the nearly identical C34 are well characterized C-peptides and are highly effective at nanomolar concentrations in vitro (4Root M.J. Steger H.K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1805-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Poveda E. Briz V. Soriano V. AIDS Rev. 2005; 7: 139-147PubMed Google Scholar, 22Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S.

It has also been shown that covalently linking C34 to a range of unrelated proteins did not diminish their anti-HIV activity, and in one case the linked C-peptide showed a longer in vivo lifetime (27Stoddart C.A. Nault G. Galkina S.A. Thibaudeau K. Bakis P. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Robitaille M. Bellomo M. Paradis V. Liscourt P. Lobach A. Rivard M.E. Ptak R.G. Mankowski M.K. Bridon D. Quraishi O. J. Biol.

Our chimeric inhibitors 5P12-linker-C37 and 5P14-linker-C37 show much higher anti-HIV potency than the parent inhibitors 5P12-RANTES, 5P14-RANTES, and C37 against R5-tropic HIV strains, leading to HIV inhibition at low picomolar levels. The chimeric proteins also retain the anti-HIV activity of C37 against X4-tropic strains. This X4-tropic anti-HIV potency can be further enhanced up to 6,000-fold on certain target cell lines expressing both CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors. A clear mechanism of C37 delivery by the RANTES variants is observed and characterized, which is a key to the greatly enhanced activity of our chimeric inhibitors. The genes for 5P12-RANTES, 5P12-linker-C37, 5P14-RANTES, 5P14-linker-C37, and P2-linker-C37 were made using standard thermocycling methods. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Bioneer Corp. (Alameda, CA). Mutations to the 5P12-linker-C37 were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These genes were expressed along with an N-terminal small ubiquitin-like modifier tag in the pET SUMO expression vector from Invitrogen. The vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3) and grown in 1 liter of 15N minimal medium using 15NH4Cl as the only nitrogen source. Protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.7. The cells were incubated with shaking for 20 h at 22 °C after induction and then harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in cracking buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with 10 mm benzamidine and French pressed twice at 16,000 p.s.i. The solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of unfolding buffer (5 m guanidinium HCl, 3 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The resuspended solution was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with stirring followed by a centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant containing the denatured protein was added dropwise into 90 ml of folding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the precipitants were then removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was dialyzed in 4 liters of dialysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with slow stirring, and the buffer was changed after 6 h. After dialysis, the solution was centrifuged again, and the supernatant containing the refolded protein was passed through a nickel chelating column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with imidazole in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The purified proteins were dialyzed in 4 liters of 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, to remove imidazole. To cleave the SUMO tag, recombinant yeast ULP1 protease was added, and the solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C. (ULP1 protease was produced and purified in our laboratory as briefly described. ULP1 was expressed in LB medium using a pET-28b, vector and the cells were collected and French pressed. The ULP1 protease from the supernatant was purified using a nickel chelating column.) Precipitated matter was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the product was separated from the SUMO tag using an acetonitrile gradient on a C4 reversed phase chromatography column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) on an Akta purification system (GE Healthcare) and then lyophilized by the Labconco freeze-dry system (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO). In our hands, we were able to obtain a yield of 5 mg of pure protein from 1 liter of Escherichia coli preparation. For proteins containing a 20-amino acid linker, the protocol was modified to include an extra step of centrifugation to remove unfolded protein before adding TFA and acetonitrile for the final C4 column purification step. For the C37 peptide, the N-acetylated and C-amidated fusion inhibitor C37 was purchased from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). All NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on a four-channel 600 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer equipped with a GRASP II gradient accessory and a TCI cryoprobe, which has an actively shielded Z-gradient coil. NMR samples were prepared by adding 15N-labeled lyophilized proteins into 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.5, with 5% D2O. The chemical shift was referenced relative to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (29Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J.

After 12 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with 50 μl per well of fresh RPMI 1640 medium (DMEM for the X4 assay). Different concentrations of inhibitors were added and mixed well. 104/well effector cells (HeLa-ADA for R5 assay and HL2/3 for X4 assay) in 50 μl of medium were then added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to allow fusion. Cells were lysed with 20 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (US Biological) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min, and then 30 μl of PBS with 8 mm substrate chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Calbiochem), 20 mm KCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) was added to each well.

https://openalex.org/W2040125739,"Rhodopsin has developed mechanisms to optimize its sensitivity to light by suppressing dark noise and enhancing quantum yield. We propose that an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network formed by ∼20 water molecules, the hydrophilic residues, and peptide backbones in the transmembrane region is essential to restrain thermal isomerization, the source of dark noise. We studied the thermal stability of rhodopsin at 55 °C with single point mutations (E181Q and S186A) that perturb the hydrogen-bonding network at the active site. We found that the rate of thermal isomerization increased by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the mutants. Our results illustrate the importance of the intact hydrogen-bonding network for dim-light detection, revealing the functional roles of water molecules in rhodopsin. We also show that thermal isomerization of 11-cis-retinal in solution can be catalyzed by wild-type opsin and that this catalytic property is not affected by the mutations. We characterize the catalytic effect and propose that it is due to steric interactions in the retinal-binding site and increases quantum yield by predetermining the trajectory of photoisomerization. Thus, our studies reveal a balancing act between dark noise and quantum yield, which have opposite effects on the thermal isomerization rate. The acquisition of the hydrogen-bonding network and the tuning of the steric interactions at the retinal-binding site are two important factors in the development of dim-light vision."
https://openalex.org/W2027915075,"E-selectin expression by endothelial cells (ECs) is crucial for leukocyte recruitment during the inflammatory response. Macrophage accumulation and serum E-selectin elevation are features of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the interactions between macrophages and ECs in regulating vascular endothelial function are not clearly understood. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the modulation of EC E-selectin expression by high glucose (HG)-treated macrophages. Macrophage-conditioned media (MCM) were prepared from HG-treated macrophages. EC stimulation with HG-MCM induced increases the expression and secretion of E-selectin. By using specific inhibitors and small interfering RNAs, we demonstrate that the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways are critical for HG-MCM-induced E-selectin expression. Transcription factor ELISA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further showed that HG-MCM increases the NF-κB- and AP-1 DNA-binding activities in ECs. The inhibition of NF-κB and AP-1 activation by specific siRNAs blocks the HG-MCM-induced E-selectin promoter activity and expression. Protein arrays and blocking assays using neutralizing antibodies demonstrated that macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and 1β in HG-MCM are major mediators for the induction of EC E-selectin expression. These data support the hypothesis that E-selectin up-regulation stimulated by macrophages may play an active role in atherogenesis in the HG condition and suggest a new mechanism by which arterial disease is accelerated in diabetes."
