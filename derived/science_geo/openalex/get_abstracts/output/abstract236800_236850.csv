https://openalex.org/W2063127941,"We have previously linked families with autosomal-dominant, late-onset parkinsonism to chromosome 12p11.2-q13.1 (PARK8). By high-resolution recombination mapping and candidate gene sequencing in 46 families, we have found six disease-segregating mutations (five missense and one putative splice site mutation) in a gene encoding a large, multifunctional protein, LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2). It belongs to the ROCO protein family and includes a protein kinase domain of the MAPKKK class and several other major functional domains. Within affected carriers of families A and D, six post mortem diagnoses reveal brainstem dopaminergic degeneration accompanied by strikingly diverse pathologies. These include abnormalities consistent with Lewy body Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, nigral degeneration without distinctive histopathology, and progressive supranuclear palsy-like pathology. Clinical diagnoses of Parkinsonism with dementia or amyotrophy or both, with their associated pathologies, are also noted. Hence, LRRK2 may be central to the pathogenesis of several major neurodegenerative disorders associated with parkinsonism."
https://openalex.org/W2106554405,"Elucidating the transcribed regions of the genome constitutes a fundamental aspect of human biology, yet this remains an outstanding problem. To comprehensively identify coding sequences, we constructed a series of high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays representing sense and antisense strands of the entire nonrepetitive sequence of the human genome. Transcribed sequences were located across the genome via hybridization to complementary DNA samples, reverse-transcribed from polyadenylated RNA obtained from human liver tissue. In addition to identifying many known and predicted genes, we found 10,595 transcribed sequences not detected by other methods. A large fraction of these are located in intergenic regions distal from previously annotated genes and exhibit significant homology to other mammalian proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2151164793,"NKT cells represent a distinct lineage of T cells that coexpress a conserved alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR) and natural killer (NK) receptors. Although the TCR of NKT cells is characteristically autoreactive to CD1d, a lipid-presenting molecule, endogenous ligands for these cells have not been identified. We show that a lysosomal glycosphingolipid of previously unknown function, isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3), is recognized both by mouse and human NKT cells. Impaired generation of lysosomal iGb3 in mice lacking beta-hexosaminidase b results in severe NKT cell deficiency, suggesting that this lipid also mediates development of NKT cells in the mouse. We suggest that expression of iGb3 in peripheral tissues may be involved in controlling NKT cell responses to infections and malignancy and in autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1974595472,"The skeletons of adult echinoderms comprise large single crystals of calcite with smooth convoluted fenestrated morphologies, raising many questions about how they form. By using water etching, infrared spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and environmental scanning electron microscopy, we show that sea urchin spine regeneration proceeds via the initial deposition of amorphous calcium carbonate. Because most echinoderms produce the same type of skeletal material, they probably all use this same mechanism. Deposition of transient amorphous phases as a strategy for producing single crystals with complex morphology may have interesting implications for the development of sophisticated materials."
https://openalex.org/W2022228987,"Rapid changes in biodiversity are occurring globally, yet the ecological impacts of diversity loss are poorly understood. Here we use data from marine invertebrate communities to parameterize models that predict how extinctions will affect sediment bioturbation, a process vital to the persistence of aquatic communities. We show that species extinction is generally expected to reduce bioturbation, but the magnitude of reduction depends on how the functional traits of individual species covary with their risk of extinction. As a result, the particular cause of extinction and the order in which species are lost ultimately govern the ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss."
https://openalex.org/W1993669821,We present a method for high-throughput cytological profiling by microscopy. Our system provides quantitative multidimensional measures of individual cell states over wide ranges of perturbations. We profile dose-dependent phenotypic effects of drugs in human cell culture with a titration-invariant similarity score (TISS). This method successfully categorized blinded drugs and suggested targets for drugs of uncertain mechanism. Multivariate single-cell analysis is a starting point for identifying relationships among drug effects at a systems level and a step toward phenotypic profiling at the single-cell level. Our methods will be useful for discovering the mechanism and predicting the toxicity of new drugs.
https://openalex.org/W2105928452,"Plants under oxidative stress suffer from damages that have been interpreted as unavoidable consequences of injuries inflicted upon plants by toxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, this paradigm needs to be modified. Inactivation of a single gene, EXECUTER1, is sufficient to abrogate stress responses of Arabidopsis thaliana caused by the release of singlet oxygen: External conditions under which these stress responses are observed and the amounts of ROS that accumulate in plants exposed to these environmental conditions do not directly cause damages. Instead, seedling lethality and growth inhibition of mature plants result from genetic programs that are activated after the release of singlet oxygen has been perceived by the plant."
https://openalex.org/W2079508856,"The multibillion-dollar trade in bushmeat is among the most immediate threats to the persistence of tropical vertebrates, but our understanding of its underlying drivers and effects on human welfare is limited by a lack of empirical data. We used 30 years of data from Ghana to link mammal declines to the bushmeat trade and to spatial and temporal changes in the availability of fish. We show that years of poor fish supply coincided with increased hunting in nature reserves and sharp declines in biomass of 41 wildlife species. Local market data provide evidence of a direct link between fish supply and subsequent bushmeat demand in villages and show bushmeat's role as a dietary staple in the region. Our results emphasize the urgent need to develop cheap protein alternatives to bushmeat and to improve fisheries management by foreign and domestic fleets to avert extinctions of tropical wildlife."
https://openalex.org/W2166991426,"Cerebellar parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses can undergo postsynaptically expressed long-term depression (LTD) or long-term potentiation (LTP) depending on whether or not the climbing fiber (CF) input is coactivated during tetanization. Here, we show that modifications of the postsynaptic calcium load using the calcium chelator BAPTA or photolytic calcium uncaging result in a reversal of the expected polarity of synaptic gain change. At higher concentrations, BAPTA blocks PF-LTP. These data indicate that PF-LTD requires a higher calcium threshold amplitude than PF-LTP induction and suggest that CF activity acts as a polarity switch by providing dendritic calcium transients. Moreover, previous CF-LTD induction changes the relative PF-LTD versus -LTP induction probability. These findings suggest that bidirectional cerebellar learning is governed by a calcium threshold rule operating ""inverse"" to the mechanism previously described at other glutamatergic synapses (BCM rule) and that the LTD/LTP induction probability is under heterosynaptic climbing fiber control."
https://openalex.org/W2042167620,"Consequences of progressive biodiversity declines depend on the functional roles of individual species and the order in which species are lost. Most studies of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relation tackle only the first of these factors. We used observed variation in grassland diversity to design an experimental test of how realistic species losses affect invasion resistance. Because entire plant functional groups disappeared faster than expected by chance, resistance declined dramatically with progressive species losses. Realistic biodiversity losses, even of rare species, can thus affect ecosystem processes far more than indicated by randomized-loss experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2002088088,"Tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), a fragment of the bacterial surface molecule peptidoglycan (PGN), is the factor responsible for the extensive tissue damage characteristic of whooping cough and gonorrhea infections. Here, we report that Vibrio fischeri also releases TCT, which acts in synergy with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to trigger tissue development in its mutualistic symbiosis with the squid Euprymna scolopes . As components of PGN and LPS have commonly been linked with pathogenesis in animals, these findings demonstrate that host interpretation of these bacterial signal molecules is context dependent. Therefore, such differences in interpretation can lead to either inflammation and disease or to the establishment of a mutually beneficial animal-microbe association."
https://openalex.org/W2054067060,"Phase-sensitive measurements were made on Sr2RuO4 to establish unambiguously the odd-parity pairing in this material. The critical current of Au(0.5)In(0.5)-Sr2RuO4 superconducting quantum interference devices prepared on Sr2RuO4 single crystals was found to be a maximum for devices with junctions on the same side of the crystal and a minimum for devices with junctions on opposite sides, in the limit of zero magnetic flux; these findings indicate that the phase of the superconducting order parameter in Sr2RuO4 changes by pi under inversion. This result verifies the odd-parity pairing symmetry and the formation of spin-triplet Cooper pairs in Sr2RuO4."
https://openalex.org/W2081382082,"Inhibitors in myelin play a major role in preventing spontaneous axonal regeneration after CNS injury. Elevation of cAMP overcomes this inhibition, in a transcription-dependent manner, through the upregulation of Arginase I (Arg I) and increased synthesis of polyamines. Here, we show that the cAMP effect requires activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to overcome myelin inhibitors; a dominant-negative CREB abolishes the effect, and neurons expressing a constitutively active form of CREB are not inhibited. Activation of CREB is also required for cAMP to upregulate Arg I, and the ability of constitutively active CREB to overcome inhibition is blocked by an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis. Finally, expression of constitutively active CREB in DRG neurons is sufficient to promote regeneration of subsequently lesioned dorsal column axons. These results indicate that CREB plays a central role in overcoming myelin inhibitors and so encourages regeneration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2014306540,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can stimulate tumor progression by modulating several proneoplastic pathways, including proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Although steady-state tissue levels of PGE2 stem from relative rates of biosynthesis and breakdown, most reports examining PGE2 have focused solely on the cyclooxygenase-dependent formation of this bioactive lipid. Enzymatic degradation of PGE2 involves the NAD+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). The present study examined a range of normal tissues in the human and mouse and found high levels of 15-PGDH in the large intestine. By contrast, the expression of 15-PGDH is decreased in several colorectal carcinoma cell lines and in other human malignancies such as breast and lung carcinomas. Consistent with these findings, we observe diminished 15-Pgdh expression in ApcMin+/– mouse adenomas. Enzymatic activity of 15-PGDH correlates with expression levels and the genetic disruption of 15-Pgdh completely blocks production of the urinary PGE2 metabolite. Finally, 15-PGDH expression and activity are significantly down-regulated in human colorectal carcinomas relative to matched normal tissue. In summary, these results suggest a novel tumor suppressive role for 15-PGDH due to loss of expression during colorectal tumor progression.

Multistep carcinogenesis unfolds as stochastic mutations and epigenetic changes accumulate within individual cells. In concert with stromal influences, those cells that develop the correct combination of mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes become fully transformed (1Sabichi A.L. Demierre M.F. Hawk E.T. Lerman C.E. Lippman S.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5649-5655PubMed Google Scholar). As an example, the dysregulation of balanced prostaglandin metabolism in vivo contributes to carcinogenesis. Numerous reports have demonstrated the increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; PG, prostaglandin; PGDH, PG dehydrogenase; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PGE-M, 11α-hydroxy-9,15-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20-dioic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. in a variety of human malignancies (2Subbaramaiah K.

Tumor Res. 2003; 37: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and higher COX-2 expression correlates with a poor clinical outcome (4DeLong P. Tanaka T. Kruklitis R. Henry A.C. Kapoor V. Kaiser L.R. Sterman D.H. Albelda S.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7845-7852PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, targeted overexpression of COX-2 in mouse mammary tissue leads directly to the development of breast carcinomas in transgenic mice (5Liu H.L. Chang S.H. Narko K. Trifan O.C. Wu M.T. Smith E. Haudenschild C. Lane T.F. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18563-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are associated with resistance to programmed cell death (6Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar) as well as stimulation of cell migration, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis (7Rozic J.G. Chakraborty C. Lala P.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although steady-state tissue levels of PGE2 depend on relative rates of biosynthesis and breakdown, virtually all reports examining the role of PGE2 in physiology and disease have focused solely on the cyclooxygenase-dependent formation of this bioactive lipid. A plausible complementary pathway yielding increased local levels of PGE2 in cancer involves reduced degradation of PGE2 by NAD+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). 15-PGDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step of prostaglandin catabolism (8Tai H.H. Ensor C.M. Tong M. Zhou H. Yan F. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The human gene is located on chromosome 4 and encodes a 29-kDa protein that oxidizes the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of prostaglandins to yield inactive 15-keto metabolites (9Pichaud F. Delage-Mourroux R. Pidoux E. Jullienne A. Rousseau-Merck M.F. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of 15-Pgdh leads to increased tissue levels of PGE2 (10Coggins K.G. Latour A. Nguyen M.S. Audoly L. Coffman T.M. Koller B.H. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although previous studies on the distribution and activity of 15-PGDH have focused primarily on parturition and uterine biology, recent data suggest that 15-PGDH plays a role in carcinogenesis (11Rao C.V. Wang C.X. Simi B. Lubet R. Kelloff G. Steele V. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3717-3722PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tong M. Tai H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although 15-PGDH may promote certain androgen-sensitive prostate cancers (13Tong M. Tai H.H. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2141-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), preliminary reports on medullary thyroid and transitional bladder cancers suggest that the loss of 15-PGDH expression contributes to malignancy (14Quidville V. Segond N. Pidoux E. Cohen R. Jullienne A. Lausson S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2561-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Gee J.R. Montoya R.G. Khaled H.M. Sabichi A.L. Grossman H.B. Urol. Oncol. 2003; 21: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These conflicting reports are intriguing, and although no mechanism has been demonstrated in vivo that explains its down-regulation, a variety of compounds that modulate the expression and activity of 15-PGDH in vitro have been reported, including the hypoglycemic thiazolidinediones (16Cho H. Tai H.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as well as NSAIDs and PPARγ agonists (17Cho H. Tai H.H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 67: 461-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To more completely understand prostaglandin function in epithelial biology, our laboratory sought to identify pathways complementary to COX-2 by which PGE2 might accumulate and contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. The present study examines the hypothesis that decreased expression of 15-PGDH correlates with colorectal tumor formation. We present data suggesting that 15-PGDH is down-regulated in malignant disease relative to normal tissue and that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and indomethacin can modulate 15-PGDH expression in colorectal carcinoma cells. We also provide functional data both in vitro and in vivo showing that 15-PGDH expression levels correlate with enzymatic activity and production of the urinary PGE2 metabolite (PGE-M). Here we report the first indication that decreased catabolism of PGE2 may regulate tumor formation in the intestine. These data are suggestive of a previously unrecognized pathway in colorectal carcinogenesis, whereby elevated PGE2 levels derive in part from reduced expression and activity of 15-PGDH. Ultimately, this novel observation may shed light on the adverse clinical outcomes of patients with high levels of tumor-derived cyclooxygenase-2. Reagents—EGF was purchased from Sigma, and indomethacin, ciglitazone, and GW9662 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Erlotinib (Tarceva™) was obtained from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). FirstChoice mouse and human Northern blots were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The Cancer Profiling Array II was purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibody to Cox-2 (160107) was purchased from Cayman Chemical, and rabbit antiserum against human 15-PGDH was a kind gift from Dr. Hsin-Hsiung Tai (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). The Northern blot probe for Cox-2 was generously provided by Dr. Sanjoy Das (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), and that for 15-Pgdh was a kind gift from Dr. Beverly Koller (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The Northern probe for 15-PGDH was obtained by SpeI digestion of IMAGE clone ID 3638799 from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Animals and Cell Culture—C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-ApcMin+/– mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6-Pgdh–/– mice were a generous gift from Dr. Beverly Koller. The mice were housed and fed with standard mouse diet in the Animal Care Facility according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals. LS-174T, HCT-15, HCT-116, DLD-1, HT-29, CaCo-2, Colo 201, LoVo, and SW480 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, and HCA-7 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Susan Kirkland. LS-174T, HCT-15, HCT-116, HCA-7, and HT-29 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. SW480, Colo 201, and DLD-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. CaCo-2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium, and LoVo cells were maintained in Ham's F-12K medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells by TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol. 5 μg of total RNA was fractionated with a MOPS-formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N1 membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following UV cross-linking, the blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 42 °C in Hybrisol I (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY) and then hybridized using 32P-labeled cDNA in the same buffer at 42 °C, washed, and subjected to autoradiography. Western Blotting—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad reagent. Proteins were then separated on precast 4–20% SDS polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody (15-PGDH, 1/15,000 and β-actin, 1/2,000) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). 15-PGDH Activity Assay—15-PGDH activity was assayed by measuring the transfer of tritium from 15(S)-[15-3H]PGE2 to glutamate through coupling 15-PGDH and glutamate dehydrogenase as described previously (18Tai H.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4586-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 5 μm NH4Cl, 1 μm α-ketoglutarate, 1 μm NAD+, 1 nm 15(S)-[15-3H]PGE2, 100 μg of glutamate dehydrogenase, and crude enzyme extract in a final volume of 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C and was terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of 3% aqueous charcoal suspension. Supernatant radioactivity following centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Calculation of oxidized PGE2 levels was based on the assumption that no kinetic isotope effect was involved in the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of 15(S)-[15-3H]PGE2. Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—The major urinary metabolite of PGE2, 11α-hydroxy-9,15-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20-dioic acid (PGE-M), was measured in urine as described previously (19Murphey L.J. Williams M.K. Sanchez S.C. Byrne L.M. Csiki I. Oates J.A. Johnson D.H. Morrow J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, PGE-M contained in 400 μl of mouse urine was derivatized using methoximine HCl (16% w/v) in a 1.5 m sodium acetate solution, diluted in water, and adjusted to pH 3 with acetic acid. Samples were purified by extraction using a C18 SepPak, after which 12.4 ng of O-[2H6]methyloxime PGE-M internal standard was added. Samples were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 50 μl of mobile phase A (95:4.9:0.1 (v/v/v) 5 mm ammonium acetate:acetonitrile:acetic acid), and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (19Murphey L.J. Williams M.K. Sanchez S.C. Byrne L.M. Csiki I. Oates J.A. Johnson D.H. Morrow J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Human Colorectal Tissue Samples—Human colorectal tumor specimens were obtained from surgical resections, with Vanderbilt Internal Review Board approval. For each tumor sample, matched adjacent normal mucosa was collected for comparison. All samples were snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. RNA and protein from tissues were processed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was performed at least three times, and data were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by paired Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Heterogeneous Expression of 15-PGDH with Highest Levels in the Large Intestine—As a preliminary study, we examined a wide range of tissue types to identify the physiologic expression pattern of 15-PGDH. 15-PGDH is known to be ubiquitously expressed in several organs in mammals (8Tai H.H. Ensor C.M. Tong M. Zhou H. Yan F. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot for tissues from human (Fig. 1A) and mouse (Fig. 1B). In humans, we found the highest expression levels in the large intestine (Fig. 1A), but elevated 15-PGDH mRNA was also detected in the lung, the liver, and the small intestine (Fig. 1, A and B). The lungs and liver are known to play an important role in prostaglandin metabolism in vivo (20Ivanov A.I. Romanovsky A.A. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1977-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), but this is the first report suggesting that 15-PGDH plays a role in the intestine. These findings prompted us to determine whether the relative expression of 15-PGDH is altered in normal versus malignant tissues. A preliminary analysis of matched normal/tumor samples from multiple human tumors revealed that 15-PGDH was dysregulated in a wide range of human cancers, including those of the breast, stomach, lung, skin, kidney, small intestine, pancreas, liver, and colon (Fig. 1C). We chose to focus our attention initially on the role of 15-PGDH in colorectal cancer because of our long term focus on understanding prostaglandin function in intestinal biology. Down-regulation of 15-PGDH Expression in Colorectal Carcinoma Cells—To assess the expression pattern and modulation of 15-PGDH in cultured colorectal carcinoma cells, we evaluated the following cell lines: HCT-15, HCT-116, HCA-7, HT-29, DLD-1, SW480, and LS-174T (Fig. 2A). Examination of the additional colorectal carcinoma cell lines CaCo-2, Colo 201, and LoVo revealed that only LoVo cells expressed 15-PGDH (data not shown). Most colorectal carcinoma cells (7 of 10) examined in this study displayed little or no 15-PGDH mRNA, although certain cell lines retained varying levels of 15-PGDH expression, including HCT-15 and HCA-7. These results are consistent with our in vivo findings that most colorectal carcinomas have significant reductions in 15-PGDH levels (see Fig. 4).Fig. 4Loss of 15-PGDH expression and activity in human colorectal cancer tissues. A, total RNA and protein were isolated from 23 individual human colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal mucosa. Equal amounts of RNA and protein were analyzed for 15-PGDH expression. N, normal mucosa; T, tumor tissue. B, determination of 15-PGDH activity is shown in eight human colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal mucosa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Four representative lines were employed in the following experiments: HCT-15, HCT-116, HCA-7, and LS-174T. This panel of cells was selected to span a full range of colorectal carcinoma lines with regard to 15-PGDH expression and endogenous prostaglandin levels. HCT-15 and HCT-116 cells do not express appreciable amounts of cyclooxygenase and have high (HCT-15) and low (HCT-116) endogenous levels of 15-PGDH expression, respectively. LS-174T cells express low levels of 15-PGDH and cyclooxygenase but have been shown to be extremely sensitive to exogenous PGE2 treatment (21Shao J. Evers B.M. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14287-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, HCA-7 cells have high levels of COX-2 and endogenous prostaglandins as well as moderate levels of 15-PGDH. To study the regulation of 15-PGDH expression in vitro, we focused initially on indomethacin and ciglitazone, compounds reported to modulate 15-PGDH in other experimental models. Indomethacin is a widely used NSAID with a number of pharmacologic activities beyond the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 activity. Previous reports indicate that indomethacin induces 15-PGDH expression in certain contexts (14Quidville V. Segond N. Pidoux E. Cohen R. Jullienne A. Lausson S.

Quantitation of 15-PGDH data by densitometry supports these findings. While evaluating additional mediators that can modulate the expression of 15-PGDH, we examined the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone with and without pretreatment with an irreversible PPARγ-specific antagonist, GW9662. Although previous reports indicate that ciglitazone is a potent antagonist of 15-PGDH enzymatic activity with an IC50 of 2.7 μm (17Cho H. Tai H.H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 67: 461-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we did not see a significant effect of this PPARγ ligand on 15-PGDH expression in our studies (data not shown). To evaluate whether 15-PGDH may serve as a tumor suppressor gene, we sought to identify known oncogenic pathways that could alter expression of 15-PGDH. EGF is an established mediator of proliferation in a variety of human cancers. In addition, signal transduction pathways downstream from the EP4 PGE2 receptor have been shown to transactivate the EGF receptor (EGFR) (24Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 25Buchanan F.G. Wang D. Bargiacchi F. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35451-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). We sought to identify whether stimulation or blockade of the EGFR (ErbB1) could modulate expression of 15-PGDH. Consistent with a tumor-suppressor role for 15-PGDH, EGF down-regulated 15-PGDH protein in HCT-15 (p = 0.013) and HCA-7 (p = 0.008) cells relative to untreated controls. Conversely, the inhibition of this pathway with the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib) led to the increased expression of 15-PGDH in both HCT-15 (p = 0.016) and HCA-7 (p = 0.070) (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment with erlotinib for 1 h prior to the addition of EGF largely blocked the down-regulation of 15-PGDH compared with EGF treatment alone (Fig. 2C). To our knowledge, this is the first observation that stimulation of the EGFR signaling cascade can down-regulate prostaglandin catabolism. Modulation of 15-PGDH Expression and Activity in Vivo— Coordinate regulation of increased PGE2 production and inhibition of PGE2 degradation may increase local tissue levels of PGE2. The relevance of this dysregulated state to carcinogenesis in vivo is emphasized by our recent study indicating that treatment of ApcMin+/– mice with PGE2 significantly accelerates adenoma growth (26Wang D. Wang H. Shi Q. Katkuri S. Walhi W. Desvergne B. Das S.K. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, we next evaluated 15-Pgdh levels in ApcMin+/– adenomas to see whether decreased catabolism could provide a partial explanation for the stimulatory effect of exogenous PGE2 on adenoma growth in vivo. Northern and Western analysis of C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-ApcMin+/– mouse intestine showed that wild-type C57BL/6 mice exhibited strong expression of 15-Pgdh mRNA (Fig. 3A). The situation was reversed in adenomas of 15-week-old ApcMin+/– mice, in which the expression of 15-Pgdh was markedly reduced (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, intestinal mucosa with a microscopically normal appearance maintained the expression of 15-Pgdh in these mice. By contrast, both Cox-2 mRNA and protein levels were low in the normal mucosa but significantly increased within the polyp microenvironment (Fig. 3, A and B). This finding is very interesting in light of the recent report that basal EGFR activity is increased in ApcMin+/– intestinal adenomas (27Moran A.E. Hunt D.H. Javid S.H. Redston M. Carothers A.M. Bertagnolli M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43261-43272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), combined with our current observation that the activation of EGFR lowers 15-PGDH expression. Functional Analysis of 15-PGDH in Vitro and in Vivo—The modulation of 15-PGDH expression by EGF naturally raised questions regarding the functional significance of these changes. To assess whether 15-PGDH protein levels correlate with enzymatic catabolism of PGE2, 15-PGDH activity was assayed in vitro as described previously (18Tai H.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4586-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The treatment of HCT-15 cells with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 24 h decreased 15-PGDH enzymatic activity by 59% relative to untreated control cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3C). This reduction mirrors the decrease in protein levels under these conditions and provides evidence that protein expression and enzymatic activity of 15-PGDH correlate in vitro. Recent reports indicate that genetic disruption of 15-Pgdh in the mouse results in increased tissue levels of PGE2 (10Coggins K.G. Latour A. Nguyen M.S. Audoly L. Coffman T.M. Koller B.H. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine how the loss of 15-PGDH expression affects PGE2 catabolism in vivo, we measured PGE-M, the major urinary metabolite of PGE2 (19Murphey L.J. Williams M.K. Sanchez S.C. Byrne L.M. Csiki I. Oates J.A. Johnson D.H. Morrow J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of urine collected from wild-type C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-Pgdh–/– mice showed that PGE-M is absent in urine collected from Pgdh–/– mice compared with control animals (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3D). This provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that loss of 15-PGDH expression alone can directly disrupt catabolism of PGE2 and contribute to elevated levels of bioactive PGE2. Loss of 15-PGDH Expression and Activity in Human Colorectal Cancers—Finally, to extend our in vivo studies and assess the biological relevance of these observations, we examined clinical samples of human colorectal carcinomas. A comparison of human colon cancers and matched normal tissue revealed greatly reduced expression of 15-PGDH in malignant tissue relative to normal colonic mucosa. Northern and Western blotting indicated that 15-PGDH levels were decreased in 85% of the 23 pairs of colon carcinoma samples compared with adjacent normal mucosa (Fig. 4A). To assess the functional significance of these findings, 15-PGDH enzymatic activity was compared in eight paired human colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal mucosa. 15-PGDH activity was found to reflect changes in expression levels (p = 0.019) (Fig. 4B). These data support the hypothesis that 15-PGDH expression and activity are down-regulated in colorectal cancer. PGE2 levels are elevated significantly at sites of inflammation and malignancy; these findings are often attributed to the increased expression of the inducible cyclooxygenase isoenzyme COX-2. The well studied functions of COX-2-derived PGE2 in malignant and metastatic disease indicate a role in modulation of apoptosis, stimulation of angiogenesis, and promotion of tumor invasion (6Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rozic J.G. Chakraborty C. Lala P.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has revealed a 40–50% reduction in risk and mortality from colorectal cancer in individuals taking NSAIDs regularly, either in the context of sporadic colorectal cancers or in familial adenomatous polyposis. Both conditions are associated with high levels of PGE2, and the protective effects of NSAIDs are due, at least in part, to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-dependent formation of PGE2 (28Rigas B. Goldman I.S. Levine L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 518-523PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pugh S. Thomas G.A. Gut. 1994; 35: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 30Giardiello F.M. Casero Jr., R.A. Hamilton S.R. Hylind L.M. Trimbath J.D. Geiman D.E. Judge K.R. Hubbard W. Offerhaus G.J. Yang V.W. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). While virtually all studies have focused on pathologic overproduction by COX-2, steady-state levels of PGE2 depend on the relative rates of biosynthesis and breakdown. Reduced degradation of PGE2 by the rate-limiting catabolic enzyme 15-PGDH provides a potential alternative mechanism for the local accumulation of PGE2. The role of 15-PGDH in malignancy has not been addressed adequately. To increase our understanding of prostaglandin function in carcinogenesis, the present study sought to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of 15-PGDH is associated with colorectal tumorigenesis. We employ a variety of approaches to support our contention that 15-PGDH is down-regulated in colorectal cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Several human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, ApcMin+/– mice, and human sporadic colorectal cancer samples show decreased 15-PGDH expression and activity relative to matched normal tissues. These findings naturally raise questions regarding the regulation of 15-PGDH expression at the molecular level. Rao et al. (11Rao C.V. Wang C.X. Simi B. Lubet R. Kelloff G. Steele V. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3717-3722PubMed Google Scholar) report that inhibition of 15-PGDH activity by the isoflavonoid genistein increases tumor burden in azoxymethane-treated rats. Although previous studies show induction of 15-PGDH by indomethacin in certain contexts (14Quidville V. Segond N. Pidoux E. Cohen R. Jullienne A. Lausson S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2561-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Frenkian M. Segond N. Pidoux E. Cohen R. Jullienne A. Prostaglandins. 2001; 65: 11-20Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Frenkian M. Pidoux E. Baudoin C. Segond N. Jullienne A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2001; 64: 87-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we only observed induction of 15-PGDH by indomethacin in one of four colorectal carcinoma cell lines (LS-174T). Examination of additional cell lines and further testing in vivo are necessary to elucidate whether indomethacin regulates 15-PGDH in the intestine. Conversely, the inhibition of 15-PGDH expression and activity by EGF suggests a previously unknown mechanism by which EGFR ligands positively regulate local PGE2 levels. While ErbB2 is known to induce COX-2 (31Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Adam L. Steinbach G. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the current study suggests that EGF can decrease the expression of 15-PGDH in colonocytes. Our findings with EGF in HCT-15 and HCA-7 are complemented by data showing induction of 15-PGDH following inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity with erlotinib. Although the majority of EGFR studies focus on activation of intracellular signaling cascades, recent data from Lu et al. (32Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) support the view that EGF-induced negative regulation of gene function can promote tumor formation. The loss of 15-PGDH expression in colorectal carcinomas is quite intriguing in light of previous reports indicating that up-regulation of EGFR occurs in 60–80% of colorectal cancers (33Messa C. Russo F. Caruso M.G. Di Leo A. Acta Oncol. 1998; 37: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 34Porebska I. Harlozinska A. Bojarowski T. Tumour Biol. 2000; 21: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 35Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar). The expression of EGFR is known to be associated with poor survival in patients with colorectal cancer (36Mayer A. Takimoto M. Fritz E. Schellander G. Kofler K. Ludwig H. Cancer. 1993; 71: 2454-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that inhibitors of EGFR signaling have clinically significant activity when given to patients with colorectal cancer who are refractory to other treatment (37Cunningham D. Humblet Y. Siena S. Khayat D. Bleiberg H. Santoro A. Bets D. Mueser M. Harstrick A. Verslype C. Chau I. Van Cutsem E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (4605) Google Scholar). As several anticancer drugs that target EGFR signaling are currently being developed, our present results may help to explain the clinical efficacy of these new agents. These data may also be quite significant when coupled with our original report (38DuBois R.N. Tsujii M. Bishop P. Awad J.A. Makita K. Lanahan A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G822-G827PubMed Google Scholar) that COX-2 is an EGF/transforming growth factor-α-inducible gene in intestinal epithelial cells, with robust enhancement of prostaglandin production following EGFR activation. Other reports (25Buchanan F.G. Wang D. Bargiacchi F. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35451-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) from our group support a feed-forward mechanism whereby COX-2-derived PGE2 can transactivate the EGFR. The present study suggests that 15-PGDH is negatively regulated downstream from activated EGFR, allowing PGE2 to accumulate and activate this cycle repeatedly. AP-1, Ets, and cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) proteins have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of 15-PGDH (39Nandy A. Jenatschke S. Hartung B. Milde-Langosch K. Bamberger A.M. Gellersen B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Future studies will determine whether any of these factors mediate EGF-dependent suppression of 15-PGDH transcription in the intestine. Data presented in this paper indicate that the regulation of local PGE2 levels in human colorectal cancers is complex, involving both increased expression of COX-2 and loss of 15-PGDH. Although 15-PGDH is known to play an important role in physiologic processes such as parturition through modulation of local prostaglandin levels, our data show that 15-PGDH may inhibit cellular transformation by metabolizing local PGE2 produced at the tumor site. Coordinate regulation of increased PGE2 production and inhibition of PGE2 degradation lead to elevated levels of PGE2, and the relevance of this dysregulated state to carcinogenesis in vivo is emphasized by our recent study (26Wang D. Wang H. Shi Q. Katkuri S. Walhi W. Desvergne B. Das S.K. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) indicating that treatment of ApcMin+/– mice with PGE2 significantly accelerates adenoma growth. ApcMin+/– mice develop intestinal adenomas spontaneously and have elevated levels of PGE2 at 15 weeks that correlate closely with multiplicity of intestinal polyps (40Kettunen H.L. Kettunen A.S. Rautonen N.E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5136-5142PubMed Google Scholar). Previously attributed solely to elevated COX-2 activity, our data in 15-week-old ApcMin+/– mice suggest that loss of 15-Pgdh also correlates with tumor progression in this setting. Given that the loss of 15-Pgdh decreases PGE2 catabolism, our data also support the hypothesis that 15-Pgdh serves an important homeostatic function involving degradation of PGE2. Loss of enzyme expression specifically within the tumor microenvironment coincides with adenoma formation in 15-week-old ApcMin+/–mice, a process that can be accelerated by treatment with exogenous PGE2 (26Wang D. Wang H. Shi Q. Katkuri S. Walhi W. Desvergne B. Das S.K. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In summary, this study examines 15-PGDH expression in both normal and tumor tissues of the mouse and human intestine, with preliminary analysis of 15-PGDH regulation in vitro. We show that 15-PGDH mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in human colorectal cancers relative to normal mucosa. A similar decrease in 15-PGDH expression is found specifically within the tumor microenvironment of intestinal adenomas in 15-week-old ApcMin+/– mice. Loss of 15-PGDH expression correlates with reduced enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo. We also show that the loss of 15-PGDH function in vivo markedly decreases metabolic inactivation of PGE2. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that reduced catabolism of PGE2 may promote colorectal tumorigenesis. These preliminary findings provide a novel framework for further investigation into the regulation of 15-PGDH expression and function in vivo. We thank Drs. Jason Morrow, Sanjoy Das, and Beverly Koller for kindly providing important reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2036141603,"In many parts of the developing nervous system, the number of axonal inputs to each postsynaptic cell is dramatically reduced. This synapse elimination has been extensively studied at the neuromuscular junction, but how axons are lost is unknown. Here, we combine time-lapse imaging of fluorescently labeled axons and serial electron microscopy to show that axons at neuromuscular junctions are removed by an unusual cellular mechanism. As axons disappear, they shed numerous membrane bound remnants. These ""axosomes"" contain a high density of synaptic organelles and are formed by engulfment of axon tips by Schwann cells. After this engulfment, the axosome's contents mix with the cytoplasm of the glial cell. Axosome shedding might underlie other forms of axon loss and may provide a pathway for interactions between axons and glia."

Expression of human PrP with valine 129 resulted in a distinct phenotype and, remarkably, persistence of a barrier to transmission of BSE-derived prions on subpassage. Polymorphic residue 129 of human PrP dictated propagation of distinct prion strains after BSE prion infection. Thus, primary and secondary human infection with BSE-derived prions may result in sporadic CJD-like or novel phenotypes in addition to vCJD, depending on the genotype of the prion source and the recipient."

It has become possible to promote the formation of new quantum phases by explicitly tuning systems toward special low-temperature quantum critical points.

We present experimental evidence for the formation of a nonsuperconducting phase in the vicinity of a magnetic field-tuned quantum critical point in ultrapure crystals of the ruthenate metal Sr3Ru2O7, and we discuss the possibility that the observed phase is due to a spin-dependent symmetry-breaking Fermi surface distortion."
https://openalex.org/W2016770429,"Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are densely expressed in the spinal dorsal horn, but their functional significance in pain processing is not understood. By disrupting the genes encoding GluR-A or GluR-B, we generated mice exhibiting increased or decreased numbers of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that AMPA receptors are critical determinants of nociceptive plasticity and inflammatory pain. A reduction in the number of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and density of AMPA channel currents in spinal neurons of GluR-A-deficient mice is accompanied by a loss of nociceptive plasticity in vitro and a reduction in acute inflammatory hyperalgesia in vivo. In contrast, an increase in spinal Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors in GluR-B-deficient mice facilitated nociceptive plasticity and enhanced long-lasting inflammatory hyperalgesia. Thus, AMPA receptors are not mere determinants of fast synaptic transmission underlying basal pain sensitivity as previously thought, but are critically involved in activity-dependent changes in synaptic processing of nociceptive inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2133808994,"Mammalian small heat shock proteins (sHSP) form polydisperse and dynamic oligomers that undergo equilibrium subunit exchange. Current models of their chaperone activity hypothesize that recognition and binding of protein non-native states involve changes in the oligomeric state. The equivalent thermodynamic representation is a set of three coupled equilibria that includes the sHSP oligomeric equilibrium, the substrate folding equilibrium, and the equilibrium binding between the sHSP and the substrate non-native states. To test this hypothesis and define the binding-competent oligomeric state of human Hsp27, we have perturbed the two former equilibria and quantitatively determined the consequences on binding. The substrate is a set of T4 lysozyme (T4L) mutants that bind under conditions that favor the folded state over the unfolded state by 10(2)-10(4)-fold. The concentration-dependent oligomer equilibrium of Hsp27 was perturbed by mutations that alter the relative stability of two major oligomeric states including phosphorylation-mimicking mutations that result in the dissociation to a small multimer over a wide range of concentrations. Correlation of binding isotherms with size exclusion chromatography analysis of the Hsp27 oligomer equilibrium demonstrates that the multimer is the binding-competent state. Binding occurs through two modes, each characterized by different affinity and number of binding sites, and results in T4L.Hsp27 complexes of different hydrodynamic properties. Mutants of the Hsp27 phosphorylation mimic that reverse the reduction in oligomer size also reduce the extent of T4L binding. Taken together, these results suggest a central role for the oligomeric equilibrium in regulating the chaperone activity of sHSP. The mutants identify sequence features important for modulating this equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2107660867,"Translational repression by Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) protein controls posterior patterning during embryonic development. Here, we show that Pum is an important mediator of synaptic growth and plasticity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Pum is localized to the postsynaptic side of the NMJ in third instar larvae and is also expressed in larval neurons. Neuronal Pum regulates synaptic growth. In its absence, NMJ boutons are larger and fewer in number, while Pum overexpression increases bouton number and decreases bouton size. Postsynaptic Pum negatively regulates expression of the translation factor eIF-4E at the NMJ, and Pum binds selectively to the 3′UTR of eIF-4E mRNA. The GluRIIa glutamate receptor is upregulated in pum mutants. These results, together with genetic epistasis studies, suggest that postsynaptic Pum modulates synaptic function via direct control of eIF-4E expression."

However, TACI alone serves as a high affinity receptor for both APRIL and BAFF because monovalent BCMA binds BAFF only weakly (14Pelletier M. Thompson J.S. Qian F. Bixler S.A. Gong D. Cachero T.

TACI functions, at least in part, as a negative regulator of BAFF function given that loss of TACI expression results in the overproduction of B cells and autoimmunity in mice (16Yan M. Wang H.

The role of BCMA is less clear, although it appears to be important for the survival of long lived plasma cells (18O'Connor B.P. Raman V.S. Erickson L.D. Cook W.J. Weaver L.K. Ahonen C. Lin L.-L. Mantchev G.T. Bram R.J. Noelle R.J. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). A third APRIL-specific receptor may exist as APRIL can stimulate cells that express neither BCMA nor TACI (11Rennert P. Schneider P. Cachero T.G. Thompson J. Trabach L. Hertig S. Holler N. Qian F.

The extracellular domain of a typical TNFR contains multiple copies of so-called ∼40-residue cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which bind in the monomer-monomer interfaces of a trimeric ligand (19Bodmer J.-L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). TACI is a member of the TNFR superfamily possessing two CRDs; interestingly however, the two CRDs of TACI are more similar to each other (∼50% sequence identity) than is typical in the TNFR family (20von Bu ̈low G.-U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). BCMA and BR3, in contrast, are unusually small TNFRs as they contain only a single or partial CRD, respectively. The only other known TNFRs possessing just a single CRD are FN14 (21Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T. Winkles J.A. Lindner V. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C.

All human APRIL or BAFF receptor CRDs, including both domains of TACI, share a common sequence feature, the so-called DXL motif, which consists of a conserved 6-residue sequence (Phe/Tyr/Trp)-Asp-Xaa-Leu-(Val/Thr)-(Arg/Gly). This motif is required for binding to either APRIL or BAFF (15Patel D.R. Wallweber H.J.A. Yin J. Shriver S.K. Marsters S.A. Gordon N.C. Starovasnik M.A. Kelley R.F. J. Biol.

Crystal structures of BAFF bound to BCMA, BR3, or a peptide presenting the DXL motif in a β-hairpin scaffold show that this receptor motif binds in a hydrophobic pocket and interacts with two conserved arginine residues on the BAFF surface (23Gordon N.C. Pan B. Hymowitz S.G. Yin J. Kelley R.F. Cochran A.G. Yan M. Dixit V.M. Fairbrother W.J. Starovasnik M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Kim H.M.

The structure of APRIL alone was recently shown to be very similar to that of BAFF and indicates that the DXL binding site is conserved in the two ligands (27Zhang G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Wallweber H.J.A. Compaan D.M. Starovasnik M.A. Hymowitz S.G. J. Mol.

Thus, a similar mode of ligand-receptor interaction via the DXL site is expected for APRIL-receptor complexes; however, ligand binding specificity of BR3 and BCMA appears to be determined by interactions outside this common motif (15Patel D.R. Wallweber H.J.A. Yin J. Shriver S.K. Marsters S.A. Gordon N.C. Starovasnik M.A. Kelley R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Gordon N.C. Pan B. Hymowitz S.G. Yin J. Kelley R.F. Cochran A.G. Yan M. Dixit V.M. Fairbrother W.J.

Zhang G. Nature. 2003; 423: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since both CRDs of human TACI contain the DXL motif and have been shown qualitatively to interact with BAFF (24Kim H.M. Yu K.S. Lee M.E. Shin D.R. Kim Y.S. Paik S.-G. Yoo O.J. Lee H. Lee J.-O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), questions remain as to whether each domain actively contributes to ligand binding in the context of the full-length receptor or whether only one is exploited for optimal ligand binding; and if only a single domain is sufficient to achieve high affinity binding, whether APRIL and BAFF favor the same or different TACI domains. Alternatively, both CRDs together could contribute to ligand binding as is typically observed for multidomain TNFRs (19Bodmer J.-L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Additionally, Kim and co-workers (24Kim H.M. Yu K.S. Lee M.E. Shin D.R. Kim Y.S. Paik S.-G. Yoo O.J. Lee H. Lee J.-O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have postulated that TACI might span adjacent BAFF trimers with its two CRDs. To understand whether TACI functions more like a multidomain TNFR or like the small and more specific receptors BR3 and BCMA, we have characterized the APRIL-TACI interaction using cell-based, biochemical and structural studies. We show that an alternative splice form of TACI lacking the N-terminal CRD is still functional for signaling. Furthermore, we found that only the membrane-proximal CRD (TACI_d2) is required for high affinity binding to either APRIL or BAFF. The solution structure of TACI_d2 reveals a compact domain similar to that of BCMA; however, combinatorial alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified additional ligand binding determinants unique to TACI_d2. The co-crystal structures of APRIL·TACI_d2 as well as APRIL·BCMA complexes show remarkably large interfaces and highlight key differences among the APRIL and BAFF receptors which influence ligand binding affinity and specificity. Thus, despite the presence of two CRDs in the extracellular domain of TACI, only a single domain is employed for both APRIL- and BAFF-dependent signaling. Protein Production—Murine APRIL was produced as described previously (28Wallweber H.J.A. Compaan D.M. Starovasnik M.A. Hymowitz S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Murine APRIL was used throughout the study because it is better behaved biochemically than recombinant human APRIL. Differences between murine and human APRIL lie outside the receptor binding site (Ref. 28Wallweber H.J.A. Compaan D.M. Starovasnik M.A. Hymowitz S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and see below), thus, similar receptor binding affinities for murine and human APRIL are expected. Human TACI_d1d2 (residues 21–116) and TACI_d1 (residues 32–67) were produced from baculovirus using essentially the same procedure. DNA coding for the TACI fragments followed by a C-terminal His tag were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67B (Pharmingen). After transfection and viral amplification in Sf9 cells, proteins were expressed and secreted from Hi5 cells grown at 27 °C. 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm NiCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to the culture medium, the pH was adjusted to 7.6, and the medium was filtered prior to loading on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column. After elution with imidazole, relevant fractions were pooled and purified further on a Superdex-75 (S-75) sizing column. For production of human TACI_d2, DNA encoding TACI residues 68–109 was subcloned into the pET32a expression vector (Novagen), creating a fusion protein consisting of an N-terminal thioredoxin domain followed by a His tag, thrombin cleavage site, then TACI_d2. Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli Origami (DE3) cultures grown at 37 °C in LB medium for unlabeled protein, or M9 minimal medium containing uniformly 13C-labeled glucose and [15N]NH4Cl to generate protein samples for NMR spectroscopy. After cultures grew to an A600 of 0.7, the temperature was lowered to 16 °C and expression induced overnight with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Thioredoxin-TACI_d2 was purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Thioredoxin was removed by thrombin cleavage, then TACI_d2 was purified further either using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography for the NMR samples or on an S-75 column in 20 mm CAPS, pH 9.7, 400 mm NaCl (buffer A) for crystallography. Human BAFF, human BCMA-Fc, and human BCMA-Z were expressed and purified as described previously (15Patel D.R. Wallweber H.J.A. Yin J. Shriver S.K. Marsters S.A. Gordon N.C. Starovasnik M.A. Kelley R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The identities of all purified proteins were verified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Competitive Binding Assays—A BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc.) was used to measure ligand-receptor interactions in solution using a competitive binding format. BCMA-Fc was coupled to a CM4 sensor chip, using the amine coupling protocol supplied by the manufacturer, at a high density (4,500 resonance units) so the initial rate of binding was linearly dependent on free ligand concentration. The chip surface was regenerated between sample injections by washing with 10 mm HCl. Fixed ligand concentrations (12.5 nm BAFF; 50 nm thioredoxin-APRIL) in the presence of varying receptor concentrations were incubated for 2 h. Samples were then passed over the BCMA-Fc-coupled surface. A linear fit of the initial on-rate of the observed sensorgrams was used to calculate the concentration of free ligand. The IC50 values were calculated using a four-parameter curve fit of the fractional rate of binding free ligand as a function of competing receptor concentration. Receptors were also tested for binding either to APRIL or to BAFF in a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (15Patel D.R. Wallweber H.J.A. Yin J. Shriver S.K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that BAFF binding assays utilized biotinylated BR3·ECD rather than biotinylated “mini-BR3” (23Gordon N.C. Pan B. Hymowitz S.G. Yin J. Kelley R.F. Cochran A.G. Yan M. Dixit V.M. Fairbrother W.J. Starovasnik M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as the probe. Phage Display of TACI_d2—DNA encoding TACI_d2 (residues 68–109) was subcloned into the phagemid BCMA2-g3 described previously (15Patel D.R. Wallweber H.J.A. Yin J. Shriver S.K. Marsters S.A. Gordon N.C. Starovasnik M.A. Kelley R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TACI_d2-g3 was used to prepare three “shotgun alanine” scanning libraries essentially as described previously (32Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Each library contains shotgun codons at unique positions: library one has 11 shotgun codons at positions 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 83, and 85; library two has 13 shotgun codons at positions 79, 81, 82, 84, 87, 88, 91, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98; and library three has 8 shotgun codons at positions 99, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, and 109. Libraries were sorted for binding against APRIL, BAFF or anti-tag antibody (3C8:2F4 Genentech, Inc.), and sequences of phage clones were analyzed as described previously (15Patel D.R. Wallweber H.J.A. Yin J. Shriver S.K. Marsters S.A. Gordon N.C. Starovasnik M.A. Kelley R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For APRIL binding, 71, 40, and 54 sequences were analyzed from libraries one, two and three, respectively. For BAFF binding, 70, 50, and 53 sequences were analyzed for libraries one, two and three, respectively. For the display selection, at least 47 sequences were analyzed for each library. The number of times a particular amino acid was found at each position was tabulated, and the normalized wild-type/mutant functional ratio, F, was calculated for each position as described previously (33Skelton N.J. Koehler M.F.T. Zobel K. Wong W.L. Yeh S. Pisabarro M.T. Yin J. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (see Table S3). F represents a measure of the apparent effect of mutation of a given residue on binding affinity, with values >1 representing deleterious mutations. Because of the relatively small number of sequences analyzed, only those mutations showing a greater than 10-fold effect (i.e. F > 10) are considered significant. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples typically contained ∼1 mm protein, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium azide, and 50 μm 1,4-dioxane as an internal chemical shift reference standard in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. A “100% D2O” sample was prepared by lyophilization and resuspension in 99.995% D2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 17 °C on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe. All NMR data were processed using FELIX (version 2000.1; Accelrys, San Diego) and analyzed using the program Sparky (version 3.11, Goddard and Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). Backbone resonance assignments of TACI_d2 were obtained from double and triple resonance experiments in H2O solution, as described previously (34Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1995Google Scholar and see Table S1). Stereospecific assignments of leucine methyl groups were obtained from a 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of a 15% 13C-labeled sample (35Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wu ̈thrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Backbone dynamics were investigated by analyzing the steady state {1H}-15N-NOE as described previously (23Gordon N.C. Pan B. Hymowitz S.G. Yin J. Kelley R.F. Cochran A.G. Yan M. Dixit V.M. Fairbrother W.J. Starovasnik M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Skelton N.J. Akke M. Ko ̈rdel J. Palmer A.G.P. Rance M. Chazin W.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 253-264Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were obtained from analysis of the following NOESY spectra: three-dimensional 1H-15N-edited NOESY (200 ms mixing time) measured in H O; three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY (150 ms mixing time) measured in D2O; and two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY (150 ms mixing time) measured in D2O. NOE peaks were picked manually, and NOE assignments were obtained using the automated NOE assignment program CANDID (37Herrmann T. Gu ̈ntert P. Wu ̈thrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) followed by several rounds of structure calculation and manual restraint checking. Dihedral angle restraints were obtained from analysis of three-dimensional 15N-1H HNHB and three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (50 ms mixing time) spectra. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were obtained from analysis of backbone chemical shifts with the program TALOS (38Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Dihedral restraints were applied for good fits to the chemical shifts with the allowed range of ±30° (for φ), ±40° (for Ψ). The final structures were calculated using the program CNX (version 2002; Accelrys). 100 structures were calculated using torsion angle dynamics followed by Cartesian dynamics and minimization. The 20 structures with the lowest restraint violation energy were chosen to represent the solution structure (Table S2). One of the differences between the NMR ensemble of TACI_d2 and the crystal structure of the same domain bound to APRIL is the conformation of the C-terminal disulfide (Cys93/Cys104). Thus, a separate set of structures was calculated using dihedral angle restraints to force the disulfide bonds to adopt the conformation observed in the crystal structure (-60 ± 20° for χ1, -60° ± 20° for χ2, and -90 ± 20° for χ3) in addition to the NMR-derived restraints. Using these additional restraints had the desired effect on disulfide bond geometry yet did not introduce significant NOE or dihedral angle restraint violations (r.m.s.d. values of 0.008 Å and 0.36°, respectively) or noticeable changes in the backbone conformation (0.58 ± 0.09 Å backbone r.m.s.d. for residues 76–104 to mean structure with NMR-derived restraints only). Thus the difference in conformation seen for the Cys93/Cys104 disulfide bond may result from the lack of experimental dihedral angle restraints and the imprecise nature of the NOE restraints in this region.

Crystals grew at 19 °C from sitting drops containing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution (70% methylpentane diol, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5). The complex of APRIL and BCMA-Z was first purified over an S-75 sizing column in buffer A, then Z-domain was removed by cleavage with endoproteinase Lys-C (EMD Biosciences), and the complex was repurified over the S-75 column. APRIL·BCMA fractions were concentrated to 8.4 mg/ml. Crystals grew at 19 °C from sitting drops containing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m MES, pH 5.0, 5% PEG 8000, and 10% PEG 1000). Crystallography—APRIL·TACI_d2 crystals were cryocooled without any additional cryoprotectant. The APRIL·BCMA crystals were first transferred to an artificial mother liquor containing 0.1 m MES, pH 5.0, 5% PEG 8000, 10% PEG 1000, 400 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CAPS, pH 9.7. Mother liquor was slowly exchanged for a cryoprotectant consisting of the mother liquor with 20% PEG 300 and then cooled by immersion in liquid nitrogen. A 1.9 Å data set of APRIL·TACI_d2 and a 2.35 Å data set of APRIL·BCMA were collected at 19BM at the APS. Processing of the APRIL·TACI_d2 data with HKL resulted in a data set with Rsym = 8.6% (35% in the 1.97–1.90 Å shell), 99.6% completeness, 6.5-fold redundancy, and <I/σI> = 7.4 in space group P212121, whereas processing of the APRIL·BCMA data with HKL (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 176: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38619) Google Scholar) resulted in a data set with Rsym = 6.7% (43% in the 2.43–2.35 Å shell), 99.9% completeness, 9.4-fold redundancy, and <I/σI> = 11.7 in space group P61 (Table S4).

This study examined the volumes of the amygdala and hippocampus in cocaine-addicted subjects and matched healthy controls and determined that the amygdala but not the hippocampus was significantly reduced in volume. The right-left amygdala asymmetry in control subjects was absent in the cocaine addicts. Topological analysis of amygdala isosurfaces (population averages) revealed that the isosurface of the cocaine-dependent group undercut the anterior and superior surfaces of the control group, implicating a difference in the corticomedial and basolateral nuclei. In cocaine addicts, amygdala volume did not correlate with any measure of cocaine use. The amygdala symmetry coefficient did correlate with baseline but not cocaine-primed craving. These findings argue for a condition that predisposes the individual to cocaine dependence by affecting the amygdala, or a primary event early in the course of cocaine use."
https://openalex.org/W2081732444,"Induction of cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) requires a postsynaptic cascade involving activation of mGluR1 and protein kinase C (PKC). Our understanding of this process has been limited by the fact that PKC is a large family of molecules, many isoforms of which are expressed in the relevant postsynaptic compartment, the cerebellar Purkinje cell. Here, we report that LTD is absent in Purkinje cells in which the alpha isoform of PKC has been reduced by targeted RNA interference or in cells derived from PKCalpha null mice. In both of these cases, LTD could be rescued by expression of PKCalpha but not other PKC isoforms. The special role of PKCalpha in cerebellar LTD is likely to derive from its unique PDZ ligand (QSAV). When this motif is mutated, PKCalpha no longer supports LTD. Conversely, when this PDZ ligand is inserted in a nonpermissive isoform, PKCgamma, it confers the capacity for LTD induction."

This study examined the role of TRPC1 in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. SH-SY5Y cells treated with an exogenous neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) significantly decreased TRPC1 protein levels. Confocal microscopy on SH-SY5Y cells treatment with MPP+ showed decreased plasma membrane staining of TRPC1. Importantly, overexpression of TRPC1 reduced neurotoxicity induced by MPP+. MPP+-induced α-synuclein expression was also suppressed by TRPC1 overexpression. Protection of SH-SY5Y cells against MPP+ was significantly decreased upon the overexpression of antisense TRPC1 cDNA construct or the addition of a nonspecific transient receptor potential channel blocker lanthanum. Activation of TRPC1 by thapsigargin or carbachol decreased MPP+ neurotoxicity, which was partially dependent on external Ca2+. Staining of SH-SY5Y cells with an apoptotic marker (YO-PRO-1) showed that TRPC1 protects SH-SY5Y neuronal cells against apoptosis. Further, TRPC1 overexpression inhibited cytochrome c release and decreased Bax and Apaf-1 protein levels. Interpretation of the above data suggests that reduction in the cell surface expression of TRPC1 following MPP+ treatment may be involved in dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

Although the underlying cause of dopaminergic cell death or the molecular mechanism by which these cells degenerate is still not fully understood, several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to play a role that includes overproduction of reactive oxygen species, impairment of mitochondrial respiration, disturbances of Ca2+ homeostasis, and excitotoxicity (6Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 7Fahn S. Cohen G. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 8Tatton W.G. Olanow C.W.

Of these, Ca2+ homeostasis is believed to play an important role, because Ca2+ has both stimulatory and inhibitory roles in the cell death process. Release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment induces oxidative stress, which could activate cell death cascades (11Ermak G. Davies K.J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Ca2+ concentration is very tightly regulated in neuronal cells. Disturbances in neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis have been implicated in a variety of neuropathological conditions (12Lehotsky J. Kaplan P. Babusikova E. Strapkova A. Murin R. Physiol. Res. 2003; 52: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). Hypotheses about how such disturbances might cause neurodegeneration have largely focused on excessive concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which could cause overactivation of a variety of potentially destructive processes (11Ermak G. Davies K.J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). More recently, several lines of evidence suggests that neuronal toxicity is not simply a function of increased [Ca2+]i. For example, treatments with AMPA or KCl can increase [Ca2+]i up to 1–2 μm in cortical neurons, without causing toxicity (13Chen Q. Surmeier D.J. Reiner A. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas equally high Ca2+ loads are toxic when entering via the N-methyl-d-aspartate channels but not when entering via the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (13Chen Q. Surmeier D.J. Reiner A. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that the source of increased [Ca2+]i or the calcium channel itself is critical for neuronal cell death. Further, in some neurons decreasing [Ca2+]i is toxic, whereas in others a modest increase in [Ca2+]i can be neuroprotective, indicating a “set point” mechanism for the effect of [Ca2+]i (11Ermak G. Davies K.J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 13Chen Q. Surmeier D.J. Reiner A. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The action of Ca2+ ion is mediated by several mechanisms, which are highlighted by the central role of Ca2+ in apoptotic processes and neuronal excitotoxicity. Mitochondria not only functions as an ATP producer but also functions as a regulator of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Increased mitochondrial Ca2+ overload as a result of excitotoxicity has been associated with the generation of superoxide and may induce the release of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins, proceeding through DNA fragmentation/condensation and culminating in cell demise by apoptosis (14Anglade P. Vyas S. Javoy-Agid F. Herrero M.T. Michel P.P. Marquez J. Mouatt-Prigent A. Ruberg M. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mochizuki H. Goto K. Mori H.

Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm from two sources: it is either released from the intracellular stores, or it enters through the plasma membrane (21Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 22Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 90: re1Google Scholar). The important initiating step in the rise of cytosolic Ca2+ is the intracellular release of Ca2+, which is initiated by the activation of the G protein-coupled receptor followed by generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binds to its receptor in the ER to release Ca2+ from internal stores. Depletion of the intracellular stores leads to the opening of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, which are known as receptor-operated Ca2+ channels (23Putney Jr., J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The addition of thapsigargin (a SERCA pump blocker) initiates a passive release of Ca2+ from the internal stores, which could activate plasma membrane Ca2+ channels known as store-operated Ca2+ channels. Mammalian homologues of the transient receptor potential (trp) genes have been suggested as the plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels (21Minke B. Cook B. Physiol.

In recent years, 28 mammalian members of the TRP superfamily has been identified that are classified into TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPML, TRPP, and ANKTM1 subfamilies (22Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 90: re1Google Scholar, 25Moran M.M. Xu H. Clapham D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). TRP superfamily members are non-voltage-gated cation channels except for TRPM5, which displayed voltage modulation (26Hofmann T. Chubanov V. Gudermann T. Montell C. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1153-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and are known to be activated by diverse stimuli including heat, pressure, pH, Ca2+, and activation of G protein-coupled receptors. These TRP channels not only function as Ca2+ influx channels but are also involved in pain transduction, osmoregulation, mechanosensitivity, cell growth, differentiation, and other as yet uncharacterized functions (25Moran M.M. Xu H. Clapham D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Both overexpression and down-regulation has shown that TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPV6 exhibit properties associated with store-operated Ca2+ channels and could be activated by store depletion per se; however, the expression of these TRP proteins is very restricted. TRPC1 is the only exception; it is ubiquitously expressed and is localized in the plasma membrane (24Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S.

Targeting of TRP proteins to the plasma membrane is essential for its function, which is dependent on its ability to interact with other proteins. TRPC1 interaction with caveolin 1 and TRPV2 interaction with a chaperone protein RGA is critical for their trafficking to the plasma membrane (28Barnhill J.C. Stokes A.J. Koblan-Huberson M.

The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of MPP+ on the expression/function of TRPC1 in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. Our data demonstrate that expression of TRPC1 is significantly reduced in cells treated with MPP+. Further, overexpression of the TRPC1 protected dopaminergic neurons from cellular toxicity elicited by MPP+, and down-regulation of TRPC1 reduced TRPC1 protein levels and an increased cell death. Finally, we show that critical proapoptotic factors are inhibited in TRPC1-overexpressing cells treated with MPP+. Together our data reveal an important role of TRPC1 in the protection of dopaminergic neurons against Parkinson's disease-inducing agents. SH-SY5Y Cell Culture, Transformation, and Reagents—SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were cultured in a medium containing minimum essential medium, F-12 medium, Hanks' balanced salt solution (2:1:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids), 1 unit/ml penicillin, and 1 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C with 95% humidified air and 5% CO2. Culture medium was changed twice weekly. SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in complete medium until reaching 90% confluence and then were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in the same medium as described above. MPP+ was added to culture wells and was present during the duration of the experiment (12–24 h) unless otherwise stated. Agents being tested for protective/inhibitory effects were added 15 min prior to the introduction of the toxic drug.

Vybrant Staining Assay—Vybrant apoptosis assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to evaluate apoptosis as per the manufacturer's instructions. This kit distinguishes apoptotic and necrotic cells by propidium iodide dye and lipid dye (YO-PRO-1) staining. The cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope using a 10× objective. The dead and necrotic cells exhibit red fluorescence, whereas apoptotic cells have a green fluorescence. The total apoptotic and necrotic cells were counted, and the percentages of cells exhibiting apoptosis/necrosis were calculated. TRPC1 Transcriptome in SH-SY5Y Cells—To investigate the expression of various TRP proteins, RT-PCR was performed. 10 ng of total mRNA isolated from SH-SY5Y cells was used for cDNA synthesis using primers specific for each trp genes. Analysis of the amplified fragments showed that TRPC1, 3, and 5 were expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas expression of TRPC2, TRPC4, and TRPC6 was not observed under similar conditions (Fig. 1A, top panel). The lack of expression of TRPC2, TRPC4, and TRPC6 was not due to their primer design or other experimental limitations because the desired PCR products were obtained when plasmid DNA was used as template (data not shown). As indicated in Fig. 1A, a 455-base pair TRPC1, a 690-base pair TRPC3, and a 595-base pair of TRPC5 fragments were amplified. Although these PCR products matched their respective base pair sizes, we sequenced these products, which confirmed the presence of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC5 transcripts (data not shown). To investigate whether other TRP members are also expressed, RT-PCR was performed using specific TRPV and TRPM primers. Analysis of TRPV transcripts indicate that TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPV4 were expressed in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Semi-quantitative analysis of the PCR products indicate that TRPV4 was expressed more, followed by TRPV3 and TRPV2. Expression of TRPM transcripts was also determined using RT-PCR method, using TRPM-specific primers. As indicated in Fig. 1A (bottom panel), only TRPM1, TRPM3, and TRPM5 were expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas TRPM2, TRPM4, TRPM6, and TRPM8 were not detected. RT-PCR using TRPM5 primers resulted in two bands. The top band corresponded with the right size and TRPM5 product, and the bottom band is perhaps an alternative spliced product of TRPM5 gene. Expression of multiple TRP transcripts in SH-SY5Y cells indicates that these TRP channels could have an important role in the physiology/function of the dopaminergic neuronal cells. Effect of MPP+ on TRPC1 Expression—To investigate the role of MPP+, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 250 μm of MPP+, and TRPC1 protein levels were investigated. As indicated in Fig. 1B, no significant changes in the TRPC1 protein levels were observed when incubated with MPP+ for an initial period of 6 h. However, prolonged incubation with MPP+ (10–24 h) showed a significant decrease in the TRPC1 levels. Densitometry on these bands revealed that 70–80% of the TRPC1 protein was reduced after 10 h of incubation with MPP+, which remained the same even after 24 h of incubation. In contrast, blots probed with anti-SERCA2B antibody showed no significant decrease in their respective protein levels (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Similar results were also obtained using actin or tubulin antibodies, where no significant decrease in their protein levels was observed after 24 h of incubation with MPP+ (data not shown). In aggregate these results suggest that the decrease in the TRPC1 protein level observed upon MPP+ treatment is specific and could be the direct effect of the drug. MPP+ Treatment Alters TRPC1 Plasma Membrane Localization—To study the role of MPP+ on the expression/localization of the TRPC1 protein, confocal microscopy was performed. Localization of the endogenous TRPC1 protein displayed a punctate plasma membrane staining along with some subplasma membrane staining (Fig. 2A). Incubation of SH-SY5Y cells without the TRPC1 antibody showed no staining (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous findings, where TRPC1 protein was expressed in the plasma membrane (24Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R.

In contrast, MPP+ treatment for 10 h on control SH-SY5Y cells showed a dramatic decrease in the plasma membrane staining of TRPC1 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were also obtained upon 24 h of incubation with MPP+ where TRPC1 was localized primarily in the cytosol rather than in the plasma membrane (data not shown). Confocal studies performed with cells overexpressing TRPC1 and treated with MPP+ showed a punctate plasma membrane staining similar to that of the control cells. In contrast, a diffused pattern of staining was observed for cells where TRPC1 expression was down-regulated using trpc1 antisense construct and treated with MPP+ for 10 h (Fig. 2B). Further, consistent with our previous results, TRPC1 protein levels were significantly reduced in cells overexpressing antisense trpc1 construct (Fig. 2C) (24Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.

These results suggest that MPP+ treatment not only decreases TRPC1 protein levels but also alters its localization, and overexpression of TRPC1 restores this effect by reverting to the control conditions. Overexpression of TRPC1 Protects SH-SY5Y Cells from Cell Death—To evaluate the role of TRPC1 in SH-SY5Y cells, we transiently overexpressed TRPC1 using adenoviral method. A multiplicity of infection of 5 for Ad-TRPC1 was used to infect SH-SY5Y cells; we have previously used this virus to overexpress TRPC1 protein in human submandibular gland cells (32Singh B.B. Zheng C. Liu X. Lockwich T. Liao D. Zhu M.X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 652-654Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 3A, Western blots were performed on crude membranes isolated from control untreated cells, and TRPC1 protein was detected. Cells treated for 10 h with MPP+ had a significant decrease in TRPC1 protein levels. This decrease in TRPC1 protein levels was similar as observed in Fig. 1A. In contrast, MPP+ treatment on SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing TRPC1 (using Ad-TRPC1; multiplicity of infection of 5) showed a significant increase in the levels of the TRPC1 protein (Fig. 3A). SH-SY5Y cells infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 of control virus (Ad-Luciferase) showed no increase in the TRPC1 protein level upon 10–24 h of MPP+ treatment (data not shown). These blots were reprobed with SERCA2B antibodies, which showed no decreases in their protein levels (Fig. 3A, lower panel). MPP+ is a toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine produced by monoamine oxidase B and causes neurodegeneration. Thus, to investigate whether TRPC1 has a role in the protection of dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, MTT assays were performed. SH-SY5Y cells were grown on a 96-well plate and treated with the desired drugs both in control and in transiently overexpressing TRPC1 cells. SH"

We recently identified two novel snake venom VEGFs (vammin and VR-1) having unique properties. These VEGFs, designated VEGF-Fs, are highly specific ligands for the kinase insert domain-containing receptor and exhibit potent biological activity both in vitro and in vivo when compared with VEGF-A(165). Here, we solved the crystal structures of vammin and VR-1 at 1.9 and 2.0 A resolutions, respectively. Both structures are very similar to each other, and these structures exhibit similar but significantly different features from the known structures of other VEGFs. These differences include a conformational difference in receptor-binding loop 3 caused by an amino acid residue insertion and a difference in surface potential on the possible binding surface for domain 3 of the receptor. These structural differences may be related to the highly selective ligand properties of VEGF-F."
https://openalex.org/W2002834476,"SNAP-25 and its ubiquitously expressed homologue, SNAP-23, are SNARE proteins that are essential for regulated exocytosis in diverse cell types. Recent work has shown that SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 are partly localized in sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane and that the integrity of these domains is important for exocytosis. Here, we show that raft localization is mediated by a 36-amino-acid region of SNAP-25 that is also the minimal sequence required for membrane targeting; this domain contains 4 closely spaced cysteine residues that are sites for palmitoylation. Analysis of endogenous levels of SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 present in lipid rafts in PC12 cells revealed that SNAP-23 (54% raft-associated) was almost 3-fold more enriched in rafts when compared with SNAP-25 (20% raft-associated). We report that the increased raft association of SNAP-23 occurs due to the substitution of a highly conserved phenylalanine residue present in SNAP-25 with a cysteine residue. Intriguingly, although the extra cysteine in SNAP-23 enhances its raft association, the phenylalanine at the same position in SNAP-25 acts to repress the raft association of this protein. These different raft-targeting signals within SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 are likely important for fine-tuning the exocytic pathways in which these proteins operate."

The enzyme, consisting of a heterotrimeric α3β3γ3 quaternary structure with the three different subunits encoded by the ureC, ureB, and ureA genes, respectively, is synthesized in the apo-form that is devoid of nickel. The incorporation of Ni2+ into the active site, leading to the activation of the enzyme, is still poorly understood and is thought to occur in vivo as a stepwise assembly process (6Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of the active site in vitro can be achieved by using high, nonphysiological concentrations of Ni2+ ions and bicarbonate as the source of CO2, which is needed for the carbamoylation of the active site lysine residue (7Park I.S. Hausinger R.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1156-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). At physiological concentrations of Ni2+ and CO2, the participation of four accessory proteins is required (8Jones B.D. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5837-5843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Renner M.J.

These proteins (UreD, UreF, UreG, and UreE) are encoded by four genes, which are also present in the urease operon together with ureA, ureB, and ureC (12Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many functional studies have been carried out on the urease accessory proteins from K. aerogenes. KaUreD (∼30 kDa) binds to apourease and appears to induce a conformational change required for the next steps of the activation process (13Park I.S. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3233-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Park I.S. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). KaUreF (∼25 kDa) binds the KaUreD-apourease complex and seems to facilitate carbamoylation of the nickel-bridging lysine residue and to prevent Ni2+ binding to the noncarbamoylated apourease (15Moncrief M.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments showed an interaction between KaUreD and the α and β subunits of apourease, whereas KaUreF was shown to interact with the β subunit and to induce a conformational change capable of increasing the accessibility of the nickel ions and CO2 to residues in the active site (16Chang Z. Kuchar J. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15305-15313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The interaction of UreD with UreF and with the α-subunit of apourease was suggested by immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid studies carried out on these proteins from Proteus mirabilis (17Heimer S.R. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In H. pylori a similar experiment indicated the interaction between UreF and UreH, the latter corresponding to UreD in other bacteria (18Voland P. Weeks D.L. Marcus E.A. Prinz C. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G96-G106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). KaUreG (∼22 kDa) can form a quaternary complex with KaUreDF-apourease, suggesting that such large aggregate is the minimum competent species for the in vitro urease activation (7Park I.S. Hausinger R.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1156-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Park I.S. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could be required for the process occurring in vivo (20Moncrief M.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4081-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Finally, KaUreE (a homodimer of ∼35 kDa) is thought to bind the KaUreDFG-apourease complex, acting as a nickel transporter that delivers Ni2+ to the active site of the enzyme (21Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Brayman T.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10731-10737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among the four accessory proteins, UreG plays an essential role in coupling cellular metabolism and bioenergetics to the assembly of urease. This protein contains a fully conserved P-loop motif, which is also present in many nucleotide-binding proteins and which is probably related to the in vivo GTP requirement for assembly of the urease active site (26Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A direct relationship between UreG and GTP requirement is proven by the evidence that GTP is needed for activation of the Ka-UreDFG-apourease complex, although it has an inhibitory effect on the nickel reconstitution of the apourease and of the KaUreD-apourease and KaUreDF-apourease complexes (26Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). UreG is also involved in delivering CO2 necessary for the carbamoylation of the nickel-bridging lysine; the curves that correlate the urease activation to different bicarbonate concentrations indicate a higher rate and level of enzymatic activation in the presence of UreDFG-apourease complex (26Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vitro, optimal levels of apourease activation require 0.5 mm GTP. Larger GTP concentrations lead to a decrease of urease activity, probably caused by the chelation of Ni2+ by the nucleotide; this is consistent with the fact that elevated levels of Mg2+ ions partially restore the activation (26Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the presence of UreE, this inhibitory effect is lost, and the urease activation occurs at significantly lower GTP concentrations (27Soriano A. Colpas G.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12435-12440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These observations indicate a correlation between GTP hydrolysis by UreG and Ni2+ transfer to apourease by UreE. Additional evidence of the UreE-UreG interaction in vivo has been obtained by using two-hybrid systems and immunoprecipitation experiments in H. pylori (18Voland P. Weeks D.L. Marcus E.A. Prinz C. Sachs G. Scott D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G96-G106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that UreG may induce GTP-dependent structural changes of the apourease, increasing the accessibility of both Ni2+ and CO2 to the developing active site. Alternatively, UreG may use GTP and CO2 to synthesize carboxyphosphate, which could serve as an excellent CO2 donor to the Lys residue (26Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The thorough functional studies described above have paved the way to an understanding of the mechanism of the urease accessory proteins and, in particular, of UreG in Ni2+ trafficking and metabolic regulation. The next echelon in the comprehension of the urease chemistry implies the study of the interaction mechanisms between the accessory proteins and the enzyme at the molecular level, in order to understand how the urease active site is assembled. This goal cannot be achieved without detailed structural information on each accessory protein and its biochemical properties. The only crystal structures available for the urease chaperones are those of UreE from K. aerogenes (28Song H-K. Mulrooney S.B. Huber R. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49359-49364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and B. pasteurii (29Remaut H. Safarov N. Ciurli S. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49365-49370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The high degree of similarity between these two structures and between the structures of Ka- and Bp-urease are indications of a conserved molecular mechanism of urease activity, activation, and metal-center building in different species (30Musiani F. Zambelli B. Stola M. Ciurli S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). No structural detail is available for the other three chaperones. A study, published in 1997 (20Moncrief M.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4081-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), reported that KaUreG is monomeric in solution and that it does not, by itself, hydrolyze GTP or ATP. Another report in 2003 (31Mehta N. Benoit S. Maier R.J. Microb. Pathog. 2003; 35: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and concerning HpUreG essentially confirmed these results. This paper describes a thorough study performed on the recombinant UreG from B. pasteurii. In particular, the cloning, expression, and purification of the protein in its native and His-tagged forms are described, together with evidence confirming the identity of the isolated protein. The oligomerization state and the hydrodynamic properties of the protein in solution were examined by using size exclusion chromatography coupled with light scattering experiments, and the protein folding was checked using circular dichroism, mass spectrometry, and NMR. The metal-binding capability and enzymatic GTPase activity of BpUreG were established for the first time and discussed. Finally, threading (fold recognition) algorithms were applied to calculate a model for the protein structure that is consistent with its solution properties and enzymatic activity. The results represent a significant contribution to the understanding of the role of this metallochaperone in the urease active site assembly. BpUreG Cloning—In accordance with the DNA sequence of the B. pasteurii urease operon available from GenBank™ (accession number AF361945), two 24- and 26-bp oligonucleotide primers were designed and synthesized to amplify the ureG gene by the PCR technique using the pUC19 plasmid containing the B. pasteurii ure operon (32Ciurli S.

The following forward and reverse primers introduced NdeI and BamHI restriction enzyme recognition sites, respectively (boldface type): 5′-CTAGGAGATTGTGCATATGAAAAC-3′; 5′-CAATATCGAG GGATCCAAACGGTATT-3′. Taq polymerase for the PCR and dNTPs were from Display System Biotech. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized in the Nucleic Acid Facility at the Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA). The PCR product obtained by using these primers was digested by a combination of NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs), purified by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel, extracted, and precipitated. By using T4 DNA ligase (Promega), this DNA fragment was ligated at a 2-fold excess of insert to vector, into plasmid pET3a (Novagen), which had been digested with NdeI and BamHI, treated with alkaline phosphatase, and purified by electrophoresis. For the His-tagged BpUreG, the plasmid pET15b was used. Plasmid DNA was isolated from transformants of Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) by the rapid alkaline extraction method, as described (33Sambrook J. Fritisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The resulting pET3a::ureG and pET15b::ureG plasmids were purified using the StrataPrep™ Plasmid MiniPrep kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the cloned BpUreG gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The constructs for both plasmids were inserted by electroporation (Bio-Rad GenePulser II) into the E. coli BL21(DE3) expression host (Novagen) grown in shaking flasks at 37 °C in a medium with the Luria-Bertani (LB) composition (Amersham Biosciences) or on agar (1.5%) plates with the same composition. BpUreG Expression—Based on the T7 system (34Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 66-89Google Scholar), large scale expression of BpUreG and His-tagged BpUreG was achieved in 2.5-liter batches of minimum M9 liquid media (1 liter contained6gofNa2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 1.25 g of (NH4)2SO4, 0.246 g of MgSO4) supplemented with 4 g of glucose per liter of culture. The 15N-enriched proteins were obtained using a medium containing (15NH4)2SO4. Transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C (28 °C for the His-tagged protein) with vigorous stirring, until the A600 reached 0.5–0.8. Expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 5 mm EDTA and lysozyme (200 μg/ml). After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, followed by the addition of DNase I (20 μg ml-1) and additional incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the cells were disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell (SLM, Aminco) at 20,000 pounds/square inch. The cell pellet was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. BpUreG Purification—In the case of native BpUreG, the pellet was washed (resuspended in 25 ml of buffer using a mixer homogenizer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and three times with the same buffer without Triton X-100. The pellet was subsequently resuspended and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mm DTT and 2 m urea. The soluble fraction, obtained after removal of the precipitated material by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min), was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose XK 26/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated with 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mm DTT and 2 m urea. The column was washed using a flow rate of 3 ml min-1 with the starting buffer until the base line was stable. The protein was eluted from the column with a 400-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m). Fractions containing BpUreG were combined, diluted with the elution buffer to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, and dialyzed (5-kDa cut-off membrane) overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. The resulting solution of BpUreG was concentrated by using 5-kDa cut-off membrane Amicon and Centricon ultrafiltration units (Millipore), to a final volume of 5 ml, and centrifuged (15 min at 14,000 × g) to remove the precipitated material. The resulting solution was loaded onto a Superdex 75 XK 26/60 column conditioned with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm DTT. BpUreG was eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml min-1, and the purified protein, amounting to ∼50 mg per liter of culture, was concentrated to 2.5 mg ml-1 and stored at -80 °C. In the case of His-tagged BpUreG, the supernatant after pellet separation was loaded onto a column containing 8 ml of the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow affinity resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm imidazole, washed with 30 ml of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and eluted using the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. Protein purity, as well as the molecular mass of BpUreG in denaturing conditions, was estimated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), by using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II apparatus. Proteins were separated on 15% (w/v) acrylamide-bisacrylamide separating gels that were stained using either Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver staining. Protein concentration was measured by using a Jasco 7800 spectro-photometer and a value for the extinction coefficient (ϵ280 = 10,810 m-1 cm-1) calculated from the amino acid sequence using the ProtParam web site (au.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). This value is in good agreement with that obtained by using the Bio-Rad assay that is based on the Bradford colorimetric method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Protein Sequence Determination—All reagents, solvents and instruments were obtained from Applied Biosystems. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed in the gas-pulsed liquid phase using a model 476A protein sequencer with a micro-reaction chamber and an on-line high pressure liquid chromatography system for phenylthiohydantoin analysis. Absorbance was monitored at 269 nm. C-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a Procise 494C protein sequencer using C-terminal sequencing chemistry (37Boyd V.L. Bozzini M. Zon G. Noble R.L. Mattaliano R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 38Samyn B. Van der Hardeman K. Eycken J. Van Beeumen J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Prior to this analysis, the sample was adsorbed on a Prosorb sample preparation cartridge and, after subsequent washes with MilliQ-filtered water, treated with 200 mm phenylisocyanate in acetonitrile under basic conditions (124 mm diisopropylethylamine/acetonitrile) in order to modify the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residues into stable phenylureas. The alkylated thiohydantoin (ATH)-amino acids were analyzed on-line using a thermostated (38 °C) C18 reverse-phase column (2.1 × 220 mm, 5 μm). A linear gradient with a flow rate of 300 μl min-1 was formed using a 140C microgradient system with the following solvents: solvent A, 35 mm sodium acetate buffer, 3.5% tetrahydrofuran/MQ water, and solvent B, 100% acetonitrile. The ATH-amino acid derivatives were monitored using a 785A absorbance detector set at 254 nm, and quantified relative to a 100 pmol of ATH-amino acid standard. The methyl naphthylthiohydantoin amino acid standards were obtained from the supplier. Mass Spectrometry—All mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass), interfaced to a chip-based nano-ESI source (NanoMate100, Advion Biosciences). The mass spectra were processed using MassLynx version 3.1 software of Micromass. Before analysis, the buffer was changed to 50 mm NH4 acetate, pH 6.5. The denatured protein (1 μm) was measured in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. For native measurements, the protein (5 μm) was kept in 50 mm NH4 acetate, pH 6.5. Acquisition conditions were a spraying voltage of 1.5 (denatured protein) or 1.7 kV (native protein), gas pressure of 0.3 pounds/square inch, and an acquisition time of 3 (denatured protein) or 10 min (native protein) across an m/z range of 500–3000. Hydrodynamic Properties—The molecular mass and hydrodynamic radius of the native protein were estimated by standard size exclusion chromatography. A small amount (100 μl, 2.5 mg/ml) of the purified protein solution was applied to a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 FPLC column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1 in order to estimate the apparent hydrodynamic volume of the purified protein. The column was calibrated using an Amersham Biosciences low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit. Absolute estimates of molecular mass and hydrodynamic radius of BpUreG were determined using a combination of size exclusion chromatography, multiple angle light scattering (MALS), and quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). BpUreG (100 μl, 2.5 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl was loaded onto an S-200 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was connected downstream to a multiangle laser light (690.0 nm) scattering DAWN EOS photometer (Wyatt Technology). Quasi-elastic (dynamic) light scattering data were collected at a 90° angle by using a Wyatt-QELS device. The concentration of the eluted protein was determined using a refractive index detector (Optilab DSP, Wyatt). Values of 0.185 for the refractive index increment (dn/dc) and 1.330 for the solvent refractive index were used. Molecular weights were determined from a Zimm plot. Data were analyzed using the Astra 4.90.07 software (Wyatt Technology), following the manufacturer's indications. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The CD spectra of BpUreG and its His-tagged analogue were measured at 20 °C, using a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter flushed with N2, and a cuvette with 0.01-cm path length. The buffer was 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The spectra were registered from 190 to 300 nm at 0.2-nm intervals. Ten spectra were accumulated at room temperature and averaged to achieve an appropriate signal-to-noise ratio. The spectrum of the buffer was subtracted. The secondary structure composition of BpUreG was evaluated with the tool available on the Dichroweb server of the Centre for Protein and Membrane Structure and Dynamics, www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb/html/home.html (39Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) using the reference sets 4 and 7. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra of 15N-enriched KaUreG and His-tagged BpUreG were recorded at pH 8.0 and 298 K on a Bruker Avance 800 spectrometer operating at 800.13 MHz. The KaUreG spectrum was recorded using a 5-mm reverse detection probe on a 1-mM sample, whereas the spectrum of His-tagged BpUreG was obtained using a TXI cryoprobe on a 0.45-mM sample. The spectrum of BpUreG isolated from inclusion bodies was recorded on a 0.45-mm 15N-enriched sample at pH 8.0 and 298 K using a Bruker DRX Avance 500 spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz and equipped with a TXO cryoprobe. 1H,15N-HSQC spectra were acquired using sensitivity improvement (40Palmer A.G.I.

Relaxation delays (including acquisition time) in the range 0.9–1.2 s were employed. Matrices of 1024 × 256 points or 2048 × 128 points were acquired and transformed into 1024 × 512 or 2048 × 512 points. Measurement of GTPase Activity—GTP hydrolyzing activity was measured using a colorimetric method. The reaction mixture, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.075 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,2mm GTP, and 5 μm BpUreG, in the absence or presence of 25 μm ZnSO4, was incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (90 μl) were removed at different incubation times and added to 30 μl of a 35% trichloroacetic acid/water solution. Phosphate concentration was determined by the malachite green assay (43Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Metal Binding Experiments—In all operations, care was taken to avoid exogenous metal contamination. Ni2+ and Zn2+ nitrate salts solutions were prepared starting from ICP 1000 ppm standard solutions (CPI International) diluted to 1 mm with buffer A, containing NaCl 0.15 m. E"
https://openalex.org/W1970382145,Measurements of the age difference between coexisting benthic and planktic foraminifera from western equatorial Pacific deep-sea cores suggest that during peak glacial time the radiocarbon age of water at 2-kilometers depth was no greater than that of today. These results make unlikely suggestions that a slowdown in deep-ocean ventilation was responsible for a sizable fraction of the increase of the ratio of carbon-14 ( 14 C) to carbon in the atmosphere and surface ocean during glacial time. Comparison of 14 C ages for coexisting wood and planktic foraminifera from the same site suggests that the atmosphere to surface ocean 14 C to C ratio difference was not substantially different from today's.

Infection by RSV leads to an extended inflammatory response, characterized by the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8). Activation of ERK MAP kinase is required for both RSV-induced inflammation and the extended survival of infected cells. In this study, we analyzed the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in RSV activation of ERK. We demonstrate for the first time that RSV activates EGFR in lung epithelial cells. Activation of EGFR results in increased ERK activity, contributing to both the inflammatory response (IL-8 release) and prolonging the survival of RSV-infected cells. Inhibition of EGFR with siRNA decreased both ERK activation and IL-8 production after RSV. In analyzing the effect of EGFR activation on survival of RSV-infected cells, we found that EGFR activation by RSV resulted in ERK-dependent alterations in the balance of pro- versus anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins. RSV altered the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins (increased BclxL and decreased BimEL) increasing the relative amount of pro-survival proteins. This occurred in an EGFR-dependent manner. This study supports an important role for EGFR activity in the lifespan and inflammatory potential of RSV-infected epithelial cells.

Early severe RSV infections (bronchiolitis with hospitalization) cause long-term morbidity and mortality by increasing the risk for recurrent wheezing and asthma symptoms throughout childhood (3Stein R.T.

RSV is found ubiquitously in the environment. It is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae. Entry into the host cell (primarily the respiratory epithelium) is by cell surface fusion. Eleven genes and their encoded proteins have been identified for RSV. Infection of lung epithelial cells leads to viral replication and induction of an inflammatory response characterized by the production of chemokines and cytokines. In our previous work, we have shown that ERK signaling pathways are involved in both inflammation and epithelial cell survival in RSV-infected cells (4Mastronarde J.G. He B. Monick M.M. Mukaida N.

This study demonstrates for the first time that RSV infection activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and that EGFR activation is linked to ERK activity. EGFR was first described as the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and since then has been shown to respond to a diverse array of ligands leading to a diverse set of outcomes (11Leu T.H. Maa M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s28-s38Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). EGFR is a membrane-bound glycoprotein with an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic domain that following activation possesses tyrosine kinase activity (12Miller W.E. Raab-Traub N. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 453-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Though originally described as the receptor for EGF, more recent data have demonstrated EGFR activation by other extracellular ligands (TGFα, amphiregulin, epiregulin, HBEGF, betacellulin). These transmembrane proligands are cleaved and released into the extracellular milieu by matrix metalloproteases (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase family (ADAMs)) leading to activation of EGFR (13Argast G.M.

There are, however, other viruses that interact with EGFR. Some viruses are known to encode viral homologues of EGFR pathway genes, including a constitutively active EGFR, v-ErbB, encoded by avian erythroblastosis retrovirus (AE) (26Downward J. Yarden Y.

Other viruses, such as hepatitis B viruses and Epstein-Barr virus encode proteins that increase levels of human EGFR (27Miller W.E. Earp H.S. Raab-Traub N. J.

Our study demonstrates the novel finding that RSV activates endogenous EGFR, leading to delayed apoptosis and increased inflammatory response in infected epithelial cells.

We have found a requirement for ERK activation in RSV-induced IL-8 production (8Chen W. Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. Exp. Lung Res. 1999; 26: 13-26Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that ERK activation plays an important role in prolonged survival of RSV-infected airway epithelial cells (10Monick M.M. Cameron K. Powers L.S. Butler N.S. McCoy D. Mallampalli R.K. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; Google Scholar). It is not entirely clear how RSV activates ERK. However, our previous studies supply some of the pieces. We have shown that there is differential use of protein kinase C isoforms upstream of ERK at various times after infection (7Monick M.M. Staber J.M. Thomas K.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have also shown that at late times after infection, RSV-induced ERK requires activation of sphingosine kinase and generation of S1P (10Monick M.M. Cameron K. Powers L.S. Butler N.S. McCoy D. Mallampalli R.K. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that a proximal event in RSV-induced ERK activity is activation of EGFR. Moreover, we demonstrate that the EGFR-linked ERK activation plays an important role in extended survival of infected epithelial cells by altering the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members. RSV induces apoptosis of infected cells. We have shown previously that activation of ERK delays the normal viral-induced apoptotic response (10Monick M.M. Cameron K. Powers L.S. Butler N.S. McCoy D. Mallampalli R.K. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; Google Scholar). In examining the role of EGFR in RSV-induced apoptosis, this study demonstrates novel ERK-dependent effects on Bcl2 family members. Mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated via the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family, which are divided into three classes based on their Bcl2 homology domains (BH1–4). Anti-apoptotic members (Bcl2 and BclxL) contain four BH domains. The two classes of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins are divided by function and number of BH domains. Bax-like proteins (including Bax and Bak) contain multiple BH domains and are physically responsible for increased mitochondrial membrane permeability. BH3-only Bcl2 proteins include Bad, Bim, and Bid. The BH3-only proteins play a role in facilitating the increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability caused by Bax and Bak (34Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). We found that RSV infection results in a decrease in the amounts of the BH3-only protein, BimEL. The role of Bim regulation in virally infected epithelial cells has not previously been studied. Bim is regulated transcriptionally, but more importantly it is actively degraded by the proteosome following phosphorylation by ERK (35Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 36Reginato M.J. Mills K.R. Paulus J.K. Lynch D.K. Sgroi D.C. Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S.

There have been no previous studies demonstrating viral subversion of the normal apoptotic process via an ERK-dependent effect on BimEL. In summary, we evaluated the role of EGFR in RSV-infected lung epithelial cells. We found that infection with RSV caused activation and internalization of EGFR. Our data suggest that the EGFR activation is via RSV-dependent cleavage of a membrane bound EGFR ligand. We found that RSV induced membrane localized ADAM protease activity, release of amphiregulin, and MMP-dependent IL-8 production. EGFR activity was required for RSV-induced ERK activity, which is necessary for both optimal RSV-induced inflammation and prolonged cell survival. Inhibition of EGFR, by a chemical inhibitor, blocking antibody or siRNA, resulted in a decreased inflammatory response (IL-8 release) and premature death of virally infected cells. The anti-apoptotic effect of EGFR in RSV-infected cells was at least partially caused by an ERK-dependent effect on the balance of pro- versus anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins. This is the first time that RSV has been shown to activate EGFR (contributing to the inflammatory response), and the first time that ERK-dependent modulation of Bcl-2 proteins (downstream of EGFR) has been shown to play a role in sustained survival of RSV-infected epithelial cells. Materials—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. Protease inhibitors were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies to Akt1 (sc-1618), ERK2 (sc-154), GFP (sc-9996), TNFR1 (sc-7895), and Bcl-xL (sc-7195) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and EGFR (Tyr1068) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), 9101, 9271, and 2234, respectively. Also from Cell Signaling were antibodies to EGFR (2232) and cleaved PARP (9541). Antibody to Bim (AAP-330) was obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada). Antibody to β-actin (A-5316) was obtained from Sigma. Antibody to RSV (B65860G) was obtained from Biodesign International (Saco, ME). Nitrocellulose, ECL, and ECL Plus were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated developing antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Epithelial Cell Culture and Viral Infection—A549 lung epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamicin. For infection, cells at ∼80% confluence were treated with human RSV, strain A-2 (moi of 5). Viral stocks were obtained from Advanced Biotechnologies Inc (Columbia, MD). Because of a report of possible adenovirus contamination in some RSV stocks (38Cameron R. Buck C. Merrill D. Luttick A. Virus Res. 2003; 92: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we tested our stock for adenovirus by PCR and found it to be completely free of adenoviral contamination. The initial stock (1 × 109 TCID50) was aliquoted and kept frozen at -135 °C. A fresh aliquot was thawed for each experiment. The virus was never refrozen. Primary Tracheobronchial Epithelial Cells (hTBEs)—All protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained as described previously (39Joseph T.D. Look D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47136-47142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells were isolated from tracheal and bronchial mucosa by enzymatic dissociation and cultured in laboratory of carcinogenesis (LHC)-8e medium on plates coated with collagen/albumin for study up to passage 10. For infection, cells at ∼80% confluency were treated with human RSV, strain A-2 (moi of 5). Cell Survival Analysis—For analysis of cell survival, A549 epithelial cells (seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and infected with RSV (moi of 5)) were cultured alone or with pathway inhibitors (ERK, U0126 at 10 μm) (EGFR, AG1478 at 30uM) for the described times. Triplicate cultures were performed on all experiments. After the incubation period, the cells were stained with ethidium homodimer (EthD-1, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 8 μm and images obtained of both bright field and fluorescence using a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a Qimaging RETICA 1300 digital camera and imaging system. After obtaining images, the percentage of EthD-1-positive cells was determined. Quantification was by direct cell count. 200 cells were counted from a minimum of four different fields. Average viability was determined and statistics performed using Graphpad software. Whole Cell Protein Isolation—Whole cell protein was obtained by lysing the cells on ice for 20 min, in 300 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, with added protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 protease minitab (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml and 100 μl of 100× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (524625, Calbiochem)/10 ml. The lysates were sonicated for 20 s, kept at 4 °C for 30 min, spun at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant saved. Protein determinations were made using a protein measurement kit (Protein Assay, 500-0006) from Bio-Rad. Cell lysates were stored at -70° until use. Biotin Labeling of Cell Surface Proteins—A549 cells were treated with the specified conditions and time. Adherent cells were washed three times with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The adherent cells were then incubated with 5 ml of biotin label (Pierce EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin 21217) at 1 mg/ml for 45 min at 4 °C. The adherent cells were then washed three times with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Lysates were scraped into 500 μl of cell lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Protein Assay. Immunoprecipitation of Cellular Proteins and Biotin-labeled Proteins—For immunoprecipitation using a specific antibody, lysates were incubated with the antibody of interest (BclxL) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and then Western sample buffer added directly to the pellet (see below). To isolate biotin-labeled membrane proteins, 1 mg of protein was incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen, 69203). The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer, and the supernatant removed after final wash. The beads were suspended in 50 μl of 2× sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The beads were spun down and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blot protocol was followed as described below. Western Analysis—Western analysis for the presence of particular proteins or for phosphorylated forms of proteins was performed as described previously (5Thomas K.W. Monick M.M. Staber J.M. Yarovinsky T. Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 492-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of protein was mixed 1:1 with 2× sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1.25 m Tris, pH 6.8) and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and run at 110 V for 2 h. Cell proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with a Bio-Rad semidry transfer system, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal loading of the protein groups on the blots was evaluated using Ponceaus S (Sigma), a staining solution designed for staining proteins on nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose was then blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with the primary antibody at dilutions of 1:500 to 1:2000 overnight. The blots were washed four times with TTBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (1:5000 to 1:20,000). Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate, ECL Plus, or ECL (Amersham Biosciences). An autoradiograph was obtained with exposure times of 10 s to 2 min. Protein levels were quantified using a FluorS scanner and Quantity One software for analysis (Bio-Rad). The data were analyzed and statistics performed using Graphpad software. Densitometry is expressed as fold increase (experimental value/control value). Transfection Protocol—A549 cells were plated in regular medium. The next day the medium was changed to 10% Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) without antibiotic. The cells were allowed to equilibrate overnight and transfected the next day with the plasmid EGFR-GFP using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's directions. A vector for expression of the EGFR with a C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag was constructed by recombinant PCR amplifications of the human EGFR cDNA sequence and the GFP cassette in the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The EGFR and GFP cDNA sequences were ligated in-frame and cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). All amplified sequence elements were validated by DNA sequencing. The next day, cells were infected with RSV and at appropriate time points assayed by confocal microscopy or by biotinylation of membrane proteins and Western analysis using an anti-GFP antibody. Confocal Microscopy—Subconfluent cultures of A549 cells in Lab-Tek® II chamber slides were transfected with EGFR-GFP and then infected with RSV. For EGFR-GFP subcellular localization analysis, cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cell nuclei were counterstained with To-Pro-3 nuclear stain (Molecular Probes). Golgi were stained using a mouse antibody against human golgin-97 (Molecular Probes), followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-568-conjugated secondary antibody. Slide chambers were cover-slipped using Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope at the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facility. Ten random fields (512 × 512 pixels each) were collected for each experimental group. ADAM Activity Assay—ADAM protease activity was performed using a fluorogenic substrate specific for cleavage by ADAM 9, ADAM 10, or ADAM 17. Briefly, A549 cells were cultured with RSV (moi of 5) for various time points. Membrane proteins were harvested by lysing cells in a lysis buffer without detergent (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl,). The lysis buffer contained a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Cat. 524625 EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and 1 tablet/10 ml lysis buffer of protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science) (cat. 11 836 170 001). The phosphatase inhibitors (EDTA-free) were specific for serine and cysteine proteases and specifically did not inhibit metallo and aspartic proteases. Following sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C 40,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was considered cytosol and the pellet the membrane fraction. The pellet was then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, allowed to sit on ice for 30 min with frequent vortexing, and the insoluble fraction removed by centrifuging for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Protein concentrations of each membrane sample were normalized such that 5 μl equaled 25 μg of protein. To perform the assay, a black 96-well fluorescent plate was loaded with the following: 1) Buffer blank, 110 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 9, 2.5 μm ZnCl2, 0.005% Brij35). 2) Substrate blank, 10 μl of buffer, 100 μl of substrate (2.5 μl of fluorogenic Peptide Substrate III (Mca-Pro-Leu-Gln-Ala-Val-Dpa-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-NH2) from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, cat. ES003)/ml of buffer described above (final concentration of substrate is 10 μm). 3) Standards run in duplicate, 10 μl of purified ADAM 17 (cat. 930-ADB, R&D Systems) and 100 μl of substrate. Standards were run from 100 ng/well to 3.1 ng/well. 4) Samples run in duplicate, 5 μl of sample (25 μg of protein) and 100 μl of substrate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h. Fluorescence was read on a 96-well fluorescent plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Victor 2, Wellesley, MA). Fluorescence was read with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 440 nm. Sample readings routinely fell within the values of 12–100 ng of purified ADAM 17 and are presented as fold increase (sample value/control value). EGFR siRNA—Endogenous EGFR in A549 cells was depleted using standard siRNA techniques. Briefly, A549 cells were seeded into 6-well plates, when 70% confluent, they were transfected with either control siRNA or EGFR siRNA (5 μl/well of 20 μm siRNA solution for a final reaction of 100 nm) (both from Upstate Biotechnologies, cat. 60-015). siImporter siRNA transfection system"

Although the H1HR has been shown to undergo desensitization in multiple cell types, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of H1HR signaling are poorly defined. To address this issue, we examined the effects of wild type and mutant G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) on the phosphorylation and signaling of human H1HR in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of GRK2 promoted H1HR phosphorylation in intact HEK293 cells and completely inhibited inositol phosphate production stimulated by H1HR, whereas GRK5 and GRK6 had lesser effects on H1HR phosphorylation and signaling. Interestingly, catalytically inactive GRK2 (GRK2-K220R) also significantly attenuated H1HR-mediated inositol phosphate production, as did an N-terminal fragment of GRK2 previously characterized as a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein for Gαq/11. Disruption of this RGS function in holo-GRK2 by mutation (GRK2-D110A) partially reversed the quenching effect of GRK2, whereas deletion of both the kinase activity and RGS function (GRK2-D110A/K220R) effectively relieved the inhibition of inositol phosphate generation. To evaluate the role of endogenous GRKs on H1HR regulation, we used small interfering RNAs to selectively target GRK2 and GRK5, two of the primary GRKs expressed in HEK293 cells. A GRK2-specific small interfering RNA effectively reduced GRK2 expression and resulted in a significant increase in histamine-promoted calcium flux. In contrast, knockdown of GRK5 expression was without effect on H1HR signaling. These findings demonstrate that GRK2 is the principal kinase mediating H1 histamine receptor desensitization in HEK293 cells and suggest that rapid termination of H1HR signaling is mediated by both the kinase activity and RGS function of GRK2.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; H1HR, H1 histamine receptor; IP, inositol phosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SC, scrambled. comprise a superfamily of seven transmembrane-spanning receptors that transduce extracellular signals into discrete intracellular signals to regulate cell functions. GPCR signaling is regulated not only by ligand availability but also by complex mechanisms that regulate receptor responsiveness to their cognate stimuli. The regulatory process of desensitization utilizes a wide variety of regulatory proteins that interact with a given GPCR to render it hyporesponsive to agonists. For the majority of GPCRs, desensitization caused by agonist exposure is mediated by one or more members of a family of GPCR kinases (GRKs) that phosphorylate the agonist-occupied receptor and promote the subsequent binding of arrestin molecules (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Arrestin binding to GPCRs disrupts receptor activation of heterotrimeric G proteins and can also initiate the process of receptor internalization, which can lead to either GPCR recycling or degradation (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, studies to date clearly demonstrate that the propensity for a particular GPCR to be regulated by second messenger-dependent kinases, GRKs, or arrestins is receptor-specific. The H1 histamine receptor (H1HR) mediates the functional effects of histamine in multiple cell types through activation of the Gq/11 heterotrimeric G protein and its downstream effector phospholipase C (PLC). Stimulation of the H1HR-Gq/11-PLC pathway results in the synthesis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol (4Leurs R. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 413-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), which in turn stimulate an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). These histamine-induced intracellular messengers promote diverse functions in multiple cell types, including smooth muscle and nonsmooth muscle contraction (4Leurs R. Smit M.J. Timmerman H.

However, beyond a basic appreciation that the H1HR desensitizes and internalizes, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which these processes are mediated. In the present study, we examined the roles of PKC and GRKs in agonist-specific H1HR desensitization, and assessed the relative contribution of distinct functional domains within GRK2 responsible for terminating H1HR signaling.

Plasmid Construction—To eliminate the promoter sequence, the 5′-terminal region of H1HR in pcDNA3-H1HR was amplified by PCR using two oligos, 5′-CGGGGGTACCCGGGCACCATG AGCCTCCCCAATTCCTCC-3′ and 5′-TAACATCTGATCCTCTGATATCTCGC-3′, and cloned back into the KpnI sites of the original pcDNA3-H1HR construct. The open reading frame of pcDNA3-H1HR was also subcloned in-frame into pcDNA3 containing a 5′-HA epitope tag cassette (20Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

All constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct orientation and to ensure that no spurious mutations were introduced. Transient Transfection and H1HR Radioligand Binding—HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 IU/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells grown in 100-mm dishes to subconfluence were transfected with 5 μg of wild type or HA-tagged pcDNA3-H1HR using FuGENE-6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells expressing H1HRs were harvested by scraping into ice-cold 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and recovered by a 10-min centrifugation at 500 × g. The cells were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer, and the homogenate (0.1–0.3 mg of protein/assay tube) was incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors and 0.5–16 nm [3H]pyrilamine (25Hill S.J. Young J.M. Marrian D.H. Nature. 1977; 270: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The binding reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) followed by rapid filtration through What-man GF/C filters in a cell harvester followed by three washes with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer. Nonspecific binding of [3H]pyrilamine was determined as binding in the presence of 20 μm doxepin, a specific antagonist for H1HR. Triplicate samples were assayed for each point. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay kit. Transfection of GRK siRNAs—siRNA transfection of the GRK2, GRK5, and SC RNA duplexes (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was performed in HEK293 cells at ∼90% confluence. The cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes (600 pmol of siRNA in a 10-cm dish, final concentration of 40 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions and were analyzed for GRK expression and calcium flux 3 days after transfection. In some experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA, split after 6 h, transfected a second time after 24 h, and then analyzed 4 days after the initial transfection. All siRNAs were 21-nucleotide duplexes and had the following sequences: siRNA-GRK2, 5′-GAU CUU CGA CUC AUA CAU CdTdT-3′; siRNA-GRK5, 5′-GAU CCU CUG CGG CUU AGA AdTdT-3′; and siRNA-SC, 5′-GCG CGC UUU GUA GGA UUC GdTdT-3′. Receptor Phosphorylation—HEK293 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3-HA-H1HR and 5 μg of pcDNA3-GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6 or vector control. The following day, the cells were seeded into two 10-cm dishes for phosphorylation analysis and one 6-cm dish for radioligand binding (to confirm equivalent expression). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed twice in serum-free and sodium phosphate-free DMEM followed by incubation in the same medium for 1 h. The cells were subsequently labeled with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h and then incubated with or without 100 μm histamine for 10 min. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4) and then scraped into 0.8 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The lysate was solubilized for 1 h on a rocker and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant supernatant was isolated and precleared by the addition of 50 μl of an ∼50% slurry of protein A-agarose beads with gentle rocking for 50 min. Sixteen μl of anti-HA polyclonal antibody was then added to the precleared supernatant and incubated for 1 h; 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added, and the suspension was incubated on a rocker overnight. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation the following day and washed 4 times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at -80 °C. Inositol Phosphate Production—Measurement of inositol phosphate (IP) production in cells was as described previously (21Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, sub-confluent HEK293 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-H1HR and GRK constructs using FuGENE-6. The total amount of transfected plasmids was adjusted to 10 μg by the addition of pcDNA3 vector. The following day, the cells were seeded onto a 24-well dish and labeled with 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 17–22 h in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in DMEM. The cells were washed two times and incubated with inositol-free DMEM containing 5 mm LiCl for 30 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with various concentrations of histamine for 30 min. The medium was removed, and the cells were lysed with 1 ml of 20 mm formic acid for 30 min at 4 °C and then neutralized with 130 μl of 3% ammonium hydroxide. The inositol fractions were separated using Dowex AGX (100–200 mesh) columns, counted, and data reported as described previously (21Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M.

Measurement of Ca2+ Flux—HEK293 cells transfected with SC, GRK2, or GRK5 siRNAs were harvested with Cellstripper (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at ∼5 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose) containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then loaded with 3 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester derivative (Fura-2/AM) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed once in Hanks' solution, resuspended in Hanks', incubated at room temperature for 15 min, washed twice in Hanks' solution, and then resuspended in Hanks' at a concentration of ∼3 × 107 cells/ml. A typical experiment contained 1.5 × 106 cells/1.6 ml in a quartz cuvette and stimulation with 1–1000 μm histamine. Receptor specificity studies were done by measuring the calcium flux stimulated by 100 μm histamine in the presence of H1-, H2-, or H3-specific antagonists. Calcium flux was measured using excitation at 340 and 380 nm in a fluorescence spectrometer (LS55, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Calibration was performed using 0.1% Triton X-100 for total fluorophore release and 10 mm EGTA to chelate free Ca2+. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using a fluorescence spectrometer measurement program as described previously (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pharmacological and Functional Properties of HA-tagged H1HRs—Our initial series of studies focused on characterizing H1HRs transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. [3H]Pyrilamine binding assays demonstrated high affinity binding of recombinant H1HRs expressed in HEK293 cells (Kd = 1.5 ± 0.8 nm, Bmax = 4.0 ± 1.3 pmol/mg protein; n = 3), similar to previously reported values (27Wieland K. Laak A.M. Smit M.J. Kuhne R. Timmerman H. Leurs R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29994-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Kd and Bmax values obtained for HA-H1HR (Kd = 0.8 ± 0.1 nm, Bmax = 5.5 ± 0.5 pmol/mg protein; n = 3) were similar to those for untagged H1HR. Histamine-stimulated IP production in HEK293 cells expressing H1HR (EC50 = 69 ± 13 nm, fold basal increase = 5.2 ± 1.3) and HA-H1HR (EC50 = 78 ± 16 nm, fold basal increase = 3.9 ± 0.3) was also comparable. Thus, the HA tag at the N terminus of the H1HR does not appear to affect H1HR expression, ligand binding, or signaling properties. Role of GRKs in H1HR Phosphorylation—To assess the ability of the H1HR to undergo agonist-promoted phosphorylation, HEK293 cells were transfected with or without HA-H1HR and loaded with [32P]orthophosphate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The HA-H1HR migrated as a broad band of 70–100 kDa, as assessed by Western blotting, using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1A, left panel). The H1HR also appeared to undergo agonist-promoted phosphorylation, as treatment with 100 μm histamine for 10 min resulted in increased phosphorylation of an ∼70–90-kDa protein in immunoprecipitates from HA-H1HR transfected cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). This protein was not present in mock-transfected cells, verifying that it was the HA-tagged H1HR (Fig. 1A, right panel). Note that the low level of agonist-independent phosphorylation appears to be mediated by endogenous PKC, because it was inhibited by treating the cells with the selective PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (data not shown). To assess whether GRKs might contribute to H1HR phosphorylation, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with HA-H1HR and either vector, GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the H1HR was significantly enhanced by co-expression of GRK2 (180% increase), whereas co-expression of GRK5 or GRK6 promoted a significantly lesser (50 and 80% increase, respectively) degree of agonist-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, all three GRKs also led to a mobility shift in the diffuse H1HR band observed in the absence of GRK co-expression to a much sharper band of ∼90 kDa (Fig. 1B). Similar agonist-promoted mobility shifts have been observed with other GPCRs (28Stadel J.M. Nambi P. Shorr R.G. Sawyer D.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GRK Function in Quenching H1HR-mediated Inositol Phosphate Production—We next examined the capacity and functional properties of GRKs in quenching H1HR signaling. Co-expression of GRK2 with HA-H1HR completely inhibited H1HR-mediated IP production (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous studies demonstrating the ability of GRK2 to effect rapid agonist-specific desensitization of numerous other GPCRs (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Interestingly, catalytically inactive GRK2 (GRK2-K220R) (31Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), previously shown as being capable of acting in a dominant negative fashion to reverse desensitization of some GPCRs (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), also significantly attenuated histamine-stimulated IP production, suggesting that the kinase activity of GRK2 is partially dispensable in its ability to quench H1HR signaling. Subsequent experiments were performed to explore how a catalytically inactive GRK2 quenches H1HR signaling and to clarify the role of discrete GRK2 functional domains in regulating H1HR signaling. Carman et al. (21Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

We therefore tested the capacity of this N-terminal functional domain to inhibit H1HR-mediated IP production. Co-expression of GRK2-RGS and H1HR resulted in ∼60% inhibition of histamine-stimulated IP production (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the RGS function of GRK2 can effectively inhibit H1HR signaling. Conversely, co-expression of GRK2-CT, a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain construct of GRK2 known to sequester Gβγ subunits necessary for activation of endogenous GRK2 (32Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Carman C.V. Barak L.S. Chen C. Liu-Chen L-Y. Onorato J.J. Kennedy S.P.

This result is similar to recent findings on the metabotropic glutamate 1 receptor (34Dhami G.K. Anborgh P.H. Dale L.B. Sterne-Marr R. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and supports a role for endogenous GRK2 in the regulation of H1HR signaling in HEK293 cells. The involvement of the RGS domain of GRK2 in H1HR regulation was subsequently examined by employing a GRK2 mutant (GRK2-D110A) that lacks the ability to interact with Gαq (22Sterne-Marr R. Tesmer J.J.G. Day P.W. Stracquatanio R.P. Cilente J-A.E. O'Connor K.E. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6050-6058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Co-expression of GRK2-D110A significantly inhibited H1HR-mediated IP production (>80%; Fig. 2C) to an extent even greater than that observed for GRK2-RGS (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the RGS function of GRK is at least partially dispensable in the ability of GRK2 to inhibit H1HR signaling. Co-expression of GRK2-R106A, which also lacks the ability to interact with Gαq (22Sterne-Marr R. Tesmer J.J.G. Day P.W. Stracquatanio R.P. Cilente J-A.E. O'Connor K.E. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6050-6058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), inhibited H1HR-mediated IP production in a manner identical to that affected by GRK2-D110A (data not shown). To assess the requirement for kinase and RGS function in GRK2-mediated desensitization of the H1HR, we introduced the D110A mutation into catalytically inactive GRK2 to generate a construct lacking both kinase and RGS function (GRK2-K220R/D110A). Co-expression of GRK2-K220R/D110A with H1HR had a relatively weak inhibitory effect on IP production at low histamine concentrations but approached 40–50% at saturating concentrations (Fig. 2C). A possible explanation for this residual efficacy of GRK2-K220R/D110A is the steric hindrance of receptor-Gαq coupling caused by GRK2-K220R/D110A binding to H1HR. By binding to the activated receptor, exogenous GRK mutants not only block access of endogenous GRK to the receptor, but potentially block receptor-Gα interactions. Because this latter function might be considered experimentally artifactual, we reduced the levels of co-expressed GRK constructs by reducing the concentration of their respective plasmid DNAs in our transfection protocol. Under these conditions, both GRK2 and GRK2-K220R largely retained their ability to inhibit H1HR-mediated IP production (Fig. 2D). However, lower levels of GRK2-K220R/D110A expression reduced the inhibitory effect of this construct to ∼20% (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that steric hindrance of H1HR-Gαq coupling probably contributes to inhibition of H1HR signaling under experimental conditions, although under physiologic conditions, GRK2 likely regulates H1HR signaling via its kinase and RGS activities. We next examined the capacity of other kinases to effect H1HR desensitization. We first examined the effects of wild type GRK5 and GRK6, both shown to weakly phosphorylate H1HR (Fig. 1). Co-expression of GRK6 with H1HR had a modest effect on histamine-stimulated IP production, whe"
https://openalex.org/W2089710269,"Chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) is excreted by the majority of S. aureus strains and is a potent inhibitor of C5a- and formylated peptide-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we reported that CHIPS binds to the C5a receptor (C5aR) and the formylated peptide receptor, thereby blocking activation by C5a and formylated peptides, respectively. The anaphylatoxin C5a plays an important role in host immunity and pathological inflammatory processes. For C5a a two-site binding model is proposed in which C5a initially binds the C5aR N terminus, followed by interaction of the C5a C-terminal tail with an effector domain on the receptor. We have shown here that CHIPS does not affect activation of the C5aR by a peptide mimic of the C5a C terminus. Moreover, CHIPS was found to bind human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing only the C5aR N terminus. Deletion and mutation experiments within this C5aR N-terminal expression system revealed that the binding site of CHIPS is contained in a short stretch of 9 amino acids (amino acids 10–18), of which the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, and 18 plus the glycine at position 12 are crucial. Binding studies with C5aR/C3aR and C5aR/IL8RA chimeras confirmed that CHIPS binds only to the C5aR N terminus without involvement of its extracellular loops. CHIPS may provide new strategies to block the C5aR, which may lead to the development of new C5aR antagonists.

Chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) 1The abbreviations used are: CHIPS, chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus; C5aR, C5a receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HEK, human embryonic kidney; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; APC, allophycocyanin; GaM-APC, APC-labeled goat-anti-mouse. is a potent and specific inhibitor of neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis toward the complement anaphylatoxin C5a and formylated peptides, like N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) (1De Haas C.J.

Via separate active sites within the protein, CHIPS binds directly to the C5a receptor (C5aR) and formylated peptide receptor, thereby blocking C5a- and fMLP-induced responses, respectively (3Haas P.J. De Haas C.J. Kleibeuker W. Poppelier M.J. Van Kessel K.P. Kruijtzer W.A. Liskamp R.M. Van Strijp J.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5704-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Postma B.

These receptors both belong to the family of G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptors. Detection of invading bacteria by neutrophils, triggered via these receptors by formylated peptides and C5a, is considered one of the earliest innate recognition events (5Yang D. Chertov O. Oppenheim J.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 978-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that CHIPS production by S. aureus may prevent this early detection, thereby delaying the immune response. C5a and its receptor also play a pivotal role in many inflammatory diseases and diseases states, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, ischemiareperfusion injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (6Pellas T.C. Wennogle L.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 737-755PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the C5aR constitutes a potential drug target for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Activation of neutrophils by C5a elicits responses that include intracellular calcium mobilization and up-regulation of cell surface integrins such as CD11b, chemotaxis, aggregation, superoxide formation, and degranulation responses (6Pellas T.C. Wennogle L.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 737-755PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kirschfink M. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

For the binding of C5a to the C5aR, a two-site binding model is proposed in which the N-terminal core of C5a initially binds the N terminus of the C5aR, followed by interaction of the C-terminal tail of C5a with residues in the transmembrane bundle of the receptor, which is essential for activation of the receptor (10Siciliano S.J.

Gonnella N.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We investigated the binding site of CHIPS to the C5aR and tried to elucidate the mechanism by which CHIPS blocks C5a-induced responses. Earlier experiments showed that CHIPS inhibits binding of an anti-C5aR mAb directed against residues 15–21 of the N terminus of the C5aR, indicating that it binds the C5aR N terminus (1De Haas C.J. Veldkamp K.E. Peschel A. Weerkamp F. Van Wamel W.J. Heezius E.C. Poppelier M.J. Van Kessel K.P. Van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We have shown here that CHIPS does not inhibit the activation of the C5aR by a peptide analogue of the C5a C terminus, suggesting that CHIPS does not affect the activation site of the C5aR. Moreover, we have demonstrated binding of CHIPS to HEK293 cells expressing only the C5aR N terminus. Construction of several deletion and substitution mutants in this N-terminal C5aR expression model narrowed the CHIPS binding site down to residues 10–18, in which the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, and 18 and the glycine at position 12 play a crucial role. These findings were confirmed by mutagenesis studies in the whole C5aR. Moreover, construction of C5aR/IL8RA and C5aR/C3aR chimeras demonstrated that the extracellular loops of the C5aR are not involved in the binding of CHIPS. Our data could provide valuable information on the mechanism by which CHIPS blocks activation of the C5aR. Moreover, they may be used for the development of therapeutic agents that control the inflammatory response induced by C5a. Materials—Fluo-3AM (Fluo-3, acetoxymethyl ester) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Recombinant human C5a was obtained from Sigma. C5a C-terminal peptide ((Tyr65, Phe67) C5a-(65–74):YSFKDMQLGR) was purchased from Bachem Holding AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland. Recombinant CHIPS was expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated, and FITC-labeled (CHIPS-FITC) as described (1De Haas C.J. Veldkamp K.E. Peschel A. Weerkamp F. Van Wamel W.J. Heezius E.C. Poppelier M.J. Van Kessel K.P. Van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Intracellular Calcium Mobilization—C5a C-terminal peptide-induced intracellular calcium mobilization was measured in a flow cytometer as described before (1De Haas C.J. Veldkamp K.E. Peschel A. Weerkamp F. Van Wamel W.J. Heezius E.C. Poppelier M.J. Van Kessel K.P. Van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells, stably expressing the C5aR (U937/C5aR; generous gift from Dr. Eric Prossnitz, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque) were loaded with 2 μm Fluo-3AM in RPMI containing 0.05% human serum albumin (RPMI/0.05% HSA) for 20 min at room temperature under constant agitation, washed twice with buffer, and suspended to 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI/0.05% HSA. Subsequently, the cells were preincubated with or without 1–100 μg/ml CHIPS for 15 min at room temperature. Each sample of cells was first measured for ∼10 s to determine the basal fluorescence level. Next, concentrated C5a C-terminal peptide (final concentration 1 μm) was added and rapidly placed back in the sample holder to continue the measurement. As a positive control, human C5a (final concentration 1 × 10–10m) was used. Cells were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) gated on forward and side scatter to exclude dead cells and debris. Design of Human C5aR and C5aR N Terminus-expressing Plasmids—The complete open reading frame of the human C5aR, which resides on a single exon, was amplified by PCR using the sense primer 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGATGAACTCCTTCAATTATACC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GCTCTAGACTACACTGCCTGGGTCTTCT-3′. The sense and antisense primers contained EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively (underlined nucleotides). To confirm surface expression of the C5aR, an N-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK, included in the sense primer in bold nucleotides) was placed after the first methionine for detection by the anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma). An extra methionine was included directly after the FLAG tag to keep the N-terminal sequence intact. The amplification reaction was performed on human bone marrow QUICK-Clone cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated in the expressing plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). In addition, the complete open reading frame of the human IL8RA was cloned in the pcDNA3.1 plasmid in a similar way, using the sense primer 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGATGTCAAATATTACAGATCCACAG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGAGGTTGGAAGAGACATTG-3′. Finally, the complete open reading frame of the human C3aR was cloned in the pcDNA3.1 plasmid in a similar way using the sense primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGATGGCGTCTTTCTCTGCTGAGACC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GCTCTAGATCACACAGTTGTACTATTTC-3′. In this case, the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites were used for cloning in the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. The cloning of the DNA sequence encoding the first 38 amino acids of the human C5aR (C5aR N terminus) was performed by PCR using the sense primer 5′-TAGTGAAGATCTATGAACTCCTTCAATTATACCACCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AGTACCATCGATGATGTCTGGAACACGCAGCG-3′. The sense and antisense primers contained BglII and ClaI restriction sites, respectively (underlined nucleotides), permitting the cloning of the C5aR N-terminal sequence in the AccI- and BglII-digested-expressing plasmid pDISPLAY (Invitrogen). A hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope tag, present upstream of the C5aR N-terminal sequence allows detection of surface expression of the C5aR N-terminal protein by mAb 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science). The cloned complete C5aR and C5aR N-terminal sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis. In addition, the IL8RA N terminus was cloned in the pDISPLAY plasmid in a similar way using the sense primer 5′-TAGTGAAGATCTATGTCAAATATTACAGATCCACAGATGTG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AGTACCATCGATCTTGTTGAGTGTCTCAGTTTC-3′. PvuI-digested C5aR- and IL8RA-expressing pcDNA3.1 plasmids were used as templates for amplification of the C5aR and IL8RA N-terminal sequences, respectively. Construction of C5aR N Terminus Mutants and C5aR Chimeras— Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the C5aR N terminus in the complete C5aR (pcDNA3.1) and C5aR N terminus (pDISPLAY) expression system by overlap extension PCR (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Briefly, PvuI-digested C5aR-, IL8RA-, and C3aR-expressing pcDNA3.1 plasmids were used as templates for amplification of DNA fragments having overlapping ends using complementary primers and PCR. Specific mutations can be introduced by incorporating nucleotide changes into the overlapping primers. When the DNA fragments are mixed, denatured, and reannealed in a subsequent PCR reaction, the strands with matching sequences at their 3′-ends overlap and act as primers for each other. Simultaneous addition of the primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-end sequences of the desired mutated molecule results in amplification of the full-length PCR product that was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 or pDISPLAY plasmid as described. Furthermore, the following C5aR chimeras were constructed using the above PCR-based methodology. N-terminal exchange chimeras: CH-(1–37), in which amino acids 1–37 from the C5aR were substituted for amino acids 1–23 from the C3aR, and CH-(38–350), in which amino acids 38–350 from the C5aR were substituted for amino acids 24–482 from the C3aR. Extracellular loop exchange chimeras: CH-(90–117), in which amino acids 90–117 (loop 1) from the C5aR were substituted for amino acids 93–118 (loop 1) from the IL8RA; CH-(172–211), in which amino acids 172–211 (loop 2) from the C5aR were substituted for amino acids 172–211 (loop 2) from the IL8RA; and CH-(265–280), in which amino acids 265–280 (loop 3) from the C5aR were substituted for amino acids 400–415 (loop 3) from the C3aR. In some C5aR chimeras, an additional D10A mutation was constructed. Other constructed C5aR N terminus mutants consisted of deletions in the N-terminal 8, 13, or 18 amino acids, denominated as Δ1–8, Δ1–13, and Δ1–18, using normal PCR. Expression of the C5aR and C5aR N Terminus—The complete C5aR, C5aR mutants, and chimeras were expressed by transfection of the pcDNA3.1 plasmid, containing the open reading frame of the C5aR, in HEK293 cells. Therefore, HEK293 cells, maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), containing 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1mm sodium pyruvate, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10% fetal calf serum, were transfected in a 6-well plate with 3 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μl) according to the manufacturer's descriptions (Invitrogen). Two to three days after transfection the cells were collected with phosphate-buffered saline/trypsin, washed with RPMI/0.05% HSA, and incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 mAb and 3 μg/ml CHIPS-FITC and subsequently with 2 μg/ml APC-labeled goat-anti-mouse Igs (GaM-APC; Pharmingen). Cells were washed and assayed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur flow cytometer after addition of propidium iodide, for binding of CHIPS-FITC to the C5aR-expressing (GAM-APC-positive) and propidium iodide-negative (living) cells. For expression of the C5aR N terminus only and derived mutants, the pDISPLAY plasmid containing the C5aR N-terminal sequence (pDISPLAY/C5aR N terminus) encoding the first 38 amino acids was transfected in HEK293 cells as described above, except that for detection of CHIPS-FITC binding the cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-HA tag 12CA5 mAb instead of the anti-FLAG M2 mAb. Data are expressed as the percentage of CHIPS-FITC binding compared with the control wild type (WT) C5aR or WT C5aR N terminus. To correct the CHIPS-FITC binding for the transfection efficiency, the mean fluorescence of the GaM-APC-positive cells (transfection efficiency) of each expressed C5aR mutant was divided by the transfection efficiency of the expressed corresponding WT C5aR or WT C5aR N terminus (transfection efficiency correction number). Then, the mean fluorescence of the CHIPS-FITC binding to the GaM-APC-positive cells was divided by this transfection efficiency correction number. Finally, the CHIPS-FITC binding of the WT C5aR and WT C5aR N terminus was set on 100%. For constitutive expression of the C5aR N terminus, HEK293 cells were 72 h after transfection with the pDISPLAY/C5aR N terminus refed with culture medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in selection medium until individual surviving foci appeared. Foci were transferred to 48-well plates and expanded. Sublines were tested for expression of the C5aR N terminus as described above. Positive cells were subjected to another final round of subcloning by limiting dilution. Kd Determination Using HEK293 Cells Expressing the C5aR N Terminus—To determine the Kd of the binding of CHIPS to the C5aR N terminus, binding assays were performed as described (4Postma B. Poppelier M.J. van Galen J.C. Prossnitz E.R. Van Strijp J.A. De Haas C.J. Van Kessel K.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6994-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), using HEK293 cells constitutively expressing the pDISPLAY/C5aR N terminus. Briefly, buffer or 10 μm unlabeled CHIPS, 0.3–80 nm 125I-CHIPS, and HEK293 cells expressing the C5aR N terminus (1 × 107/ml) were added sequentially to a final volume of 100 μl. After 90 min of incubation at room temperature, 90 μl was applied to a 150-μl mixture of 20% olive oil/80% dibutylphthalate (Sigma) in a microsediment-winning 0.3-ml tube (Sarstedt, Newton, NC). To separate the cell-bound 125I-CHIPS from free 125I-CHIPS, the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 1800 × g, after which the tips of the tubes containing the cell pellet were cut and counted in a COBRA gamma counter (Packard Instrument Co.) for 5 min. Curves were fit to nonlinear regression analysis, and the Kd values were quantitated using the PRISM program (GraphPad Inc.). CHIPS Does Not Block Activation of the C5aR by a C5a C-terminal Peptide Analogue—Short peptide derivatives of the C5a C terminus possess agonist properties on the C5aR, initiating the same rapid mobilization of intracellular calcium as C5a (14Finch A.M.

Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We examined whether CHIPS could block the activation of the C5aR by a peptide mimic of the C terminus of C5a. To this end, we tested the calcium mobilization in U937/C5aR cells, with and without preincubation with CHIPS. Fig. 1A demonstrates that in U937/C5aR cells a ligand-specific calcium mobilization is elicited upon stimulation with C5a C-terminal peptide. Even at high concentrations (up to 100 μg/ml) CHIPS did not inhibit this activation. In contrast, activation of U937/C5aR cells with native C5a was totally blocked with just 1 μg/ml CHIPS (Fig. 1B). We concluded that CHIPS does not affect the activation site on the C5aR. CHIPS Binds the N Terminus of the C5aR—To investigate the role of the C5aR N terminus in CHIPS binding, the N terminus of the C5aR was expressed on HEK293 cells using the pDisplay expression vector. As controls, the N terminus of the IL8RA and an empty pDisplay vector were used. The method of detection of the C5aR N terminus on the surface of HEK293 cells is depicted in Fig. 2A. HEK293 cells were gated based on forward and sideward scatter parameters (Fig. 2B, region 1 (R1)) and viability (cells staining negative for propidium iodide) (Fig. 2C, R2). Subsequently, only cells within regions R1 and R2 were analyzed for expression of N termini (GaM-APC-positive cells in R3; Fig. 2, D, G, and J). Finally, the cells within region R3 were analyzed for binding of CHIPS-FITC (Fig. 2, E, H, and K). Fig. 2, F, I, and L shows the GaM-APC versus CHIPS-FITC scatter plots of the cells within R1 and R2. Fig. 2 clearly shows expression of the C5aR N terminus (D and F) and IL8RA N terminus (G and I), whereas CHIPS binding is restricted to the C5aR N terminus (E, F, H, and I). HEK293 cells transfected with only the empty vector did not bind CHIPS (J, K, and L). This strongly suggests that CHIPS binds to the N terminus of the C5aR. Moreover, it indicates that CHIPS does not interact with the epitope tags or transmembrane domain that are expressed by the pDisplay vector. Using HEK293 cells constitutively expressing the C5aR N terminus, we determined that CHIPS bound the C5aR N terminus with an apparent Kd value of 29.7 ± 4.4 nm (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Specific binding of 125I-CHIPS to the C5aR N terminus. HEK293 cells stably expressing the C5aR N terminus were incubated with 125I-CHIPS in the absence or presence of unlabeled CHIPS for 90 min. Cell-bound 125I-CHIPS was measured in a gamma counter. Curves were fit to nonlinear regression analysis, and the Kd values were quantitated using the PRISM program.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mapping the Binding Site of CHIPS to the N Terminus of the C5aR by Use of the pDisplay Expression Vector—To investigate the role of the C5aR N terminus in CHIPS binding in more detail, deletion and substitution mutants in the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus expression system were created (Table I). Analysis of these constructs in transfected HEK293 cells showed that the deletion mutant of the C5aR N terminus lacking the first 8 residues was still able to bind CHIPS, whereas the variant lacking the first 13 residues failed to bind CHIPS (Fig. 4A). Deletion mutants lacking residues 21–30 or 33–38 distal in the C5aR N terminus did not lose their ability to bind CHIPS (Fig. 4A). Mutagenesis studies with the C5aR have shown that aspartic acid residues throughout the N terminus are particularly important for the interaction with C5a (17DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G.

As CHIPS is a cationic protein, like C5a, we hypothesized that CHIPS may interact with similar negatively charged residues. We tested this hypothesis by substituting all aspartic acid residues one by one for alanine residues (Table I). Fig. 4B demonstrates that mutation of the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, or 18 resulted in a C5aR N terminus devoid of all CHIPS binding. Mutation of the aspartic acid residues at positions 16, 21, 27, and 37 had no influence on CHIPS binding.Table IMutations and deletions constructed in the C5aR N terminus1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738WTaWild type C5aR N-terminus.MNSFNYTTPDYGHYDDKDTLDLNTPVDKTSNTLRVPDIΔ1-8bDeleted amino acids.PDYGHYDDKDTLDLNTPVDKTSNTLRVPDIΔ1-13YDDKDTLDLNTPVDKTSNTLRVPDIΔ1-18TLDLNTPVDKTSNTLRVPDIΔ21-30MNSFNYTTPDYGHYDDKDTL----------NTLRVPDIΔ33-38MNSFNYTTPDYGHYDDKDTLDLNTPVDKTSNTP9A........A.............................D10A.........A............................Y11F..........F...........................G12A...........A..........................H13A............A.........................Y14F.............F........................D15A..............A.......................D16A...............A......................K17A................A.....................D18A.................A....................T19A..................A...................L20A...................A..................D21A....................A.................D27A..........................A...........T32A...............................A......D37A....................................A.Y11F+Y14F..........F..F........................D10A+D15A.........A....A.......................D10A+D18A.........A.......A....................D15A+D18A..............A..A....................D10A+D15A+D18A.........A....A..A....................a Wild type C5aR N-terminus.b Deleted amino acids. Open table in a new tab The C5aR N terminus contains 3 tyrosine residues located at positions 6, 11, and 14. Farzan et al. (20Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the residues at positions 11 and 14 are sulfated and show that this posttranslational modification is critical for efficient association of C5a with the C5aR. They hypothesize that these sulfated tyrosines provide primary binding energy for docking of C5a. To examine whether sulfation of the N-terminal tyrosines of the C5aR is also important for CHIPS binding, these tyrosines were modified to phenylalanines. Fig. 4B shows that substitution of one or both of these residues had no or little influence on CHIPS binding, suggesting that sulfation of the tyrosines plays no role in the binding of CHIPS. To exclude the importance of other residues in CHIPS binding, we substituted the remaining amino acids from positions 8–20 of the C5aR N terminus by alanine residues. Fig. 4B shows that all mutants retain their ability to bind CHIPS, except for the variant in which the glycine at position 12 is substituted. These results pinpoint the amino acids involved in CHIPS binding to the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, and 18 with an additional glycine at position 12. CHIPS Exclusively Binds the N Terminus of the C5aR—To investigate whether the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus expression results can be extrapolated to the whole C5aR, comparable mutagenesis was performed in a whole C5aR expression system. Fig. 5A shows that the N-terminal deletion mutants show a similar decrease in CHIPS binding after deletion of the first 13 residues as compared with the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus mutants. However, in contrast to the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus mutants, the variants with a single substitution of the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, or 18 retained some CHIPS binding (Fig. 5B). At least two of these three mutations were needed to abolish CHIPS binding. The single glycine to alanine mutation at position 12 resulted in a decreased CHIPS binding, consistent with the findings in the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus. These results raised the question whether one or more of the extracellular loops of the C5aR plays an additional role in CHIPS binding. This would be consistent with the finding that the affinity of CHIPS for the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus on HEK293 cells is about 30-fold lower as compared with its affinity for the whole C5aR (4Postma B. Poppelier M.J. van Galen J.C. Prossnitz E.R. Van Strijp J.A. De Haas C.J. Van Kessel K.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6994-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To assess whether the extracellular loops of the C5aR participate in CHIPS binding, C5aR chimeras composed of the C5aR and human C3aR or IL8RA were created (Fig. 6A). CHIPS does not bind to the human C3aR or IL8RA (4Postma B. Poppelier M.J. van Galen J.C. Prossnitz E.R. Van Strijp J.A. De Haas C.J. Van Kessel K.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6994-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Analysis of these chimeric receptors transfected in HEK293 cells revealed that CHIPS binding was not affected in all cases where separate extracellular loops of the C5aR were exchanged (CH-(90–117), CH-(171–211), and CH-(265–280)). Even exchanging the complete C5aR, except for the N terminus, for the C3aR (CH-(38–350)) did not influence the CHIPS binding (Fig. 6B), whereas its reciprocal chimera, CH-(1–37), was completely devoid of CHIPS binding. To exclude the involvement of the C5aR extracellular loops in CHIPS binding even further, loop exchange mutants with an additional D10A mutation showed no additional decrease in CHIPS binding as compared with the wild type C5aR with the D10A mutation. These results strongly suggest that the extracellular loops of the C5aR do not participate in CHIPS binding. Various C5aR antagonists have already been reported, including C5a mutants, peptides, non-peptidic compounds, and anti-C5aR antibodies (6Pellas T.C. Wennogle L.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 737-755PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sumichika H. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 5: 505-510PubMed Google Scholar). Only a few of these C5aR antagonists have proven useful in vivo. Most of these antagonists are modified structures of C5a, yielding molecules that presumably bind competitively to the C5aR. Moreover, with the exception of some C5a mutants, they almost exclusively are aimed at the activation site of the C5aR (6Pellas T.C. Wennogle L.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 737-755PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sumichika H. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 5: 505-510PubMed Google Scholar). CHIPS is unique in this list of C5aR antagonists, as CHIPS is a bacterial protein without structural similarity with C5a. Moreover, CHIPS does not compete with C5a for the activation site of the C5aR but interferes with the association of C5a by binding the C5aR N terminus. For these reasons CHIPS may provide us with new strategies to block the C5aR. Based on our data on binding of CHIPS to the C5aR N terminus expressed on HEK293 cells alone and to the whole C5aR, we have proposed that residues 10–18 within the C5aR N terminus compose a binding domain for CHIPS. Within this region the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, and 18 and the glycine at position 12 are crucial in the binding of CHIPS. We showed that sulfation of the tyrosines at positions 11 and 14 is not important for CHIPS binding, in contrast to the findings of Farzan et al. for the C5a binding (20Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the aspartic acid residues participate directly in the binding of CHIPS, as data on the structure of CHIPS show numerous positive charges at the surface of the protein. 2P. J. Haas, C. J. De Haas, M. J. Poppelier, K. P. Van Kessel, J. A. Van Strijp, K. Dijkstra, R. M. Scheek, H. Fan, J. A. Kruijtzer, R. M. Liskamp, and J. Kemmink, manuscript in preparation. The glycine at position 12 might directly participate in CHIPS binding. However, because this is a small non-polar amino acid that is often found in turns and loops (22Bieri O. Kiefhaber T. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is more likely to be essential for the conformation of the binding domain. C5aR chimeras clearly showed that CHIPS binds only the C5aR N terminus, without any involvement of the extracellular loops. This seems to contrast with the results obtained in comparing the mutagenesis studies of the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus with the whole C5aR. First, the Kd of CHIPS binding to both systems differed 30-fold (4Postma B. Poppelier M.J. van Galen J.C. Prossnitz E.R. Van Strijp J.A. De Haas C.J. Van Kessel K.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6994-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which is not expected when no other sites are involved in the CHIPS binding. Second, although in both expression systems the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, and 18 were involved in CHIPS binding, in the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus system mutation of only one of these aspartic acid residues was sufficient to completely abolish CHIPS binding; in the whole C5aR at least two mutations were necessary. A possible explanation for these observations might be that the epitope tags and/or transmembrane domain expressed by the pDisplay expression vector cause small changes in the conformation of the C5aR N terminus, which negatively influences CHIPS binding. It seems plausible that with a lower binding affinity of CHIPS one mutation in the pDisplay/C5aR N terminus results in a complete loss of CHIPS binding, whereas with a higher binding affinity at least two mutations are necessary in the complete receptor. Based on the possible sigmoid shape of the binding curve in Fig. 3, we considered a two-site cooperative binding model. However, the fit assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry is of reasonable quality, and our experimental data showing the involvement of only 9 amino acids (residues 10–18) in CHIPS binding do not support a more complex binding model. The question remains how the binding of CHIPS to the C5aR N terminus interferes with the association of C5a. The parts of the C5aR N terminus involved in the binding of C5a are still a matter of debate. Several mutagenesis data pinpoint the C5a binding domain to residues 10–16 of the C5aR N terminus. Mery and Boulay (19Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that substitution of the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, and 16 decreased the binding efficiency of C5a. In contrast to these findings, but resulting in about the same binding domain, Farzan et al. (20Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported that only the two tyrosine sulfate moieties located at positions 11 and 14 within the C5aR N terminus play a critical role in the initial association of C5a with the C5aR. Taken together, according to these data C5a and CHIPS would compete for the same binding site within the C5aR N terminus. Alternatively, there is evidence for an initial C5a binding site located between the negatively charged residues in region 21–30 of the C5aR N terminus. Chen et al. (23Chen Z. Zhang X. Gonnella N.C. Pellas T.C. Boyar W.C. Ni F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10411-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrate in a nuclear magnetic resonance study of the interaction between C5a and a C5aR N-terminal peptide that only the aspartic acid residues at positions 21 and 27 were directly perturbed by C5a binding. They propose a model in which C5a binds residues 21–30 of the C5aR N terminus while residues 10–18 of the C5aR N terminus make intramolecular contacts with the extracellular loops of the C5aR, thereby forming a stable C5a binding pocket. In this model CHIPS may interfere with the formation of a stable binding pocket by blocking the association of the C5aR N terminus with the extracellular loops. This would be a complete new mechanism of inhibiting C5a-induced responses. Further experiments are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanism by which CHIPS inhibits C5a binding to the C5aR. In summary, we have identified residues 10–18 of the C5aR as a binding domain for CHIPS. Within this region the aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 15, and 18 and the glycine at position 12 are crucial in the binding of CHIPS. This may be valuable information for the development of C5aR antagonists, whether CHIPS-derived or non-CHIPS-derived compounds."

The chromophore sequence Met63-Tyr64-Gly65 of the A. sulcata chromoprotein was previously proposed to comprise a 6-membered pyrazine-type heterocycle (Martynov, V. I., Savitsky, A. P., Martynova, N.

However, our crystallographic data revealed the chromophore to comprise a 5-membered p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolinone moiety that adopts a non-coplanar trans conformation within the interior of the GFP β-can fold. Unexpectedly, fragmentation of the polypeptide was found to occur within the chromophore moiety, at the bond between Cys62C and Met63N1. Our structural data reveal that fragmentation of the chromophore represents an intrinsic, autocatalytic step toward the formation of the mature chromophore within the specific GFP-like proteins.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Protein engineering, together with the isolation of novel homologs of GFP, has provided a range of GFP-like proteins that cover the entire visible spectrum and exhibit a variety of useful properties (1Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar, 2Verkhusha V.V. Lukyanov K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The characterized GFP-like proteins can be divided into two groups, the fluorescent proteins and nonfluorescent or weakly fluorescent chromoproteins (3Labas Y.A. Gurskaya N.G. Yanushevich Y.G.

BioEssays. 2002; 24: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The chromophore within these proteins arises from a unique autocatalytic post-translational modification of three consecutive amino acids (XYG) in the primary sequence, which, to date, has been observed to form a 5-membered heterocycle. In some GFP-like proteins, the chromophore maybe modified by further post-translational events. For example, some fluorescent proteins and chromoproteins with red-shifted spectral properties have an extended π -conjugation system resulting from acylimine formation; photo-conversion of the Kaede protein and GFP is due to a unique UV-induced polypeptide cleavage and decarboxylation event, respectively (5Mizuno H.

X-ray crystallographic studies have been important in revealing that the chromophore can adopt alternative conformations such as trans non-coplanar and trans-coplanar present in the essentially nonfluorescent chromoprotein (Rtms5) and the far-red fluorescent protein (eqFP611), respectively (7Prescott M.

The range of possible post-translational modifications of the chromophore was recently extended (9Martynov V.I. Savitsky A.P. Martynova N.Y. Savitsky P.A. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol.

The model proposed a unique 6-membered pyrazine-type heterocycle. In addition, analysis by SDS-PAGE indicated that asCP under-went fragmentation at a position adjacent to the chromophore. However, an NMR study of the “chromopeptide” isolated by proteolytic digestion of asFP595, a double point mutant (T68A/A143S) of asCP, suggested the alternative cyclization mechanism to be incorrect, and the protein instead contains a p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolinone moiety typical of GFP-like proteins (10Zagranichny V.E.

A similar chromophore structure and fragmentation was identified in the highly yellow fluorescent protein zFP538 (11Zagranichny V.E. Rudenko N.V. Gorokhovatsky A.Y. Zakharov M.V. Shenkarev Z.O. Balashova T.A. Arseniev A.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25879-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that alterations in the configuration of the chromophore form the basis of the kindling phenomenon (13Chudakov D.M. Feofanov A.V. Mudrik N.N. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7215-7219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The kindling properties of asCP have been optimized with the inclusion of the key mutation (A143G) in the vicinity of the chromophore to produce a variant, termed KFP (14Chudakov D.M. Belousov V.V. Zaraisky A.G. Novoselov V.V. Staroverov D.B. Zorov D.B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To clarify the controversy in the literature regarding the asCP and zFP538 chromophore conformation, and to begin to gain an understanding of the kindling phenomenon, we determined the 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure of KFP. The structure highlights several key features, including fragmentation of the former bond between Cys62C and Met63N1, and gives a detailed view of the chromophore and its environment indicating the presence of p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolinone moiety in a trans non-coplanar configuration. Cloning—Using the vector pKindling-Red-N (Evrogen) as a template, a DNA cassette encoding KFP was retrieved by PCR using the oligonucleotide primer pair 5′-taggatccatcgccaccatggtgagcggcctg-3′ and 5′-atagtttagcggccgctcagtgatcagagttggccttctcgggcag-3′ and was cloned into the BamHI/NotI expression site pQE10N to produce pQE10N::KFP (15Beddoe T.

Protein Expression and Purification—BL21(DE3) cells harboring pQE10N::KFP were induced for protein expression and protein-purified by a combination of nickel-nitriloacetic acid and S200 gel filtration chromatography as described (8Petersen J.

Protein eluting at a position corresponding to the KFP tetramer was concentrated to 20 mg/ml using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filter unit (Centricon, Millipore) in preparation for crystallization trials. Chromopeptide Isolation and MALDI-TOF MS—KFP (1 mg/ml) was adjusted to pH 2.3 with dilute HCl and immediately readjusted to pH 7.8 with dilute NaOH. Digestion with trypsin (1:50, trypsin:protein; Sigma) was performed for 4 h at room temperature. Digestions were immediately adjusted to 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and applied to an XTerra analytical C18 column (Waters); peptides were eluted with a linear elution gradient of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile and detected by absorbance at 214 nm. Visibly colored fractions containing chromopeptide were collected for further analysis. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of chromopeptide was performed as described (7Prescott M. Ling M. Beddoe T. Oakley A.J.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C in 16% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.7, 0.2 m ammonium acetate. Crystals were observed after 3–4 days and grew to a maximal crystal size after 7–14 days. Crystals were flash-cooled to 100 K prior to data collection using 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 15% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. X-ray diffraction experiments were performed utilizing a Rikagu RU-3HBR rotating anode generator with helium purged OSMIC focusing mirrors coupled to an R-AXIS IV++ detector. Crystals were determined to belong to space group P6222 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 112 Å, c = 97 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. The Matthews' coefficient (17Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure of KFP was solved by molecular replacement using the program AmoRe in the CCP4 suite. A modified protomer of the eqFP611 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1UIS) was used as the search probe, with the chromophore removed and all sequence differences mutated to alanine. The structure was readily solved with one clear peak in the rotation function leading to the elucidation of one clear peak in the translation function. Refinement was monitored by the Rfree value (5.0% of the data) with neither a sigma nor a low resolution cut-off being applied to the data. The structure was refined using rigid body fitting followed by the simulated annealing protocol of crystallography NMR software (CNS version 1.1) interspersed with rounds of model building using the program O (18Brünger A.T.

Water molecules were included in the model if they were within hydrogen-bonding distance to chemically reasonable groups, appeared in Fo – Fc maps contoured at 3.5σ, and had a B-factor less than 60 Å2. Clear electron density for the Met63-Tyr64-Gly65 chromophore sequence was observed in the initial 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps and was built in the penultimate round of refinement. A p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolinone moiety in a trans non-coplanar conformation fitted into the observed density unambiguously. Attempts to model other chromophore conformations, such as the previously postulated 6-membered pyrazine-type heterocycle (9Martynov V.I. Savitsky A.P. Martynova N.Y. Savitsky P.A. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21012-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), failed to adequately represent the observed electron density and led to a worsening of the Rfac and Rfree values. Topology and parameter files for the chromophore were initially based on those observed for the eqFP611 chromophore (8Petersen J. Wilmann P.G. Beddoe T. Oakley A.J. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44626-44631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The linkage between the chromophore and Ser66 was observed to represent a true trans peptide bond, analogous to that observed in the eqFP611, DsRed, and Rtms5 structures. However, a break in the electron density between Cys62 and the chromophore was observed, indicative of cleavage of polypeptide chain at this site. Trying to model a covalent link between Cys62 and the chromophore led to a worsening of the Rfac and Rfree values; by contrast, modeling a covalent break at the same site resulted in an improved fit of the chromophore into the electron density. In addition, simulated annealing omit maps of the chromophore and the surrounding residues were created to validate the correctness of our interpretation of the chromophore structure. The final model, which comprises a single protomer (residues 4–232), 130 water molecules, and 1 acetate ion, has an Rfac of 21.4% and an Rfree of 23.3% for all reflections between 50 and 2.1 Å. See Table I for a summary of model quality and refinement statistics. The structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1XQM). Structure Description—The protomer in the asymmetric unit is very similar to the described previously GFP 11-stranded β-barrel with a central α-helix running co-axially to the barrel axis (Fig. 1A). At the center of the barrel the cyclic tripeptide chromophore is observed to form only one covalent link to the protein, with a break in the polypeptide between Cys62 and the chromophore (Fig. 1, B and C). SDS-PAGE analysis of redissolved KFP crystals as well as KFP starting material revealed polypeptide fragments with molecular masses wholly consistent with the position of fragmentation observed in the crystal structure. Similar results showing fragmentation have been reported for asFP595 (9Martynov V.I. Savitsky A.P. Martynova N.Y. Savitsky P.A. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21012-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results indicate that fragmentation of KFP is a property of the native protein and an intrinsic step in the maturation of the chromophore that must take place inside the native protein fold. In comparison with other GFP-like proteins, KFP is most similar to eqFP611 (59.2% sequence identity, 218 equivalent Cα atoms having an r.m.s. deviation of 0.74 Å) (8Petersen J. Wilmann P.G. Beddoe T. Oakley A.J. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Rossjohn J. J. Biol.

Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), whereas less similarity is observed between KFP and GFP (21.4% sequence identity, 201 equivalent Cα atoms having an r.m.s. deviation of 1.28 Å). Notable structural differences include the immediate environment of the chromophore and the extended C-terminal tail of KFP. The biologically active 222 tetramer generated via the crystallographic symmetry operators exhibited close structural homology to the DsRed, eqFP611, and Rtms5 tetramers (7Prescott M. Ling M.

Biol. 2000; 7: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, the intersubunit A-B interface of KFP is moderately larger than that of the GFP-like tetramers. This observation is attributable to the extended C-terminal tail of KFP that participates in numerous intersubunit contacts. Chromophore Structure and Environment—A p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolinone moiety, typical of GFP cyclization, fitted the observed electron density unambiguously (Fig. 1B). A 6-membered pyrazine-type heterocycle, predicted by the alternative cyclization mechanism for asCP, was inconsistent with the observed electron density (Fig. 1, B and C) (9Martynov V.I. Savitsky A.P. Martynova N.Y. Savitsky P.A. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21012-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The imidazolinone moiety is sandwiched between the turns of the central helix, making several hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with the surrounding side chains. Of the chromophore contacts in the DsRed, Rtms5, eqFP611, and KFP structures, residues Trp90, Arg92, Glu145, and Glu215 were observed to be strictly conserved. Notably, three of these residues (Trp90, Arg92, and Glu215) were found to contact the imidazolinone moiety, highlighting their possible important role in chromophore cyclization (Fig. 2A). The electron density shows clearly that the imidazolinone and 4-hydroxyphenylmethylene moieties of the chromophore are non-coplanar, with the 4-hydroxyphenyl moiety rotated 31° in respect to the plane of the imidazolinone ring (Figs. 1 and 2A). The chromophore adopts a trans non-coplanar conformation, stabilized by 6 hydrogen bonds, 5 water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and numerous van der Waals interactions (Table II, Fig. 2A). The methionine moiety of the KFP chromophore is found to extend into a deep pocket that is surrounded by the side chains of residues Gln39, Met41, Ile199, Gln213, and Glu215. The residues that comprise this pocket are largely conserved in the KFP, DsRed, Rtms5, and eqFP611 structures.Table IIChromophore contactsChromophoreProteinNature of interactionMethionine moiety N1Cys62van der Waals Cα1Ser59, Glu215van der Waals Cβ1Ser59, Cys62, Gln213, Glu215van der Waals Cγ1Gln39, Glu215van der Waals Sδ1Gln39, Gln213, Glu215van der Waals Cϵ3Met41, Gln213van der WaalsImidazolinone moiety C1Thr60, Glu215van der Waals N2Thr60van der WaalsGlu215Oϵ2H-bond N3Thr60OH-bond C2Thr60, Arg92van der Waals Cα2Thr60, Glu215van der Waals O2Arg92Nη2H-bondThr60, Lys67van der Waals4-Hydroxyphenyl-methylene moiety Cβ2His197, Glu215van der Waals Cγ2His197van der Waals Cδ1Thr60, Met160, His197van der Waals Cδ2Arg92, Tyr178, His197van der Waals Cϵ1Ser158, Met160, Leu174, His197van der Waals Cϵ2Arg92, Glu145, Tyr178van der Waals Cζ[ρ]Glu145, Ser158, Leu174van der Waals Oη[ρ]Ser158Oγ[ρ]H-bondLeu174van der WaalsGlu145Oϵ2, Thr176Oγ1Water-mediated H-bondGlycyl moiety Cα3Thr60, Trp90van der Waals CLys67, Trp90van der Waals OTrp90Nϵ1, Gln106Nϵ2H-bondSer61O, Thr108Oγ1, Lys67NWater-mediated H-bond Open table in a new tab Fragmentation of KFP results in the formation of a unique chromophore and thus distinguishes it from those observed in other available crystal structures of GFP-like proteins; however the mechanism for fragmentation is not clear. Although the same three amino acids, Met-Tyr-Gly, comprise the chromophore in both KFP and the highly fluorescent eqFP611, the extended conjugation due to the acylimine in eqFP611 is absent in KFP. The cleavage of the Cys62-chromophore bond provides a degree of freedom of movement of the chromophore, permitting a significant shift of the chromophore body toward β-strand 8, which also causes a shift in the position of this strand (as highlighted by the comparison of KFP to the eqFP611 structures (Fig. 2B)). Both the KFP and eqFP611 4-hydroxyphenylmethylene moieties form polar interactions with residue Ser158 despite differences in the position and rotamer conformation of Ser 158. The KFP 4-hydroxyphenylmethylene moiety makes additional interactions through 2 water-mediated hydrogen bonds to Glu145 and Thr176. The hydroxyphenyl moiety of the KFP chromophore makes van der Waals contacts with Thr60, Arg92, Glu145, Ser158, Met160, Leu174, Tyr178, His197, and Glu215 (Table II). The imidazole ring of His197 interacts extensively with the hydroxyphenyl moiety, adopting a coplanar conformation with respect to this moiety. Notably, KFP lacks an aromatic residue at position 174, which in eqFP611 is occupied by a Phe and was observed to make several contacts to the p-hydroxyphenylmethylene moiety. The interplay between residues at positions 197 and 67 observed in DsRed, eqFP611, and the Rtms5 structures is also observed in KFP, where, because of the bulky His197 imidazole ring, Lys67 is pushed away from the hydroxyphenyl moiety to salt bridge to Glu195 and Glu145. The site of fragmentation and chemical nature of the KFP chromophore were investigated in further detail. A peptide released by trypsin digestion of acid denatured KFP (the chromophore is covalently linked to KFP via Ser66) was HPLC-purified and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. A 564.20-Da species was observed matching closely the predicted monoisotropic mass (564.26 Da; data not shown) for a pentapeptide (Met-Tyr-Gly-Ser-Lys), which contains the chromophore sequence (Met-Tyr-Gly) and corresponds to a typical GFP-like cyclization event to form the p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazalinone moiety followed by fragmentation to yield the “imino”-substituted chromophore, as predicted for asFP595 and zFP538 (10Zagranichny V.E.

The predicted monoisotropic mass for the “keto”-substituted chromopeptide (a predicted hydrolysis product of the imino form (10Zagranichny V.E. Rudenko N.V. Gorokhovatsky A.Y. Zakharov M.V.

Accordingly, our data discount these alternatives. The chromophore structure observed in KFP represents another alternative for generating red-shifted spectral properties in GFP-like proteins; whereas an acylimine extends the conjugation system of DsRed (λmax 558 nm) (20Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and eqFP611 (λmax 559 nm) (21Wiedenmann J. Schenk A. Rocker C. Girod A. Spindler K.D. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11646-11651Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), an acylimine is absent KFP (λmax 545 nm). In KFP the single π -bond of the imino (C=NH) substituent extends the GFP-chromophore and (together with His197) appears sufficient to promote the red-shifted property of KFP. This suggests that in DsRed and eqFP611 the acyl (C=O) part of the acylimine does not necessarily participate in the delocalization of the chromophore π -system. Accordingly in the structures of DsRed, eqFP611, and Rtms5 this bond is out of plane in respect to the imidazolinone moiety of the chromophore. The soluble protein used to generate KFP crystals was not exposed to the intense excitation illumination required to induce the phenomenon of kindling. The absorbance and fluorescence spectra of KFP from redissolved crystals were similar to the soluble starting material (data not shown). Our structure, therefore, represents the nonkindled or “dark” state of the protein. A model for the kindling mechanism has been proposed (13Chudakov D.M. Feofanov A.V. Mudrik N.N. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7215-7219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this model intense illumination with green light induces a significant alteration in the configuration of the chromophore from a trans nonfluorescent to a cis fluorescent form. The chromophore in KFP adopts a trans non-coplanar configuration similar to the chromophore configuration found in another nonfluorescent chromoprotein, Rtms5 (7Prescott M. Ling M. Beddoe T. Oakley A.J. Dove S. Hoegh-Guldberg O. Devenish R.J. Rossjohn J. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 275-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The A143G substitution presumably permits a greater degree of conformational freedom that allows the chromophore to adopt a cis coplanar conformation in the kindled state. Fragmentation may lower activation barriers for conformational transitions and/or allow the chromophore to assume an alternative conformation. Nevertheless, there appears to be ample room to accommodate the tyrosyl moiety if it should adopt a cis coplanar configuration upon kindling. Further investigation of the mechanism of kindling requires the crystal structure of the photoconverted protein. In conclusion, this crystal structure of KFP shows for the first time fragmentation of the main chain polypeptide for the GFP-like family, revealing an additional layer of complexity in the chromophore chemistry of these GFP-like proteins. Furthermore, it provides unequivocal evidence that fragmentation in the native protein contributes to the formation of a novel imino-substituted chromophore. We thank S. Harris for assistance in mass spectrometry analysis and Peter Gräber for support."
https://openalex.org/W1977532644,"The GDNF family ligands signal through a receptor complex composed of a ligand binding subunit, GFRalpha, and a signaling subunit, the RET tyrosine kinase. GFRalphas are expressed not only in RET-expressing cells, but also in cells lacking RET. A body of evidence suggests that RET-independent GFRalphas are important for (1) modulation of RET signaling in a non-cell-autonomous fashion (trans-signaling) and (2) regulation of NCAM function. To address the physiological significance of these roles, we generated mice specifically lacking RET-independent GFRalpha1. These mice exhibited no deficits in regions where trans-signaling has been implicated in vitro, including enteric neurons, motor neurons, kidney, and regenerating nerves. Furthermore, no abnormalities were found in the olfactory bulb, which requires proper NCAM function for its formation and is putatively a site of GDNF-GFRalpha-NCAM signaling. Thus RET-independent GFRalpha1 is dispensable for organogenesis and nerve regeneration in vivo, indicating that trans-signaling and GFRalpha-dependent NCAM signaling play a minor role physiologically."

A contributing factor may be a failure to break down free cytosolic tau, thus creating a surplus for aggregation, although the proteases that degrade tau in brain remain unknown. To address this issue, we prepared cytosolic fractions from five normal human brains and from perfused rat brains and incubated them with or without protease inhibitors. d-Phenylalanyl-l-prolylarginyl chloromethyl ketone, a thrombin-specific inhibitor, prevented tau breakdown in these fractions, suggesting that thrombin is a brain protease that processes tau. We next exposed human recombinant tau to purified human thrombin and analyzed the fragments by N-terminal sequencing. We found that thrombin proteolyzed tau at multiple arginine and lysine sites. These include Arg155–Gly156, Arg209–Ser210, Arg230–Thr231, Lys257–Ser258, and Lys340–Ser341 (numbering according to the longest human tau isoform). Temporally, the initial cleavage occurred at the Arg155–Gly156 bond. Proteolysis of the resultant C-terminal tau fragment then proceeded bidirectionally. When tau was phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β, most of these proteolytic processes were inhibited, except for the first cleavage at the Arg155–Gly156 bond. Furthermore, paired helical filament tau prepared from Alzheimer's disease brain was more resistant to thrombin proteolysis than following dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase. The results suggest a possible role for thrombin in proteolysis of tau under physiological and/or pathological conditions in human brains.

Intracellular aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.

Of these, hyperphosphorylation is the most common feature of aggregated tau in tauopathies. The mechanism of tau aggregation still remains unknown, however. One hypothesis is that impaired proteolysis of tau perturbs tau turnover, leading to its availability for aggregation (8Ikeda K. Akiyama H. Arai T. Kondo H. Haga C. Iritani S. Tsuchiya K. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 258: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In vitro, tau has been reported to be a substrate for a number of proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin D, calpains, caspases, proteasomal proteases, double-stranded DNA-stimulated protease, and thrombin (9Ksiezak-Reding H.

However, the proteases that degrade tau or the factors that affect its function in brain are still unclear.To clarify these issues, we examined tau breakdown in cytosolic fractions extracted from five normal human brains incubated at 37 °C with or without various kinds of protease inhibitors. Here, we show that a thrombin-specific inhibitor, d-phenylalanyl-l-prolylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (PPACK), completely repressed tau breakdown in this fraction. PPACK also inhibited tau breakdown in the same fraction prepared from perfused rat brains, indicating that thrombin in sufficient quantity for degrading tau is present in brain cells. These results suggest that thrombin is a brain protease that degrades tau. Furthermore, we have studied the in vitro proteolysis by thrombin of human recombinant tau and Sarkosyl-insoluble tau from a PHF preparation (referred to as PHF-tau) (9Ksiezak-Reding H. Yen S.-H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We show that thrombin initially cleaved recombinant tau at the Arg155–Gly156 bond. It then cleaved the resultant C-terminal tau fragment bidirectionally at multiple Arg/Lys–Xaa bonds. Moreover, we show that recombinant tau phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and PHF-tau were more resistant to thrombin proteolysis than non-phosphorylated recombinant tau and dephosphorylated PHF-tau, respectively. These results suggest a possible role for thrombin in proteolysis of tau under physiological and/or pathological conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEffect of Protease Inhibitors on the Breakdown of Endogenous Tau in Soluble Human Brain Extracts—Five subjects without any neurological symptoms were employed in this study. The age, sex, brain weight, post-mortem interval, brain regions examined, and diagnosis are given in Table I. Frozen brain tissue was homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold TS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl). The homogenate was aliquoted into multiple ultracentrifugation tubes, and a different protease inhibitor was added to each tube. The protease inhibitors used were as follows: protease inhibitor cocktail, Pefabloc SC (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), aprotinin, chymostatin, trypsin inhibitor from chicken egg white, leupeptin, antipain dihydrochloride, E-64, calpain inhibitors I and II, pepstatin, bestatin, and phosphoramidon (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland); PPACK (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., Hamburg, Germany); and caspase-3 inhibitor III (acetyl-DEVD chloromethyl ketone), potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor, and lactacystin (Calbiochem). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Part of the supernatant from each tube was mixed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The remaining samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 2, and 4 h; mixed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer; and boiled. The protein concentrations in the supernatant were measured using the DC protein assay system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Table IDescription of the subjectsCase no.Age at deathSexBrain wtPMIaPMI, post-mortem interval; NA, not available.RegionDiagnosisyrgh171Female12004FrontalMyocardial infarction263Female11503.5FrontalAdenoma of adrenal cortex375Female126010TemporalLung cancer493Female118024TemporalPneumonia578MaleNA7FrontalPulmonary failurea PMI, post-mortem interval; NA, not available.

After blocking with 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in TS buffer, membranes were incubated with anti-tau antibody T46 or A0024, both of which recognize the C-terminal region of tau (see Table II).

The whole brain was removed, immediately frozen in dry ice, and kept at –80°C until used. The frontal or temporal region of the frozen brain tissue was homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold TS buffer with or without PPACK and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and kept at –20°C until used. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, mixed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and boiled at various time points. The measurement of protein concentrations and the analysis of tau breakdown in supernatants were performed as described above.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Tau—Three kinds of human recombinant tau isoforms were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells as described previously (16Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). They included the longest form of tau, which includes exons 2 and 3 and four microtubule-binding repeats (T40), and tau with only three microtubule-binding repeats and an N-terminal insertion of either exon 2 (T37) or exons 2 and 3 (T39). They were extracted and purified according to the method of Crowther et al. (17Crowther R.A. Olesen O.F. Smith M.J. Jakes R. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Frozen E. coli pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (∼10 ml of extraction buffer/g of cells) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin. Cells were sonicated 15 times on ice, and the supernatant was collected after removing the cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. NaCl was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the supernatant was boiled and then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Finally, the extracted supernatant was dialyzed completely at 4 °C against buffer A (20 mm PIPES (pH 6.9), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The dialyzed tau supernatant was further purified on a Mono S HR 5/5 column. Before loading the supernatant, the column was equilibrated with buffer A. After loading, the column was washed with buffer A and eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m in buffer A, and fractions of 1 ml were collected. The pooled fractions containing tau were then dialyzed at 4 °C against 40 mm HEPES, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (50Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

The purified protein was stored at –70°C until used.Identification of the Sites of Thrombin Cleavage of Tau—TSDC stock buffer (14Olesen O.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 716-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was added to the recombinant tau samples (T39 or T40 at a concentration 0.5 or 1.0 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 17.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm DTT, and 2.1 mm CaCl2 (15Wang X. An S. Wu J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Following the addition of purified human α-thrombin (Nihon Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) at a final concentration of 60 or 120 units/ml, the entire reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and samples were collected at different times. The proteolytic reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min.The samples were subjected to 12.5 or 16.5% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). Each positive band was carefully cut out and subjected to sequence analysis with an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 High Throughput Protein Sequencer as described previously (18Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the N-terminal tau fragment after thrombin treatment, the membrane was immunostained with antibody AB5868, which recognizes the N-terminal portion of tau (see Table II), as described above.Proteolysis of Phosphorylated Recombinant Tau by Thrombin—In vitro phosphorylation was carried out by incubating T37 or T40 (0.05 mg/ml) at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP (Sigma), 0.05 or 0.5 mg/ml GSK-3β (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), 2 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail. After incubation for 3 h, the reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The denatured kinase was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Western blotting was performed as described above to confirm the phosphorylation state of tau. This was done using phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies, including anti-phospho-Thr212 tau, anti-phospho-Thr231 tau, and PHF-1 (Table II). Antibody T46, which recognizes the C-terminal region of both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated tau, was also used to detect total tau.α-Thrombin was then added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 6.0 units/ml. Part of the sample was collected immediately, mixed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The remainder was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, and the proteolytic reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer and boiling. For a negative control, T37 or T40 was treated in the same way, except that GSK-3β was eliminated from the first reaction mixture. The samples were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody T46.Proteolysis of PHF-tau by Thrombin—PHF-tau was extracted from the temporal lobe of a neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease patient (75-year-old female) as described previously (19Greenberg S.G.

The samples were incubated at 67 °C for 3 h with or without E. coli alkaline phosphatase (type III, 18 units/ml; Sigma). After cooling on ice, α-thrombin was added to each sample at a final concentration of 16 units/ml. Part of the sample was collected immediately, mixed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and boiled. The remainder was incubated at 37 °C for 1 and 3 h, mixed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and boiled. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-tau antibody HT7 or A0024 (Table II).RESULTSIdentification of Thrombin as a Protease That Processes Tau in Soluble Human Brain Extracts—Fig. 1 shows a representative Western blot of human brain supernatant incubated at 37 °C and stained with antibody T46. Without any protease inhibitors, the quantity of the full-length tau isoforms decreased, and several C-terminal tau fragments from 18.5 to 27 kDa appeared, increasing with time. A thrombin-specific inhibitor, PPACK, completely inhibited these tau breakdowns. Table III summarizes the effects of protease inhibitors on tau breakdown in human brain supernatant. In addition to PPACK, protease inhibitor cocktail, Pefabloc SC (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), leupeptin, and antipain dihydrochloride inhibited tau breakdown. Inhibitors that had no effect included aprotinin, chymostatin, trypsin inhibitor, E-64, calpain inhibitors, caspase-3 inhibitor III, pepstatin, bestatin, phosphoramidon, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor, and lactacystin. Western blotting with anti-tau antibody A0024 showed the same results as obtained with antibody T46 (data not shown). These findings were consistent among all cases examined, indicating that thrombin is a major protease that degrades tau in human brain supernatant.

In the sample without PPACK, the quantity of endogenous full-length tau decreased over time, with most of it disappearing after 24 h. On the other hand, in the sample with PPACK, the quantity of full-length tau was unchanged at 24 h.

They are GAAPPG (fragments b, c, i, and l), SRTPSL (fragments d, f, and o), TPPKSP (fragments e, h, and p), and SEKLDF (fragments j, s, and t). Sequence SKIGST (fragment t) was identified only in T40. These results suggest that thrombin can cleave tau at five different sites, which are Arg155–Gly156, Arg209–Ser210, Arg230–Thr231, Lys340–Ser341, and Lys257–Ser258 (numbering according to the longest human tau isoform) (23Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with a previous report that thrombin preferentially cleaves polypeptide substrates at Arg/Lys–Xaa bonds (24Blomba ̈ck B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Claesson G.

They are IVEGSD (fragments a, g, and n), YERNIE (fragments e and q), GQPSVL (fragment i), and SPFNNR (fragment t), which correspond to the B chain of α-thrombin, the B2 chain of β-thrombin, the B4 chain of γ-thrombin, and C-terminal fragment of the B4 chain of γ-thrombin, respectively (Fig. 5) (22Imamura T.

These results suggest that autolytic degradation of α-thrombin takes place during incubation as reported previously (26Fenton II, J.W.L. is B.H. Walz D.A. Finlayson J.S.

The remaining three fragments (fragments k, m, and r) revealed no decipherable sequences. The reason for fragments k and r not revealing definite sequences might be an insufficient amount of protein. The reason for the failure of fragment m to yield a definite sequence is uncertain.Fig. 5Autolytic cleavage sites of thrombin. Shown is the sequence of α-thrombin. The vertical lines indicate the cleavages sites identified in this study. The arginine and lysine residues at the cleavage sites are in boldface and underscored with their respective position number. The A chain of α-thrombin is located at residues 1–36, the B chain of α-thrombin at residues 37–295; the B2 chain of β-thrombin at residues 107–295, and the B4 chain of γ-thrombin at residues 191–295.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

PCC 6803. Several bands for carboxylate symmetric stretching modes in an S2/S1 FTIR difference spectrum were affected by selective 13C labeling of the α-carboxylate of Ala with l-[1-13C]alanine, whereas most of the isotopic effects failed to be induced in a site-directed mutant in which Ala-344 was replaced with Gly. Labeling of the α-methyl of Ala with l-[3-13C]alanine had much smaller effects on the spectrum to induce isotopic bands due to a symmetric CH3 deformation coupled with the α-carboxylate. The isotopic bands for the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 showed characteristic changes during S-state cycling. The bands appeared prominently upon the S1-to-S2 transition and to a lesser extent upon the S2-to-S3 transition but reappeared at slightly upshifted frequencies with the opposite sign upon the S3-to-S0 transition. No obvious isotopic band appeared upon the S0-to-S1 transition. These results indicate that the α-carboxylate of C-terminal Ala-344 is structurally associated with a manganese ion that becomes oxidized upon the S1-to-S2 transition and reduced reversely upon the S3-to-S0 transition but is not associated with manganese ion(s) oxidized during the S0-to-S1 (and S2-to-S3) transition(s).

The D1 protein is synthesized and assembled into the PS II complex with a short C-terminal extension except for the protein in Euglena (14Marder J.B. Goloubinoff P. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3900-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Light-dependent assembly of the manganese/Ca2+ cluster requires a free α-carboxylate of the C-terminal Ala-344, which occurs via cleavage of the C-terminal extension by the D1 C-terminal processing protease (CtpA) (15Shestakov S.V. Anbudurai R.R. Stanbekova G.E. Gadzhiev A. Lind L.K. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19354-19359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the C-terminal truncated Synechocystis mutants in which Asn-335, Asp-342, Leu-343, and Ala-344 were replaced with a stop codon grew photoautotrophically and evolved oxygen (5Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Site-directed replacement of D1-Ala-344 with Gly, Met, Ser, Val, Glu, or Gln in the D1-Ala-344-stop strain did not eliminate the capability for photoautotrophic growth and oxygen evolution (5Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy showed the isotope-induced changes of carboxylate symmetric stretching bands from the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 upon the S1-to-S2 transition by incorporating l-[1-13C]alanine isotope (16Chu H-A. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Replacement of the C-terminal Ala with Gly, which induced marked changes in the skeletal structure of the manganese/Ca2+ cluster detected by light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy in the low frequency region (17Mizusawa N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29622-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicated the close structural association of Ala-344 with the manganese/Ca2+ cluster. These observations suggest that the α-carboxylate of D1-Ala-344 associates with manganese ion(s) as a direct ligand. Some x-ray structural models of PS II suggested possible ligation of the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 to the manganese ion(s) (10Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 11Fromme P. Kern J. Loll B. Biesiadka J. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Krauss N. Zouni A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), but a recent 3.5 Å x-ray model proposed the closest location of the α-carboxylate to the Ca2+ ion that composes a cubane-like cluster core with three manganese ions (13Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar). Notably, however, no electron density for the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 has been resolved in any x-ray models because of limited resolution and x-ray damages during data collection. During the process of photosynthetic oxygen evolution, two water molecules are oxidized to yield an oxygen molecule through five intermediates labeled Sn (n = 0–4), where n denotes the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. Each Sn state advances to the Sn+1 state by absorbing a photon until reaching the highest oxidation state, S4, which spontaneously reverts to the lowest oxidation state, S0, concomitant with the release of an oxygen molecule (18Joliot P. Barbieri G. Chabaud R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1969; 10: 309-329Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 19Kok B. Forbush B. McGloin M.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 11: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Because the thermally stable S1 state predominates after prolonged dark incubation, S-state cycling starts from the S1 state in the dark adapted OEC. However, the mechanism through which substrate water molecules are oxidized to an oxygen molecule remains still largely unknown. To understand the mechanism of water oxidation, it is indispensable to know the details of changes in the chemical structure of the OEC during S-state cycling. Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful technique for detecting subtle changes in molecular structure and chemical bonds accompanying chemical processes directly (20Bath A. Zscherp C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 369-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Mid-frequency FTIR difference spectroscopy has been applied to studies on oxygen evolution for elucidating S-state-dependent changes in protein backbone and amino acid side groups, which structurally associate with the manganese/Ca2+ cluster in a direct or indirect manner (21Noguchi T. Sugiura M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Hillier W. Babcock G.T.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7479-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the spectra obtained were a composite of changes of a large number of bands, and no band was exactly assigned to a specific amino acid residue in a protein, with the only exception being the bands for the α-carboxylate of the C-terminal Ala-344 of the D1 protein found in the S2/S1 FTIR difference spectrum (16Chu H-A. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the bands of C-terminal Ala-344 of the D1 protein in the mid-frequency S2/S1 FTIR difference spectrum by labeling the α-carboxylate group with l-[1-13C]alanine and the α-methyl group with l-[3-13C]alanine in combination with site-directed mutation of Ala-344. We further report the changes in the mid-frequency bands for the α-carboxylate of C-terminal Ala-344 during S-state cycling in PS II core particles from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This is the first report on detection of the S-state-dependent structural changes in a single amino acid ligand for the manganese/Ca2+ cluster in OEC. It was also shown that bands in the low frequency (670–350 cm–1) S2/S1 FTIR difference spectrum exhibited characteristic changes due to l-[1-13C]alanine labeling. Sample Materials—A mutant with Gly instead of Ala at the D1 C-terminal (A344G-stop) was constructed based on the control strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which lacks the D1 C-terminal extension and bears a His tag on the C-terminal of CP47 (Ala-344-stop) (17Mizusawa N. Kimura Y. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Nakazawa S. Teramoto H. Ono T-A. J. Biol.

For specific 13C labeling of the α-carboxylate (1-C) or α-methyl carbon (3-C) of alanine, cells were grown photoautotrophically in BG11 medium supplemented with 0.5 mm l-[1-13C]alanine or l-[3-13C]alanine (99% 13C enrichment, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.). Total incorporation of 13C into 1-C or 3-C of Ala was evaluated with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis and found to be ∼70% in thylakoid membranes. Thylakoid membranes obtained by disrupting cells using a Bead-Beater (Bio-Spec Products) followed by centrifugation were solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and PS II core particles were chromatographically purified using a nickel column (17Mizusawa N.

The O2-evolving activity of the core particles obtained was ∼2500 μmol of O2 (mg of chlorophyll)–1 h–1 at 25 °C using 4 mm potassium ferricyanide as an electron acceptor. FTIR Measurements—Mid-frequency (1800–1200 cm–1) and low frequency (670–350 cm–1) FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS-66v/S spectrophotometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector (EG&G Optoelectronics D316/6) and on a Bomen MB102 spectrophotometer equipped with a silicon bolometer (infrared, HDL-5), respectively, at 0 °C (±0.03 °C) as described previously (25Yamanari T.

The PS II core particles (∼40 μg of chlorophyll) suspended in medium A were mixed with 1 μl of sodium ferricyanide solution (100 mm stock) as an electron acceptor. The PS II core suspension was deposited on a BaF2 (mid-frequency) or an AgCl (low frequency) disk, partially dried under a stream of cool N2 gas, and then covered with another BaF2 or AgCl disk with a greased Teflon spacer after placing a droplet of 20% (v/v) glycerol/water solution adjacent to the sample for rehydration (25Yamanari T.

After dark incubation at 0 °C for 1 h, the sample was preflashed to reduce the oxidized non-heme iron on the acceptor side and to enrich the S1 population. The sample was subjected to one flash for the S1-to-S2 transition or four successive flashes at 10-s intervals for respective S-state transitions provided from a frequency-doubled Nd3+:YAG laser (Spectra Physics, INDI-50) as described previously (25Yamanari T.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Single-beam spectra in the mid-frequency (20 scans) or low frequency (10 scans) region were measured before and after the first flash for S2/S1 difference or before the first flash and after each flash for the measurement of the flash-induced difference spectrum of each transition during the S-state cycling. To obtain difference spectra for the respective S-state transitions, the single-beam spectrum before each flash was subtracted from that after the flash. To obtain higher quality spectra of S2/S1 difference for close inspection of the isotopic bands than the spectra for S-state cycling, 80–170 and 70–89 mid-frequency spectra were accumulated for S2/S1 difference and S-state cycling, respectively. 261–273 spectra were averaged for the low frequency region. Effects of 13C-Alanine Labeling on S2/S1 FTIR Difference Spectrum—Fig. 1A shows mid-frequency S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra of PS II core particles from the control Ala-344-stop cells labeled by l-[1-13C]alanine (a, red line) or l-[3-13C]alanine (b, red line) and the particles from A344G-stop cells labeled by l-[1-13C]alanine (c, red line) as compared with the unlabeled spectra (a–c, black lines). Carbon atoms of the α-carboxylate and α-methyl groups in the alanine residues were selectively labeled by l-[1-13C]alanine and l-[3-13C]alanine, respectively. The S2/S1 spectra include the symmetric (1450–1300 cm–1) and asymmetric (1600–1500 cm–1) stretching modes from putative carboxylate ligands for the manganese/Ca2+ cluster as well as the amide I (1700–1600 cm–1) and II (1600–1500 cm–1) modes from polypeptide backbones (16Chu H-A. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Noguchi T. Sugiura M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Labeling by l-[1-13C]alanine induced changes of S2/S1 spectra in the carboxylate symmetric stretching region below 1400 cm–1 in particles from the control Ala-344-stop cells (a) but minimal changes in particles from the mutant A344G-stop cells (c). These results were in good agreement with a previous report (16Chu H-A. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and indicated that changes in the α-carboxylate group of D1 C-terminal Ala-344 are mainly responsible for these isotopic bands. Consistent with this view, labeling of the α-methyl of alanine by l-[3-13C]alanine had little influence on spectra in the carboxylate symmetric stretching region of the control Ala-344-stop particles (b) other than the slight difference around 1354 cm–1. Although these isotope labeling experiments also induced changes in the spectra at 1700–1500 cm–1, the region that includes asymmetric stretching bands of carboxylates, the effects of the isotope labeling on the spectra in this frequency region were ambiguous at present due to extensive overlap of intense amide bands. Fig. 1B shows double difference FTIR spectra for the S2/S1 difference in the carboxylate symmetric stretching region (1500–1200 cm–1), in which relatively small changes induced by the isotope labeling were clearly observable due to the absence of overlapping by intensive amide I and II bands. Each double difference spectrum was obtained by subtracting the [13C]alanine-labeled spectrum from the unlabeled ([12C]alanine) spectrum. The l-[1-12C]alanine/l-[1-13C]alanine double difference ([1-12C]/[1-13C]alanine) spectrum for the control Ala-344-stop particles (a) showed main bands at 1356(–), 1340(+), 1319(+), and 1309(–)/1297(–) as well as minor bands at 1381(–), 1373(+), 1287(+), and 1277(–) cm–1, but few bands were observed above 1400 cm–1, the region in which prominent symmetric stretching modes of carboxylate appeared in the S2/S1 difference spectrum as shown in Fig. 1A. The obtained double difference spectrum was very similar to that previously reported at 1375–1290 cm–1 (16Chu H-A. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The positive bands can be ascribed to [1-12C]Ala-344 in the S2 state or [1-13C]Ala-344 in the S1 state, and the negative bands can be ascribed to [1-12C]Ala-344 in the S1 state or [1-13C]Ala-344 in the S2 state. Most of the bands observed in the [1-12C]/[1-13C]alanine spectrum for the control Ala-344-stop particles were not present in the l-[3-12C]alanine/l-[3-13C]alanine double difference ([3-12C]/[3-13C]alanine) spectrum (b) or in the [1-12C]/[1-13C]alanine spectrum for the A344G-stop particles (c). However, derivative-shaped 1356(–)/1349(+) cm–1 bands were induced by the 13C labeling of α-methyl in alanine. The symmetric CH3 deformation of α-methyl and the symmetric COO– stretching modes of α-carboxylate in alanine were coupled (27Percy G.C. Stenton H.S. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1976; : 2429-2433Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the coupled bands were affected by the 1-13C (16Chu H-A. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or 3-13C labeling 2Y. Kimura, N. Mizusawa, T. Yamanari, A. Ishii, and T.-A. Ono, unpublished data. in the 12C/13C difference spectrum of alanine solution. In contrast, the asymmetric CH3 deformation mode was hardly affected by both types of labeling, and the CH bending mode sensitive to the 1-13C labeling was little changed upon the 3-13C labeling. Therefore, the 1356(–)/1349(+) cm–1 bands in the [3-12C]/[3-13C]alanine spectrum (b) may be ascribed to the symmetric CH3 deformation modes of the α-methyl of D1 Ala-344 coupled with the α-carboxylate. The [1-12C]/[1-13C]alanine spectrum for the A344G-stop particles contained bands at 1305(–)/1291(+)/1278(–) cm–1. Since D1 Ala-344 was replaced with Gly in the A344G-stop particles, it is likely that these bands are caused by Ala residue(s) separate from the C-terminal residue. There are several alanine residues that reside possibly close to the manganese/Ca2+ cluster in the luminal side of the D1 protein. One of these residues may be responsible for the 1309–1277 cm–1 bands, although it is not clear which vibrational modes are responsible for the bands. The coupled α-methyl band of D1 Ala-344 and the bands from the other Ala residue(s) are likely to at least in part contribute to the bands in the [1-12C]/[1-13C]alanine spectrum for the control Ala-344-stop particles. Other minor bands at 1381(–) and 1373(+) cm–1 cannot be assigned at present, although apparent S-state dependence indicated that some species concerning S-state cycling are responsible for the bands. Structural Changes of D1 C-terminal Ala-344 Carboxylate during S-state Cycling—Fig. 2 shows the FTIR difference spectra at 1800–1200 cm–1 obtained during S-state cycling of PS II core particles from the unlabeled control (black lines) and l-[1-13C]alanine-labeled (red lines) cells. The difference spectra induced by the first (a), second (b), third (c), and fourth (d) flashes correspond to the S2/S1, S3/S2, S0/S3, and S1/S0 difference spectra, respectively. Spectra showed characteristic changes that were dependent on the number of flashes. Each spectrum for the S-state cycling of unlabeled control (Ala-344-stop) particles was nearly identical to that of particles isolated from a histidine-tagged wild-type Synechocystis strain retaining the C-terminal extension (25Yamanari T. Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7479-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and very similar to PS II core particles from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (21Noguchi T. Sugiura M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Noguchi T. Sugiura M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Noguchi T. Sugiura M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6035-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and spinach (22Hillier W. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Yamanari T. Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7479-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overall features of the l-[1-13C]alanine-labeled spectra for S-state cycling were similar to those for the unlabeled control, but distinct changes were clearly observed in the carboxylate symmetric stretching regions below 1400 cm–1 in spectra induced by the first (a) and third (c) flashes but not in those induced by the second (b) and fourth (d) flashes. Spectral features in the 1700–1500 cm–1 region showed some differences in band intensity between the unlabeled controls and l-[1-13C]alanine-labeled spectra. This frequency region is expected to involve asymmetric carboxylate stretching vibrations that are the counterpart of the labeling-sensitive symmetric modes, and the observed differences may include the effects of the labeling on the C-terminal Ala-344 carboxylate during the S-state cycling. However, we cannot analyze the details of the labeling effects on the spectral features at 1700–1500 cm–1 because the band intensity tends to fluctuate easily due to the presence of the large background from the water and amide absorptions. S-state dependence of the carboxylate symmetric stretching bands of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 was revealed more clearly in the l-[1-12C]alanine/l-[1-13C]alanine double difference spectra shown in Fig. 3, which were obtained by subtracting l-[1-13C]alanine-labeled S-state difference spectra from the unlabeled S-state difference spectra. The double difference spectra obtained are predominantly ascribed to S-state-dependent structural changes of the C-terminal Ala-344 carboxylate. The bands clearly and prominently observed in the double difference spectrum for S2/S1 difference (a) largely disappeared in the double difference spectrum for S3/S2 difference (b). Note that the spectral features of the double difference spectrum for the S3/S2 difference somewhat resembled those for the S2/S1 difference, suggesting some contribution of the isotopic bands for S2/S1 difference to the double difference spectrum for the second flash due to the miss-hit (∼18%) after the first flash (25Yamanari T. Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7479-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The double difference spectrum for S0/S3 (c) showed prominent bands, overall features of which were similar to those in the double difference spectrum for S2/S1 but with the opposite sign. Interestingly, the peak position for each band in spectrum c was slightly upshifted as compared with that for the corresponding band in spectrum a. No obvious band was apparent in the double difference spectrum for S1/S0 (d), indicating that few structural changes in the C-terminal Ala-344 carboxylate group were induced during the S0-to-S1 transition. The periodic changes in the spectral features clearly demonstrated that the α-carboxylate group of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 characteristically changes structure and/or chemical natures during S-state cycling. Effects of l-[1-13C]Alanine Labeling on Low Frequency S2/S1 Spectrum—Fig. 4 shows the low frequency (670–350 cm–1) S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra of PS II core particles from the unlabeled control (black line) and l-[1-13C]alanine-labeled (red line) cells. The control spectrum agreed well with that reported previously (17Mizusawa N. Kimura Y. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Nakazawa S. Teramoto H. Ono T-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29622-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and showed bands at 652(–), 642(+), 629(+), 617(–), 606(+), 590(+), and 577(–) cm–1 as well as many medium and low intensity bands. The bands at ∼400(–) cm–1 and 590(+) cm–1 were ascribed to the ferricyanide added to the sample suspension as an electron acceptor and ferrocyanide formed by photoreduction of ferricyanide, respectively (26Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the spectrum of l-[1-13C]alanine-labeled particles was basically similar to the unlabeled control spectrum, small but distinctive differences between the two spectra were observed reproducibly at >590 cm–1. The intensity of the 617(–) cm–1 band changed considerably, and the bands at 642(+), 629(+), and 617(–) cm–1 were downshifted slightly upon the l-[1-13C]alanine labeling. Most of the bands for S2/S1 in the low frequency difference spectrum were significantly affected upon universal 13C labeling with the exception of the 577(–) cm–1 band for the putative skeletal vibration of the manganese cluster (26Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the α-carboxylate in the C-terminal Ala-344 is responsible for low frequency bands affected by l-[1-13C]alanine labeling. The low frequency result is compatible with the view that the α-carboxylate of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 associates with metal ion(s) as a direct ligand. The present results clearly demonstrated that vibrations of the α-carboxylate in the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 changed characteristically during S-state cycling. As shown in Fig. 3, the bands from the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 appeared strongly in the double difference spectrum for S2/S1, with much reduced intensity in the double difference spectrum for S3/S2, and then appeared prominently again at slightly higher frequencies in the double difference spectrum for S0/S3 but with the opposite sign, and appeared minimally in the double difference spectrum for S1/S0. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements indicate that the core structure of the manganese/Ca2+ cluster remains almost same during the S1-to-S2 transition but changes considerably during the S2-to-S3 transition (28Liang W. Roelofs T.A. Cinco R.M. Rompel A. Latimer M.J. Wa Yu O. Sauer K. Klein M.P. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3399-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the S-state-dependent changes in the vibrations of the α-carboxylate of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 are not caused by S-state-dependent structural alterations in the manganese/Ca2+ cluster but are mainly due to changes in the oxidation state of the manganese ion(s) during S-state cycling. The present results indicate that the α-carboxylate of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 structurally associates with a manganese ion that is oxidized during the S1-to-S2 transition and reversely reduced during the S3-to-S0 transition. The oxidation state of the manganese ions is thought to be MnIIIMnIIIMnIVMnIV (or MnIIIMnIIIMnIIIMnIII) and MnIIIMnIVMnIVMnIV (or MnIIIMnIIIMnIIIMnIV) for the S1 and S2 states, respectively (29Goussias C. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1369-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 is thought to structurally associate with a manganese ion oxidized from MnIII to MnIV during the S1-to-S2 transition. The spectral changes observed during S-state cycling strongly indicate that this oxidized manganese ion undergoes no redox change during the S2-to-S3 transition and then is reduced again from MnIV to MnIII during the S3-to-S0 transition and shows no redox change during the S0-to-S1 transition. A manganese ion probably becomes oxidized during the S0-to-S1 and possibly during the S2-to-S3 transitions (29Goussias C. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1369-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The appearance of few isotopic bands after the second and fourth flashes indicates that manganese ion(s), other than the ion associated with the α-carboxylate of Ala-344, are oxidized during the S2-to-S3 and S0-to-S1, and little change in structure of the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 occurs during these steps. These interpretations are rationalized most straightforwardly by assuming direct ligation of the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 to the manganese ion. As pointed out by Chu et al. (16Chu H-A. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the frequencies of the symmetric stretching bands of the α-carboxylate in the S2/S1 difference spectrum are compatible with those from a carboxylate that ligates a metal ion in an unidentate manner but are considerably different from a free and hydrogen-bonded carboxylate or a carboxylate ligating metal ion(s) in a bridging or a chelating manner. A carboxylate interacting with a non-metal atom through unusually strong hydrogen bond(s) could show bands at frequencies found in this study. However, this may be a less likely case because the spectral region for the Ala-344 α-carboxylate is not influenced by deuteration (23Noguchi T. Sugiura M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the Ala-344 α-carboxylate ligates a manganese ion in an unidentate manner throughout S-state cycling, and this manganese ion is oxidized from MnIII to MnIV and reduced from MnIV to MnIII during the S1-to-S2 and S3-to-S0 transitions, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Taking into account the isotopic downshift of the symmetric carboxylate stretching modes by the 13C labeling of the Ala-344 α-carboxylate and presumed downshift induced by the oxidation of the manganese ion during the S1-to-S2 transition, the bands in the [1-12C]/[1-13C]alanine spectrum for the S2/S1 difference (Fig. 3a) at 1356(–), 1340(+), 1319(+), and 1304(–) cm–1 can be assigned to S1 (12C), S1 (13C), S2 (12C), and S2 (13C) modes, respectively. Accordingly, the bands for the S0/S3 difference (Fig. 3c) at 1360(+), 1344(–), 1323(–), and 1311(+) cm–1 can be assigned to S0 (12C), S0 (13C), S3 (12C), and S3 (13C) modes, respectively. It is of note in this context that the isotopic bands in the double difference spectrum for the S3-to-S0 transition shifted upwards by ∼4 cm–1 as compared with those for the S1-to-S2 transition (Fig. 3). This suggests that the interaction between the C-terminal α-carboxylate and the redox-active manganese ion may be slightly weaker in the S0 and/or S3 state than that in the S1 and/or S2 state. The S3-to-S0 transition involves more drastic changes in the oxidation state and structure of the manganese/Ca2+ cluster (28Liang W. Roelofs T.A. Cinco R.M. Rompel A. Latimer M.J. Wa Yu O. Sauer K. Klein M.P. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3399-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Goussias C. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1369-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and these may indirectly influence the C-terminal carboxylate mode. The direct ligation of the Ala-344 α-carboxylate to the manganese ion is also consistent with changes observed in the low frequency region (>590 cm–1) of the S2/S1 difference spectrum after 13C labeling of the Ala-344 α-carboxylate shown in Fig. 4 because the bands for out-of-plane [π (COO)] or in-plane [δ(OCO)] bending modes of a carboxylate that ligates a metal ion could appear in this frequency region (27Percy G.C. Stenton H.S. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1976; : 2429-2433Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Cannon R.D. Jayassooriya U.A. Montri L. Saad A.K. Koru E. Bollen S.K. Sanderson W.R. Powell A.K.

Polyhedron. 1999; 18: 2321-2326Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Such vibrational modes may be partly responsible for the marked 12C/13C isotopic bands induced by the universal 13C labeling of the OEC (26Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this interpretation conflicts with the 3.5 Å x-ray model of the S1 state OEC, in which the C-terminal carboxylate of Ala-344 is located close to the Ca2+ ion of the Mn3CaO4 cubane-like cluster core (13Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar). We note in this context that the α-carboxylate is not resolved in any reported electron density map, presumably due to some radiation damage of crystals during data collection. Nevertheless, the present results may be alternatively interpreted by taking the 3.5 Å x-ray model into account as presented in Fig. 5 (in the parentheses). The C-terminal carboxylate of Ala-344 ligates the Ca2+ ion in an unidentate manner in the S1 state and unidentately ligates the MnIV ion, which was oxidized upon the S1-to-S2 transition, instead of the Ca2+ ion in the S2 state. The increase in the formal charge of the manganese ion from +3to +4 upon the S2 state formation may preferentially facilitate ligation of the C-terminal carboxylate to the higher valence manganese ion. We may presume that change in a formal charge from +2 (Ca2+) to +4 (MnIV) by this metal exchange affects the stretching modes of the Ala-344 α-carboxylate, but details of the consequences of this model cannot be evaluated for the lack of available data obtained using compatible model complexes. The C-terminal carboxylate remains bound to the same MnIV ion during the S2-to-S3 transition, but the metal exchange occurs again during the S3-to-S0 transition, which results in binding of a Ca2+ ion instead of a manganese ion in the S0 state. This scheme is compatible with the x-ray model but is not easy to reconcile with the reports that the depletion of the functional Ca2+ ion from OEC does not induce drastic changes in mid-frequency S2/S1 difference spectrum (32Kimura Y. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14061-14068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Kimura Y. Hasegawa K. Ono T-A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5844-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we succeeded in following the changes in structural and/or chemical properties of a specific amino acid ligand, α-carboxylate of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344, for the manganese/Ca2+ cluster in OEC during S-state cycling for the first time. Apparently, higher quality x-ray crystallographic data are required for the elucidation of the present vibrational spectroscopic results on a strictly structural base."
https://openalex.org/W2078736107,"The Rac1/Cdc42 effector p21-activated kinase (PAK) is activated by various signaling cascades including receptor-tyrosine kinases and integrins and regulates a number of processes such as cell proliferation and motility. PAK activity has been shown to be required for maximal activation of the canonical Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK Map kinase signaling cascade, likely because of PAK co-activation of Raf and MEK. Herein, we found that adhesion signaling also stimulates an association between PAK1 and ERK1/2. PAK1 and ERK1/2 co-immunoprecipitated from rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) plated on fibronectin, and the two proteins co-localized in membrane ruffles and adhesion complexes following PDGF-BB or sphingosine 1-phosphate treatment, respectively. Far Western analysis demonstrated a direct association between the two proteins, and peptide mapping identified an ERK2 binding site within the autoinhibitory domain of PAK1. Interestingly, deletion of a major ERK binding site in PAK attenuates activation of an ERK-dependent serum-responsive element (SRE)-luciferase reporter gene, indicating that association between PAK and ERK is required to facilitate ERK signaling. We also show that ERK2 phosphorylates PAK1 on Thr(212) in vitro and that Thr(212) is phosphorylated in smooth muscle cells following PDGF-BB treatment in an adhesion- and MEK/ERK-dependent fashion. Expression of a phosphomimic variant, PAK-T212E, does not alter ERK association, but markedly attenuates downstream ERK signaling. Taken together, these data suggest that PAK1 may facilitate ERK signaling by serving as a scaffold to recruit Raf, MEK, and ERK to adhesion complexes, and that subsequent growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of PAK-Thr(212) by ERK may serve to provide a negative feedback signal to control coordinate activation of ERK by growth factor- and matrix-induced signals."
https://openalex.org/W2110623540,"Intracellular calcium concentration rises have been reported following activation of GABA(A) receptors in neonatal preparations and attributed to activation of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. However, we show that, in cerebellar interneurons, GABA(A) agonists induce a somatodendritic Ca(2+) rise that persists at least until postnatal day 20 and is not mediated by depolarization-induced Ca(2+) entry. A local Ca(2+) elevation can likewise be elicited by repetitive stimulation of presynaptic GABAergic afferent fibers. We find that, following GABA(A) receptor activation, bicarbonate-induced Cl(-) entry leads to cell depolarization, Cl(-) accumulation, and osmotic tension. We propose that this tension induces the intracellular Ca(2+) rise as part of a regulatory volume decrease reaction. This mechanism introduces an unexpected link between activation of GABA(A) receptors and intracellular Ca(2+) elevation, which could contribute to activity-driven synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2051098120,"The metabolic reduction of 11-keto groups in glucocorticoid steroids such as cortisone leads to the nuclear receptor ligand cortisol. This conversion is an example of pre-receptor regulation and constitutes a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and possibly other derangements observed in the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and lowered insulin secretion. This reaction is carried out by the NADPH-dependent type 1 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD1), an enzyme attached through an integral N-terminal transmembrane helix to the lipid bilayer and located with its active site within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the crystal structure of recombinant guinea pig 11β-HSD1. This variant was determined in complex with NADP at 2.5 Å resolution and crystallized in the presence of detergent and guanidinium hydrochloride. The overall structure of guinea pig 11β-HSD1 shows a clear relationship to other members of the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases but harbors a unique C-terminal helical segment that fulfills three essential functions and accordingly is involved in subunit interactions, contributes to active site architecture, and is necessary for lipid-membrane interactions. The structure provides a model for enzyme-lipid bilayer interactions and suggests a funneling of lipophilic substrates such as steroid hormones from the hydrophobic membrane environment to the enzyme active site. The metabolic reduction of 11-keto groups in glucocorticoid steroids such as cortisone leads to the nuclear receptor ligand cortisol. This conversion is an example of pre-receptor regulation and constitutes a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and possibly other derangements observed in the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and lowered insulin secretion. This reaction is carried out by the NADPH-dependent type 1 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD1), an enzyme attached through an integral N-terminal transmembrane helix to the lipid bilayer and located with its active site within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the crystal structure of recombinant guinea pig 11β-HSD1. This variant was determined in complex with NADP at 2.5 Å resolution and crystallized in the presence of detergent and guanidinium hydrochloride. The overall structure of guinea pig 11β-HSD1 shows a clear relationship to other members of the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases but harbors a unique C-terminal helical segment that fulfills three essential functions and accordingly is involved in subunit interactions, contributes to active site architecture, and is necessary for lipid-membrane interactions. The structure provides a model for enzyme-lipid bilayer interactions and suggests a funneling of lipophilic substrates such as steroid hormones from the hydrophobic membrane environment to the enzyme active site. Glucocorticoid hormones control essential functions such as development, immune response, and metabolism. The primary mode of action is accomplished through binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, which, in combination with other factors, can induce or repress gene transcription. This basic principle is in a tissue-specific manner modulated by the enzyme system 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), 1The abbreviations used are: 11β-HSD1, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; AADP, 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 1The abbreviations used are: 11β-HSD1, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; AADP, 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PDB, Protein Data Bank. which interconverts the steroid C11 carbonyl/β-hydroxyl groups in cortisone and cortisol (in humans) or dehydrocorticosterone and corticosterone (in rodents) (1Stewart P.M.

Free plasma levels of cortisol/corticosterone are low, due to tight plasma protein (corticosteroid-binding globulin) binding, whereas cortisone/dehydrocorticosterone do not bind, resulting in high free levels of this glucocorticoid precursor, to be taken up by target cells. Cortisol/corticosterone bind to the glucocorticoid receptor and can exhibit in this receptor-ligand complex transcriptional activity; in contrast, cortisone/dehydrocorticosterone cannot. Thus 11β-HSD is a central “cellular switch,” which decides whether and how much receptor ligand is available (1Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Seckl J.R. Walker B.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 3Oppermann U.C. Persson B.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 4113-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At present, two isozymes (11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2) are known, and both act seemingly in a mutually exclusive manner (1Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 3Oppermann U.C. Persson B. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both are bound through N-terminal transmembrane domains to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 3Oppermann U.C. Persson B. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The active site of 11β-HSD1 is located in the lumenal compartment of the ER, whereas 11β-HSD2 faces the cytosolic space. These specific localizations explain why 11β-HSD1 is in most instances an NADPH-dependent cortisone reductase, whereas the type 2 enzyme acts as an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase of cortisol. The cellular functions of 11β-HSD1 (as a cortisol-producing catalyst) in insulin resistance and metabolic disorders establish this enzyme as a novel pharmacological target in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and successful inhibitor developments have been reported (5Walker B.R.

Both isozymes belong to the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) (1Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam.

SDR enzymes display a low level of residue identities (typically 10–30%) sharing few conserved sequence motifs, which are necessary for the maintenance of fold and catalysis (8Oppermann U.C.

About 30 three-dimensional structures of this family have been deposited in the PDB, showing a nearly superimposable α/β-folding pattern with a central Rossmann fold for nucleotide cofactor binding (8Oppermann U.C.

However, all enzymes show unique active site cavities, thus explaining the large variability in substrate specificities found in SDR enzymes. Purification and thorough characterization of the membrane-attached 11β-HSD isozymes have been difficult, and no structure determination has been reported yet. We recently described the successful expression and kinetic characterization of transmembrane domain-deleted human and guinea pig 11β-HSD1 variants (10Shafqat N. Elleby B. Svensson S. Shafqat J.

We now present the successful crystallization and structure determination at 2.5 Å of the guinea pig enzyme and discuss the structural implications on enzyme function and membrane attachment. Purification of Guinea Pig 11β-HSD1—N-terminally His6-tagged, transmembrane domain-deleted 11β-HSD1 was expressed in the Escherichia coli expression strain BL21(DE3) as described previously (10Shafqat N.

Optimization of protein production and purification conditions has been described in detail elsewhere (11Elleby B. Svensson S. Wu X. Stefansson K. Nilsson J. Hallen D. Oppermann U. Abrahmsen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In summary, the supernatant of the cell lysate was subjected to His bind affinity chromatography followed by incubation overnight in buffer supplemented with 0.5 m GuHCl (ICC Chemicals, Cincinatti, OH), 0.05% Triton X-100 (Anapoe X-100; Anatrace, Maumee, OH), 50 μm NADP+, and 25 μm arylsulfonamidothiazole inhibitor BVT.4584 (Biovitrum, Stockholm, Sweden), and a final gel filtration chromatographic step on a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was concentrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 m GuHCl, 20 μm NADP+, and 10 μm arylsulfonoamidothiazole inhibitor BVT.4584 to around 10 mg/ml using a 30,000 molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra concentration device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Crystallization of Guinea Pig 11β-HSD1—Prior to crystallization, the purified protein was diluted 10 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5% glycerol, 0.5 m GuHCl, 0.05% Anapoe X-100, 20 μm cortisone, and 40 μm NADP analogue, 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AADP; Sigma) and concentrated back to the starting volume using the concentration device described above. This procedure was repeated three times to attempt the exchange of NADP+ and BVT.4584 with AADP and cortisone, respectively. The protein was finally concentrated down to around 10 mg/ml and centrifuged in a Microfuge for 30 min to remove any aggregates. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C. For crystal growth, a 2-μl drop of the concentrated protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of precipitating solution containing polyethylene glycol 550 mono methyl ether (Fluka)(38–40%) and 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.5, and equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitating solution. The resulting tetragonal crystals containing a single guinea pig 11β-HSD1 dimer per asymmetric unit (space group I422; a = 118.3 Å, b = 118.3 Å c = 184.7Å, α = β = γ = 90°) appeared within 5–6 days. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—Single crystals (∼0.25 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm) were transferred directly to a loop and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100° K. Data were collected at the I711 beamline at MaxLAB synchrotron, Lund, Sweden, using a MAR area detector and at our home laboratory on a Rigaku RU-300 x-ray generator and Raxis IV++ image plate detector system. All data were processed using the HKL and CCP4 software packages (12Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19658) Google Scholar, 13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38222) Google Scholar). Structure Solution—The structure was solved by single isomorphous replacement using the autoSHARP (14Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. autoSHARP, an Automated Structure Determination System. Version 3.0.15., Global Phasing Ltd., Cambridge, UK2003Google Scholar). Two mercury compounds, mercury chloride (HgCl2) and mercury cyanate (HgCN), were used to prepare heavy atom derivative crystals, both yielding the same two major binding sites. A total of 6612 reflections to 3.3 Å were phased using the HgCl2 derivative, and 15,447 reflections to 2.7 Å were phased with the HgCN derivative with phasing powers of 1.92 and 1.23, respectively. As implemented in SHARP, solvent flattening using Solomon (15Abrahams J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) was run on experimental electron density maps from each hand, and the resulting correlation coefficients on E2 clearly indicated the correct solution (0.189 versus 0.105). After the solvent-flattening procedure, the figure of merit was improved from 0.34 to 0.76. The resulting electron density maps were of sufficient quality to place most residues of the guinea pig 11β-HSD1 dimer. Clear density for the cofactor was also observed. The model was built manually using O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan Kjeldgaard S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12997) Google Scholar), and subsequent rounds of refinement were carried out using REFMAC (17Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13695) Google Scholar). During the final refinement stages, water molecules were added to the protein model using ARP/wARP (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). The final model contained residues 24–300 from chain A and 24–292 from chain B, 2 NADP and 70 water molecules in the asymmetric unit with 90.3% of residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and 2 residues in the disallowed region. The model has root mean square deviations of 0.015 Å in bond lengths and 1.7 Å in bond angles. The Rcryst and Rfree values of the final model were 19.2 and 26.7%, respectively (Table I).

The variant crystallized in this study is devoid of the membrane-anchoring N-terminal portion; still, it is only moderately soluble and in addition has a tendency to form large aggregates (11Elleby B. Svensson S. Wu X. Stefansson K. Nilsson J. Hallen D. Oppermann U. Abrahmsen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To define conditions under which 11β-HSD1 exists as a monodisperse element in solution, we screened combinations of different detergents with varying subdenaturating concentrations of GuHCl. This screening resulted in a crystallization solution containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m GuHCl. It should be noted that the 11β-HSD1 retains full dehydrogenase and reductase activity after a 16-h incubation under these conditions (11Elleby B. Svensson S. Wu X. Stefansson K. Nilsson J. Hallen D. Oppermann U. Abrahmsen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Up to now, only few proteins have been crystallized in the presence of GuHCl, and 11β-HSD1 is the first example of a protein crystallized in the presence of both GuHCl and a detergent. Our preliminary results indicate that combinations of detergent and denaturants could be a general route to monodispersity and therefore a possible way of improving the odds for obtaining high quality crystals of low solubility proteins. Although the cofactor could be unambiguously modeled in the structure, the continuous positive difference density present in the substrate-binding pocket could not be accounted for by either cortisone or BVT.4584. Instead, it is possible that the active site is occupied by a buffer molecule, such as glycerol, guanidine, or BisTris. It can be concluded that the attempt to exchange the ligands complexed during protein purification with cortisone and AADP failed, suggesting that the presented ternary complex represents a stable conformation. Overall Structure of Guinea Pig 11β-HSD1—The crystal structure reveals one dimer per asymmetric unit, most probably representing the physiologically active entity (11Elleby B. Svensson S. Wu X. Stefansson K. Nilsson J. Hallen D. Oppermann U. Abrahmsen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The monomeric subunit of 11β-HSD1 shows the typical SDR architecture consisting of a central seven-stranded parallel β-sheet (βC-βA, βD-βG), twisted over all by 90°, sandwiched between three helices on each side (αD-αF and αC-αG) (Fig. 1). Strands βA to βF constitute the central part of the Rossman fold associated with NAD/NADP binding. The segment connecting βF and αG, residues 217–237, forms a lid over the substrate-binding pocket and contains a double turn α-helix (α1, residues 220–228). The C-terminal segment following βG, residues 260–297, protrudes from the domain and forms a long helical structure (α2 and α3) observed to pack against the C terminus of its dimer partner in an antiparallel manner. This segment interacts mainly with the second subunit and extends the dimerization interface, which for SDR enzymes is usually limited to helices E and F, resulting in a total buried surface of 3308 Å2 for each monomer. Notably, α3 and the loop preceding it interact with the substrate-binding loop of the second subunit and form parts of the substrate-binding pocket of that subunit. This C-terminal arrangement is reminiscent of dimeric Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase, in which the C terminus serves to cover part of the active site of the adjacent subunit and furthermore is involved in subunit dimerization ((19Benach J. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 383-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) PDB accession code 1A4U). This structural feature is even more pronounced in the dimeric medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes in which the two substrate pockets are lined with residues from both subunits (20Eklund H. Nordstrom B. Zeppezauer E. Soderlund G. Ohlsson I. Boiwe T. Branden C.I. FEBS Lett. 1974; 44: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Together with a proposed role in membrane interactions (discussed below), the C-terminal regions thus fulfill essential roles in subunit interactions, membrane topology, and active site architecture. At present, primary structures of 11β-HSD1 have been determined from 13 different species, and a pattern of conserved and variable segments of 11β-HSD1s has been established. 2M. Hult and U. Oppermann, manuscript in preparation. Six variable segments (V1–V6) can be defined, and they all cluster together to form parts of the substrate-binding pocket and the dimer interface (Fig. 1). Regions V1 (residues 122–131), V4 (residues 225–236), V5 (residues 259–269), and V6 (residues 280–300) of the second subunit form the substrate-binding pocket, whereas V2 (residues 176–182) form parts of the dimer interface interacting with V3 (residues 198–205) and V6 of the second subunit. The low homology around the substrate-binding pocket is manifested in the different substrate specificities (cortisol/corticosterone, 7α/7β-hydroxycholesterol) and the fact that species-specific inhibitors are frequently found. 2M. Hult and U. Oppermann, manuscript in preparation. The guinea pig 11β-HSD1 has an 8-residue extension in the C terminus when compared with the other orthologue sequences determined. Structural Features of Guinea Pig 11β-HSD1 and Relationship to the Short-chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Family—The closest structural neighbors to guinea pig 11β-HSD1 are SDR enzymes such as porcine carbonyl reductase (PDB accession code 1CYD), trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from Magnaporthe grisea (PDB accession code 1DOH), human estradiol 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (PDB accession code 1BHS), and E. coli 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (PDB accession code 1AHI), showing high similarity (about 2 Å root mean square deviation over 240 residues) in the central scaffold. In particular, the essential sequence motifs of the SDR family are found at homologous positions, such as the N-terminal sequence TGX3GXG (positions 17–24), necessary for nucleotide binding, and the active site tetrad consisting of Asn-119, Ser-170, Tyr-183, and Lys-187 (21Oppermann U.C.

Commun. 1992; 188: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Major differences between these enzymes are seen in their substrate-binding loop, probably reflecting the differences in substrate specificity, as well as in the previously mentioned C-terminal fragment, reflecting differences in quaternary structure arrangement. A segment of IRVN residues, with Asn constituting an N-linked glycosylation site in 11β-HSD1, is highly conserved in SDR enzymes. Mutational studies on this residue in a related steroid dehydrogenase showed the essential nature for catalysis, and sequence comparisons suggested a homologous role for Asn-207 found in 11β-HSD1 (9Filling C. Nordling E. Benach J. Berndt K.D. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of this residue in rat 11β-HSD1 indeed revealed that it is essential for activity (25Agarwal A.K. Mune T. Monder C. White P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Later experiments, however, suggested that the glycan moiety itself is not a prerequisite for activity (26Blum A. Martin H.J. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the guinea pig 11β-HSD1 structure, the conserved Asn-207 is located at the enzyme surface in a loop connecting helix F and strand F, which is consistent with glycan modification in a eukaryotic cellular ER environment. Despite an apparent homology to the conserved Asn residue in the IRVN sequence of SDRs (9Filling C. Nordling E. Benach J. Berndt K.D. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), Asn-207 in guinea pig 11β-HSD1 does not connect the active site and the C-terminal part of SDRs; instead, this stabilizing function is fulfilled by Thr-211. Its side-chain OH connects through a water molecule to the OH of Ser-164, located in strand E close to the active site, and to the carbonyl of the C-terminal residue Gln-253. Thus the role of Asn-207 in catalysis remains unknown; however, it is possible that Asn-207 is necessary for glycan modification and subsequent folding in the ER of mammalian cells. Guinea pig 11β-HSD1 contains cysteine residues at sequence positions 78, 213, and 241. Two of these residues, Cys-213 and Cys-241, are found in all sequenced 11β-HSD1 variants, whereas only the porcine orthologue shows variation at position 78 (Ser instead of Cys). A disulfide bond involving Cys-78 and Cys-213 has been suggested to be present in the rabbit orthologue (27Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is apparently supported by the subcellular localization of the catalytic domain of 11β-HSD1 within the ER lumen, which provides an oxidative environment suitable for disulfide bond formation. However, examination of the guinea pig structure raises serious doubts about the possibility of an intramolecular disulfide bond to be formed in 11β-HSD1 variants. Although the distance between the α-carbons of Cys-78 and Cys-213 is about 20 Å, the corresponding distance between the closest cysteine pair, Cys-213 and Cys-241, is almost 10 Å, thus excluding intrasubunit disulfide formation. Active Site Topography and Catalysis—The general oxidoreductase mechanism of SDRs is reflected in a common active site configuration. The binary 11β-HSD1-NADP+ structure fulfills the requirements for a catalytically competent complex. In general, hydride transfer in SDR enzymes is carried through by the C4-H from the S-face of the coenzyme (28Jornvall H. Woenckhaus C. Schattle E. Jeck R. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in which Tyr-183 acts as an acid-base catalyst, Lys-187 lowers the pKa of the tyrosine hydroxyl, and Ser-170 stabilizes the substrate carbonyl group (28Jornvall H. Woenckhaus C. Schattle E. Jeck R. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the Tyr and Lys residues form together with the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose, a water molecule, and the main-chain carbonyl of the conserved Asn-143 residue, a hydrogen-bonding network, suggesting a proton relay from the active site to the bulk solvent (Fig. 2) (22Filling C.

Residues surrounding the region forming the cleft for the nicotinamide ring and its ribose are Asn-119, Val-121, Tyr-123, Val-168, Ser-169, Ser-170, Tyr-183, Lys-187, Leu-215, Gly-216, Leu-217, Ile-218, and Ala-22. Residues Leu-215 and Gly-216 that terminate β-strand F (Fig. 1) are at homologous positions of a conserved Pro-Gly motif found in other SDRs and are oriented toward the R-side of the nicotinamide ring. The carbonyl and amide groups of this conserved glycine residue are possibly involved in the initiation of catalysis (29Ghosh D. Vihko P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); accordingly, in guinea pig 11β-HSD1, the carbonyl of Gly-193 is oriented toward the C4h of the R-side of NADP. The pyrophosphate and adenine ribose moieties are bound in a cavity built up mainly by the conserved residues Gly-41–Ile-46 and the segment Ile-220–Thr-222. A mostly apolar surface for the adenine ring is created by segments Gly-91–Met-93 and residues His-120, Val-121, and Val-142, whereas the other side of the ring is dominated by the adenine ribose. The 2′-OH phosphate of NADP is bound to Ser-67 and Arg-66, but not to Lys-44, as observed in other NADP(H)-dependent SDRs, such as mouse lung carbonyl reductase (30Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NAD(P)(H) specificity versus NAD(H) is achieved through Arg-66. This residue is not present in NAD(H)-dependent SDRs and is also preceded in these enzymes by an Asp residue conferring electrostatic repulsion to a 2′-phosphate (30Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 31Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The shape of the substrate-binding pocket is compatible with its function to accommodate cortisol/cortisone and 7β-hydroxycholesterol/7-ketocholesterol. The substrate-accessible void is 640 Å3 and is predominantly lined by non-polar residues (Fig. 2a). To gain insights into the determinants for substrate binding, cortisol was manually docked into the present structure (Fig. 2b). Carbon 11 was fixed within hydride transfer distance to C4 and the C11 hydroxyl group within hydrogen-bonding distance to Ser-170 and Tyr-183. These experiments reveal that cortisol fits well into the active site, provided that a side-chain movement of Tyr-123 occurs for accommodation of the substrate. Residues in α1, the nicotinamide ring of NADP, and residues in variable segment 1 constitute the lower part of the pocket, whereas Ile-180 and Leu-217 are crucial for the middle part. The upper part, which according to our modeling should accommodate the A-ring of the substrate, offers several possible hydrogen bond donors to the 3-keto group of cortisol, e.g. the side-chain hydroxyls of Tyr-177 and Tyr-231 and the backbone amide nitrogen of Leu-217. Notably, Ser-280 and Tyr-284 of the second subunit are lining the upper part of the substrate-binding pocket. The pocket stretches further up at this end, and the substrate-binding loop, the loop connecting βF and α2, together with α2 of the second subunit form a possible entrance. Orientation of 11β-HSD1 with Respect to the Lipid Membrane—The location of the N termini together with the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal helices in the 11β-HSD1 dimer suggest a possible orientation of the molecule with respect to the membrane surface (Figs. 3 and 4). The two C-terminal helical segments from the dimer form a non-polar plateau (∼3000 Å2), which is encircled by a ring of positively charged residues (Fig. 3). This arrangement suggests that the plateau is located in the non-polar center of the membrane with the charged residues forming salt bridges with the displaced phospholipid and sulfolipid head groups. This model characterizes monotopic membrane proteins, and such a non-polar surface contact formed at a dimer interface has been previously observed for squalene cyclase (32Wendt K.U. Poralla K. Schulz G.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and prostaglandin-H2-synthase (33Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Model of 11β-HSD1 positioning in the lipid membrane.

The substrate binding site and entrance for one subunit is shown in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A possible entrance to the substrate-binding pocket is formed by the substrate-binding loop, the loop connecting βF, and helices α2 and α2 of the second subunit. With the suggested membrane orientation, this entrance makes the catalytic site accessible for lipophilic substrates such as cortisol or 7β-hydroxycholesterol, enriched in the lipid membrane. Accordingly, this model intuitively suggests a funneling of hydrophobic steroids from the membrane into the active site cleft. This hypothesis further explains the discrepancies between efficient steroid conversion at low concentrations and the somewhat higher apparent Km values observed in vitro (10Shafqat N. Elleby B.

Taken together, this study provides detailed insight into the structural features and active site architecture of a physiologically important hormone-activating enzyme and drug target. Furthermore, the observed hydrophobic surface and the proposed membrane association might constitute a general model for lipid interactions of similar membrane-bound SDR enzymes such as 17β-HSD types 2 and 3 or enzymes involved in retinoic acid metabolism such as retinol dehydrogenases.

https://openalex.org/W2057979382,"Neuronal apoptosis has been shown to require de novo RNA/protein synthesis. However, very few genes whose expression is necessary for inducing apoptosis have been identified so far. To systematically identify such genes, we have used genome-scale, long oligonucleotide microarrays and characterized the gene expression profile of cerebellar granule neurons in the early phase of apoptosis elicited by KCl deprivation. We identified 368 significantly differentially expressed genes, including most of the genes previously reported to be transcriptionally regulated in this paradigm. In addition, we identified several hundreds of genes whose transcriptional regulation has never been associated with neuronal apoptosis. We used automated Gene Ontology annotation, analysis of promoter sequences, and statistical tools to characterize these regulations. Although differentially expressed genes included some components of the apoptotic machinery, this functional category was not significantly over-represented among regulated genes. On the other hand, categories related to signal transduction were the most significantly over-represented group. This indicates that the apoptotic machinery is mainly constitutive, whereas molecular pathways that lead to the activation of apoptotic components are transcriptionally regulated. In particular, we show for the first time that signaling pathways known to be involved in the control of neuronal survival are regulated at the transcriptional level and not only by post-translational mechanisms. Moreover, our approach provides insights into novel transcription factors and novel mechanisms, such as the unfolded protein response and cell adhesion, that may contribute to the induction of neuronal apoptosis.

Moreover, our approach provides insights into novel transcription factors and novel mechanisms, such as the unfolded protein response and cell adhesion, that may contribute to the induction of neuronal apoptosis. From the beginning of its description, apoptosis has been considered as an active process requiring RNA and protein synthesis, especially in neurons. Blockade by macromolecular synthesis inhibitors has long been used as a criterion to establish the apoptotic nature of a particular cell death (discussed in Ref. 1Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although identification of death receptor-induced pathways that do not require de novo protein synthesis has slightly restrained this notion (2Martin S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 141-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the question of the transcriptional control of apoptosis, the role it plays, and the nature of newly expressed genes still remains. The first studies on the transcriptional regulation of apoptosis were orientated by the concept of a preset rheostat based on the observation that the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 could be counteracted by pro-apoptotic Bax (3Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). Many studies were undertaken to examine possible expression variations of these two proteins. In fact, transcription of selective members of the Bcl-2 family was repeatedly reported during different forms of apoptosis, in particular in neurons. These data suggested that differential expression of certain genes may be essential to the initiation of apoptotic neuronal death. However, the number of genes whose differential expression could be essential to the initiation of apoptosis has become difficult to estimate. At least 20 Bcl-2 family members (4Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) and an increasing number of other components of the core apoptotic machinery (5Reed J.C. Doctor K. Rojas A. Zapata J.M. Stehlik C. Fiorentino L. Damiano J. Roth W. Matsuzawa S. Newman R. Takayama S. Marusawa H. Xu F. Salvesen G. Godzik A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1376-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have been identified in mammals to date. Moreover, much less is known about early mechanisms leading to the activation of the apoptotic machinery, and they could also be regulated at the transcriptional level. The expression of all these components cannot be simultaneously detected by classical methods used to evaluate mRNA (reverse transcription (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; CGN, cerebellar granule neuron(s); FDR, false discovery rate; GO, Gene Ontology; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; PI, phosphatidylinositol.-PCR, Northern blotting, and differential display), which can give only a biased view of transcriptional regulations associated with apoptosis. The recent development of genome-scale methods of gene expression analysis now offers new perspectives (6Chiang L.W. Grenier J.M. Ettwiller L. Jenkins L.P. Ficenec D. Martin J. Jin F. DiStefano P.S. Wood A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2814-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) are particularly suited to conduct this kind of study. CGN are one of the best characterized in vitro models of neuronal apoptosis (7Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which depends on the synthesis of new RNA and proteins (8D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Moreover, CGN constitute the most abundant neuronal population in the central nervous system of mammals and can be cultured in vitro up to 98% homogeneity. When dissociated from early postnatal mice, CGN can survive and differentiate in culture in the presence of serum and depolarizing levels of extracellular KCl ([KCl]o = 25 mm) (7Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depolarization is presumed to mimic the endogenous excitatory activity that is required for survival during cerebellar development in vivo (9Ikonomidou C. Bosch F. Miksa M. Bittigau P. Vo ̈ckler J. Dikranian K. Tenkova T.I. Stefovska V. Turski L. Olney J.W. Science. 1999; 283: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Lowering [KCl]o to 5 mm in the absence of serum triggers apoptosis (8D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). This presumably mimics the naturally occurring death that takes place in the external granular layer of newborn rat cerebellum (10Wood K.A. Dipasquale B. Youle R.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this study, we used genome-scale, long oligonucleotide microarrays to discover sets of genes associated with CGN apoptosis induction. We focused data analysis on components of the core apoptotic machinery. We identified several of these genes whose up-regulation has not been previously reported during neuronal apoptosis. However, genes involved in the execution of apoptosis were not significantly over-represented among differentially expressed genes. Primary Cultures of CGN—CGN cultures were prepared from 7-day-old murine pups (C57Bl/6J mice, Charles River Laboratories) as described by Miller and Johnson (7Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, freshly dissected cerebella were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.25 mg/ml trypsin, and cells were dissociated in Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I by several steps of mechanical disruption. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mm KCl to achieve a final concentration of 25 mm. The cell suspension was filtered through a Falcon 40-μm cell strainer and plated in a coated dish for 25 min to allow attachment of non-neuronal cells. Neurons were then resuspended, counted, and seeded at a density of 25 × 104 cells/cm2 in culture dishes previously coated with poly-d-lysine (BD Biosciences). The granule neurons were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 6% CO2 and 94% air for 6 days. To prevent proliferation of remaining non-neuronal cells, 10 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside was added to the culture medium 24 h after plating. At 6 days in vitro, granule neurons represented >98% of the cultured cells (data not shown). KCl Deprivation, Survival, and Apoptotic Assays—CGN were washed and incubated for the indicated times in serum-free basal Eagle's medium supplemented with l-Gln, HEPES, antibiotics, and the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist (+)-MK-801 (1 μm) and containing either 25 mm KCl (K25 medium) or 5 mm KCl (K5 medium). We chose to use K25 medium as a control instead of the initial culture medium to exclude gene expression differences resulting from serum deprivation. Serum deprivation has been shown to induce the death of a small proportion of cultured CGN (7Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this neuronal death proceeds mainly through necrosis (11Villalba M. Bockaert J. Journot L. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, we added 1 μm MK-801 to both the K25 and K5 media to avoid any change in gene expression due to uncontrolled N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor stimulation by endogenously released glutamate. Neuronal survival was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, the culture medium was replaced with K25 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and neurons were returned to the incubator for 2 h. The medium was removed, and blue formazan produced by living cells was solubilized in Me2SO. The absorbance of blue formazan was estimated at 570 nm. To assess apoptosis, cytochrome c subcellular localization was detected by immunocytochemistry using an antibody from Pharmingen; caspase-3 activation was estimated by immunostaining with an antibody that specifically recognizes cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology); and nuclear condensation was visualized by Hoechst 33258 staining. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were performed as described previously (12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNAqueous® kit and treated with the DNase I from the DNA-free™ kit (Ambion, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA with Oligotex™ (Qiagen Inc.). Two rounds of hybridization with oligo(dT) beads were carried out successively to improve mRNA purity. RNAs were used to perform a two-step RT-PCR. Briefly, either 1 μg of total RNA or 50 ng of mRNA were reverse-transcribed using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 2.5 μm N6 random primers and 0.5 mm dNTP. Either 10 or 0.5 ng of the resulting cDNA were used as template for real-time PCR using ABI Prism 7000 with the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed with Primer Express™ software (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of all the primers used are provided in Supplemental Table 1. PCR was performed in a volume of 10 μl in the presence of 300 nm specific primers. Thermal cycling parameters were 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were analyzed with ABI Prism 7000 SDS software. The relative amounts of specifically amplified cDNAs were calculated with the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt) method (13Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar). The β2-microglobulin amplicon was used as a reference. Long Oligonucleotide Microarray Fabrication—The long oligonucleotides of the Mouse Genome Oligo Set Version 2 (Operon) were used. Operon provided the following information about the oligonucleotides. The 16,463 70-mers were designed from representative sequences of the UniGene Database Build Mm.102 (February 2002) and the Mouse Reference Sequence (RefSeq) Database, each oligonucleotide representing a unique gene. An amino linker was attached to the 5′-end of each oligonucleotide. Oligonucleotides were designed to have melting temperatures of 78 ± 5 °C. More than 98% of the oligonucleotides were within 1000 bases from the 3′-end of the available gene sequence. Oligonucleotides were selected to limit secondary structure. BLAST alignments were performed to exclude oligonucleotides that could cross-hybridize with other sequences of the Mouse UniGene Database. Each oligonucleotide had ≤70% of overall identity to any other gene and could not have >20 contiguous bases common to any other gene. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in Tris/EDTA and diluted twice in 2× spotting solution (ArrayIt, TeleChem International, Inc.) to a final concentration of 10 μm. Oligonucleotides were spotted using Amersham Generation III Array spotter on aminosilane-coated mirror glass slides (7-Star, Amersham Biosciences). Prior to hybridization, DNA was cross-linked to the slides by UV irradiation and washed twice with 0.2% SDS solution and twice with distilled water. cDNA Labeling—Poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed, and cDNA was labeled using the CyScribe cDNA post-labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) in a two-step procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the first step, aminoallyl-dUTP was incorporated during first-strand cDNA synthesis. A mixture of random nonamers and anchored oligo(dT) was used for priming the synthesis catalyzed by CyScript™ reverse transcriptase. For each reaction, 500 ng of mRNA were used as template, and incubation was carried out for 2 h at 42 °C. Following alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA template, the cDNA was purified on QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that QIAquick wash buffer was replaced with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 80% ethanol, and cDNA was eluted with 4 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5). In the second step, the aminoallyl-modified cDNA was chemically coupled to Cy3 and Cy5 N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters. The coupling reactions were performed separately with Cy3 and Cy5 so that the cDNA derived from neurons incubated in K25 or K5 medium was labeled with a different dye. The coupling reaction was terminated by the addition of hydroxylamine. The fluorescent cDNAs were subsequently purified using the CyScribe GFX purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Dual Color Microarray Hybridization—Of the cDNA derived from each condition (K5 or K25 medium), one-half was labeled with Cy3 and the other half with Cy5 to perform dye swap hybridizations: K25-Cy3 + K5-Cy5 and K25-Cy5 + K5-Cy3. This enabled us to account for any bias in dye coupling or emission efficiency of Cy dyes. The two labeled cDNA preparations (0.9–1.2 μg/condition) were combined together with 10 μg of oligonucleotide A80 and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. They were subsequently added to microarray hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and applied to the microarrays in individual chambers of an automated slide processor (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was carried out at 37 °C for 12 h. Hybridized slides were washed at 37 °C successively with 1× SSC and 0.2% SDS for 10 min, twice with 0.1× SSC and 0.2% SDS for 10 min, with 0.1× SSC for 1 min, and with isopropyl alcohol before air drying. Microarrays were immediately scanned in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels with an Amersham Generation III Array scanner with 10-μm resolution. ArrayVision™ software (Imaging Research Inc.) was used for image analysis. A local background was calculated for each spot as the median value of the fluorescence intensities of four squares surrounding the spot. This background was subtracted from the foreground fluorescence intensity. Detection limit was calculated as (average + (3 × S.D.)) of the fluorescence intensities of three different negative controls spotted 12 times along each slide. Intensity values under this detection limit were replaced with the threshold value before any normalization and statistical analysis. Microarray Data Analyses—Fluorescence intensity ratios from each microarray were normalized using the R package SMA (statistical microarray analysis) by the local weight regression (lowess) algorithm called print-tip (14Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). In this procedure, spotting variation is taken into account, and the normalizing quotient varies with the intensity of the spot. Once the two channels had been normalized for each microarray, normalization was performed between array data by creating a matrix of normalized log intensity ratios across different slides. We then scaled the matrix such that each column had the same median absolute deviation as described by Yang et al. (14Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). Normalized data were analyzed using a variance estimate and a permutation technique known as SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; available at www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html) (15Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar). SAM was used with the one-class response and 100 permutation parameters using the k-nearest neighbor approach for lost values. The delta value was obtained by fixing the false discovery rate (FDR) for both the median and 95th percentile to 1 or 5%. An FDR of 1% indicates that, on average, 1% of the genes called significantly regulated are not actually regulated (15Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar). The eGOn Version 1.0 software of the Norwegian Microarray Consortium (available at www.mikromatrise.no) was used to assign Gene Ontology (GO) terms to individual genes from the Oligo Set and the differentially expressed gene list. Annotated genes were then clustered in functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology Consortium (16Consortium Gene Ontology Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27692) Google Scholar). To simplify representation, only the third row of GO nodes have been considered, and redundancy was avoided when possible. Despite this, in many cases, single genes were associated with multiple GO identifiers. This reflects the biological reality that a particular protein may function in several processes, may contain domains that carry out diverse molecular functions, and may be active in multiple locations in the cell. This explains why the sum of gene numbers contained in the different categories is often greater than the total number of annotated genes. Statistical tests available on the eGOn Version 1.0 web site were performed to identify categories of genes in which differentially expressed genes were over-represented. A two-sided, one-sample binomial test was implemented, and a p value was calculated for each GO term. This test identified terms where the number of differentially expressed genes divided by the number of genes in the Oligo Set was greater than the overall proportion (the total number of differentially expressed genes divided by the total number of genes in the Oligo Set). Genomic sequences 1 kb upstream and 200 bp downstream from transcriptional start sites of genes from the Oligo Set and the differentially expressed gene list were retrieved from DBTSS (available at dbtss.hgc.jp/index.html). They were analyzed for the presence of consensus DNA-binding sites with Match™ software and the TRANSFAC Database (available at www.gene-regulation.com/) using high quality matrices to minimize the occurrence of false positive sites. A binomial test, implemented as described above, identified consensus binding sites over-represented in the promoters of differentially expressed genes compared with those of the Oligo Set. Temporal Analysis of CGN Apoptosis—CGN were completely protected from KCl deprivation-induced apoptosis by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 1a). This supports the notion that de novo RNA and protein synthesis is required for neuronal apoptosis. Expression of the genes necessary for triggering apoptosis is likely to precede the point after which neurons are irreversibly committed to death. To determine this point, we performed a series of temporal analyses based on different apoptotic criteria such as cytochrome c release from mitochondria, caspase-3 activation, and chromatin condensation. The appearance of these hallmarks was approximately concomitant (Fig. 1b). We also determined the commitment points after which half of the neurons could no longer be rescued by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or re-addition of 25 mm KCl to the medium (Fig. 1c) because, at that time, genes necessary to apoptosis induction have already been expressed. Our data were consistent with results reported by others in mouse CGN (17Nardi N. Avidan G. Daily D. Zilkha-Falb R. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar): transcriptional and translational commitment points were ∼5 h after deprivation. The temporal curves of apoptosis (Fig. 1b) and KCl rescue (Fig. 1c) indicated that 50% of the neurons were still alive after 7 h. These results suggested that expression of determinant genes preceded first manifestations of apoptosis by ∼2 h. This was confirmed by the expression time course of genes known to be implicated in the triggering of CGN apoptosis such as bim-EL, DP5, and c-jun (18Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson Jr., E.M.

Moreover, Western blotting showed a peak of protein levels and phosphorylation of c-Jun after 6 h and a peak of Bim-EL after 4 h, both preceding massive cleavage and activation of caspase-3 (8 h) (Fig. 1e). These data prompted us to analyze the gene expression profile of CGN 4 h after KCl withdrawal, this time appearing as optimal to identify genes involved in the induction of neuronal apoptosis. Gene Expression Profiling of Apoptotic CGN—Gene expression profiles of CGN maintained in K25 medium (control) and in K5 medium (apoptosis) for 4 h were compared using high density long oligonucleotide microarrays. Three independent experiments were performed using distinct neuronal cultures. For >50% of the oligonucleotides, fluorescence intensities were above the detection threshold, indicating a good sensitivity. Data analysis also revealed good normalization (data not shown) as well as good reproducibility (Fig. 2a). SAM statistical analysis (15Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The analysis showed that 278 genes were significantly up-regulated and that 90 genes were significantly down-regulated in apoptotic neurons compared with controls. -Fold change values distributed as described in the legend to Fig. 2b.

We used the lists of gene families defined by Reed et al. (5Reed J.C. Doctor K. Rojas A. Zapata J.M. Stehlik C. Fiorentino L. Damiano J. Roth W. Matsuzawa S. Newman R. Takayama S. Marusawa H. Xu F.

The expression measurements of the 229 genes contained in these different categories are presented in Supplemental Table 2. Only six genes were found to be significantly up-regulated after SAM performed with 1% FDR (Supplemental Table 2): DP5, bim, caspase-3, caspase-6, Unc5h2, and Cide-A. A less stringent SAM performed with 5% FDR identified four additional regulated genes: Raidd/Cradd, mal/Tirap, Traf3, and cytochrome c (Supplemental Table 2). All of these gene expression changes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Table I). However, K5/K25 medium ratios determined by quantitative PCR were too low for mal/Tirap (1.33 ± 0.14) and Traf3 (1.72 ± 0.26) to warrant further analysis. Two additional genes that were not identified as significantly regulated by SAM but with a K5/K25 medium ratio on microarrays above 1.6 were found to be actually up-regulated during CGN apoptosis by real-time PCR: caspase-7 and p73 (Table I). In addition, fasL up-regulation that was not detected on microarrays but that had been previously reported during CGN apoptosis (21Ginham R. Harrison D.C. Facci L. Skaper S. Philpott K.L. Neurosci.

Overall, only 11 genes of the 229 gene-containing list of the apoptotic machinery were found to be significantly regulated during CGN apoptosis. In addition, most of the gene expression changes previously reported during CGN apoptosis and the regulations of some genes involved in signaling pathways controlling CGN survival were also detected both by our microarray measurements and by quantitative RT-PCR (Table I). For instance, we detected an increased level for the following genes: caspase-3; the Bcl-2 family members bim and DP5; the transcription factors c-jun, c-fos, and egr-1; the secreted glycoprotein neuronal pentraxin-1; the stress-responsive inhibitor of thioredoxin, Vdup-1; the potassium channel Task-1; and the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein Igfbp5, as observed by other investigators (7Miller T.M.

https://openalex.org/W1964826832,"Long-term maintenance and modification of synaptic strength involve the turnover of neurotransmitter receptors. Glutamate receptors are constitutively and acutely internalized, presumptively through clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. Here, we show that cpg2 is a brain-specific splice variant of the syne-1 gene that encodes a protein specifically localized to a postsynaptic endocytotic zone of excitatory synapses. RNAi-mediated CPG2 knockdown increases the number of postsynaptic clathrin-coated vesicles, some of which traffic NMDA receptors, disrupts the constitutive internalization of glutamate receptors, and inhibits the activity-induced internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors. Manipulating CPG2 levels also affects dendritic spine size, further supporting a function in regulating membrane transport. Our results suggest that CPG2 is a key component of a specialized postsynaptic endocytic mechanism devoted to the internalization of synaptic proteins, including glutamate receptors. The activity dependence and distribution of cpg2 expression further suggest that it contributes to the capacity for postsynaptic plasticity inherent to excitatory synapses."

The emergence of pathogenic bacteria with clinically significant resistance to conventional antibiotics is a major public health concern and provides much of the impetus for current attempts to develop newer types of clinical antibiotics that can evade bacterial drug resistance mechanisms (1Hancock R.E.

Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2001: 149-165Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides are among the more promising of such research candidates and are particularly attractive because they are usually part of the innate immune response of higher organisms and seem to act by degrading the barrier properties of bacterial cell membranes. Because of their nonspecific mode of action, the evolution of bacterial resistance to these agents is difficult, and these agents have thus maintained their effectiveness over evolutionary time. Unfortunately, these same properties tend to make many antimicrobial peptides unsuitable for general clinical application, mainly because of their tendency to cause hemolysis (3Izumiya N. Kato T.

Consequently, much effort is currently being expended to produce antimicrobial peptides of comparable antibiotic effectiveness but with a reduced toxicity to animal cells.

Numerous studies by us and others have shown that disruption of the barrier properties of cell membranes is the basis of the antimicrobial and hemolytic properties of GS (3Izumiya N. Kato T.

Thus, differential scanning calorimetry studies indicate that GS interacts more strongly with anionic than with zwitterionic phospholipid bilayers and more strongly with more fluid than with less fluid model membrane systems (11Prenner E.J. Lewis R.N.A.H. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 31P NMR spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction both indicate that GS can induce inverted nonlamellar cubic phases in various phospholipid vesicles and that GS also causes the thinning of phospholipid bilayers (12Prenner E.J.

Also, densitometry and sound velocimetry both indicate that GS binding to PC bilayers increases the motional freedom of the lipid hydrocarbon chains while increasing the volume compressibility and decreasing the density of its host bilayer (14Krivanek R. Rybar P. Prenner E.J. McElhaney R.N. Hianik T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1510: 452-463Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also indicates that GS is located at the polar/apolar interfacial region of phospholipid bilayers, that it penetrates more deeply into anionic and more fluid phospholipid bilayers (15Lewis R.N.A.H. Prenner E.J. Kondejewski L. Flach C.R. Mendelsohn R. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15193-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and that the presence of cholesterol attenuates the disordering effects of GS on phospholipid bilayers, primarily by reducing the penetration of the peptide into phospholipid model membranes (16Prenner E.J. Lewis R.N.A.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Finally, 19F NMR spectroscopic studies of a 19F-labeled GS analog indicate that GS is aligned with its cyclic β-sheet ring lying flat in the plane of the bilayer, as is consistent with its amphiphilic character (17Salgado J. Grage S.L. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Ulrich J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, because of the nonspecific basis of its action, GS is also strongly hemolytic, and its use as a clinical antibiotic is thus restricted to topical applications. However, recent work has shown that structural analogs of GS can be designed with comparable antimicrobial activity but with markedly reduced hemolytic activity (see below), suggesting the possibility that appropriate GS derivatives might be developed for use as oral or injectable broad spectrum antibiotics. The relationship between the chemical structure of GS analogs and their antimicrobial and hemolytic activities has been the subject of numerous studies (3Izumiya N. Kato T. Aoyaga H. Waki M. Kondo M.

Biochemistry of Peptide Antibiotics: Recent Advances in the Biotechnology of β-Lactams and Microbial Bioactive Peptides. Walter de Gruyter and Co., Berlin1990: 205-244Google Scholar). Unfortunately, most structural modifications of the GS molecule itself result in more or less parallel variations in antimicrobial and hemolytic activities.

In particular they demonstrated that by varying both the size of the GS ring system and the orientation of certain amino acid side chains relative to the plane of the ring, one can obtain analogs that exhibit considerable (≥100-fold) dissociation of their antimicrobial activity from their hemolytic properties (6Kondejewski L.H.

To address these issues, we have examined and compared the structure-activity relationships of some GS analogs that were obtained by enantiomeric inversions of one or more of the Lys residues of GS14. These peptides have identical amino acid compositions and sequences and are well suited for this type of study because their antibiotic and hemolytic activities and their capacity to discriminate between bacterial and animal cells span a fairly broad range. We present here our studies of the conformational and amphipathic properties of these GS14 analogs, their ability to destabilize and permeabilize model lipid membranes, and their ability to inhibit the growth of the cell wall-less bacterium, Acholeplasma laidlawii B. We also present an evaluation of how the structural and physicochemical properties of these antimicrobial peptides are reflected in the capacity to disrupt lipid bilayer membranes and the capacity for effective discrimination between bacterial and animal cell membranes. GS14 and the other peptides were prepared as described previously (21McInnes C. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14287-14297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and other high purity reagents were obtained commercially and used as received. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C using quartz cells of 0.1-cm path length with a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan). Spectra were recorded using solutions containing 100 μm peptide and either buffer alone, equivolume mixtures of buffer and TFE, or buffer containing 30 mm SDS. The buffer utilized was composed of final concentrations of 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. RP-HPLC analyses were performed on a Zorbax SB-C8 column (150 × 2.1-mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size, 300 Å pore size; Rockland Technologies, Wilmington, DE) using a Hewlett Packard 1100 chromatograph with a linear AB gradient of 0.5% B/min (solvent A: 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. Retention times were recorded at temperatures between 5 and 80 °C (3 °C increments) using the temperature profiling RP-HPLC protocols described previously (25Lee D.L. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22918-22927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 31P NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker MSL-400 solid state spectrometer operating at 161 MHz for 31P, using data acquisition and data processing protocols similar to those described previously (12Prenner E.J. Lewis R.N.A.H. Newman K.C. Gruner S.M. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7906-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Peptide-induced leakage of calcein from POPC vesicles (diameter ∼ 200 nm) was measured at 37 °C using previously published procedures (16Prenner E.J. Lewis R.N.A.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A. laidlawii B was cultured in chloroform-extracted bovine serum albumin-free medium, and cell growth was monitored turbidometrically (26Silvius J.R. McElhaney R.N. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The effect of the antimicrobial peptides on cell growth was monitored as a function of time after the addition of these peptides to the culture medium just before a 10% (by volume) inoculation with cells in the mid log phase of growth. Cell growth is expressed as a percentage of the maximum growth obtained in the absence of peptide. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopic Studies—Illustrated in Fig. 1 are the CD spectra exhibited by GS14 and the six diasteriomeric derivatives examined. In both aqueous and membrane mimetic media, the CD spectra of GS14 exhibit large negative molar ellipticity values at wavelengths between 210 and 230 nm. This result is expected because GS14, like GS, is known to exist predominantly in an antiparallel β-sheet structure with type II β-turns (27Gibbs A.G. Kondejewski L.H. Gronwalk W. Nip A.M. Hodges R.S. Wishart D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Over most of the range examined, GS14 exhibits molar ellipticities that are considerably greater than those of all other derivatives. Evidently, enantiomeric inversion of any of the Lys residues of GS14 causes significant distortion of the stable antiparallel β-sheet conformation that GS14 normally adopts. Also, GS14 analogs derived from single Lys inversions all exhibit higher molar ellipticity values than does GS14dK2K4, which in turn exhibits molar ellipticity values that are higher than those exhibited by GS14dK2K4K9K11, indicating that conformational distortions of the GS14 structure caused by enantiomeric inversion of its Lys residues increase progressively with the number of such inversions. Moreover, molar ellipticity values of the GS14 analogs derived from single Lys enantiomeric inversions decrease in the general order GS14dK11 ≥ GS14dK4 > GS14dK2 ≥ GS14dK9, indicating that the distortions of the GS14 structure caused by the various single enantiomeric inversions are inequivalent. Finally, the molar ellipticities of GS14dK4 and GS14dK11 are generally comparable in magnitude as are those of GS14dK2 and GS14dK9, indicating that the conformational distortions caused by enantiomeric inversions of the K4 and K11 residues of the GS14 molecule are comparable but different from those caused by enantiomeric inversions of the K2 and K9 residues. Thus, despite the inequivalent structures of the four single-substitution derivatives, there are some structural similarities between GS14dK11 and GS14dK4 and between GS14dK2 and GS14dK9.Fig. 1CD spectra of GS14 and its diastereomeric derivatives dissolved in aqueous solution (A), 50% TFE (B), and in SDS-containing aqueous media (C). The spectra shown are representative of GS14 (▪]), GS14dK2 (▵), GS14dK4 (○), GS14dK9 (♦), GS14dK11 (☆), GS14dK2K4 (*), and GS14dK2K4K9K11 (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 also shows that all of these peptides (except GS14dK2K4K9K11) exhibit significantly higher molar ellipticity values when dissolved in 50 vol% TFE and in SDS-containing aqueous media than when dissolved in aqueous buffer alone. TFE-induced increases in molar ellipticity such as observed here are generally ascribed to the structure-inducing properties of that solvent (28Sonnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 29Blanci F.J. Jimenez M.A. Pineda A. Rico M. Santoro J. Nieto J.L.

Thus, the increases in molar ellipticity values observed in TFE-containing solvents indicate that all of the peptides examined (except GS14dK2K4K9K11) adopt somewhat distorted conformations in aqueous media which are receptive to the structure-inducing properties of TFE. We also note that the molar ellipticity values obtained in SDS-containing aqueous media are generally comparable with those obtained in 50 vol% TFE (see Fig. 1). Such behavior is commonly observed with water-soluble amphipathic peptides that have the capacity to partition between aqueous media and lipid bilayers and are usually a reflection of the capacity for so-called inducible conformational changes in response to changes in the polarity of the local environment (see 31Cornut I. Thiaudiere E. DuFourcq J. Epand R.M. The Amphipathic Helix. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 173-219Google Scholar and references cited therein). RP-HPLC Studies—Under any given set of conditions, the binding of a peptide to a RP-HPLC column is determined by its intrinsic hydrophobicity, the size and spatial distribution of its hydrophobic regions, and its capacity for self-association in aqueous media (25Lee D.L. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22918-22927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Parker J.M.R. Guo D. Hodges R.S.

Peptide Res. 1996; 48: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because these peptides all have the same amino acid sequences (and thus the same intrinsic hydrophobicities), retention by RP-HPLC columns is thus largely determined by facial amphiphilicity, which reflects the extent to which hydrophobic and polar residues are segregated on different faces of the molecule. The latter determines the capacity for preferential interaction with hydrophobic surfaces (when dissolved in aqueous media) and thus provides an indirect estimate of the relative propensities of these peptides for partitioning into lipid membranes. The RP-HPLC retention times of these peptides are summarized in Fig. 2. From these results it is evident that the facial amphiphilicity of GS14 is considerably higher than those of all other peptides. Also, the facial amphiphilicities of the four single inversion analogs are significantly higher than that of GS14dK2K4, which in turn is higher than that of GS14dK2K4K9K11. Moreover, the facial amphiphilicities of the single inversion analogs are all different (GS14dK2 > GS14dK9 > GS14dK4 > GS14dK11), and GS14dK2 and GS14dK9 both exhibit higher facial amphiphilicities than GS14dK4 and GS14dK11. Thus, the facial amphiphilicities of these derivatives decrease markedly as the number of enantiomeric inversions increases. Moreover, single enantiomeric inversions at the K2 and K9, and at the K4 and K11 positions of GS14 produce compounds of comparable but distinct amphipathic properties. Fig. 2 also shows that the retention times of all peptides except GS14dK2K4K9K11 exhibit a biphasic response to temperature change. At low temperatures, retention times increase with temperature up to a maximal value beyond which further increases in temperature actually cause retention times to decrease. The GS14dK2K4K9K11 derivative exhibits a monotonic decrease in retention time over the entire temperature range and is the only exception to this general observation. This biphasic temperature dependence of RP-HPLC retention times has been ascribed to temperature-induced changes in the degree of hydrophobically driven self-association of peptides in aqueous media (25Lee D.L. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22918-22927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These measurements thus reflect the tendencies of these peptides to self-associate in aqueous media, which reflects both their aqueous monomeric solubilities and propensities for partitioning into lipid membranes. Moreover, the maxima in the temperature profiles shown in Fig. 2 are, in effect, turning points of the monomer:oligomer equilibria of these peptides and are useful indicators of their relative propensities for self-association (25Lee D.L. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22918-22927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the temperature maxima listed in Table I suggest that the self-association propensities of these peptides decreases markedly as the number of enantiomeric inversions increases (GS14 ≫ GS14dK2 ∼ GS14dK9 > GS14dK4 ∼ GS14dK11 > GS14dK2K4 ≫ GS14dK2K4K9K11) and that the self-association propensities of GS14dK2 and GS14dK9 derivatives are of comparable magnitude as are those of the GS14dK4 and GS14dK11 analogs. Moreover, because this process is hydrophobically driven, we can also infer that the aqueous solubility of these peptides increases in the order GS14 ≪ GS14dK2 ∼ GS14dK9 < GS14dK4 ∼ GS14dK11 < GS14dK2K4 ≪ GS14dK2K4K9K11, in the reverse order of their membrane partitioning propensities.Table ITemperature maxima of the retention times of GS14 and its lysine diastereomeric derivatives on a reversed phase HPLC columnPeptide sampleaSorted in decreasing order of retention times.Temperature maximum°CGS1454.2GS14dK238.7GS14dK938.4GS14dK426.1GS14dK1126.1GS14dK2K414.6GS14dK2K4K9K11<5a Sorted in decreasing order of retention times.

Typically, NSTs are studied in microsomal preparations from wild-type or mutant lines; however, in this setting it can be difficult to assess NST properties because of the presence of glycosyltransferases and other interfering activities. Here we have engineered Leishmania donovani to express high levels of an active LPG2 Golgi GDP-Man transporter bearing a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. The functional LPG2-HIS was solubilized, purified by metal affinity chromatography, and reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine-containing liposomes using polystyrene SM-2 beads. The proteoliposomes exhibited robust GDP-Man transport activity with an apparent Km of 6.6 μm. Transport activity was enhanced by preloading of GMP and showed specificity for multiple substrates (GDP-Ara and GDP-Fuc). In contrast to the activity in crude microsomes, transport was not dependent on the presence of divalent cations. Thus, reconstitution of transport activity using purified LPG2 protein in liposomes provides firm experimental evidence that a single polypeptide is solely required for NST activity and is able to mediate the uptake of multiple substrates.

Many glycosylation reactions in eukaryotes require the synthesis of nucleotide sugar substrates in the cytoplasm and their subsequent translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus.

NST genes generally encode for multi-transmembrane-spanning proteins (30–45 kDa) that function in oligomeric complexes, ranging from dimers to hexamers (22Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M.

NST activities occur in both the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and specificities for a variety of the nucleotide sugars described include UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, CMP-sialic acid, GDP-Man, GDP-Ara, and GDP-Fuc (25Hirschberg C.B.

Although originally thought to be specific for a single nucleotide sugar substrate, more recent studies have shown that some NSTs can transport several different nucleotide sugars (9Goto S.

Oriol R. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although most attention has been given to NST substrate specificity, the quantity of nucleotide sugars supplied by the respective NSTs has important consequences. Under conditions of limited substrate availability due to down-regulation of NST activity, glycosyltransferases with low Km values may prevail, whereas under substrate-saturating conditions glycosyltransferases with higher Km values are activated. For example, elevated expression of a UDP-Gal NST in colonic cancers, in turn, adversely affects the synthesis of several important carbohydrate determinants such as sialyl Lewis X (30Kumamoto K. Goto Y. Sekikawa K. Takenoshita S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4620-4627PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, modifications of the activity of NST may have profound consequences on glycoconjugate structures. NSTs are thought to act through an antiport mechanism involving a one-for-one exchange between the external nucleotide sugar and the corresponding lumenal nucleotide monophosphate (26Gerardy-Schahn R. Oelmann S. Bakker H. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The NMPs arise directly following the action of glycosyl phosphotransferases (7Ma D.Q. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or by the hydrolysis of NDPs arising from glycosyltransferases through the action of nucleotide diesterases (31Berninsone P.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most biochemical characterizations of NSTs have been performed using crude microsomes, and these microsomes have been hampered by the presence of the glycosyltransferases and diesterases mentioned earlier as well as by the limiting quantities of NSTs naturally occurring in microsomal membranes. Several NSTs have been solubilized from rat liver Golgi microsomes, and then the transport activities were reconstituted in proteoliposomes (22Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K.

The transport of nucleotide sugars into the secretory pathway is particularly important for pathogenic microbes, such as the protozoan parasite Leishmania, because of the synthesis of considerable quantities of glycoconjugates that play critical roles in their infectious cycle. Leishmania synthesizes a variety of mannose-containing glycoconjugates including glycoproteins and phosphoglycans, and genetic studies show that many of these are required for the ability of the parasite to successfully survive and induce disease in the mammalian host (33Ilg T.

For microsomal preparations, the cells were grown in brain-heart infusion medium supplemented with adenine (2.67 μg/ml), hemin (10 μg/ml), and G-418 (50 μg/ml). Purification of the LPG2 Protein—lpg2–/– cells transfected with pXG-LPG2cHis6 were grown in brain-heart infusion medium to a concentration of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. Two 4-liter cultures of cells (4 × 1010) were washed twice with PBS, harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g, resuspended in disruption buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm Complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 0.5 mm 2,3-dimercaptopropanol), and lysed by nitrogen cavitation (1500–2000 p.s.i. for 30 min at 4 °C) as described previously (7Ma D.Q.

Microsomal vesicles were prepared by successive centrifugations (7Ma D.Q. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol.

To solubilize the LPG2 transporter, the microsomal pellet (∼500 mg of protein) was incubated in 10 ml of binding buffer 1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 0.5% GDA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5 mm 2,3-dimercaptopropanol) containing 5 mm imidazole on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h), and 0.5 ml of TALON resin, which had been equilibrated with the binding buffer 1, was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The unbound fraction was removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 2 min, and the resin was rinsed with 5 ml of washing buffer 1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8., 0.5% GDA, 20% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole) by mixing gently for 10 min at 4 °C. The resin was recovered by centrifugation as before, resuspended in 1 ml of washing buffer 1, and then transferred into an empty spin column. The column was centrifuged at 700 × g for 2 min and washed twice with 1.5 ml of washing buffer 1, once with washing buffer 2 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 0.5% GDA, 20% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole), and then twice with 1.5 ml of washing buffer 3 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 0.5% GDA, 0.25 m sucrose, and 5 mm imidazole). The bound protein was eluted with five additions of 0.5 ml of binding buffer 2 (40 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 0.5% GDA, and 0.25 m sucrose). The LPG2-HIS-containing fractions were pooled, and an equal volume of binding buffer 2 without imidazole was added and then loaded onto a column of Ni-NTA (0.2-ml bed volume). The column was washed with 6-column volumes of wash buffer 3 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 0.5% GDA, and 0.25 m sucrose), which contained 20 mm imidazole, and then washed with 6-column volumes of 10 mm imidazole containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% GDA, and 0.25 m sucrose. The LPG2-HIS protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% GDA, and 0.25 m sucrose. Reconstitution—Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine was suspended under nitrogen gas in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm GMP at a concentration of 20 mg/ml and 0.5% GDA using a water bath sonicator. The lipid mixture was added to protein at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v). SM-2 beads (30 mg), pre-wetted with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and containing 0.25 m sucrose, were added to the protein-lipid mixture with gentle agitation for 30 min at 25 °C. Another 30 mg of pre-wetted SM-2 beads was added and incubated for an additional 30 min. Finally, 100 mg of pre-wetted beads were added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with gentle agitation. After filtering the suspension through a glass wool-plugged plastic syringe, the suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at room temperature. The reconstituted proteoliposomes were obtained by passage through a BioSpin P-6 column at 700 × g for 4 min. Immunofluorescence Staining—Leishmania cells (108 grown to 107/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min and wash once with ice-cold PBS. The cells were fixed in 1 ml of PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 30 min. The fixed cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. A 50-μl aliquot of cell suspension was spotted into each well of an 8-well slide, which was pre-coated with 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. After incubation for 10 min, unbound cells were removed by washing with PBS. The bound cells were blocked for 30 min in 50 mm ammonium chloride containing 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and stained for 1 h with anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody (1:200) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin. The bound antibody was detected with 1:400 diluted Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti mouse IgG. The cells were observed with a Nikon ECLIPSE E600 fluorescence microscope at a 1000-fold magnification and photographed with a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Western Blotting—Leishmania cells (2 × 106) were pelleted and washed with ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl, resuspended with 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8) containing 2× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and probe-sonicated for 20 s. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the cell suspension and probe-sonicated for 20 s. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,200 × g before gel electrophoresis. Similarly, an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the microsomal samples. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis using 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters at 100 V for 1 h. The target protein was detected with India HisProbe-HRP using luminol according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). India HisProbe-HRP is a nickel-activated derivative of horseradish peroxidase. Nucleotide Sugar Transporter Assay—In the standard NST assay, a 20-μl aliquot of reconstituted microsomes was incubated in 0.1 ml of TSM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm dimercaptopropanol) containing 10 μm radioactive nucleotide sugar substrate at 28 °C for 30 s. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.25 m sucrose) and filtered with a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore). The filter was washed with 10 ml of stop buffer, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (Packard). Expression of LPG2 Bearing a C-terminal His Tag—To express high levels of the L. donovani LPG2 GDP-Man transporter, we made use of the Leishmania episomal expression vector pXG, as the insertion of protein open reading frames and transfection into Leishmania typically induces overexpression of the cognate protein up to 100-fold (40Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 22-48Google Scholar). To facilitate the detection of the LPG2 transporter during its purification, the LPG2 gene was modified with a C-terminal epitope polyhistidine tag (LPG2cHis6 or LPG2-HIS), as previously we showed that LPG2 activity tolerated a variety of C-terminal tags (24Hong K.J. Ma D.Q. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As a recipient cell we used the L. donovani lpg2–/– knock-out line described previously; these cells thus lack endogenous, unmodified LPG2. By using a homologous Leishmania expression system, we ensured that the purified LPG2 protein would be properly assembled and processed (if necessary). Expression of the LPG2-HIS protein in pXG-LPG2cHis6/lpg2–/– transfectants was monitored by Western blotting using nickel-activated India HisProbe-HRP detection. The apparent molecular mass of the protein by Western blotting was ∼32 kDa (Fig. 1), which is similar to the calculated molecular mass of ∼37 kDa, with the slight discrepancy possibly due to the extreme hydrophobic nature of the protein affecting its proper mobility by SDS-PAGE. The cellular localization of the LPG2-HIS protein was determined by immunofluorescence staining using a polyhistidine monoclonal antibody. The signal of LPG2-HIS was detected as a single spot only in the LPG2-HIS-expressing cells (Fig. 2, panel I) and not in the wild type nor in the lpg2–/– knock-out (Fig. 2, panels C and F). The location of this spot between the nucleus and flagellar pocket and close to the site of the mitochondrial kinetoplast DNA network indicates that the LPG2-HIS protein was correctly targeted to the Golgi apparatus as seen previously with an LPG2-hemagglutinin construct (7Ma D.Q. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, replacement of the hemagglutinin tag with a His6 tag did not result in mislocalization of the transporterFig. 2Immunolocalization of LPG2-HIS in Leishmania cells. Formaldehyde-fixed and Triton X-100-permeabilized Leishmania cells were incubated with anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody. Bound antibody was detected with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Cells were observed at 1000-fold magnification. A fluorescence image and a Nomarsky image of the same field were merged.

The C-terminal domain of several Golgi NSTs has been shown to be cytoplasmically oriented (15Miura N. Ishida H. Hoshino M. Yamauchi M. Hara T. Ayusawa D. Kawakita M. J. Biochem.

Ito M. Yoshioka S. Sun-Wada G.H. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the C terminus of the hemagglutinin epitope-tagged LPG2 was previously localized by an immunogold technique to the lumenal side of the Golgi membrane (7Ma D.Q. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We confirmed this finding for the LPG2-HIS protein-containing vesicles by probing the accessibility of the C-terminal His tag to the Ni-NTA resin. Cytoplasmic orientation of the C terminus of LPG2-HIS would result in the binding of the microsomes to the Ni-NTA resin, whereas a lumenal orientation would preclude binding. Subsequently, the microsomes were centrifuged at low speed (1,500 × g) to pellet the Ni-NTA resin, and the presence of LPG2-HIS was assessed by Western blotting using HisProbe-HRP detection (Fig. 3). In the absence of detergent, almost all of the LPG2-HIS was in the supernatant, indicating that its C terminus was not accessible to the Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 3, second and third lanes from the left). Solubilization of the membranes and transporter by treatment with 1% GDA (see below) rendered the C terminus of LPG2-HIS accessible to the Ni-NTA, and the protein was now pelleted (Fig. 3, fourth and fifth lanes from the left). These results provide further evidence regarding the topology of the GDP-Man NST; in contrast to other known NSTs, the C terminus of LPG2 is lumenally oriented in the Golgi apparatus. Purification of LPG2-HIS—The microsomal fraction was taken as the starting material, and first a variety of detergents were surveyed for their ability to solubilize the LPG2-HIS protein in this fraction. Although Triton X-100 (1.1%) and Nonidet P-40 (0.5%) have been used successfully to extract active nucleotide metabolite transporters from rat liver Golgi (22Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M.

As shown in Fig. 4A, deoxycholic acid and its conjugates GDA and taurodeoxycholic acid at concentrations of 1% solubilized the Leishmania microsomes efficiently. GDA was chosen for further usage because of its tolerance of high concentrations of salt. GDA solubilized the LPG2-HIS protein from Leishmania microsomes in amounts as low as 0.2% (Fig. 4B), but GDA was used for LPG2-HIS purification at a concentration of 0.5%, corresponding to 5-fold above its critical micelle concentration. To purify the GDA-solubilized LPG2-HIS, the extract was applied sequentially to two resins that interact with the His6 tag, and purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and anti-His tag Western"
https://openalex.org/W2101518822,"The alkylsulfatase AtsK from Pseudomonas putida S-313 is a member of the non-heme iron(II)-α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. In the initial step of their catalytic cycle, enzymes belonging to this widespread and versatile family coordinate molecular oxygen to the iron center in the active site. The subsequent decarboxylation of the cosubstrate α-ketoglutarate yields carbon dioxide, succinate, and a highly reactive ferryl (IV) species, which is required for substrate oxidation via a complex mechanism involving the transfer of radical species. Non-productive activation of oxygen may lead to harmful side reactions; therefore, such enzymes need an effective built-in protection mechanism. One of the ways of controlling undesired side reactions is the self-hydroxylation of an aromatic side chain, which leads to an irreversibly inactivated species. Here we describe the crystal structure of the alkylsulfatase AtsK in complexes with succinate and with Fe(II)/succinate. In the crystal structure of the AtsK-Fe(II)-succinate complex, the side chain of Tyr168 is co-ordinated to the iron, suggesting that Tyr168 is the target of enzyme self-hydroxylation. This is the first structural study of an Fe(II)-α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that presents an aromatic side chain coordinated to the metal center, thus allowing structural insight into this protective mechanism of enzyme self-inactivation.

The alkylsulfatase AtsK from Pseudomonas putida S-313 is a member of the family of non-heme iron(II), α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (1Kahnert A. Kertesz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31661-31667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 2Ryle M.J. Hausinger R.P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This remarkable superfamily is widespread among prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and its members catalyze a broad diversity of energetically demanding biosynthetic and degradative reactions including hydroxylation processes, stereoselective desaturation of inactivated carbon-carbon single bonds, and oxidative ring closure (3Hausinger R.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of this enzyme superfamily has been the topic of numerous spectroscopic and structural investigations (Fig. 1). This family of enzymes all bind iron using a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad, a feature that is one of nature's recurring multifunctional bioinorganic motifs such as the heme group or iron-sulfur clusters. They catalyze the oxidative conversion of the cofactor αKG 1The abbreviations used are: αKG, α-ketoglutarate; TauD, taurine dioxygenase; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; PDB, Protein Data Bank. into CO2 and succinate, simultaneously generating an activated oxygen species bound to the oxidized Fe center. The generally accepted mechanism proceeds via a Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate (4Price J.C. Barr E.W. Glass T.E. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13008-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The interaction of this activated intermediate with the enzyme substrate generates a transient radical species that subsequently decomposes to the reaction product. A reaction mechanism that involves radical formation would at first sight seem to be a hazardous method for an organism to accomplish the relatively straightforward cleavage reaction that is catalyzed by AtsK (i.e. the release of sulfate from an alkyl sulfate ester), because harmful side reactions could take place in the absence of substrate. Such enzymes must therefore have an effective built-in protection mechanism, and indeed, several checks exist to control undesired side reactions. First, kinetic studies have shown that the oxygen activation process is much slower in the absence of substrate. In the case of the taurine dioxygenase (TauD), for example, stopped-flow kinetic analysis of the taurine-αKG·Fe(II)·TauD and the substrate-free Fe·αKG·TauD complexes have shown that the oxygen reactivity of the latter is orders of magnitude lower than that of the substrate complex (5Ryle M.J. Padmakumar R. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15278-15286Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Secondly, x-ray structural analysis of several members of this enzyme family has demonstrated that substrate binding induces changes in the iron coordination sphere. The water molecule that occupies the sixth iron coordination site in the initial complex with AtsK, TauD, and factor-inducing hypoxia-inducible factor (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M.

Ren J. Stammers D.K. Baldwin J.E. Harlos K. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)). It is believed that the change in the Fe(II) coordination environment induced by substrate binding within the active site pocket facilitates the binding of dioxygen. Nonetheless, this structural feature alone does not ensure protection against substrate-uncoupled oxidation of the enzyme. Decarboxylation of the cosubstrate αKG in the absence of substrate has long been known and leads to inactivation of the enzyme. The first reports of this phenomenon involved prolyl hydroxylase, the enzyme whose malfunction underlies scurvy (10Counts D.F. Cardinale G.J. Udenfield S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Rao N.V. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6327-6330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tuderman L. Myllyla ̈ R. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 314-348Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar) in which the uncoupled turnover results in the metal becoming oxidized in an ascorbic acid-reversible manner (13Myllyla ̈ R. Majamaa K. Gu ̈nzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.N. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5403-5405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar ascorbate-reversible uncoupled reactions have been reported for several other enzymes in this family, and ascorbic acid is a widespread component in the buffers used to assay these enzymes to avoid rapid inactivation (1Kahnert A. Kertesz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31661-31667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Assuming that the same mechanism of cosubstrate oxidation occurs for the substrate-free complex as in the catalytic cycle, a highly reactive Fe(IV)=O-ferryl species would be formed concomitantly with αKG decarboxylation. As discussed in the case of deacetylcephalosporin synthase (14Valega ̊rd K. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Dubus A. Ranghino G. O ̈ster L.M. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2003; 11: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a second cosubstrate molecule could then coordinate to the active site and undergo oxidation in the absence of substrate. This would generate an Fe(III)-protein complex that could be transformed into an active species by ascorbate or other mild reducing agents. A different pathway, leading to irreversibly modified enzymes, has been reported for TfdA, AlkB, and TauD. During the uncoupled reaction of TauD, ∼60% of the inactivated complexes can be recovered by reduction, whereas approximately one-third of the molecules are transformed into a Fe(III)-succinate-catecholate species (15Ryle M.J. Koehntop K.D. Liu A. Que L. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3790-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that are produced by enzyme self-hydroxylation at the side chain of Tyr73. For TfdA and AlkB, analogous hydroxylation of a tryptophan side chain has been observed (16Henshaw T.F. Feig M. Hausinger R.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Liu A. Ho R.Y.N. Que Jr., L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5126-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The precise location of the relevant hydroxylated aromatic residue within the protein framework varies among enzymes. Hydroxylation of an aromatic side chain by the ferryl intermediate generated in the absence of proper substrate would constitute a definitive mechanism for enzyme inactivation and thus of self-protection in case of a lack of cosubstrate or another suitable reducing agent to mediate the reversible inactivation. Here we describe the crystal structures of the alkylsulfatase AtsK in complexes with succinate and water in the metal binding site as well as with succinate and Fe(II) (PDB entries 1VZ4 for succinate-Fe(II)·AtsK and 1VZ5 for succinate-AtsK). In the second structure, a tyrosine side chain coordinates to the iron via its hydroxyl group. This amino acid was part of a flexible loop in the crystal structures of AtsK previously described (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This structure provides insight into the mechanism of the self-hydroxylation reaction similar to the one reported for TauD and TfdA. In addition, EPR measurements on the Fe(II)·αKG·AtsK complex and its reaction products upon exposure to oxygen were undertaken. The crystal structure of Fe·αKG·AtsK with and without substrate (PDB entries 1oii and 1oik) (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is compared with the succinate-AtsK complexes determined in this work, and the structural aspects of the self-hydroxylation mechanism are discussed. Crystallization—Crystals of the succinate-AtsK-complex were grown at 20 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Crystals grew out of a mixture of equal volumes of protein and well solution (2 μl each) The protein solution contained 18 mg/ml of the apoform of AtsK and 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5. The well solution contained 25 mm ammonium sulfate, 175 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.6, 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 30% glycerol. Crystals grew to a typical size of 0.05 × 0.1 × 0.3 mm3 over 1–4 weeks and could be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without a further cryoprotectant. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121. Iron was soaked into the succinate-AtsK-complex under anaerobic conditions. The crystals were transferred to an anaerobically prepared solution containing the additives of the mother liquor. A solution containing the mother liquor and 10 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O was added stepwise to the crystals to a total Fe2+ concentration of 2 mm. The crystals were incubated under anaerobic conditions for 36 h. The space group changed upon soaking from P212121 to I212121. Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline BL2 at the Protein Structure Factory c/o BESSY in Berlin using a MAR345 image plate detector to a resolution of 2.15 Å for the succinate-AtsK complex and of 2.5 Å for the succinate-Fe(II)·AtsK complex at a wavelength of 0.9000 and 0.8976 Å, respectively.

For the succinate-iron complex, the protein model of the Fe·αKG·2-ethyl-1-hexyl sulfate structure (PDB entry 1oik) (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used for the initial rigid body refinement. In both cases, the side chains of the residues in the active site region were truncated. The refinement was performed using the program REFMAC5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Further refinement of the structures included non-crystallographic symmetry with tight restraints for the positional and thermal parameters of the main chain atoms and medium restraints for the side chain atoms. Because of non-crystallographic symmetry, the data for calculating the Rfree value were selected in thin resolution shells to prevent correlation between work and free sets of reflections. For the TLS refinement of the succinate-AtsK structure, each of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit was defined as a rigid body. TLS refinement of the Fe-succinate-AtsK complex did not improve the quality of the model as monitored by Rfree and was therefore abandoned. Water molecules were built in by XtalView (21McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar), and their B-factors and stereochemistry were evaluated manually. The restraints for the succinate molecules were taken from the standard REFMAC5 library. In case of the Fe-succinate-AtsK complex, the presence of an iron atom in the iron binding site was confirmed by the observed bond lengths and the anomalous signal in a 3-Å in-house data set (λ = 1.54 Å) collected on the same crystal (anomalous signal to noise ratio of 1.4).

Nitrogen was used as a coolant. The microwave power was selected within the range 2–10 milliwatts. A microwave frequency of around 9.44 GHz and the modulation amplitude of 4 G at a modulation frequency of 100 kHz were used for all of the measurements. The protein sample was prepared anaerobically under argon addition of 0.9 equivalents of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O and 5 mm α-ketoglutaric acid or 5 mm succinic acid, respectively, to 0.8 mm AtsK in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The solution also contained 20% v/v glycerol. Oxygen exposure of the solution was performed by streaming O2 through the sample for 5 s. After incubation at room temperature for 20 s and 2, 5, 20, and 90 min, the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and the spectrum was recorded at 150 K. For comparison, an EPR spectrum was collected on an anaerobically prepared solution containing 0.75 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O and 5 mm α-ketoglutaric acid, 20% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, which was then exposed to oxygen. The spectrum of the anaerobic sample showed a small peak at g = 4.25 as a result of contamination of Fe(III) in the solution (26Munro O.Q. de Wet M. Pollak H. van Wyk J. Marques H.M. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1998; 94: 1743-1752Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This peak increased upon oxygen exposure. A peak with similar intensity appeared for the anaerobic protein sample, but it did not increase upon oxygen exposure of the protein sample. Instead, different features appeared in the spectrum. We know from previous AtsK handling that the Fe(III) that is present as an impurity in the Fe(II) stock solution does not bind to the protein (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The structure of AtsK displays an α/β-domain that folds into a jelly roll motif with a β-sheet core flanked by α-helices characteristic for this enzyme family and a second α/β-domain (Fig. 2) (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The core domain contains the active site made up of the iron binding, the cosubstrate binding, and the substrate binding sites. In the previously reported Fe·αKG·AtsK complex (PDB entry 1oii) (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the iron is coordinated by the protein via His-108(Nϵ2), Asp-110(Oδ1), and His-264(Nϵ2) by the cosubstrate via its carbonyl-oxygen opposite to Asp110 and via one oxygen atom of its α-carboxyl group opposite to His108. The iron coordination sphere is completed by a water molecule opposite to His264. The cosubstrate binds to the protein through a salt bridge between its γ-carboxyl group and Arg-275(Nχ1 and Nχ2) assisted by a hydrogen bond from Thr-135(Oγ1) to this carboxyl group. Another hydrogen bond between the α-carboxyl oxygen atom not involved in iron binding and Arg-279(Nχ2) contributes to hold its position. In the Fe·αKG·substrate complex, the sulfate ester faces the metal center from the water binding site with the sulfate group forming hydrogen bonds to Val-111(N), Arg-279(Nχ2), and His-81(Nϵ2). The last of these residues forms part of a short disordered loop in the substrate-free structure. The water molecule is displaced from the iron, leaving a coordinatively unsaturated metal ion. Arg279 changes its side chain conformation upon substrate binding, thereby tightening the interaction with the cosubstrate molecule by forming a second hydrogen bond between the α-carboxyl group of αKG and Arg-279(Nϵ) (Fig. 3). Succinate Binds into the Cosubstrate Binding Site, Water Fills the Metal Binding Site, and His214 Adopts a Conformation That Closes the Substrate Binding Pocket—In the succinate-AtsK complex, a water molecule occupies the metal binding site, as indicated by its distances to the protein and the succinate molecule (Table III). The water molecule in the iron binding site forms hydrogen bonds with the succinate molecules, His-108(Nϵ2), Asp-110(Oδ1), and His-264(Nϵ2), the distortion imposed by the longer distances resulting in a pyramidal rather than tetrahedral coordination. In the corresponding iron-free αKG·AtsK structure (PDB entry 1oih) (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), this position is filled by a sodium cation. Alteration of the protonation state of the histidine side chains in the presence of succinate is presumably responsible for this difference. The succinate molecule is held in place by interactions with the same amino acids that coordinate αKG. One of its carboxyl groups forms salt bridges with Arg-275(Nχ1 and Nχ2) and a hydrogen bond with Thr-135(Oγ1). The other carboxyl group is oriented toward the metal binding site and interacts with Arg-279(Nχ2) as described for the non-iron-binding α-carboxyl oxygen atom of αKG. Thus, the orientation of the side chain of Arg279 is maintained relative to that found in the Fe·αKG·AtsK structure. Nevertheless, there is one significant conformational change between the two structures within the active site of the protein. His214 is oriented parallel to the side chain of His108 as described in the structure of the apoform of AtsK, although no direct contact with the succinate molecule was observed. In the Fe·αKG·AtsK structure, the side chain of His214 points away from His108. As shown by the structure of the Fe·αKG·AtsK·2-ethyl-1-hexyl sulfate ester complex (PDB entry 1oik) (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), this orientation provides a cleft for the aliphatic side chain of the substrate. On the contrary, the apostructure and the structure reported here show a closing of the substrate binding pocket. The binding site for the sulfate group of the substrate close to Val111 and Arg279 is occupied by a water molecule that hydrogen bonds to Val-111(N). This solvent molecule does not interact with Arg279 or His81 for which no electron density can be seen.Table IIISelected bond lengthsAtsK complexHis-108(Nϵ2)-H2O/FeAsp-110(Oδ1)-H2O/FeHis-264(Nϵ2)-H2O/FeSucc(O1)-FeTyr-168(Oχ)-FeÅSuccinate (PDB entry 1VZ5)2.742.583.192.602.862.993.622.642.432.362.612.512.782.933.562.49Succinate + Fe (PDB entry 1VZ4)2.162.052.171.962.302.292.011.992.082.17 Open table in a new tab The Presence of Iron and Succinate in the Active Site Induces Coordination of Tyr168 along with Major Conformational Changes—In crystals grown in the presence of succinate and soaked in an Fe(II) solution under anaerobic conditions, the water molecule in the metal binding site is replaced by an iron atom. The metal adopts a 5-fold coordination. Four of these ligands are made up by the AtsK iron-binding triad His-108(Nϵ2), Asp-110(Oδ1), and His-264(Nϵ2) and one of the succinate oxygen atoms. Unexpectedly and most interestingly, the fifth ligand is the side chain oxygen atom of Tyr-168(Oχ), which approaches from the substrate binding site to complete the coordination sphere. This tyrosine is part of a 25 amino acid long flexible loop between Glu165 and Tyr192 that is not visible in the electron density of any other structure of AtsK previously described (Fig. 4). Here, the amino acids Tyr166 to Ala169 are involved in a hydrogen bond network with the amino acids constituting the active site and thus adopt an ordered structure that is clearly visible in the electron density. The rearrangement of this part of the loop is accompanied by a structural change involving two strands in the β-sheet of the jelly roll core (Fig. 5). The side chain of Arg279, which has been suggested to play the role of a linker between the substrate and cosubstrate binding areas, changes its position and conformation. Besides binding the iron-coordinating carboxyl group of the succinate molecule, Arg-279(Nχ1) forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-168(Oχ) (monomer A, 2.70 Å; monomer D, 2.92 Å). The Arg279 rearrangement is induced by the orientation of the succinate molecule close to the iron, shifting Arg279 closer toward the metal binding site than observed in the Fe·αKG or the iron-free succinate complex. A consequence of the reorientation of Arg279 is the breakage of the hydrogen bond to Thr-281(Oγ1) that is observed in all but the Fe·αKG·AtsK·2-ethyl-1-hexyl sulfate ester structure. The side chain of Thr281 changes its orientation and forms a hydrogen bond with Val79 (monomer A, 2.79 Å; monomer D, 3.07 Å). This hydrogen bond was also present in the substrate-AtsK structure. This new contact fixes the positions of Ala80 and His81, which are part of a formerly disordered loop between Val79 and Pro85. In the substrate-AtsK structure, His81 is involved in substrate binding and there it has been assumed to be important not only for substrate binding but also for capping the active site. In the structure described here, His-81(Nϵ2) forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-167(Oδ2) (monomer A, 3.03 Å; monomer D, 3.24 Å). The latter amino acid was part of the long flexible loop that could not be modeled in the AtsK-substrate complex. This hydrogen bond strengthens the fixation of the loop carrying Tyr168 and creates a lid over the active site. The interaction between Asp167 and His81 places the entire β-strand β4 closer to the active site, and the interaction between Val79 and Thr281 brings β-strand β16 closer to β4 and thus narrows the upper end of the jelly roll barrel (Table III). EPR Spectra Reveal an Fe(III) Low Spin Species after Oxygen Exposure—XAS measurement of the Fe(II)·αKG·AtsK complex under aerobic conditions showed that the iron is oxidized within the active site (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This iron species was further investigated by EPR analysis. In TauD and TfdA, Fe(III) high spin complexes were observed as reaction products. The occurrence in TauD of only one signal at g = 4.3 for a rhombic high spin Fe(III) complex allowed a second signal at g = 2, which decreased over time, to be assigned to the tyrosine radical (27Ryle M.J. Liu A. Muthukumaran R.B. Ho R.Y.N. Koehntop K.D. McCracken J. Que Jr., L. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For TfdA, features at g-values of 7.4, 5.8, 4.3, and 2.0 were reported and interpreted as the result of Fe(III) high spin (S = 5/2) complex formation (17Liu A. Ho R.Y.N. Que Jr., L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5126-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Oxygen exposure of the Fe(II)·αKG·AtsK complex leads to the development of an intense EPR feature at g = 2.15. A second peak at g = 4.27 is present prior to oxygen exposure and in a reference sample prepared in the absence of AtsK. In the latter sample, the intensity of this peak increases upon oxygen exposure, which is not observed in the presence of protein. The spectra were recorded after oxygen addition and incubation at room temperature for 20 s, 2, 5, 20, and 90 min. The peak at g = 2.15 appears after 2 min and with increasing incubation time, a significant shift of this signal toward lower field is observed (g = 2.24 after 90 min). In addition, much weaker signals are observed at g = 1.9 and 1.75, whose intensity increases between 2 and 20 min of incubation, and almost disappear after 90 min of incubation. These signals indicate the presence of a low spin Fe(III) (S = 1/2) species. The altered electronic features of the Fe(III) ion revealed by the shift of the EPR signal could be the result of a rearrangement in the coordination sphere of the metal ion during the uncoupled oxidation. The width of the signal did not allow us to resolve further signals around g = 2 and thus assign a putative tyrosine radical signal. Ryle et al. (15Ryle M.J. Koehntop K.D. Liu A. Que L. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3790-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported on the oxidation of the iron center in an Fe(II)-succinate-TauD complex in the presence of oxygen monitored by UV-visible and Raman spectroscopy (15Ryle M.J. Koehntop K.D. Liu A. Que L. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3790-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The reaction of the iron center with molecular oxygen occurred over a period of hours rather than minutes as seen for the Fe(II)·αKG·TauD complex. Therefore, we investigated the EPR features of the Fe(II)-succinate-AtsK complex upon oxygen exposure. In agreement with the TauD results, we did not find a change in the EPR spectrum of the Fe(II)-succinate-AtsK sample after oxygen exposure and incubation for 5 min. The complex could not be studied after longer incubation at room temperature as the protein slowly precipitated. This reduced reactivity of the iron is consistent with the formation of a less accessible metal center in the succinate complex, as formerly disordered loops form the lid over the active site that is seen in the crystal structure of AtsK. The crystallographic studies on the succinate complexes of AtsK show that the presence of succinate and iron (II) in the active site of AtsK causes the coordination of a tyrosine side chain to the iron center. The penta-coordinated iron complex seen in the crystals differs from the real mechanistic intermediate, since it has not been derived from a reaction taking place at the active site between aKG and dioxygen, which would result in a hexa-coordinated metal center in a higher oxidation state. Nevertheless, it mimics the structural response of the enzyme to the presence of succinate in the absence of either substrate or product. Although not directly involved in cosubstrate oxidation, the presence of a substrate molecule in the active site facilitates the coordination of dioxygen to the iron atom, concomitant with the coordination of the substrate to its binding site. A water molecule is removed from the iron coordination sphere to leave a 5-fold coordinated iron center and a potential oxygen binding site. By decarboxylating the αKG, the iron center is transformed into an Fe(IV)=O species (27Ryle M.J. Liu A. Muthukumaran R.B. Ho R.Y.N. Koehntop K.D. McCracken J. Que Jr., L. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the substrate molecule reacts with this Fe(IV)=O intermediate in the next step. In the absence of substrate, e.g. in the Fe·αKG·AtsK complex, the water molecule remains bound to the iron. This does not mean that it cannot be replaced by an approaching dioxygen molecule; however, if this replacement occurs, the activation energy required should be substantially higher than when the substrate is bound, in agreement with the much longer reaction time of the substrate-free complex with oxygen in respect to the substrate complex (15Ryle M.J. Koehntop K.D. Liu A. Que L. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3790-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EPR measurements provide clear evidence for a reaction between the Fe(II)·αKG·AtsK complex and oxygen in the absence of substrate, e.g. an oxidation uncoupled from substrate binding. In light of these results and the self-hydroxylation reaction reported for TauD (15Ryle M.J. Koehntop K.D. Liu A. Que L. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3790-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we propose a similar self-protection mechanism for the αKG-dependent dioxygenase AtsK. The structural information obtained from the succinate complexes of AtsK provides a view of how this self-hydroxylation of an aromatic residue is accomplished. Building on the pathway of the catalytic reaction (Fig. 1), we assume that dioxygen coordinates to the active site in an initial step of the uncoupled mechanism and that the cosubstrate is then oxidized and split into succinate and carbon dioxide. This leaves an activated ferryl species that needs to be quenched since it is capable of initiating undesired radical side reactions. Therefore, in this model, the conversion of the αKG into succinate in absence of substrate is the trigger for the tyrosine approach. The Fe-succinate-AtsK structure now gives insight into how the tyrosine side chain is recruited to the active site. The rearrangement of the Arg279 side chain, induced by the replacement of αKG into succinate, leads to a cascade of hydrogen bond reorganization. When there is no substrate bound to the protein, the flexible loop between 165 and 191 can dock at the open end of the active site via interaction between Asp167 and His81 and between Tyr168 and Arg279. This corroborates the previous hypothesis (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that Arg279 plays the role of a linker between the cosubstrate and the substrate binding site. The coordinative binding of the tyrosine side chain to the ferryl species would have the double effect of shielding other alternative oxidation targets by closing the active site pocket and of placing a tyrosine carbon atom ortho to the hydroxyl group at an appropriate distance to react with the ferryl species and form a radical intermediate. The conversion into a catecholate would be the final step of enzyme self-hydroxylation. Whether the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl radical transferred to the tyrosine radical originates from dioxygen or from a water molecule cannot be determined from the crystal structure. The water molecule as a source seems to be more likely by comparison with TauD for which the catecholate oxygen atom is incorporated from the solvent (15Ryle M.J. Koehntop K.D. Liu A. Que L. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3790-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Ryle M.J. Liu A. Muthukumaran R.B. Ho R.Y.N. Koehntop K.D. McCracken J. Que Jr., L. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For TauD and other enzymes, it has been shown that the modified enzyme is irreversibly inactivated, which implies the formation of a stable catecholate complex and a permanently closed active site. These results do not contradict the finding that only approximately one-third of the protein undergoes self-hydroxylation in the presence of oxygen but in the absence of substrate. In the case of deacetylcephalosporin synthase, it has been suggested by Valegård et al. (14Valega ̊rd K. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Dubus A. Ranghino G. O ̈ster L.M. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2003; 11: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that a second cosubstrate molecule could coordinate to the substrate binding site and undergo oxidation in the uncoupled reaction. In this case, an αKG molecule would occupy this site and the tyrosine molecule could not approach and coordinate to the iron. The tyrosine side chain that had been shown to be the target of self-hydroxylation in TauD is Tyr73. In terms of sequence, it is not related to Tyr168 of AtsK. Crystal structures of TauD are available for substrate complexes or the apoform of the protein (7Elkins J.M. Ryle M.J. Clifton I.J. Dunning Hotopp J.C. Lloyd J.S. Burzlaff N.I. Baldwin J.E. Hausinger R.P. Roach P.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28O'Brien J.R. Schuller D.J. Yang V.S. Dillard B.D. Lanzilotta W.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5547-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and both show that Tyr73 is part of the substrate binding site. Tyr73 belongs to a short loop related to the loop between Val79 and Pro85 in AtsK, which itself does not contain any aromatic amino acids. The structural relationship between Tyr-168(AtsK) and Tyr-73(TauD) supports the assumption that Tyr168 undergoes hydroxylation in the uncoupled oxidation of AtsK. In conclusion, we propose an enzyme self-hydroxylation pathway as an irreversible self-inactivation process for the αKG-dependent dioxygenase AtsK and describe a putative cascade of protein rearrangements following cosubstrate decarboxylation in the absence of a substrate molecule. The side chain of Tyr168 that coordinates to the metal ion in the Fe-succinate-AtsK structure most probably undergoes oxidation to yield a catecholate species. In an attempt to structurally characterize the reaction product of the uncoupled oxidation, we took crystals that had been grown in the presence of αKG and soaked anaerobically in Fe(II) (6Mu ̈ller I. Kahnert A. Pape T. Sheldrick G.M. Meyer-Klauke W. Dierks T. Kertesz M. Uso ́n I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3075-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and exposed them to oxygen. During oxygen exposure, the colorless crystals became yellow, indicating the formation of iron(III). This change in color was accompanied by a change in the symmetry: The anaerobic form had the space group P212121, and upon oxygen exposure, it changed to I212121. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.3 Å, but the difference electron density close to the iron binding site could not be interpreted (data not shown). This may arise from a disorder among different reaction products from 1) competing reactions because αKG, which may lead to reversible inactivation, is present in large excess, 2) incomplete reaction, and 3) limitation in the quality of the experimental data. Therefore, further work on this structure is under way. We are grateful to George M. Sheldrick for scientific discussion and support. We thank Tewes Tralau for technical assistance.

Here we report on the cloning and functional characterization of a GABA transporter from C. elegans (ceGAT-1) and on the functional relevance of the transporter to the biology of body muscles and enteric muscles. ceGAT-1 is coded by snf-11 gene, a member of the sodium-dependent neurotransmitter symporter gene family in C. elegans. The cloned ceGAT-1 functions as a Na+/Cl–-coupled high-affinity transporter selective for GABA with a Kt of ∼15 μm. The Na+:Cl–:GABA stoichiometry for ceGAT-1-mediated transport process is 2:1:1. The transport process is electrogenic as evidenced from GABA-induced inward currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes that express ceGAT-1 heterologously. The transporter is expressed exclusively in GABA-ergic neurons and in two other additional neurons. We also investigated the functional relevance of ceGAT-1 to the biology of body muscles and enteric muscles by ceGAT-1-specific RNA interference (RNAi) in rrf-3 mutant, a strain of C. elegans in which neurons are not refractory to RNAi as in the wild type strain. The down-regulation of ceGAT-1 by RNAi leads to an interesting phenotype associated with altered function of body muscles (as evident from changes in thrashing frequency) and enteric muscles (as evident from the rates of defecation failure) and also with altered sensitivity to aldicarb-induced paralysis. These findings provide unequivocal evidence for a modulatory role of GABA and ceGAT-1 in the biology of cholinergic neurons and in the function of body muscles and enteric muscles in this organism. GABA functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in body muscles and as an excitatory neurotransmitter in enteric muscles in Caenorhabditis elegans. Whereas many of the components of the GABA-ergic neurotransmission in this organism have been identified at the molecular and functional levels, no transporter specific for this neurotransmitter has been identified to date.

GABAergic neurotransmission is used clinically as the target of antiepileptic, anxiolytic, and antispasmodic drugs (1Bowery N.G. Nistico G. GABA, Basic Research and Clinical Applications. Pythagora, Rome, Italy1989: 1-426Google Scholar, 2Brambilla P. Perez J. Barale F. Schettini G. Soares J.C. Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 721-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3Lydiard R.B.

Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2003; 2: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Several molecular components are involved in GABA-ergic neurotransmission. These include glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme needed for the production of GABA from glutamate), vesicular GABA transporter (the transporter in presynaptic neurons that transports GABA into synaptic vesicles), GABA receptors (the receptors present on the postsynaptic membrane to transmit the GABAergic signals), and GABA transporters (the transporters present in presynaptic neurons and glial cells that participate in the clearance of GABA from the synapse). Mammals, including humans, express four different GABA transporters (GATs) of which only two are present specifically in GABA-ergic neurons. These are GAT-1 and GAT-3 (6Dalby N.O. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Chen N.H. Reith M.E.A. Quick M.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). GAT-1 is the predominant GABA transporter in the brain, co-localizes with markers of GABAergic neurons, and is expressed in the axons and presynaptic membranes (8Radian R. Ottersen O.P. Storm-Mathisen J. Castel M. Kanner B.I. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Minelli A. Brecha N.C. Karschin C. DeBiasi S. Conti F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7734-7746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ikegaki N. Saito N. Hashima M. Tanaka C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). GAT-3 is also expressed exclusively in the brain where it is found in GABA-ergic nerve terminals as well as in glial cells (11Minelli A. DeBiasi S. Brecha N.C. Zuccarello L.V. Conti F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6255-6264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12DeBiasi S. Vitellaro-Zuccarello L. Brecha N.C. Neuroscience. 1998; 83: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The other two GABA transporters (GAT-2 and BGT-1/GAT-4, also known as betaine/GABA transporter) are not related to GABA-ergic neurotransmission. Antiepileptic, anxiolytic, and antispasmodic drugs produce their therapeutic effects by enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission (1Bowery N.G. Nistico G. GABA, Basic Research and Clinical Applications. Pythagora, Rome, Italy1989: 1-426Google Scholar, 2Brambilla P. Perez J. Barale F. Schettini G. Soares J.C. Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 721-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3Lydiard R.B. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2003; 64: 21-27PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ashton H. Young A.H. J. Psychopharmacol. 2003; 17: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Sarup A. Larsson O.M. Schousboe A. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2003; 2: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The activation of GABAergic neurotransmission can be accomplished by drugs that function either as agonists of GABA receptors or inhibitors of GABA transporters. The latter class of drugs such as tiagabine (an antiepileptic drug) increases the levels of GABA in the synaptic cleft by their ability to block the clearance of the neurotransmitter from the synapse via GABA transporters and thus enhances GABA-ergic neurotransmission (5Sarup A. Larsson O.M. Schousboe A. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2003; 2: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Even though GAT-1 and GAT-3 have been identified at the molecular level more than a decade ago and are known to be linked to diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia (6Dalby N.O. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Chen N.H. Reith M.E.A. Quick M.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), there are no knock-out animal models reported in the literature describing the phenotypic changes that occur as a consequence of specific deletion of either GAT-1 or GAT-3. GABA-ergic neurotransmission plays a critical role in the function of body muscles and enteric muscles in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (13Schuske K. Beg A.A. Jorgensen E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There are 26 GABA-ergic neurons in this organism as identified by immunocytochemistry using a polyclonal antibody specific for GABA (14McIntire S.L. Jorgensen E. Kaplan J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These consist of the 6 DD neurons, 13 VD neurons, 4 RME neurons, 1 AVL neuron, 1 DVB neuron, and 1 RIS neuron. The connectivity of all of these neurons that use GABA as the neurotransmitter has been well established (14McIntire S.L. Jorgensen E. Kaplan J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The DD and VD neurons control the function of body muscles that are involved in locomotion. The RME neurons innervate the muscle in the head that participates in foraging. The AVL and DVB neurons control the function of enteric muscles that participate, together with body muscles, in the defecation cycle. The function of the RIS neuron is not well understood. The molecular components of GABAergic neurotransmission in C. elegans are similar to those in mammals. These include glutamic acid decarboxylase (known as unc-25), vesicular GABA transporter (known as unc-47), and a GABA receptor (known as unc-49) (13Schuske K. Beg A.A. Jorgensen E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15McIntire S.L. Jorgensen E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Two other proteins have also been shown to be essential for normal GABAergic neurotransmission in C. elegans (i.e. unc-30 that participates in the differentiation of GABA-ergic neurons and unc-46 that is essential for synaptic release of GABA) (13Schuske K. Beg A.A. Jorgensen E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15McIntire S.L. Jorgensen E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). unc-25, unc-30, unc-46, unc-47, and unc-49 are members of the uncoordinated gene class. All of the members of this gene class, when made nonfunctional, lead to a loss of coordination of muscle function in the organism. The C. elegans counterpart(s) of mammalian GABA transporters has/have not yet been identified at the molecular level. GABA transporters in mammals belong to the SLC6 gene family, which consists of at least 19 members (7Chen N.H. Reith M.E.A. Quick M.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Most of the transporters in this gene family recognize neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (e.g. GABA, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, glycine, proline, and taurine) as substrates and are energetically coupled to the transmembrane gradients of Na+ and Cl–. Therefore, this family is called Na+/Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporter gene family. C. elegans also contains a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter symporter family (snf). A search in the WormBase (Release WS93 at www.wormbase.org) using the mammalian GABA transporter protein sequence as a query has revealed that there are 14 members in this snf gene family (snf-1, snf-2, and so forth) in the worm genome. Only two of them have so far been identified at the functional level. dat-1 (T23G5.5) encodes a dopamine transporter (16Jayanthi L.D. Apparsundaram S. Malone M.D. Ward E. Miller D.M. Eppler M. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 601-609PubMed Google Scholar) and mod-5 (Y54E10BR.7) encodes a serotonin transporter (17Ranganathan R. Sawin E.R. Trent C. Horvitz H.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5871-5884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we undertook a study to identify the taurine transporter in C. elegans. When we searched the data base for the snf gene family with the mammalian taurine transporter as a query to identify the most likely candidate for the C. elegans taurine transporter, the search yielded snf-11 as the likely candidate based on amino acid sequence. Therefore, we isolated a full-length snf-11 cDNA clone from a C. elegans cDNA library and characterized its transport function, hoping that this clone would function as a Na+/Cl–-coupled transporter for taurine. Quite unexpectedly, these studies showed that snf-11 is not a taurine transporter but a GABA transporter. This represents the first GABA transporter to be identified at the functional level in C. elegans. In this paper, we describe the structural and functional aspects of this GABA transporter (ceGAT-1). In addition, we show here that ceGAT-1 is expressed in all of the GABA-ergic neurons (plus in two non-GABAergic neurons) and that down-regulation of GAT-1 expression by gene-specific RNA interference (RNAi) leads to changes in the function of body muscles and enteric muscles. Furthermore, RNAi-induced down-regulation of GAT-1 also leads to an interesting pharmacologic phenotype with altered cholinergic neurotransmission as evident from enhanced sensitivity to aldicarb (an inhibitor of acetylcholineesterase)-induced paralysis. To our knowledge, this represents the first report on the consequences of down-regulation of a GABA transporter in an animal model. Materials—[3H]GABA (specific radioactivity, 70 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cell line, used routinely in our laboratory for heterologous expression of cloned transporters, was maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium/F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Lipofectin was purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Magna nylon transfer membranes used in library screening were purchased from Micron Separations (Westboro, MA). Unlabeled GABA and its analogs and other amino acids were obtained from Sigma. A wild type nematode strain, C. elegans N2 (Bristol) and all of the other C. elegans mutant strains such as rrf-3 (NL-2099), unc-25 (e156), unc-47 (e307), and unc-2 (e55) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (St. Paul, MN). Nematode Culture and RNA Preparation—Nematode culture was carried out using a standard procedure with a large-scale liquid cultivation protocol (18Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The nematodes were cleaned by sedimentation through 15% (w/v) Ficoll 400 in 0.1 m NaCl. The pellet was then used for total RNA preparation. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified by affinity chromatography using oligo(dT)-cellulose. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Hybridization Probe Preparation—Our original aim was to clone the C. elegans taurine transporter. A search in the WormBase using the mammalian taurine transporter protein sequences as queries revealed that the gene T03F7.1 (GenBank™ accession number Z74041) located on chromosome V encodes a candidate plasma membrane transporter that may function as the sodium/chloride-coupled taurine transporter. Therefore, a pair of PCR primers specific for this gene was designed based on the sequence of the cosmid T03F7.1, 5′-GCA CTT TTC CTT CTT CTC GTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCA AAA ACC CAG CAA AAC TTC-3′ (reverse primer). These primers yielded a single DNA fragment in RT-PCR using the total RNA isolated from C. elegans as the template in the reaction. The size of the product was ∼0.9 kb, which agreed with the predicted size based on the distance between the two primers in the theoretically derived gene transcript. The RT-PCR product was gel-purified and subcloned into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega Madison, WI). The molecular identity of the insert was established by DNA sequencing. This cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen a C. elegans cDNA library. Construction of a Directional C. elegans cDNA Library—SuperScript plasmid system from Invitrogen was used to establish the cDNA library using the poly(A)+ RNA from C. elegans. The transformation of the ligated cDNA into Escherichia coli was performed by electroporation using ElectroMAX DH10B-competent cells. The bacteria plating, the filter lifting, the DNA fragment labeling, and the hybridization methods followed the routine procedure (19Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem.

The DNA sequencing of the full-length ceGAT-1 cDNA clone was performed using an automated PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer (Foster City, CA) and the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing protocol. Functional Expression of ceGAT-1 in Mammalian Cells by Vaccinia Virus Expression System—Functional expression of the ceGAT-1 cDNA in HRPE cells was done using the vaccinia virus expression system as described previously (19Fei Y.J.

HRPE cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (VTF7–3) at a multiplicity of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. This virus carries the gene for T7 RNA polymerase in its genome. The virus was allowed to adsorb onto the cells for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking of the plate. Cells were then transfected with the plasmid DNA (empty vector pSPORT or ceGAT-1 cDNA construct) using the lipofection procedure (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h and then used for the determination of transport activity. The uptake of [3H]GABA was determined at 37 °C. In most experiments, the uptake medium was 25 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5, containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. In experiments in which the cation and anion dependence of the transport process was investigated, NaCl was replaced isosmotically by sodium gluconate or N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) chloride. Uptake measurements were routinely made in parallel in control cells transfected with the empty vector alone and in cells transfected with the vector-cDNA construct. The uptake activity in cDNA-transfected cells was adjusted for the endogenous activity measured in control cells to calculate the cDNA-specific activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Results are presented as means ± S.E. In Vitro Transcription, Oocyte Expression, and Electrophysiological Studies—ceGAT-1 was expressed heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of ceGAT-1 cRNA. The procedures for in vitro transcription, oocyte isolation, and microinjection have been described previously (19Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem.

The plasmid ceGAT-1 cDNA (constructed in pSPORT vector) was linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro to cRNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The expression of ceGAT-1 was initially detected by comparing the uptake of [3H]GABA in uninjected oocytes and ceGAT-1 cRNA-injected oocytes. The electrophysiological characteristics of the heterologously expressed ceGAT-1 were then studied as described previously (19Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem.

Analysis of Tissue-specific Expression Pattern of ceGAT-1—To study the tissue-specific expression pattern of the cegat-1 gene in C. elegans, a transcriptional cegat-1::gfp fusion gene was constructed and transgenic animals expressing these transgenes were established as described previously (19Fei Y.J.

The cosmid T03F7.1 containing the cegat-1 gene and its promoter was obtained from the Sanger Center (Cambridge, United Kingdom). A DNA fragment containing the cegat-1 gene promoter region was generated by PCR using this cosmid DNA as the template. The sense primer (coordinates in cosmid T03F7.1 are 3,896–3,925) with an XbaI adapter attached to the 5′-end was 5′-TCT AGA CAT TCG GCG AAG GAT GGT CGA GAG-3′, and the reverse primer (coordinates in cosmid T03F7.1 are 5,609–5,637) with a BamHI adapter attached to the 5′-end was 5′-GGA TCC CCT GCA GGA GAT TTC TGG ATA CAA-3′. A recombinant KlenTaq DNA polymerase (AB Peptides, St. Louis, MO) was used for the long-range PCR. The size of the expected PCR product is ∼2.0 kb. The amplified region contains the putative promoter for the cegat-1 gene. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into multiple cloning sites II in the pPD117.01 vector. Bacterial transformation and plasmid preparation followed a standard protocol (25Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 26Sulston J.E. Hodgkin J. Wood W. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). The minigene fusion constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Transgenic lines were established using a standard germ line transformation protocol (25Mello C. Fire A.

A cloned mutant collagen gene containing the rol-6 (plasmid pRF4) was used as a dominant genetic marker for DNA transformation. The F1 rollers were picked up according to their characteristic rolling behavior and cultured individually to establish transformed lines. GFP expression pattern was determined by fluorescence microscopy (19Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem.

Cell identification was validated by their morphology in combination with relative positions of the GFP-positive cells in the same animals using differential interference contrast image. Bacteria-mediated RNAi—A fragment of the coding region of ceGAT-1 cDNA was generated by EcoRI digestion and subcloned into a “double T7” plasmid pPD129.36 (kindly provided by Dr. A.

The induction of HT115 cells harboring the double T7 plasmid to express dsRNA and the bacteria-mediated RNAi procedure were carried out as described previously (21Fei Y.J. Inoue K. Ganapathy V. J.

To serve as a negative control for the bacteria-mediated RNAi in assessment of the influence of ceGAT-1 on animal behavior, we included an HT115 strain containing the empty vector alone.

Assay of Aldicarb-induced Paralysis—This was done according to the procedure described by Mathews et al. (30Mathews E.A. Garcia E. Santi C.M. Mullen G.P. Thacker C. Moerman D.G. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control and experimental (RNAi) worms (N2 and rrf-3 strains) (20–25 worms/experiment) were exposed to 0.5 mm aldicarb. Paralyzed worms were identified by a lack of response in terms of movement upon poking with a metal wire. The number of paralyzed worms was counted at different time periods following exposure to aldicarb. The experiment was repeated three times, and the data were analyzed as the percent of animals that were paralyzed at each time point. In the experiment in which the relevance of the abolition of GABA-ergic neurotransmission to aldicarb-induced paralysis was investigated using mutant strains, the worms (control strain N2 and the mutant strains unc-25, unc-47, and unc-2) were exposed to 0.5 mm aldicarb without the bacteria-mediated RNAi and the percent of paralyzed worms was determined at different time points following the exposure to aldicarb. This experiment was repeated twice. Thrashing Assay—This assay was used to investigate the frequency of contraction of body muscles in worms subjected to RNAi.

The COOH terminus of P-gp contains a dileucine motif (Leu1260-Leu1261) and a conserved phenylalanine (Phe1268). Similar residues in SUR1 (ABCC8) were reported to be important plasma membrane-targeting signals (Sharma, N., Crane, A., Clement, J. P. t., Gonzalez, G., Babenko, A. P., Bryan, J., and Aguilar-Bryan, L. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20628–20632). Here, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to test whether these residues were essential for trafficking of P-gp to the cell surface. Mutant L1260A expressed a 150-kDa immature protein that did not reach the cell surface and was sensitive to digestion by Endo Hf. By contrast, mutants L1261A, F1268A, and wild-type P-gps expressed the 170-kDa mature proteins at the cell surface. Mutation of Leu1260 to Gly, Ile, Trp, Lys, or Glu also resulted in the expression of the 150-kDa immature protein. All of the mutants, however, expressed the 170-kDa protein in the presence of the drug substrate/specific chemical chaperone cyclosporin A. Mutant L1260A P-gp exhibited drug-stimulated ATPase activities similar to that of wild-type enzyme after rescue with cyclosporin A. Deletion of the last 22 amino acids (Q1259-Q1280) also caused misprocessing. The mutant, however, was rescued by expression in the presence of cyclosporin A and conferred resistance to colchicine in transfected cells. These results show that the dileucine motif is not a plasma membrane targeting signal. The COOH terminus is required for proper folding of P-gp but not for activity.

Therefore, understanding the mechanism of folding and trafficking of these proteins would contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies. P-gp is an ideal model system for studying processes involved in folding and trafficking of ABC transporters, because these processes can be manipulated by specific chemical chaperones. P-gp is a typical ABC transporter. Its 1280 amino acids are organized in two repeating halves of 610 amino acids that are joined by a linker region of about 60 amino acids (6Chen C.J. Chin J.E.

In SUR1, mutational analysis of the COOH-terminal residues indicated that the dileucine motif and a downstream Phe residue formed important plasma membrane-targeting signals (25Sharma N. Crane A.

In this study, we tested whether the dileucine motif in the COOH-terminal end of P-gp was essential for trafficking of P-gp to the cell surface.

Deletion mutants were constructed by inserting stop codons at residues Thr1277, Val1273, or Gln1259 resulting in deletion of the last 4, 8, and 22 residues, respectively. The mutations were verified by sequencing the fragment used for mutagenesis by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar). Drug Rescue of Processing Mutations—Wild-type or mutant P-gp cDNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing no drug or 10 μm cyclosporin A. The cells were then incubated for another 24 h, harvested, and whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Digestion with Endoglycosidase Hf and PNGase F—Cells expressing wild-type or mutant P-gp were suspended in PBS and solubilized by addition of 0.1 volume of denaturation buffer (5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 500 mm EDTA). For digestion with endoglycosidase Hf, a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μlof0.5 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, 79 μl of denatured cell extract, 10 μl of water, and 1 μl of Endo Hf (1000 units, New England Biolabs) was incubated for 15 min at 21 °C. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was then added, and the sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. For digestion with PNGase F, a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μl of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 10 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 79 μl of denatured cell extract, and 1 μl of PNGase F (500 units, New England Biolabs) was incubated for 15 min at 21 °C. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was then added, and the sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cell Surface Labeling—Cells expressing A52-tagged wild-type or mutant P-gp and grown with or without cyclosporin A were suspended in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm NaIO4. After 30 min at 21 °C in the dark, the cells were washed four times with PBS buffer and then incubated with 0.1 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm biotin-X-hydrazide (where X represents a 7-atom aminohexanoyl spacer between biotin and the reactive carboxylic acid) (6-((biotinoyl)amino)hexanoic acid) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After 30 min at 21 °C in the dark, the cells were washed 5 times with PBS and then solubilized with PBS buffer containing 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and P-gp-A52 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52 and Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with PBS buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. SDS sample buffer was then added to the beads, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to streptavidin followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Isolation of Histidine-tagged P-gp and Measurement of Drug-stimulated ATPase Activity—Briefly, 50 (10-cm diameter) plates of HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant P-gp cDNA. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. After another 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested and solubilized with buffer containing 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and histidine-tagged P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography (28Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The isolated P-gps were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml crude sheep brain lipid (Sigma Type II) and sonicated. Aliquots of the P-gp:lipid mixture were assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP and various concentrations of drug substrates: vinblastine (0–0.4 mm) or verapamil (0–2 mm). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (30Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Measurement of Drug Resistance—Cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant P-gps were generated using the Flp-In system (Invitrogen, Canada) as described previously (31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12081-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were first grown for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm cyclosporin A. The cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove cyclosporin A and then incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in the presence of various concentrations (0–4000 nm) colchicine. The concentration of colchicine that inhibited growth by 80% (D80) was determined by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay (32Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). The SUR1 receptor forms a complex with the Kir potassium channel at the cell surface of pancreatic β cells to generate an ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel (25Sharma N. Crane A. J Clement P.t. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SUR1 is similar to P-gp in that it has two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and six transmembrane segments (TMs) in each of the two transmembrane domains (TMDs). It also contains an additional NH2-terminal domain of consisting of five TMs. It was postulated that trafficking of SUR1 to the cell surface depends on the presence of a dileucine motif and a downstream Phe at the COOH terminus of the protein. Mutation of the first Leu residue, the downstream Phe residue, or deletion of seven or more residues at the COOH terminus resulted in retention of the mutant SUR1 within the cell (25Sharma N. Crane A. J Clement P.t. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, these residues were postulated to form the plasma membrane-targeting signals. Comparison of the COOH-terminal sequences of P-gp and other ABC proteins such as mouse and hamster P-gps, human MDR3, human CFTR, hamster SUR1, or human MRP1 (Fig. 1) shows the presence of a conserved dileucine motif (Leu1260-Leu1261) that is often followed by a downstream phenylalanine (Phe1268). Other residues in the COOH-terminal region that are highly conserved are Lys1264 and Tyr1267. Accordingly, we tested whether residues Leu1260, Leu1261, Lys1264, Tyr1267, and Phe1268 are important for folding and trafficking of P-gp to the cell surface. The codons for residues Leu1260, Leu1261, Lys1264, Tyr1267, and Phe1268 in the wild-type P-gp cDNA were each mutated to alanine. The mutant cDNAs were then expressed in HEK293 cells, and then samples of whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. P-gp contains three glycosylation site at residues Asn91, Asn94, and Asn99 (33Schinkel A.H. Kemp S. Dolle M. Rudenko G. Wagenaar E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant P-gps that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are only core-glycosylated and migrate on SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent mass of 150 kDa. The carbohydrates on P-gp are modified when the protein passes through the Golgi, and as a result the protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa in SDS-PAGE gels (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the major product in mutants L1260A or Y1267A was the 150-kDa protein. By contrast, the major product in wild-type P-gp and in mutants L1261A, K1264A, and F1268A was the 170-kDa protein.Fig. 2Effect of mutations to conserved residues in the COOH-terminal end of P-gp. HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type P-gp or the indicated mutant cDNA. A, after 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing (-) no drug or (+) 10 μm cyclosporin A (Cyclo A). After another 24 h, whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp. B, wild-type and mutant L1260A P-gps were expressed in HEK 293 cells in the absence of cyclosporin A. Whole cell extracts were then treated with EndoHf (Hf), PNGase F (F), or no endoglycosidase (-). The samples were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp. Mutant P-gps with the indicated changes to Leu1260 (C) orTyr1267 (D) were expressed in HEK293 cells in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 10 μm cyclosporin A (Cyclo A). After 24 h, whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp. The positions of the mature (170 kDa), immature core-glycosylated (150 kDa), and deglycosylated (140 kDa) P-gps are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then tested whether the difference between the 150- and 170-kDa proteins was due to glycosylation and not proteolysis. The mutants were digested with Endo Hf and PNGase F. P-gp that is retained in the ER is only core-glycosylated and is sensitive to digestion with Endo Hf. Mature 170-kDa P-gp, however, contains complex carbohydrates and is resistant to digestion with Endo Hf. Fig. 2B shows that treatment of wild-type or mutant L1260A P-gps with Endo Hf resulted in the disappearance of the 150-kDa protein and the appearance of a 140-kDa protein (Fig. 2B). By contrast, the 170-kDa mature protein of wild-type P-gp was resistant to digestion with Endo Hf. The 170- and 150-kDa proteins were both sensitive to digestion by PNGase F. Similar results were observed with mutant Y1267A (data not shown). We then determined whether mutations to Leu1260 or Tyr1267 inhibited maturation of P-gp, because they were membrane-targeting signals or because they inhibited folding of the protein. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the mutants were subjected to a “drug-rescue” assay. We previously showed that mutants defective in folding could be rescued by carrying out expression in the presence of a drug substrate or modulator of P-gp. The drug substrate or modulator acts as a specific chemical chaperone to correct the folding defect (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mutations that cause the P-gp to be misprocessed and retained in the ER appear to trap the protein in a pre-folded state where there are incomplete or abnormal domain-domain interactions (22Loo T.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38395-38401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of the misprocessed mutants in the presence of the drug substrate/modulator, however, allows the protein to overcome the thermodynamic hurdle for folding by promoting interactions between the TMDs. As a result, the misprocessed mutants mature and escape the quality control mechanism in the ER and are trafficked to the cell surface as an active protein (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). If a mutation disrupts a membrane-targeting signal, then maturation should still be inhibited even after the folding defect is corrected by the presence of a chemical chaperone. Accordingly, wild-type P-gp and mutants L1260A, L1261A, K1264A, Y1267A, and F1268A were expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence or absence of the chemical chaperone/drug substrate cyclosporin A. Whole cell SDS extracts were then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2A shows that the cyclosporin A was able to rescue mutants L1260A and Y1267A, because a 170-kDa protein was then detected (Fig. 2A). These results show that mutation of Leu1260 and Tyr1267 affected folding and were not essential plasma membrane-targeting signals. We then tested the effects of other amino acid substitutions at positions Leu1260 and Tyr1267. Residue Leu1260 was mutated to Gly, Ile, Trp, Lys, or Glu, whereas residue Tyr1267 was mutated to Leu, Trp, Phe, or Lys. The mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A and whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2C shows that residue Leu1260 was very sensitive to change, because replacement with Gly, Ile, Trp, Lys, or Glu, inhibited maturation of P-gp. The major product in these mutants in SDS-PAGE gels was the 150-kDa protein. Maturation of all of the mutants, however, was restored in the presence of cyclosporin A. Residue Tyr1267 was more tolerant to change. Mutants Y1267L, Y1267W, and Y1267F were still able to mature, because the major product was the 170-kDa protein (Fig. 2C). Mutant Y1267K, however, showed inhibited maturated that could be overcome by expression in the presence of cyclosporin A. We then determined whether the 170-kDa rescued mutant proteins were actually at the cell surface. For cell surface labeling, the A52-epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant L1260A P-gps were used. The presence of the epitope tag allowed us to distinguish the mutant proteins from any endogenous P-gp present in HEK293 cells. Accordingly, HEK293 cells expressing A52-tagged wild-type or mutant L1260A were grown for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm cyclosporin A. Whole cell SDS extracts were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52. Fig. 3A shows that the major products of A52-tagged mutant L1260A P-gp were the 150- and 170-kDa proteins when expression was carried out in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A, respectively. Because the A52-tagged P-gps have the same maturation characteristics as the untagged proteins (Fig. 2A), they could be used for cell surface labeling studies. Cells expressing the A52-tagged wild-type and mutant P-gps and grown in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A were treated with sodium periodate to oxidize the carbohydrate groups on the protein and then reacted with biotin-X-hydrazide. The cells were then washed and solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and A52-tagged P-gps immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then subjected to Western blot analysis with horseradish peroxidase conjugated with streptavidin. Fig. 3B shows that the 170-kDa protein was labeled in the wild-type P-gp grown in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A. By contrast, the 170-kDa protein was labeled in mutant L1260A only when grown in the presence of cyclosporin A. Labeling of the 150-kDa protein was not detected when mutant L1260A was grown without cyclosporin A. These results indicate that the rescued mutant is present at the cell surface. Because residue Leu1260 was very sensitive to replacement with other amino acids, we determined whether mutant L1260A retained drug-stimulated ATPase activity when at the cell surface. The drug- and ATP-binding sites in P-gp are coupled such that occupation of the drug-binding site located in the TMDs (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine drug-stimulated ATPase activity, we attached a histidine tag at the COOH-end of the wild-type and mutant L1260A P-gps. The presence of the histidine tag did not affect the maturation characteristics of mutant L1260A. When histidine-tagged mutant L1260A was expressed in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A, the major products in SDS-PAGE were the 150- and 170-kDa proteins, respectively (data not show). Accordingly, histidine-tagged wild-type and mutant were grown in HEK293 cells in the presence of cyclosporin A and then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. Equivalent amounts of the isolated proteins were mixed with lipid and assayed for verapamil- or vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity. Fig. 4 shows that mutant L1260A retained more than 80% of the verapamil- or vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity of wild-type P-gp. Half-maximal activation of wild-type and rescued mutant L1260A occurred at ∼30 μm verapamil. In the presence of vinblastine, however, both wild-type and rescued mutant L1260A showed half-maximal activity at 6 μm vinblastine. Therefore, residue Leu1260 was not essential for coupling of drug binding to ATPase activity. To determine whether any segment of the COOH-terminal end of P-gp was essential for trafficking to the cell surface, we constructed a series of deletion mutants that lacked the last 4 (Δ4), 8 (Δ8), and 22 (Δ22) amino acids by inserting stop codons at residues Thr1277, Val1273, or Gln1259. The wild-type and deletion mutants were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells in the absence or presence of 10 μm cyclosporin A. Samples of whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp. When the deletion mutants Δ4, Δ8, and Δ22 were expressed in the absence of cyclosporin A, the major product in mutants Δ4 and Δ8 was ∼170 kDa, whereas the major product in mutant Δ22 was the 150-kDa protein (Fig. 5). Deletion of the last 4 or 8 amino acids did not appear to affect maturation of the proteins"

Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The exact physiological functions of these proteins are unclear, although it is generally thought that they may have a potential role in the uptake and targeting of fatty acids to various intracellular organelles and metabolic pathways. All further sites of metabolism of long chain fatty acids in the cell involve membrane proteins. For a targeting role to operate, the FABP must interact with an intracellular structure such as a membrane interface or receptor/docking protein. Targeting could be modulated by the presence of bound fatty acid and be affected by the nature of the fatty acid such as chain length and the degree of unsaturation. In addition, FABP knock-out studies in mice have highlighted the physiological importance of acyl CoAs as ligands for liver FABP (8Martin G.G. Huang H. Atshaves B.P. Binas B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11520-11532Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and hence competition between these ligands and fatty acids could influence targeting of liver FABP. Evidence for membrane binding has been provided in the case of intestinal, muscle, and adipose FABP. Model fluorescence studies have led to the proposal for interaction-mediated transfer of long-chain fatty acids between the protein and a phospholipid (reviewed in Ref. 3Storch J. Thumser A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, such a process was not observed to operate for liver FABP under the same assay conditions, and an aqueous phase diffusion mechanism was proposed, not requiring interaction of the protein with membrane surfaces (3Storch J. Thumser A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In contrast, using different assay conditions involving low ionic strength buffers we have reported the apparent binding of liver FABP to anionic vesicles, monitored as the release of the fluorescent fatty acid ligand (DAUDA) from the protein (9Davies J.K. Thumser A.A. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16932-16940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Davies J.K. Hagan R.M. Wilton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48395-48402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the binding of liver FABP to anionic vesicles involves nonspecific electrostatic interactions (9Davies J.K. Thumser A.A. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16932-16940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a result of studies using charge reversal mutagenesis, the cationic residues on the protein surface that make a significant contribution to such binding have been identified as Lys-31, Lys-36, and Lys-57 (10Davies J.K. Hagan R.M. Wilton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48395-48402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These residues are strategically placed around the portal region of the proteins in positions of enhanced protein mobility. Our studies also highlighted the role of cationic residues in ligand binding at site 2 of liver FABP particularly ligands with more bulky anionic head groups such as acyl CoAs, lysophospholipids, and bile acids (11Hagan R.M. Davies J.K. Wilton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To investigate further the effect of ligand and membrane binding on the conformation of liver FABP linked to a targeting role for this protein we have used a strategy of tryptophan insertion mutagenesis. Positions 28, 54, and 74 (see Fig. 1) were initially selected for mutagenesis to tryptophan because these positions are strategically placed surrounding the portal region. Fig. 1 is derived from the crystal structure with two bound oleates (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The oleate at site 1 is buried within the cavity with its carboxyl group neutralized by a hydrogen bonding network linked to Arg-122 (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, the oleate at site 2 has the carboxyl group located in the portal region and exposed to the external environment. Leu-28 is one of the amino acids on helix α2 along with Lys-31 that actually defines the cavity opening in liver FABP (13Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is in contact with the second oleic acid binding site (site 2) (14Thompson J. Ory J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 1Ribbon diagram of rat liver FABP showing the position of the bound oleic acid (sites 1 and 2) and the amino acids that are mutated to tryptophan.

Site 1 is the higher affinity fatty acid-binding site where the ligand is buried within the binding cavity, and the carboxyl group of the bound oleate interacts with Arg-122 via a hydrogen bonding network. The carboxyl group of the oleic acid at site 2 extends into the portal region where it is solvent-exposed. The protein molecule is oriented to most clearly show the portal region and associated residues. The model is derived from the crystal structure of liver FABP with two bound oleic acid ligands (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol.

Therefore, the results for the binding of ligands to the L28W mutant are described in detail in this study. These results provide an important insight into the functioning of liver FABP and demonstrate the ability of long chain fatty acids and acyl CoA derivatives to effectively compete for binding to the protein, thus highlighting the potential functional importance of acyl CoA in modulating liver FABP function. Materials—DAUDA was obtained from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR.). Phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL); fatty acids and laboratory chemicals are from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and other molecular biologicals were from Promega (Southampton, UK) and Sigma. Mutagenic primers were provided by MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Molecular Biology—The preparation of a synthetic gene for rat liver FABP (15Worrall A.F. Evans C. Wilton D.C. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16932-16940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has been described. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using standard cloning procedures as described previously (16Beers S.A. Buckland A.G. Giles N. Gelb M.H. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7326-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequence used for the construction of the L28W mutant was as follows (mutant sequence is underlined), 5′-GGGTCTGCCGGAAGACTGGATCCAGAAAGGTAAAG-3′. The mutated liver FABP construct was verified by sequence analysis that was carried out by Oswel (Southampton, UK). Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant FABP and the mutant were expressed, purified, and delipidated as described previously (9Davies J.K. Thumser A.A. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16932-16940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Purity was confirmed by silver staining after SDS-PAGE with a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad) used according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD Spectra—The CD spectrum of wild type and L28W mutant FABP were performed using a Jasco J-270 spectropolarimeter. For comparative secondary structure CD, a 0.5 mg/ml solution of protein in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was measured between 190 and 250 nm. Ligand Binding Assays—DAUDA binding assays were performed by titrating up to 1 nmol of DAUDA into liver FABP (0.8 nmol) in 10 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.5. The increase in fluorescence at 500 nm was monitored after excitation at 350 nm. Titrations are corrected for dilution and for a blank titration involving addition of DAUDA to buffer only. The Kd values were determined using Sigma Plot software. The binding of fatty acids and other ligands to tryptophan mutants of FABP was performed by titrating ligand in methanol into protein in 10 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer or phosphate-buffered saline as indicated. The final methanol volume did not exceed 2.5% (v/v) and had no effect on the fluorescence measurements other than dilution, which was corrected. Excitation was at 280 nm and emission was at 340 nm using a Hitachi F2000 fluorimeter. Wavelength scans were performed using a Hitachi F2500 fluorimeter. Urea Denaturation Studies—The tryptophan-containing mutants of liver FABP was equilibrated 50 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing up to 8 m urea, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 1 h and 2 h to ensure that a folding equilibrium had been achieved. Excitation was at 280 nm, and emission was at 340 nm using a Hitachi F2000 fluorimeter. CD Properties of the Wild Type and L28W Mutant—The CD spectra for wild type liver FABP and L28W mutant are shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum of the L28W mutant is essentially identical to the wild type FABP indicating correct folding. This is confirmed by the ligand binding studies (see below). Fluorescent Characteristics of the L28W Tryptophan Mutant—The fluorescence emission spectrum of the tryptophan mutant was recorded. The fluorescence emission maximum was at a wavelength of 341.7 ± 0.6 nm consistent with the tryptophan being located in a relatively solvent exposed environment. The fluorescence intensity was low compared with other tryptophan-containing mutants of liver FABP measured under identical conditions and having maximum emission at similar wavelengths (data not shown). Although it is difficult to predict precisely how the environment would affect fluorescence intensity, the low fluorescent yield with L28W would be consistent with this tryptophan residue being in close proximity to a quenching agent such as a polar group within the apoprotein. Ligand Binding Properties of the L28W Tryptophan Mutant—The binding of the fluorescent fatty acid derivative, DAUDA, to the wild type and mutant liver FABP was determined by making use of the increased fluorescence intensity when this probe binds to liver FABP. This enhanced fluorescence is a direct measure of ligand binding and is used to determine the Kd and the fluorescence properties of the bound probe. The Kd was 0.18 ± 0.04 μm and this compares with a Kd for the wild type liver FABP of 0.12 ± 0.02 μm. The wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity of FABP-bound DAUDA was the same for the wild type and L28W mutant at 498 nm indicating no significant change in the polarity of the binding cavity. Effect of Ligand Binding on the Fluorescent Characteristics of L28W—The ability of liver FABP to bind a variety of physiological ligands in addition to long chain fatty acids provided an opportunity to compare the effect of ligand binding on the fluorescent properties of this tryptophan mutant. The ligands oleic acid and oleoyl CoA were chosen together with lithocholic and the conjugated bile acids lithocholic acid 3-sulfate and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate as these bile acid derivatives show highest affinity for liver FABP (17Thumser A.A. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Takikawa H. Kaplowitz N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and may be physiological ligands (19Dietrich A. Dieminger W. Fuchte K. Stoll G.H. Schlitz E. Gerok W. Kurz G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1745-1755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty Acids—The effects of oleic acid addition on the fluorescence properties of L28W are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table I. A number of important features emerged from this study. First, oleic acid produced a 4-fold increase in fluorescence intensity, and the shape of this titration with the L28W was sigmoidal suggesting binding cooperativity. In fact, binding cooperativity was seen for all long chain fatty acids that were tested (see below). The L28W mutation is remote from site 1 for oleic acid (Fig. 1) and would be expected to be reporting on site 2 binding. A conclusion from crystallographic studies is that a fully functional site 2 must involve the presence of a fatty acid (oleic acid) at site 1 (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), therefore cooperativity was not unexpected and is examined in more detail.Table IThe effect of ligands on the fluorescent properties of the L28W mutant of liver FABPLigand addedLigand concentrationWavelength maximumMaximum fluorescence intensityμmnm% apoproteinNone341.0 ± 0.5100Oleic acid4342.5 ± 0.5390 ± 3Oleic acid20342.0 ± 0.5405 ± 3Linoleic acid20342.0 ± 0.5368 ± 5Linolenic acid20341.5 ± 0.5372 ± 9Arachidonic acid20342.0 ± 0.5366 ± 1Docosahexaenoic acid20342.8 ± 0.8353 ± 14Palmitic acid4343.0 ± 1.0220 ± 20Myristic acid200339.0 ± 1.5186 ± 14Oleoyl CoA4339.5 ± 0.575 ± 1Lithocholic acid 3-sulfate4341.5 ± 0.5356 ± 12Lithocholic acid 3-sulfate200341.5 ± 0.5393 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Cooperative Binding of Oleic Acid and Other Fatty Acids— The large enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence seen with the L28W mutant on binding oleic acid provided an opportunity to investigate in more detail the binding of fatty acids to this protein. In particular, is it possible that the more condensed structure of polyunsaturated fatty acids produces a different fluorescence response compared with the binding of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids? The representative fatty acids chosen were myristic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid (n-6), α-linolenic acid (n-3), arachidonic acid (n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (n-3). Stearic acid was not studied because of its very low solubility in aqueous buffers. Titration of long chain fatty acids into the L28W mutant result in a considerable increase in fluorescence intensity for all fatty acids that were studied. The titration curves are shown (Fig. 4). The greatest fluorescence enhancement was 4-fold with oleic acid, whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids produced slightly lower enhancement values. The value for palmitic acid was limited by the low solubility of this ligand and reached a plateau above ∼2 μm fatty acid. Light scattering confirmed aggregation of palmitic acid above this concentration, which was not seen with oleic acid (data not shown). As expected, myristic acid showed a much lower affinity consistent with previous published work (20Wilkinson T.I. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All the fatty acids tested demonstrated a modest cooperativity in terms of fluorescence response, a result consistent with the prediction from the crystal structure that the second fatty acid binding site may not be completely formed until after the primary site is filled (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Oleoyl CoA—In contrast to fatty acids, the binding of oleoyl CoA was accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3). This small change in fluorescence provided the first opportunity to directly measure the binding of a natural fatty acyl CoA to liver FABP where binding is predicted to involve site 2, based on analysis of the crystal structure (13Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the binding curve for oleoyl CoA with L28W (Fig. 5) assuming a single site, produced a Kd apparent value of 0.68 ± 0.08 μm, similar to values determined from displacement studies (11Hagan R.M. Davies J.K. Wilton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The binding of oleoyl CoA to the M74W mutant (see the introduction) was also analyzed as this produced a larger decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 5). A Kd value of 0.66 ± 0.20 μm was obtained from this data assuming a single binding site very similar to that obtained with the L28W mutant. Bile Acids—The binding of lithocholic acid and its conjugates was accompanied by an increase in fluorescence that was larger with the two sulfate containing derivatives, lithocholic acid 3-sulfate and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (Fig. 3). In contrast, lithocholic acid and taurolithocholic acid produced a modest increase in fluorescence (Fig. 3). When a very high concentration of lithocholic acid 3-sulfate was used to saturate the FABP, an almost 4-fold fluorescence enhancement was observed essentially identical to that seen for oleic acid binding (Table I). No suggestion of cooperativity was seen for any bile acid derivative when binding to the L28W mutant consistent with only one ligand molecule being accommodated within the binding cavity of the protein. Overall, the spectral properties of the L28W mutant with bound fatty acids, oleoyl CoA, or lithocholic acid 3-sulfate are summarized in Table I. No significant change in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence is seen for any ligand, however the increase in fluorescence intensity is greatest for oleic acid and lithocholic acid 3-sulfate using saturating concentrations of ligand. In contrast, a 25% reduction in fluorescence intensity is observed with binding of oleoyl CoA. The large increase in fluorescence seen in particular with fatty acid binding requires a molecular explanation. The intrinsic fluorescence of the L28W is low compared with other tryptophan insertion mutants. 2R. M. Hagan, J. Worner-Gibbs, and D. C. Wilton, unpublished data. An explanation is that the tryptophan in the apoprotein is quenched by another group within the protein that is in close proximity to Trp-28. Ligand binding must change the environment of Trp-28 reducing the quenching of this tryptophan and producing the large increase in fluorescence intensity that is observed. If this is the case, then loss of protein structure as a result of unfolding should, at least in terms of partial unfolding, also result in an increase in fluorescence. When the L28W mutant was equilibrated in a range of urea concentrations it demonstrated a significant increase in fluorescence, this increase being 60% if exposed to 8 m urea. This increase compares with a large fall in fluorescence seen with F3W, F18W, and C69W (21Thumser A.A. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and also Y54W and M74W. 2R. M. Hagan, J. Worner-Gibbs, and D. C. Wilton, unpublished data. An alternative explanation for the L28W results is increased fluorescence on ligand (fatty acid) binding is caused by a change in the oligomeric state of L28W. However, the wild type and L28W liver FABPs showed identical elution patterns both in the absence or presence of oleic acid in the elution buffer when analyzed using Superdex 75 (data not shown). Competition between Binding Oleic Acid and Oleoyl CoA to Liver FABP Demonstrated Using the L28W Mutant—The opposing effects of oleic acid and oleoyl CoA on tryptophan fluorescence intensity of L28W provided a unique opportunity to observe direct competition between these two ligands for binding to liver FABP under more physiological conditions. Can fatty acids and fatty acyl CoAs effectively compete for binding to liver FABP within the cell and hence modulate FABP function? Ligand competition titrations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline to more accurately reflect ionic conditions within the cell because we previously observed that the binding of oleoyl CoA is sensitive to the ionic strength of the medium, being facilitated at higher ionic strength (11Hagan R.M. Davies J.K. Wilton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The effect on protein fluorescence of adding oleic acid to liver FABP up to a ligand-protein stoichiometry of ∼1:1 followed by the addition by titration of excess oleoyl CoA is shown in Fig. 6. The expected large rise in fluorescence on the addition of oleic acid is followed by an equally large fall in fluorescence immediately following the addition of oleoyl CoA. Moreover, when the order of ligand addition is reversed, a reciprocal plot is obtained in which the expected fall in fluorescence on addition of oleoyl CoA is followed by a large rise in fluorescence on the subsequent addition of oleic acid. Control titrations using only oleic acid or oleoyl CoA over these ranges of ligand concentration (Fig. 6) confirm the fluorescence response seen in Fig. 3. These results provide the first direct illustration of how, when present at similar concentrations, oleic acid and oleoyl CoA compete effectively for binding to liver FABP as a consequence of similar affinities. The unique fluorescence properties of L28W allow the binding of the natural ligands rather than fluorescent analogues to be measured, and these observations have important implications when discussing the physiological role of liver FABP. This experimental protocol allowed the binding of other fatty acids to be compared with oleic acid, and the experiment was repeated with a saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid, and a polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid. The results (data not shown) again showed displacement of oleoyl CoA by the fatty acid with an increase in fluorescence and displacement of fatty acid by oleoyl CoA with a decrease in fluorescence. Similarly, lithocholic acid 3-sulfate was an effective displacer of oleoyl CoA and vice versa as monitored by the changes in fluorescence of L28W (Fig. 7), producing very similar responses to that seen in when oleic acid and oleoyl CoA compete (Fig. 6). There is considerable evidence that highlights the important role of the portal region of FABPs in ligand and membrane binding and cellular function (7Glatz J.F.C. Storch J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) including deletion of the helical motif of intestinal FABP (22Corsico B. Cistola D.P. Frieden C. Storch J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 12174-12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Wu F. Corsico B. Flach C.R. Cistola D.P. Storch J. Mendelsohn R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1976-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and helical swapping with liver FABP (24Corsico B. Liou H.L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3600-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the case of murine adipocyte FABP, the effect of enlargement of the portal on ligand access was evaluated after multiple glycine insertion mutagenesis (25Jenkins A.E. Hockenberry J.A. Nguyen T. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this paper we used tryptophan insertion mutagenesis to produce the portal mutant, L28W, with fluorescence properties that are very sensitive to ligand binding. The position of this mutation is consistent with the tryptophan reporting at ligand-binding site 2, where the anionic group of ligands such as fatty acids is located within the portal (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We propose that the increase in fluorescence intensity on binding fatty acids is caused by conformational changes at site 2 that reduces the quenching environment. It has been proposed that quenching of tryptophan by nearby amino acid residues is a common occurrence in folded proteins (26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Edition. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 445-486Crossref Google Scholar). Inspection of the structure (Fig. 1) suggests that residues in the vicinity of Tyr-54 at the βCβD turn are appropriately placed. The unfolding of the protein as a result of urea treatment should remove such amino acid residues from the vicinity of Trp-28 resulting in an increase in fluorescence. This was indeed the case and also argues against quenching of Trp-28 by solvent in the apoprotein but not after fatty acid binding because urea treatment should enhance solvent exposure resulting in a decrease in fluorescence. The binding of oleoyl CoA reduced the fluorescence intensity of L28W, indicating that in contrast to the binding of fatty acids this tryptophan is in a more quenched environment in the holoprotein. Oleoyl CoA has been modeled into the binding cavity of liver FABP (13Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the pyrophosphate backbone of CoA is adjacent to Leu-28. This pyrophosphate group would provide such a quenching environment, whereas when oleic acid is bound at site 2, the non-quenching alkyl chain of the fatty acid is adjacent to Leu-28 (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The fluorescence studies with the L28W mutant have clarified three important ligand binding properties of liver FABP that are relevant to physiological function. Fatty Acid Binding and Binding Site Cooperativity—The fatty acid binding studies with the L28W mutant demonstrated cooperativity between sites 1 and 2. In fact, the crystal structure of liver FABP with two bound oleates had already indicated that a fully functional (high affinity) site 2 appeared to depend on the presence of oleic acid at site 1, the primary site (12Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The Kd values range from 0.009–0.2 μm for the primary site and from 0.06–4.0 μm for the secondary site (27Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rolf B. Oudenampsen-Kruger E. Borchers T. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Lezius A. Spener F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Miller K.R. Cistola D.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the very low Kd values that have been quoted result from using fatty acid salts rather than free acids as ligands (30Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6545-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At least two models explain the observed cooperativity for fatty acid binding resulting, both requiring that ligand binding at site 2 and not the more remote site 1 produces the fluorescence change seen with L28W. The first model involves sequential ligand binding in which site 2 is only fully formed after occupancy of site 1. This cooperativity would become increasingly more dramatic with increasing differences in affinity between the two sites for fatty acid, as site 1 is compulsorily occupied prior to site 2. However, the observed sigmoidal nature of the fluorescence response is modest and not consistent with compulsory sequential binding. Therefore we feel that a more likely explanation is that the first molecule of oleic acid can bind at either site 1 or site 2. Cooperativity will be achieved because the addition of further ligand will preferentially bind to site 2 of FABP molecules, in which site 1 is already occupied, rather than to apo-FABP. This model is in line with recent NMR studies using 13C-labeled long chain fatty acids where the NMR resonances are interpreted as involving exchange of fatty acid between sites 1 and 2 (31Wang H. He Y. Kroenke C.D. Kodukula S. Storch J. Palmer A.G. Stark R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5453-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All fatty acids that were studied demonstrated cooperativity, which was most apparent when oleic acid was the ligand. No major differences were observed between fatty acids other than those anticipated based on different affinities of individual ligands as a result of differences in hydrophobicity or solubility. For example, essential polyunsaturated fatty acids did not produce major differences in terms of fluorescence response as compared with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. These results suggest that there would be no specific differences in the metabolism of particular fatty acids as a result of being bound to liver FABP. Fatty Acyl CoAs Can Compete with Fatty Acids for Binding to Liver FABP—The significant decrease in fluorescence of L28W on binding of oleoyl CoA permitted a number of important properties of liver FABP to be investigated with respect to this ligand. First, it provided an opportunity to directly measure the binding affinity of oleoyl CoA rather than using indirect methods or relying on fluorescent analogues. The binding data produced an apparent Kd value of 0.68 μm, a figure that is similar to that obtained using DAUDA displacement studies (11Hagan R.M. Davies J.K. Wilton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and in the same affinity range as that reported for fatty acids binding at the secondary site (27Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rolf B. Oudenampsen-Kruger E. Borchers T. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Lezius A. Spener F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Miller K.R. Cistola D.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A second tryptophan mutant, M74W, was also used to confirm these observations. The M74W mutant produced a larger decrease in fluorescence than that seen with L28W. The apparent Kd value obtained, 0.66 μm, was very similar to that using L28W whereas both calculations assumed a 1:1 molar binding stoichiometry. Second, the opposite effects on fluorescence intensity of binding oleic acid and oleoyl Co allowed a direct measurement of the competition between fatty acid and fatty acyl CoA binding when added successively to liver FABP (Fig. 6). The titration profiles are not compatible with the apparent Ki values that were determined in previous studies. Thus, using DAUDA displacement, an apparent Ki value of 1 μm was obtained for oleoyl CoA (11Hagan R.M. Davies J.K. Wilton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas in contrast the apparent Ki value for oleic acid was 0.04 μm (10Davies J.K. Hagan R.M. Wilton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48395-48402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A greater than 20-fold difference in Ki between oleic acid and oleoyl CoA should dramatically affect the shape of the fluorescence changes with the L28W mutant with oleoyl CoA being a poor displacer of oleic acid. In fact, the shape of the curves in Fig. 6 indicates that oleoyl CoA and oleic acid have similar affinities for liver FABP of considerable physiological relevance. The discrepancy with DAUDA displacement studies probably reflects the fact that L28W is reporting on site 2 with an apparent Kd value for fatty acids (published range 0.06–4.0 μm) that is an order of magnitude higher than the site 1 Kd (published range 0.009 to 0.2 μm) (27Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rolf B. Oudenampsen-Kruger E. Borchers T. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Lezius A. Spener F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Miller K.R. Cistola D.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas DAUDA displacement reports on site 1 (10Davies J.K. Hagan R.M. Wilton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48395-48402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Presumably, the replacement of a fatty acid at site 2 by oleoyl CoA compulsorily also results in loss of the fatty acid including DAUDA from a perturbed site 1 to allow the bulky acyl chain of the oleoyl CoA to be accommodated within the binding cavity. When the fluorescent fatty acid parinaric acid and its CoA derivative are used to measure bind affinities to liver FABP, Kd values in the nm range were obtained for both the free acid and CoA ester (30Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6545-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas a 2:1 stoichiometry is proposed for both ligands. Although these studies are reporting much higher affinities than seen by others, the authors conclude that both fatty acid and fatty acyl CoA can effectively compete for liver FABP binding sites consistent with our observations with the L28W mutant. Liver FABP with bound fatty acyl CoA will have significantly different structural properties compared with the apoprotein or with fatty acid as the ligand. This is because the highly anionic phosphopanthenyl part of the molecule is predicted to be surface exposed within the portal region (13Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and should dramatically affect potential protein-protein or protein-membrane interactions. It remains to be established if these structural differences in properties affect ligand targeting or if the holoprotein has more specific regulatory affects on lipid metabolism such as interacting with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (32Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A recent study involving liver FABP knock-out mice has highlighted the significant role of this protein in binding fatty acyl CoA in vivo while the relative contributions of liver FABP and acyl CoA binding protein under varying conditions were discussed (8Martin G.G. Huang H. Atshaves B.P. Binas B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11520-11532Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the liver FABP gene enhanced the targeting of both fluorescent fatty acids and acyl CoAs to the nucleus (33Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Atshaves B.P. Woldegiorgis G. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2484-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Third, we have demonstrated that bile acids derived from lithocholic acid are good ligands for FABP and that lack of cooperativity is consistent with liver FABP binding only one molecule of ligand. The binding of these bile acids and their conjugates could involve two possible orientations of ligands in the protein cavity. We have previously argued that more bulky anionic groups occupy site 2 where solvent exposure allows such groups to be more readily accommodated and stabilized (11Hagan R.M. Davies J.K. Wilton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We propose that the identical and small effect of lithocholic acid and taurolithocholic acid on L28W fluorescence is caused by the internalization of the bile acid side chain so that its anionic charge interacts with site 1 or may exchange between the two sites. In contrast we argue that the 3-sulfate group is located at site 2 and produces the dramatic fluorescence enhancement as a result of conformational changes in the region of tryptophan at position 28. Thus lithocholic acid 3-sulfate can be accommodated at site 2 with the anionic sulfate located in the portal region, whereas the side chain anionic carboxyl group would be in the vicinity of the site 1 anion binding site of liver FABP. We have argued that lithocholic acid-3-sulfate binds at site 2 and competes with oleoyl CoA binding. In fact we observed similar titration curves to those involving oleic acid and oleoyl CoA, and this reflects the fact that these ligands must bind at site 2 with similar Kd values. We have reported Ki values of the order of 1 μm for both oleoyl CoA and lithocholic acid 3-sulfate (11Hagan R.M. Davies J.K. Wilton D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas a similar value has previously been reported for lithocholic acid 3-sulfate (18Takikawa H. Kaplowitz N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, in theory, such bile acid derivatives could affect the physiological function of liver FABP. In summary, fluorescence studies with the tryptophan mutant L28W have highlighted conformational changes in liver FABP as a result of ligand binding. These studies have provided more details as to how specific ligands, particularly fatty acids and acyl CoAs, interact with the protein. It is proposed that competition between fatty acids and fatty acyl CoAs for liver FABP should play an important role in ligand targeting within the cell."

The expression of PTEN in PTEN-mutant glioblastoma cells leads to a cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 that is mediated at least partially by increased p27kip1 levels. Here we show that p27kip1 is not regulated by transcriptional control but that p27kip1 protein shows increased stability after inhibition of the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase pathway. Because p27kip1 protein stability is known to be regulated by phosphorylation, we have examined modifications in the phosphorylation pattern after PI 3-kinase inhibition. Biochemical evidence suggests that p27kip1 is phosphorylated on several serine residues, including Ser-10 and Ser-178, but that phosphorylation is unaltered by PI 3-kinase activity. This is further confirmed by the inducible expression of p27kip1 phosphorylation site mutants, suggesting that p27kip1 is destabilized in a phosphorylation-independent manner by the PI 3-kinase pathway at the G1/S transition.

A reduction of p27kip1 expression using antisense oligonucleotides against p27kip1 prevents the PTEN-induced G0/G1 arrest, implicating p27kip1 as a key mediator of the PI 3-kinase-mediated cell cycle progression (7Gottschalk A.R. Basila D. Wong M. Dean N.M. Brandts C.H. Stokoe D. Haas-Kogan D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2105-2111PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of PI 3-kinase in p27kip1 null cells is also less effective at causing G1 arrest (8Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.

However, the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation of p27kip1 in glioblastoma cells after the introduction of PTEN remain unclear.Posttranslational modifications of p27kip1 have been studied extensively. Not only is p27kip1 an inhibitor of the Cyclin-Cdk2 complex, it can also act as a substrate. Cdk2-Cyclin E phosphorylates p27kip1 on Thr-187, which leads to the recruitment of the Skp2-containing Skp1-Cul1-Fbox protein complex (a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) resulting in p27kip1 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (9Carrano A.C.

It is not clear whether this also applies to other tumor types with high AKT activity or whether this regulation is specific for breast cancer. AKT may also phosphorylate Thr-198, promoting 14-3-3 association and cytoplasmic sequestration (17Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).Finally, it has been demonstrated that Forkhead transcription factors, which are inactivated after the phosphorylation by AKT, can regulate p27kip1 transcription (8Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 18Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M.

Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) have also proposed that Forkhead transcription factors increase p27kip1 levels by affecting primarily protein stability.The importance of p27kip1 as an important mediator of PI 3-kinase-induced cell cycle progression is well established, but clearly the mechanism of regulation can be different in different cell types. We therefore explored the mechanisms underlying p27kip1 induction following inhibition of PI 3-kinase in PTEN-mutant glioblastoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—U87-MG glioblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with antibiotics. When cells were to be infected with adenovirus, the medium was changed to 2% fetal bovine serum 1 h prior to infection.Inducible Cell Lines—Ecdysone-inducible cell lines were established using the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system (Invitrogen). Hygromycin-resistant pIND expression vectors containing Myc-tagged p27kip1 and phosphorylation site mutants were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) into U87-MG cell lines expressing the ecdysone response receptor. Twenty single cell-derived independent drug-resistant colonies of each form of p27kip1 were cloned and screened for each gene. Exogenous expression levels of each of these genes was monitored by Western blotting, and the highest induced gene expression cell line was chosen for further study. Different ranges of ponasterone A (PonA) concentration were used to induce p27kip1 to different degrees in the different cell lines. The amounts varied from 0.3 to 10 μm but were different in the cell lines in a manner that was independent of the generation of phosphorylation sites and were probably more related to clonal variability.Control and WT PTEN-expressing adenoviruses were made as described previously (7Gottschalk A.R. Basila D. Wong M. Dean N.M. Brandts C.H. Stokoe D. Haas-Kogan D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2105-2111PubMed Google Scholar). U87-MG cells were infected routinely at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and cells were harvested 48 h after infection. The infection efficiency achieved by this procedure was >98% (data not shown).Quantitative Real Time PCR—RNA was purified by the RNAeasy protocol (Qiagen), and first strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase. p27kip1 RNA levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR (TaqMan) using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGTTAGCGGAGCAATGCG-3′ and 5′-TCCACAGAACCGGCATTTG-3′ to amplify the p27kip1 cDNA and the fluorescently labeled internal oligonucleotide 5′-TGCAACCGACGATTCTTCTACTCAAAACAAA-3′ for fluorescence detection, using an ABI 4700 analyzer. The quantification of p27kip1 was performed relative to the control gene hGUS by subtracting the cycle threshold (Ct) of the hGUS gene from the Ct of p27kip1. The resulting difference in cycle number (ΔCt) is the exponent of the base 2 (because of the doubling function of PCR), representing the -fold difference of the template for these two genes (20Ginzinger D.G. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis and Antibodies—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged (10,000 × g) to remove insoluble components. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and separated by standard SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Anti-phospho-Ser-473-Akt and anti-phospho-Thr-308-Akt antibodies were produced as described previously (21Taylor V. Wong M. Brandts C. Reilly L. Dean N.M. Cowsert L.M. Moodie S. Stokoe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6860-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Anti-p27kip1 antibodies and anti-Cdk2 antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film.Two-dimensional Isoelectrical Focusing-SDS-Protein Analysis Gel Electrophoresis—Equal amounts of material (as normalized by cell number) were lysed in 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Biolytes (pH 3–10). Readystrips (pH 3–10, Bio-Rad) were actively rehydrated with 300 μl of sample. The isoelectrical focusing was performed in a Bio-Rad chamber to separate proteins by charge, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After equilibration in appropriate buffers, 12% gels were run to separate proteins by mass in the second dimension. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and blotted using an anti-p27kip1 antibody (BD Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Cdk2 Kinase Assay—Subconfluent monolayers of U87-MG cells were lysed as described for immunoblot analysis. Endogenous Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated by adding 1 μg of anti-Cdk2 antibody (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and kept on ice for 1 h. Protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and samples were collected after 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer. One-half of the immunoprecipitate was used for immunoblotting. The other half was used to measure kinase activity using 2 μg of histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology) as a substrate in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (EasyTide, Amersham Biosciences). The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 15 min and then stopped with 4× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radioactivity was quantified using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Cycloheximide Experiments—U87-MG cells were treated with cycloheximide (200 μg/ml) at the indicated times. Equal amounts of lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for p27kip1, p21cip1, Cyclin D3, and β-actin.Pulse-Chase Experiments—To measure the turnover of p27kip1 protein, subconfluent U87-MG cells were plated and induced with the indicated amounts of PonA as necessary. After preincubation for 1 h with methionine- and cysteine-free medium, cells were pulsed with 500 μCi of EasyTag EXPRE35S protein-labeling mixture (containing 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine, catalog no. NEG772, PerkinElmer) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After they were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were replaced with medium containing methionine and cysteine and lysed after the indicated times in buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 25 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. After preclearing with protein G beads, p27kip1 was immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of anti-p27kip1 antibody (catalog no. SC-528, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein G beads. The precipitate was washed six times in lysis buffer and separated on a 12% SDS gel. After transfer to an Immobilon-P membrane, p27kip1 was quantified using the STORM PhosphorImager. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting for p27kip1.Antisense Oligonucleotides, [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling, Phosphoamino Analysis, and Phosphopeptide Mapping—Cells were treated with p27kip1 antisense oligonucleotides as described previously (7Gottschalk A.R. Basila D. Wong M. Dean N.M. Brandts C.H. Stokoe D. Haas-Kogan D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2105-2111PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent U87-MG cells were preincubated in phosphate-free medium for 1 h and labeled with 1 mCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid for 6 h. Cells were lysed, and p27kip1 was immunoprecipitated as described for pulsechase analyses.One-third of the sample was separated on a 12% SDS gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and immunoblotted for p27kip1. The membrane was exposed to the STORM PhosphorImager, and radiolabeled p27kip1 was quantified. The membrane containing p27kip1 was excised and subjected to partial hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for 60 min at 110 °C. Two-dimensional phosphoamino analysis was performed as described previously (22van der Boyle W.J. Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar).Two-thirds of the sample were separated on a 12% SDS gel and exposed to the STORM PhosphorImager. The band corresponding to p27kip1 was excised and digested with trypsin, and the phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography (22van der Boyle W.J. Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar).Cell Cycle Analysis—U87-MG cells were trypsinized following 48 h of treatment with 20 μm LY294002 and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Roche Applied Sciences) and 1 μg/ml RNase A, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To aid in the visualization of the effects on the cell cycle, one-half of the samples were treated with nocodazole (70 ng/ml) for 18 h prior to trypsinization to induce an arrest in G2, as described previously (23Furnari F.B. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5002-5008PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSInhibition of the PI 3-Kinase Pathway by PTEN or LY294002 Leads to p27kip1 Stabilization—The introduction of PTEN leads to a G1 arrest that is mediated by p27kip1 (7Gottschalk A.R. Basila D. Wong M. Dean N.M. Brandts C.H. Stokoe D. Haas-Kogan D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2105-2111PubMed Google Scholar). Using an adenovirus expression system >98% of cells were green fluorescent protein-positive by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, indicating adenoviral gene transduction into >98% of cells (data not shown). We (7Gottschalk A.R. Basila D. Wong M. Dean N.M. Brandts C.H. Stokoe D. Haas-Kogan D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2105-2111PubMed Google Scholar) and other investigators (4Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 6Sun H. Lesche R. Li D.M. Liliental J. Zhang H. Gao J. Gavrilova N. Mueller B. Liu X. Wu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biol. 2001; 11: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have shown previously that p27kip1 levels accumulate in U87-MG cells after the expression of WT PTEN or treatment with LY294002 (Fig. 1A). This accumulation was not caused by transcriptional regulation because quantitative PCR (Fig. 1A) or Northern blotting (data not shown) showed no significant differences in p27kip1 mRNA levels. We therefore examined whether changes in p27kip1 stability could underlie the increased levels seen following the inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity. As depicted in Fig. 1B, adding cycloheximide to prevent protein synthesis resulted in the decay of p27kip1 levels in untreated cells, with a half-life of ∼2 h. In contrast, when PI 3-kinase was inhibited by either infection with PTEN adenovirus or treatment with LY294002, cycloheximide addition did not result in a rapid loss of p27kip1 protein. In the inhibited cells, the p27kip1 half-life was greater than the duration of the experiment, i.e. >8 h. In contrast, the stability of two additional cell cycle proteins, p21cip1 and Cyclin D3, was not affected by PI 3-kinase inhibition (Fig. 1B). p27kip1 stabilization by PI 3-kinase inhibition was independent of AKT and mTOR, because the overexpression of dominant-negative (kinase-dead) AKT or treatment with rapamycin did not dramatically affect p27kip1 stability (Fig. 1C). Increased p27kip1 stability following the inhibition of PI 3-kinase was further confirmed by [35S]Met/Cys pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1D). The half-life of endogenous p27kip1 determined by these experiments was 1.5–2 h, which increased to 4–6 h in the presence of LY294002 or PTEN adenovirus. This is slightly less that the half-life determined by cycloheximide treatment, suggesting that proteins required for p27kip1 degradation may also have a short half-life.p27kip1 Phosphorylation Pattern or Overall Charge Is Unaltered by PTEN Expression or Treatment with LY294002—Because p27kip1 stability could be regulated by phosphorylation, we tested whether the inhibition of PI 3-kinase altered p27kip1 stability by changing its phosphorylation state. Immunoprecipitation from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled U87-MG cells demonstrated that endogenous p27kip1 was a phosphoprotein under these conditions (Fig. 2A). Endogenous phosphorylated Cdk2, the identity of which was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown), was also co-immunoprecipitated under these circumstances. However, the stoichiometry of p27kip1 phosphorylation was not altered dramatically on PTEN expression or LY294002 treatment (Fig. 2A). Phosphoamino analysis of total p27kip1 showed that p27kip1 was phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues and that threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed (Fig. 2B) even after long exposures. To determine whether individual phosphorylation sites might be affected by PI 3-kinase activity, we digested the phosphorylated protein with trypsin and separated the released phosphopeptides by two-dimensional electrophoresis. This analysis showed that four major phosphopeptides were consistently apparent (Fig. 2B). The two minor phosphopeptides (Fig. 2B, asterisks) were not consistently seen across several experiments. After the inhibition of PI 3-kinase with LY294002 (Fig. 2B) or PTEN (data not shown), this pattern of phosphopeptides was almost identical, suggesting that phosphorylation of individual p27kip1 phosphorylation sites was not affected significantly by PI 3-kinase activity. In a complementary approach that was applied to analyze the phosphorylation status of p27kip1, as well as to analyze additional post-translational modifications, we performed two-dimensional gel and Western blot analyses. After treatment of U87-MG cells with LY294002 or PTEN, protein lysates were separated by isoelectrical focusing followed by SDS-PAGE and blotted for p27kip1. This analysis revealed two major and three minor differentially charged forms of p27kip1, which also did not consistently change following PI 3-kinase inhibition (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Changes in phosphorylation of p27kip1 are not detectable following inhibition of PI 3-kinase. A, U87-MG cells were treated with Me2SO (DMSO) or 20 μm LY294002 or infected with control (Cont Ad) or PTEN adenovirus (PTEN Ad). 24 h later, the cells were incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free medium followed by an incubation of 6 h in phosphate-free medium containing 1 mCi of orthophosphate. Cells were then harvested and incubated with protein G beads (precleared (pc), odd lanes), and the supernatant of this incubation was immunoprecipitated with p27kip1 antibody and protein G beads (p27, even lanes). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by phosphorimaging analysis. Arrows indicate p27kip1 and the associated Cdk2 present in the immunoprecipitate. 10% of the immunoprecipitate was run on a separate SDS gel and Western blotted for p27kip1. B, p27kip1 from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled Me2SO- or from LY294002-treated cells was recovered as in A, excised from the gel, and digested with trypsin, and peptides were resolved in two dimensions on thin layer chromatography plates. Longer exposures of the p27kip1 phosphopeptides from the Me2SO-treated cells were used to generate similar visual intensities. Shown on the top left is a schematic map of the resolved phosphopeptides. The bottom left panel shows p27kip1 recovered from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled LY294002-treated cells and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (paa). The other bottom panels are densitometric analyses of spots 1–4. C, U87-MG cells were treated with either Me2SO or LY294002 or infected with control or PTEN adenoviruses. Cells were subjected to isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and Western blotted using a p27kip1 antibody. Longer film exposure times were used for Me2SO- and control adenovirus-treated cells than for LY294002- or PTEN adenovirus-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inducible Expression of WT p27kip1 and Phosphorylation Site Mutants Are Stabilized after Inhibition of the PI 3-Kinase Pathway—Even though the phosphorylation state of p27kip1 did not change following PI 3-kinase inhibition, we reasoned that the regulation of Thr-187 phosphorylation could still be controlling p27kip1 stability but that its phosphorylation would cause immediate degradation and therefore would not be detected. We therefore generated U87-MG cell lines that expressed inducible forms of WT Myc-tagged p27kip1 and phosphorylation site mutant derivatives. As depicted in Fig. 3A, left panel, increasing doses of PonA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in WT p27kip1 levels. The inhibition of PI 3-kinase caused increased levels of these exogenously expressed proteins, consistent with their stabilization following the inhibition of this pathway (Fig. 3A, right panel). The p27kip1 proteins were functional, as judged by their ability to inhibit Cdk2 kinase activity (Fig. 3A, bottom left panel), and caused a cell cycle arrest in G1 (Fig. 3B). The expression of exogenous p27kip1 also increased the protein levels of endogenous p27kip1, consistent with the notion that p27kip1 is an inhibitor of Cyclin-Cdk2 complexes, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of endogenous p27kip1 on its regulatory phosphorylation site Thr-187. However, the mutation of the Cdk2 phosphorylation site (T187A) in p27kip1 did not prevent an increased stabilization of p27kip1 resulting from PI 3-kinase inhibition (Fig. 3C). The mutation of S10A, another phosphorylation site implicated in p27kip1 stabilization (12Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatekeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6672-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), also did not prevent increased levels of p27kip1 following PI 3-kinase inhibition (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, a form of p27kip1 containing mutations in both Thr-187 and Ser-10 and a third phosphorylation site implicated in p27kip1 regulation, Ser-178, was also stabilized by inhibiting PI 3-kinase to the same extent as WT p27kip1 (Fig. 3C). Slight differences in the induction of the endogenous p27kip1 levels after expression of the various exogenous p27kip1 mutants were not observed to be consistent and varied among several clones. To confirm that the increased levels of exogenous p27kip1 following PI 3-kinase inhibition were caused by protein stabilization, we performed pulse-chase analysis. Fig. 4A demonstrates that exogenous p27kip1 had a half-life of approximately 1–2 h under these conditions, which increased to more than 7 h in cells subjected to the inhibition of PI 3-kinase, similar to the data shown in Fig. 1 for endogenous p27kip1.Fig. 3Increased p27kip1 in response to LY294002 is independent of phosphorylation on Thr-187, Ser-10, and Ser-178. A, Me2SO (DMSO)- and LY294002-treated U87-MG cells expressing Myc-tagged wild type p27kip1 were subjected to increasing concentrations of PonA, and endogenous and exogenous p27kip1 was detected by Western blotting using the p27kip1 antibody. The middle panel shows Cdk2 activity against histone H1 after immunoprecipitation from the same lysates. Western blotting for β-actin served as a loading control. B, vector or inducible WT p27kip1-expressing U87-MG cells were treated with 20 μm LY294002 or 10 μm PonA. After an incubation of 12 h, 70 ng/ml nocodazole (Noc) was added, and cells were harvested for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis 18 h later. The percentage of cells with a 2n DNA content is indicted. C, cells expressing inducible phosphorylation site mutants of p27kip1 were treated with either Me2SO or LY294002, and after 6 h, the cells subjected to increasing concentrations of PonA. p27kip1 and β-actin were analyzed by Western blotting, and Cdk2 activity was assessed by its ability to phosphorylate histone H1. As in A, Cdk2 activity levels from LY294002-treated cells were always very low to undetectable, irrespective of p27kip1 induction (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Exogenous p27kip1 is stabilized by LY294002 independently of endogenous p27kip1 levels.
