https://openalex.org/W1992945893,"Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with a variety of clinical outcomes including gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer disease. The reasons for this variation are not clear, but the gastric physiological response is influenced by the severity and anatomical distribution of gastritis induced by H. pylori. Thus, individuals with gastritis predominantly localized to the antrum retain normal (or even high) acid secretion, whereas individuals with extensive corpus gastritis develop hypochlorhydria and gastric atrophy, which are presumptive precursors of gastric cancer. Here we report that interleukin-1 gene cluster polymorphisms suspected of enhancing production of interleukin-1-beta are associated with an increased risk of both hypochlorhydria induced by H. pylori and gastric cancer. Two of these polymorphism are in near-complete linkage disequilibrium and one is a TATA-box polymorphism that markedly affects DNA-protein interactions in vitro. The association with disease may be explained by the biological properties of interleukin-1-beta, which is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine and a powerful inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. Host genetic factors that affect interleukin-1-beta may determine why some individuals infected with H. pylori develop gastric cancer while others do not."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying α-synuclein aggregation into filamentous inclusions remain unknown. Since oxidative and nitrative stresses are potential pathogenic mediators of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases, we asked if oxidative and/or nitrative events alter α-synuclein and induce it to aggregate. Here we show that exposure of human recombinant α-synuclein to nitrating agents (peroxynitrite/CO2 or myeloperoxidase/H2O2/nitrite) induces formation of nitrated α-synuclein oligomers that are highly stabilized due to covalent cross-linking via the oxidation of tyrosine to formo,o′-dityrosine. We also demonstrate that oxidation and nitration of pre-assembled α-synuclein filaments stabilize these filaments to withstand denaturing conditions and enhance formation of SDS-insoluble, heat-stable high molecular mass aggregates. Thus, these data suggest that oxidative and nitrative stresses are involved in mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies and glial cell inclusions in PD and multiple system atrophy, respectively, as well as α-synuclein pathologies in other synucleinopathies.

However, the precise molecular alterations of wild-type α-synuclein that lead to the formation of aggregates in these diseases are unknown.Oxidative stress has been implicated in pathogenic mechanisms of PD and many other neurodegenerative diseases (25.Przedborski S.

Moreover, α-synuclein inclusions in brains from patients with PD (28.Good P.F. Hsu A. Werner P. Perl D.P. Olanow O.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), dementia with LBs, and multiple system atrophy are strongly labeled by antibodies specific to 3-nitrotyrosine as well as by novel antibodies that specifically detect nitrated synuclein. 2J. E. Duda, B. I. Giasson, Q. Chen, J. M. Souza, H. Ischiropoulous, V. M.-Y. Lee, and J. Q. Trojanowski, manuscript in preparation. 2J. E. Duda, B. I. Giasson, Q. Chen, J. M. Souza, H. Ischiropoulous, V. M.-Y. Lee, and J. Q. Trojanowski, manuscript in preparation. Thus, available evidence supports the hypothesis that α-synuclein is a target for nitration. The generation of 3-nitrotyrosine is a post-translational modification of proteins that results from the reaction of nitrating agents with proteins. Nitrating agents are generated by the interaction of oxygen and nitric oxide-derived reactive species (26.Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 217: C1424-C1437Crossref Google Scholar, 27.Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). As such, the detection and quantification of nitrotyrosine residues in proteins provide indirect evidence for the formation of nitrating agents and their possible involvement in pathological processes (27.Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar).α-Synuclein is a small protein of 140 amino acids with four tyrosine residues (33.Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 23: 27-32Crossref Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 34.Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) that is relatively unstructured in aqueous solution (35.Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. Georges J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 36.Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the tyrosine residues may be readily exposed and accessible for modification by nitration agents. Indeed, the data reported here show that exposure of recombinant α-synuclein to nitrating agents leads to tyrosine nitration as well as tyrosine oxidation to form o,o′-dityrosine, resulting in cross-linking of α-synuclein to form stable high molecular mass α-synuclein aggregates, whereas preformed α-synuclein filaments are stabilized by nitrating agents in vitro.DISCUSSIONRecent studies have shown that the majority of LBs contain 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity (28.Good P.F. Hsu A. Werner P. Perl D.P. Olanow O.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and that novel monoclonal antibodies to nitrated synuclein bind specifically to LBs and GCIs in a variety of synucleinopathies.2 Thus, insights into the oxidation/nitration of α-synuclein are critical for understanding the pathogenesis of these inclusions in neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including PD and multiple system atrophy. Significantly, our data demonstrate that α-synuclein is a substrate for tyrosine nitration and that it is readily cross-linked through covalent o,o′-dityrosine bonds. Indeed, the ability of α-synuclein to form oligomers in the presence of oxidizing/nitrating agents provides a plausible explanation for the formation of SDS-resistant forms of wild-type as well as truncated and higher molecular mass species of α-synuclein in purified LBs (4.Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.-H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). These and other observations support the hypothesis that nitration or other modifications associated with oxidative and nitrative stress-mediated post-translation modifications are involved in altering the biophysical properties of α-synuclein and promoting the aggregation of this otherwise soluble protein.The high efficiency of α-synuclein nitration and oxidation is likely due to the unstructured conformation of the protein in aqueous solution since all tyrosine residues could be exposed to the solvent phase, thereby increasing the probability for reaction with nitrating agents. The efficiency of α-synuclein nitration is in sharp contrast with the nitration of other proteins with a similar size and number of tyrosine residues as α-synuclein, but with a distinctly different structural organization that appears to restrict nitration to only one or two tyrosine residues after exposure to the same nitrating agent and conditions used here. For example, under the same conditions, RNase, which contains six tyrosine residues and has a molecular mass of 14 kDa, was nitrated mostly at tyrosine 115 (37.Souza J.M. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. Raman C.S. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Other critical factors that may promote nitration of α-synuclein include the local environment of the tyrosine residues, the absence of steric hindrance and reactive thiols, and the presence of negatively charges in the vicinity of the tyrosine residue(s) (37.Souza J.M. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. Raman C.S. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Specifically, in human α-synuclein, there are no cysteine residues, and several glutamate residues are near tyrosines 125, 133, and 136 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of α-synuclein.Exposure to peroxynitrite also led to the formation of SDS- and heat-stable α-synuclein aggregates that resulted from the formation of o,o′-dityrosine cross-linking. Although nitration of tyrosine residues by peroxynitrite has been reported for several proteins, formation of o,o′-dityrosine has been detected only in a few proteins such as fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, human manganese-superoxide dismutase, and possibly epidermal growth factor receptor (38.Ischiropoulos H.

Exposure to myeloperoxidase/H2O2/NO2−, which is known to oxidize the tyrosine residues and is expected to cause the formation of o,o′-dityrosine (41.Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S.

The formation of a tyrosyl radical and its reaction with a tyrosyl radical on another α-synuclein molecule are the basis foro,o′-dityrosine covalent cross-linking (41.Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F.

Similarly, the reported formation of α-synuclein dimers after exposure of the protein to oxidants generated by H2O2 and ferric iron or H2O2 plus cytochrome c also may be due to the formation of o,o′-dityrosine (44.Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sisk A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 45.Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Hsu L.J. Takenouchi T. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Analysis of covalently oligomerized α-synuclein after exposure to nitrative conditions revealed that one out of four tyrosine residues was oxidized to dityrosine, whereas at least two of the three remaining residues were nitrated in the oligomerized α-synuclein, resulting in protein molecules that were nitrated and covalently linked via dityrosine. It is unlikely that the same tyrosine residue is nitrated and covalently linked because the addition of a nitro group in theortho-position of tyrosine renders the aromatic ring less reactive toward further modifications. Moreover, the formation of dimerized tyrosine will impede nitration at these tyrosine residues since dimerization also deactivates the aromatic ring. Formation ofo,o′-dityrosine most likely involves or at the very least requires tyrosine residues located in the C terminus since exposure of α-synuclein fragment-(2–97) (generated by digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N) to nitrating agents results in nitration of tyrosine 39, but not in the formation of aggregates (data not shown). Although β-synuclein contains similarly placed tyrosine residues in the C terminus and it is nitrated after exposure to the nitrative conditions used here for α-synuclein, it is much less prone to form stably cross-linked oligomers. These results demonstrate that the propensity of α-synuclein to formo,o′-dityrosine cross-links is a property of this molecule, which may explain, at least in part, its aggregation in pathological lesions, whereas other synuclein proteins such as β-synuclein are not found in LBs and GCIs (3.Arima K.

However, a number of recent studies and the work presented here suggest a mechanistic model based on the specific and unusual properties of α-synuclein (Fig.7). Spectroscopic techniques including CD spectra revealed that wild-type α-synuclein contains as little as 3% α-helices and 23% β-sheets, whereas the rest of the protein assumes a random conformation (35.Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. Georges J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 36.Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). However, upon binding to small unilamellar vesicles of various compositions of acidic phospholipids, the protein folds largely in an α-helical conformation (63–71% of the protein) (35.Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. Georges J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Moreover, recombinant α-synuclein can readily assemble into filaments, and this process is accompanied by a change to an anti-parallel β-sheet confirmation (16.El-Agnaf O.M.A. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 18.Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that α-synuclein exists in multiple conformations in a living cell and that the formation of β-sheet conformation may be restricted by a chaperone or other factors. However, under certain pathological conditions, a threshold concentration of α-synuclein with a β-sheet conformation may be attained, which enables α-synuclein to assemble into short filamentous polymers; and these short oligomers may “seed” the assembly of longer polymers that form α-synuclein filaments. The formation of these short oligomers may be the rate-limiting step in the polymerization of elongated fibrils since assembly in vitro proceeds through a “seeding” mechanism (17.Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 46.Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.-C. Citron N. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that α-synuclein can undergo oxidative cross-linking via the formation ofo,o′-dityrosine and that this modification may play a role in the fibrillogenesis by stabilizing short oligomers and/or elongated α-synuclein polymers (Fig. 7). Cross-linking may also contribute to the bundling of fibrils into intracellular proteinaceous aggregates and cause the covalent linking of normal, non-amyloidogenic α-synuclein to these aggregates. Thus, the oxidative cross-linking of α-synuclein may act at different steps in the formation of large intracellular lesions. This model is consistent with the elevated oxidative environment of dopaminergic neurons, which are the neurons that are primarily affected in PD (25.Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1998; 11: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with the presence of oxidized metabolites in dementia with LBs (47.Lyras L. Perry R.H. Perry E.K. Ince P.G. Jenner A. Jenner P. Halliwel B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71 (312): 320Google Scholar)2as well as the neurons that are burdened with iron deposition in Hallervoden-Spatz disease (48.Dooling E.C. Schoene W.C. Richandoson E.P. Arch. Neurol. 1974; 30: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the other hand, oxidative stress has not been demonstrated to occur in multiple system atrophy; however, the observation that GCIs contain nitrated proteins2 suggests that oxidative stress and α-synuclein aggregation are common pathological features in these neurodegenerative diseases and synucleinopathies. Taken together, our data presented here and data from several previous reports provide increasing evidence that oxidative/nitrative stress plays a mechanistic role in the onset/progression of PD and related synucleinopathies. Accumulations of proteinaceous fibrils are a common neuropathological feature of several different sporadic and hereditary neurodegenerative diseases (1.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr.

Here, we show that exogenously added Wnt-3a protein, an intercellular signaling molecule, up-regulates the expression of endogenous melanocyte-specific Mitf (Mitf-M) mRNA in cultured melanocytes. The melanocyte-specific promoter of the humanMITF gene (MITF-M promoter) contains a functional LEF-1-binding site, which is bound in vitro by LEF-1 and confers the preferential expression on a reporter gene in melanocytes and melanoma cells, as judged by the transient transfection assays. Moreover, the LEF-1-binding site is required for the transactivation of a reporter gene by LEF-1, β-catenin, or their combination. Exogenously added Wnt-3a protein also transactivates theMITF-M promoter via the LEF-1-binding site; this activation was abolished when a dominant-negative form of LEF-1 was coexpressed. These results suggest that Wnt-3a signaling recruits β-catenin and LEF-1 to the LEF-1-binding site of the MITF-M promoter.

Mitf and its human counterpart, MITF, contain a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper structure, which is required for DNA binding and dimer formation. MITF consists of at least five isoforms with distinct amino termini, called MITF-A, -B, -C, -H, and -M (4.Amae S. Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Sato S. Yajima I. Yamamoto H. Udono T. Durlu Y.K. Tamai M.

The amino termini of these isoforms are encoded by a separate first exons, and each exon 1 is under the control of a unique promoter (6.Udono T., Yasumoto, K., Takeda K., Amae S., Watanabe K., Saito H., Fuse N., Tachibana M., Takahashi K., Tamai M., and Shibahara S. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in pressGoogle Scholar). Among these isoforms, MITF-M/Mitf-M is exclusively expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells of neural crest origin (4.Amae S. Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Sato S. Yajima I. Yamamoto H. Udono T. Durlu Y.K. Tamai M. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In fact, the 5′-flanking region of the first exon, coding for the amino terminus of MITF-M, shows the melanocyte-specific promoter function (8.Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S.

The mutations in theMITF/Mitf gene were found in patients with auditory pigmentary syndromes such as Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (16.Tassabehji M. Newton V.E. Read A.P. Nat.

These affected individuals mainly exhibit hypopigmentation and hearing impairment, caused by the lack of pigment cells in the skin and inner ear. Moreover, the MITF-M promoter is up-regulated by PAX3 (19.Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), a transcription factor with a paired-homeodomain, in which the gene is responsible for Waardenburg syndrome types 1 and 3 (17.Tassabehji M. Newton V.E. Liu X.Z. Brady A. Donnai D. Krajewska-Walasek M. Murday V. Norman A. Obersztyn E. Reardon W. et al.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2131-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, the essential requirement of Mitf-M in melanocyte development was verified by the molecular lesion of the black-eyed whiteMitf mi-bw mice (20.Yajima I. Sato S. Kimura T. Yasumoto K. Shibahara S. Goding C.R. Yamamoto H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which are characterized by a completely white coat color, deafness, and normally pigmented RPE (21.Motohashi H. Hozawa K. Oshima T. Takeuchi T. Takasaka T. Hear. Res. 1994; 80: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Mitf mi-bw mice, the insertion of an L1 retrotransposable element in intron 3 lead to complete repression of Mitf-M mRNA expression and to a reduction of Mitf-A and Mitf-H mRNAs expression (20.Yajima I. Sato S. Kimura T. Yasumoto K. Shibahara S. Goding C.R. Yamamoto H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that MITF-M/Mitf-M is a key regulator of the melanocyte development but is dispensable for RPE development. However, the mechanism of differentiation of neural crest cells toward melanocytes is not well understood. Wnt proteins, which are secreted cysteine-rich glycoproteins, have been established as developmentally important signaling molecules (22.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Particularly, Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a are required for the expansion of neural crest precursors (23.Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X.

Nature. 1997; 389: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and for determining the fate of neural crest cells during early development (25.Dorsky R.I. Moon R.T. Raible D.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In fact, targeted disruption of the Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a genes in the mouse causes deficiency of neural crest derivatives, including melanocytes (24.Ikeya M. Lee S.M. Johnson J.E. McMahon A.P. Takada S. Nature. 1997; 389: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutant mice lacking Wnt-1 orWnt-3a show no noticeable deficiency of neural crest derivatives from the dorsal neural tube (26.Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 27.Takada S. Stark K.L. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 174-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). These results suggest a redundant role for Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a signaling in the differentiation of neural crest precursors. Wnt-3a is expressed in pluripotent ectoderm cells of the primitive streak during gastrulation (27.Takada S. Stark K.L. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 174-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The onset of Wnt-3a expression is detected at embryonic day 7.5 (27.Takada S. Stark K.L. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 174-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), which precedes the onset of Mitf expression in neural crest cells (9.5–10.5 days) (28.Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Chen C.C. Opdecamp K. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Mech. Dev. 1998; 70: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Wnt-3a is a good candidate for regulating the differentiation of neural crest cells toward melanocytes. The signals evoked by Wnt proteins lead to intracellular accumulation of β-catenin, a key downstream component of the Wnt signaling pathway (22.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 29.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). β-Catenin then activates the target genes through interaction with a member of the LEF-1/TCF transcription factors, containing a high mobility group domain. Thus, LEF-1/TCF transcription factors mediate a nuclear response to Wnt signals. Here, we show that exogenously added Wnt-3a protein induces endogenous Mitf-M mRNA in cultured melanocytes. In addition, we identify the functional LEF-1-binding site in the MITF-M promoter and provide evidence that Wnt-3a signaling recruits β-catenin and LEF-1 to the MITF-M promoter, which leads to increased transcription from the MITF-M promoter. Therefore, the present study shows a direct link between Wnt signaling and Mitf-M/MITF-M expression. The mouse fibroblast L cells, constitutively expressing mouse Wnt-3a cDNA, were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 in a 94-mm dish containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (30.Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). After 3 days of culture, cells were refed with fresh medium and incubated for 1 more day, and the cultured media were collected as conditioned media, referred to as Wnt3a/L-CM. Wnt3a/L-CM was estimated to contain about 400 ng/ml of Wnt-3a protein (30.Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Conditioned media, neo/L-CM, were also prepared from the cultures of control L cells that were stably transfected with a vector plasmid as described previously (30.Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R.

Melan-a cells, maintained in a 3.5-cm dish containing 1 ml of the medium, were treated with Wnt3a/L-CM or neo/L-CM for 24 h. The final concentration of Wnt-3a was about 40 ng/ml. Total RNA was prepared from the treated Melan-a cells of two dishes and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (15.Tachibana M. Takeda K. Nobukuni Y. Urabe K. Long J.E.

A wild-type reporter plasmid, pGL3-MITF/M, was constructed as follows. TheBamHI/XhoI fragment containing the 2.2-kilobase pair human MITF-M pomoter was isolated from pHMIL1 (8.Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and ligated to pGL3-Basic (Promega), linearized by the digestion withSmaI and XhoI. Prior to ligation, theBamHI site had been converted to a blunt end by a filling-in reaction. A mutant construct, pGL3-MITF/M(m195), was constructed from pGL3-MITF/M by the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutant primer used was the synthetic oligonucleotide (positions −215 to −174) carrying the base changes at positions −196 and −195. Thus, pGL3-MITF/M(m195) carries the GT nucleotides instead of the original TG nucleotides at position −195 (8.Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Human LEF-1 cDNA, a gift from K. A. Jones (34.Waterman M.L. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), was subcloned in the pRc/CMV eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen), yielding pRc/CMV-LEF-1. A dominant-negative form of LEF-1, DNLEF-1, lacks the 26 amino acid residues near the amino terminus (amino acid positions 2–27); its cDNA was made by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in pRc/CMV, generating pRc/CMV-DNLEF-1. β-Catenin cDNA was synthesized by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in pRc/CMV, yielding pRc/CMV-β-catenin. TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH, gifts from M. van de Wetering and H. Clevers (35.van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M.

LEF-1 protein was produced from pRc/CMV-LEF-1 by in vitrotranscription/translation reaction using a TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system kit (Promega). The production of LEF-1 protein was assessed by electrophoresis of the translation products labeled with [35S]methionine. The wild-type oligonucleotide of theMITF promoter sequence from nucleotides −215 to −174 (5′-CTGACAGTGAGTTTGACTTTGATAGCTCGTCACTTAAAAAGG-3′/3′-GACTGTCACTCAAACTGAAACTATCGAGCAGTGAATTTTTCC-5′) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as a probe. EMSA was carried out as described previously (18.Nobukuni Y. Watanabe A. Takeda K. Skarka H. Tachibana M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 76-83PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HMV-II melanoma cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were seeded at 60–80% confluency in a 3.5-cm dish 18–24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (18.Nobukuni Y. Watanabe A. Takeda K. Skarka H. Tachibana M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 76-83PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of DNA used for transfection was 6 μg, consisting of 0.5 μg of each test plasmid and pCH110, β-galactosidase expression vector under control of SV40 early promoter as an internal control, and pBluescript SK(+) as a filler. Transfection was also carried out in HMV-II melanoma cells as described above. After 24 h, transfected cells were harvested, and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured as described previously (13.Yasumoto K. Mahalingam H. Suzuki H. Yoshizawa M. Yokoyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. Melan-a cells were transfected by FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of DNA used for transfection was 1.5 μg, consisting of 0.5 μg of each test plasmid and pCH110, with pBluescript SK(+) as a filler. After 4 h, Wnt3a/L-CM or neo/L-CM was added to each culture medium of transfected Melan-a cells. Cells were then incubated for 24 h and harvested. To assess the hypothesis that Wnt signaling regulates the expression of MITF-M/Mitf-M, we analyzed the effect of Wnt-3a protein on Mitf-M mRNA expression in cultured melanocytes. Accordingly, Melan-a immortalized melanocytes were treated with Wnt3a/L-CM containing Wnt-3a protein or neo/L-CM for 24 h (Fig.1). The treatment with Wnt3a/L-CM increased Mitf-M mRNA by 24 h (lane 1), whereas the treatment with neo/L-CM did not (lane 2). Thus, Wnt-3a induces the expression of endogenous Mitf-M mRNA, supporting the notion that Wnt signaling is involved in melanocyte differentiation. Wnt signaling activates the target genes through the interaction of β-catenin and a member of the LEF-1/TCF transcription factors. The consensus DNA sequence recognized by LEF-1/TCF transcription factors is CTTTGA/TA/T (29.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and the MITF-M promoter contains a putative LEF-1/TCF-binding site, CTTTGAT (positions −199 to −193), which agrees with the consensus sequence (Fig.2 A). The same sequence motif is conserved at a similar position in the mouse Mitf-Mpromoter. 2K. Takeda, K. Yasumoto, K. Watanabe, T. Udono, H. Saito, K. Takahashi, and S. Shibahara, unpublished observations. To assess the function of the putative LEF-1/TCF-binding site in theMITF-M promoter, we compared the expression levels of pGL3-MITF/M in HMV-II human melanoma cells with those of pGL3-MITF/M(m195), containing the altered LEF-1/TCF site, CTTGTAT (Fig.2 B). These base changes were expected to reduce theMITF-M promoter activity, because the Wnt signaling pathway is activated in many melanoma cells due to β-catenin mutation (36.Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I. Porfiri E. Polakis P. Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). In fact, the expression level of pGL3-MITF/M(m195) was lower than that of pGL3-MITF/M, whereas the expression levels of these two constructs were similarly lower in HeLa cervical cancer cells. These results suggest that the CTTTGAT motif is involved in MITF-Mpromoter activity in melanoma cells. The significant luciferase activity detected with pGL3-MITF/M(m195) in melanoma cells may be due to the presence of other melanocyte-specific enhancers present in theMITF-M promoter. We then performed cotransfection assays in HeLa cervical cancer cells to test the possibility that the LEF-1/TCF family is involved in regulation of the MITF-M promoter (Fig. 2 C). Expression of either LEF-1 or β-catenin significantly increased the luciferase activity under the control of the MITF-Mpromoter. The coexpression of β-catenin and LEF-1 synergistically increased the luciferase activity, which was higher than the degree of activation caused by LEF-1 or β-catenin. In contrast, the introduction of mutation at the putative LEF-1 site completely inhibited the increase in luciferase activity caused by LEF-1, β-catenin, or their combination (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that the CTTTGAT motif of the MITF-M promoter represents a functional LEF-1-binding site. To confirm whether LEF-1 protein binds to the CTTTGAT motif of theMITF-M promoter, we carried out EMSA. The in vitro translation of LEF-1 mRNA was confirmed by autoradiography of 35S-labeled LEF-1 protein (data not shown). The synthetic LEF-1-binding site was specifically bound by thein vitro translated LEF-1 protein (Fig.3, lane 1). The formation of this complex was inhibited by competitor oligonucleotide containing the CTTTGAT motif but not by the mutant oligonucleotide containing the CTTGTAT motif (lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, these results indicate that LEF-1 recognizes the CTTTGAT motif of theMITF-M promoter. These results are consistent in part with the recent report showing that the LEF-1/TCF-binding sites of the promoter region of the Nacre, a zebrafish homolog ofMITF, is required for pigment cell-specific expression of a reporter gene in vivo (37.Dorsky R.I. Raible D.W. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 158-162PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we assessed the effects of Wnt-3a protein on theMITF-M promoter activity in Melan-a cells (Fig.4). In this series of experiments, Melan-a immortalized melanocytes were chosen because this cell line was more sensitive to Wnt-3a treatment than HMV-II melanoma cells, as judged by transient expression assays with the test plasmid TOPFLASH, containing multiple LEF-1 responsive elements (data not shown). Such a difference in sensitivity to Wnt-3a suggests that a component(s) of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as β-catenin, may be constitutively activated in HMV-II melanoma cells. Melan-a cells were transfected with pGL3-MITF/M or pGL3-MITF/M(m195) and then treated with either Wnt3a/L-CM or neo/L-CM. Wnt3a/L-CM increased the expression of pGL3-MITF/M by about 2.5-fold. To confirm that this increase was dependent on Wnt signaling, we cotransfected the expression plasmid of a dominant-negative form of LEF-1, pRc/CMV-DNLEF-1. The dominant-negative LEF-1 lacks the amino-terminal β-catenin interaction domain and is expected to inhibit Wnt signaling. The observed activation by Wnt3a/L-CM was completely inhibited when the dominant-negative LEF-1 was coexpressed. Furthermore, the expression level of pGL3-MITF/M(m195) was lower than that of a wild-type construct, pGL3-MITF/M, and was not significantly increased by treatment with Wnt3a/L-CM. These results indicate that the LEF-1 site is necessary and sufficient for the activation of theMITF-M promoter by Wnt-3a signaling. The data all support the interpretation of a direct effect by Wnt-3a, but there is a possibility that a certain factor other than Wnt-3a in the conditioned medium from the Wnt-3a transfectants could contribute to the LEF-1-dependent activation. Further study with Wnt-3a neutralizing antibodies will be required to address this issue. The MITF-M promoter is functional exclusively in melanocyte-lineage cells (6.Udono T., Yasumoto, K., Takeda K., Amae S., Watanabe K., Saito H., Fuse N., Tachibana M., Takahashi K., Tamai M., and Shibahara S. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in pressGoogle Scholar, 8.Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and is up-regulated via the separatecis-acting elements by PAX3 (19.Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone signaling (38.Price E.R. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Weilbaecher K.N. Takemoto C.M. Landis M.W. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33042-33047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (see Fig.2 A). Here, we provide evidence that Wnt-3a signal activates the MITF-M promoter through the LEF-1-binding site. Thus, multiple signals appear to converge on the MITF-M promoter, leading to the up-regulation of MITF-M expression, a key regulator for the melanogenesis enzyme genes. The expression levels of Pax3 mRNA were reduced in the double knock-out mouse of the Wnt-1 andWnt-3a genes (24.Ikeya M. Lee S.M. Johnson J.E. McMahon A.P. Takada S. Nature. 1997; 389: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that Wnt signals may also up-regulate Mitf-M/MITF-M expression through Pax3. In summary, Wnt-3a protein induces Mitf-M mRNA expression in melanocytes and activates the MITF-M promoter by recruiting LEF-1 and β-catenin to the LEF-1-binding site. Thus,MITF-M/Mitf-M is a direct target gene of Wnt signaling in humans and mice. We thank D. Bennett for Melan-a cells, K. A. Jones for LEF-1 cDNA, and M. van de Wetering and H.

Thus, together with their wide distribution in various tissues they may contribute to background currents that set the membrane potential near the K+ equilibrium potential. 2P K+ channels are subject to modulation by a wide variety of stimuli. TREK-1 (KCNK2) and TRAAK (KCNK4) channels are mechanosensitive and are activated by arachidonic acids and other unsaturated fatty acids (14.Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The reduction in intracellular pH occurring during ischemia is expected to cause hyperpolarization and subsequent reduction of Ca2+ influx through voltage-activated Ca2+channels. Thus, TREK-1 may play a protective role during ischemia by reducing Ca2+ overload (15.Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar).2P K+ channels have been found in many different tissues and are particularly abundant in the brain (except TASK-2). Here we describe the cloning and expression of a novel mammalian 2P K+ channel, TASK-3, that is exclusively expressed in the brain. The close sequence similarity between TASK-1 and TASK-3 and the similar functional properties suggest that TASK-3 and TASK-1 may form a subfamily within the 2P K+ channels. TASK-3, like TASK-1, is sensitive to extracellular pH and shares two extracellular histidine residues with TASK-1. Using site-directed mutagenesis we identified the histidine at position 98 near the pore selectivity filter as a component of the pH sensor.DISCUSSIONTASK-3 is a new member of the family of tandem pore domain potassium channels. Sequence analysis showed that the typical structural features of previously cloned 2P K+ channels are also found in TASK-3: (i) four conserved transmembrane regions, (ii) two pore-forming regions with a GYG(H/N/Y) motif in P1 and a G[FL]GD motif in P2, and (iii) a large extracellular M1-P1 linker region. When comparing human and guinea pig sequences it is obvious that the cytosolic part of TASK-3 channels is not strongly conserved, except for the last 26 nucleotides at the C-terminal end. Although not a typical consensus PDZ-binding motif, this region has considerable sequence homology to the TASK-1 PDZ-binding motif. Because gpTASK-3 is expressed almost exclusively in the brain, it may be speculated that this domain is important for subcellular localization in neuronal cells. Whereas some 2P K+ channels may form covalently linked dimeric channels by connecting the M1-P1 linkers through an extracellular disulfide bridge (21.Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), no conserved cysteine residue is found in the TASK-3 M1-P1 linker. Instead, an N-glycosylation site is found at the homologous position in TASK-3. It is not yet clear whether the glycosylation of TASK-3 is important for dimerization.The close sequence similarity of TASK-3 and TASK-1 indicates that these two channels are the first mammalian members of a distinct subfamily of the 2P K+ channels. The mammalian 2P K+channels cloned so far showed no phylogenetic clustering into subfamilies. Although some 2P K+ channels have similar physiological properties, for example TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 or TASK-1 and TASK-2, the homology between these channels is not higher than the homology among other members of the 2P K+ channel family. The sequences of the nematode 2P K+ channels, however, have been shown to cluster into subfamilies (25.Wang Z.W. Kunkel M.W. Wei A. Butler A. Salkoff L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 286-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis (25.Wang Z.W. Kunkel M.W. Wei A. Butler A. Salkoff L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 286-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) shows that the nematode channels n2P38 and n2P20 also belong to the TASK-1/TASK-3 subfamily. Most of the nematode genes have introns within the codon for the first glycine residue of the P1 signature sequence GYG (21.Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). TASK-3 also possesses an intron at this position, indicating a common ancestral gene structure.The current voltage relation of elementary TASK-3 channels was nonlinear (concave downward) in the range −120 to 0 mV, both with and without external cations, indicating that the single channel slope conductance increased with hyperpolarization in the presence of symmetrical 150 mm K+. In this respect, TASK-3 differs from the other 2P K+ channels such as TASK-1/TBAK (26.Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M. Taylor D.M. Chavez R.A. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and also from most two-transmembrane-domain inward rectifier channels. The pronounced increase in open probability of TASK-3 with depolarization is also a novel finding. P o of other 2P K+channels was reported to be independent of membrane potential (26.Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M. Taylor D.M. Chavez R.A. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 868-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y.

The single channel conductance of TASK-3 was much larger in the absence of external divalent cations (from 27 to 100 pS at −100 mV). Such a dependence of single channel conductance on divalent cations has not been previously found in 2P K+ channels.The whole-cell currents measured in Xenopus oocytes injected with TASK-3 cRNA decreased with extracellular acidification, in line with the unique functional properties of TASK-1 and TASK-2. However, whereas TASK-1 and TASK-2 fully open or close within a range of 0.5 pH units (3.Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 6.Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) around the physiological pH (7.3–7.8), TASK-3 is most sensitive to extracellular H+ changes between pH 5 and 7. When His-98 of TASK-3 was changed to asparagine, the pKdecreased from 5.9 to 3. This agrees reasonably well with the nominal pK values for the side chains of the free amino acids (6 and 3.9, respectively), indicating that the pH sensitivity of TASK-3 is mainly determined by His-98, the histidine at position +1 adjacent to the selectivity filter of the first P region. Unlike in TASK-1 and other potassium channels (30.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the chemical environment in TASK-3 does not create a pK shift at this residue. The equivalent histidine residue is also present in TASK-1.Histidine side chains have been implicated in the pH sensitivity of other K+ channels (31.Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32.Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P. Bienkowski M.J. Lee K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1173-C1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, apart from the protonation of the side chain, the mechanism underlying the pH sensitivity also depends on the electrostatic interactions defined by the tertiary structure of the individual channel subunits. This may differ considerably between various 2P K+ channels, which complicates the analysis. For example, TWIK-1, the first identified member of 2P K+ channel family, also harbors a histidine residue at the equivalent position in the first pore region (Fig.8), but no pH dependence has been reported for this channel. Conversely, the corresponding position in TASK-2 is occupied by an asparagine (Fig. 8), indicating that the pH sensitivity of this subunit may be attributable to a different pH sensor site.TASK-3 could play an important role under pathophysiological conditions. TASK-3 channels are most sensitive to pH changes in the range 7 to 6. Extracellular pH changes in this range are observed during cerebral ischemia and may depolarize the cells by inhibition of TASK-3 channels. Such a depolarization would be expected to cause an increase in the firing rate of specific neurons expressing TASK-3. This is in marked contrast to the function of other 2P K+channels such as TREK-1, which are activated by intracellular acidification and may have a neuroprotective function (14.Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The highly cell-specific pattern of expression of 2P K+ channels in the brain (5.Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M.

Mammalian tandem pore domain potassium channels (2P K+channels) contain four transmembrane regions (M1 to M4) and two pore-forming domains (P1 and P2) in each subunit (1.Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). It is believed that two subunits dimerize to form a K+-selective pore. So far, eight members of this gene family, denoted KCNK1–8, have been identified in mammals (1.Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

Approximately 60 structurally related subunits of this family have been identified in the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (8.Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13256-13261Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (11.Czempinski K. Zimmermann S. Ehrhardt T. Müller-Röber B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2565-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A slightly different 2P K+ channel motif with 6 + 2 transmembrane regions has been described in the TOK1/DUK1 subunit of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (12.Ketchum K.A. Joiner W.J. Sellers A.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Those 2P K+ channels that functionally express in heterologous systems (but see 2, 13) generate instantaneous, noninactivating, and weakly rectifying K+-selective currents with no apparent voltage sensitivity of activation. Thus, together with their wide distribution in various tissues they may contribute to background currents that set the membrane potential near the K+ equilibrium potential. 2P K+ channels are subject to modulation by a wide variety of stimuli. TREK-1 (KCNK2) and TRAAK (KCNK4) channels are mechanosensitive and are activated by arachidonic acids and other unsaturated fatty acids (14.Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). TREK-1 is, in addition, inhibited by protein kinase A and C and activated by intracellular acidification (14.Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The reduction in intracellular pH occurring during ischemia is expected to cause hyperpolarization and subsequent reduction of Ca2+ influx through voltage-activated Ca2+channels. Thus, TREK-1 may play a protective role during ischemia by reducing Ca2+ overload (15.Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). TWIK-1 (KCNK1) and TWIK-2 (KCNK6) form weakly, inwardly rectifying potassium channels that are inhibited by protein kinase C and internal acidification (1.Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F.

It should be noted, however, that several reports showed that expression of TWIK-1 or TWIK-2 subunits alone did not produce functional channels (13.Poutney D.J. Gulkarov I. Vega-Saenz de Miera E.

Med. 1998; 76: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although not strongly related at the amino acid level, both TASK-11 (KCNK3) and TASK-2 (KCNK5) are sensitive to changes in extracellular pH (3.Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 6.Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TASK-1 and TREK-1 are potential targets for volatile anesthetics (17.Kindler C.H. Yost C.S. Gray A.T. Anesthesiology. 1999; 90: 1092-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18.Patel A.J. Honore E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). 2P K+ channels have been found in many different tissues and are particularly abundant in the brain (except TASK-2). Here we describe the cloning and expression of a novel mammalian 2P K+ channel, TASK-3, that is exclusively expressed in the brain. The close sequence similarity between TASK-1 and TASK-3 and the similar functional properties suggest that TASK-3 and TASK-1 may form a subfamily within the 2P K+ channels. TASK-3, like TASK-1, is sensitive to extracellular pH and shares two extracellular histidine residues with TASK-1. Using site-directed mutagenesis we identified the histidine at position 98 near the pore selectivity filter as a component of the pH sensor. DISCUSSIONTASK-3 is a new member of the family of tandem pore domain potassium channels. Sequence analysis showed that the typical structural features of previously cloned 2P K+ channels are also found in TASK-3: (i) four conserved transmembrane regions, (ii) two pore-forming regions with a GYG(H/N/Y) motif in P1 and a G[FL]GD motif in P2, and (iii) a large extracellular M1-P1 linker region. When comparing human and guinea pig sequences it is obvious that the cytosolic part of TASK-3 channels is not strongly conserved, except for the last 26 nucleotides at the C-terminal end. Although not a typical consensus PDZ-binding motif, this region has considerable sequence homology to the TASK-1 PDZ-binding motif. Because gpTASK-3 is expressed almost exclusively in the brain, it may be speculated that this domain is important for subcellular localization in neuronal cells. Whereas some 2P K+ channels may form covalently linked dimeric channels by connecting the M1-P1 linkers through an extracellular disulfide bridge (21.Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), no conserved cysteine residue is found in the TASK-3 M1-P1 linker. Instead, an N-glycosylation site is found at the homologous position in TASK-3. It is not yet clear whether the glycosylation of TASK-3 is important for dimerization.The close sequence similarity of TASK-3 and TASK-1 indicates that these two channels are the first mammalian members of a distinct subfamily of the 2P K+ channels. The mammalian 2P K+channels cloned so far showed no phylogenetic clustering into subfamilies. Although some 2P K+ channels have similar physiological properties, for example TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 or TASK-1 and TASK-2, the homology between these channels is not higher than the homology among other members of the 2P K+ channel family. The sequences of the nematode 2P K+ channels, however, have been shown to cluster into subfamilies (25.Wang Z.W. Kunkel M.W. Wei A. Butler A. Salkoff L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 286-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis (25.Wang Z.W. Kunkel M.W. Wei A. Butler A. Salkoff L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 286-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) shows that the nematode channels n2P38 and n2P20 also belong to the TASK-1/TASK-3 subfamily. Most of the nematode genes have introns within the codon for the first glycine residue of the P1 signature sequence GYG (21.Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). TASK-3 also possesses an intron at this position, indicating a common ancestral gene structure.The current voltage relation of elementary TASK-3 channels was nonlinear (concave downward) in the range −120 to 0 mV, both with and without external cations, indicating that the single channel slope conductance increased with hyperpolarization in the presence of symmetrical 150 mm K+. In this respect, TASK-3 differs from the other 2P K+ channels such as TASK-1/TBAK (26.Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M. Taylor D.M. Chavez R.A. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and also from most two-transmembrane-domain inward rectifier channels. The pronounced increase in open probability of TASK-3 with depolarization is also a novel finding. P o of other 2P K+channels was reported to be independent of membrane potential (26.Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M. Taylor D.M. Chavez R.A. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 868-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The single channel conductance of TASK-3 was much larger in the absence of external divalent cations (from 27 to 100 pS at −100 mV). Such a dependence of single channel conductance on divalent cations has not been previously found in 2P K+ channels.The whole-cell currents measured in Xenopus oocytes injected with TASK-3 cRNA decreased with extracellular acidification, in line with the unique functional properties of TASK-1 and TASK-2.

The equivalent histidine residue is also present in TASK-1.Histidine side chains have been implicated in the pH sensitivity of other K+ channels (31.Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32.Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P. Bienkowski M.J. Lee K.S. Am. J.

However, apart from the protonation of the side chain, the mechanism underlying the pH sensitivity also depends on the electrostatic interactions defined by the tertiary structure of the individual channel subunits. This may differ considerably between various 2P K+ channels, which complicates the analysis. For example, TWIK-1, the first identified member of 2P K+ channel family, also harbors a histidine residue at the equivalent position in the first pore region (Fig.8), but no pH dependence has been reported for this channel. Conversely, the corresponding position in TASK-2 is occupied by an asparagine (Fig. 8), indicating that the pH sensitivity of this subunit may be attributable to a different pH sensor site.TASK-3 could play an important role under pathophysiological conditions. TASK-3 channels are most sensitive to pH changes in the range 7 to 6. Extracellular pH changes in this range are observed during cerebral ischemia and may depolarize the cells by inhibition of TASK-3 channels. Such a depolarization would be expected to cause an increase in the firing rate of specific neurons expressing TASK-3. This is in marked contrast to the function of other 2P K+channels such as TREK-1, which are activated by intracellular acidification and may have a neuroprotective function (14.Maingret F. Patel A.J.

The equivalent histidine residue is also present in TASK-1. Histidine side chains have been implicated in the pH sensitivity of other K+ channels (31.Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32.Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P. Bienkowski M.J. Lee K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1173-C1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, apart from the protonation of the side chain, the mechanism underlying the pH sensitivity also depends on the electrostatic interactions defined by the tertiary structure of the individual channel subunits. This may differ considerably between various 2P K+ channels, which complicates the analysis. For example, TWIK-1, the first identified member of 2P K+ channel family, also harbors a histidine residue at the equivalent position in the first pore region (Fig.8), but no pH dependence has been reported for this channel. Conversely, the corresponding position in TASK-2 is occupied by an asparagine (Fig. 8), indicating that the pH sensitivity of this subunit may be attributable to a different pH sensor site. TASK-3 could play an important role under pathophysiological conditions. TASK-3 channels are most sensitive to pH changes in the range 7 to 6. Extracellular pH changes in this range are observed during cerebral ischemia and may depolarize the cells by inhibition of TASK-3 channels. Such a depolarization would be expected to cause an increase in the firing rate of specific neurons expressing TASK-3. This is in marked contrast to the function of other 2P K+channels such as TREK-1, which are activated by intracellular acidification and may have a neuroprotective function (14.Maingret F. Patel A.J.

Subsequently it became known that this transport system is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues (3.Christensen H.N. J. Membr.

The characteristics of system A include Na+ dependence, preference for short-chain neutral amino acids such as alanine, serine, proline, and glutamine as substrates, pH sensitivity, andtrans-inhibition. Bulky hydrophobic amino acids (e.g. leucine, tryptophan), anionic amino acids (glutamate and aspartate), and cationic amino acids (arginine and lysine) are excluded by the system.

Vatz K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3609-3616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, system A is defined as the component of Na+-dependent transport of any neutral amino acid that is inhibitable by the model substrate α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB)1 (3.Christensen H.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4.Christensen H.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 576-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5.Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Na+-dependent transport of MeAIB can be used directly as a measure of system A activity. Another important feature of system A is its regulatory properties (6.Shotwell M.A. Kilberg M.S. Oxender D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 7.Haussinger D. Lang F. Kilberg M.S. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport. Mechanisms and Control.

System A is up-regulated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, and mitogens. It is also subject to adaptive regulation mediated by altered levels of intracellular amino acids. The expression of system A in the skeletal muscle and liver and its regulation by glucagon and insulin in these tissues are particularly important with respect to various physiological conditions such as starvation and pregnancy and pathological states such as diabetes.In recent years, several amino acid transporters have been identified at the molecular level (9.Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 456-467Google Scholar). However, the molecular identification of the protein responsible for system A activity has been elusive. Most recently, Varoqui et al. (12.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of a Na+-dependent glutamine transporter (GlnT) from rat brain that is capable of transporting the system A-specific model substrate MeAIB. However, the expression of GlnT is restricted to the brain. GlnT-specific transcripts are not detectable in the skeletal muscle, liver, and other tissues. This suggests that GlnT may represent a subtype of system A that is expressed specifically in the brain. The ubiquitously expressed system A has not yet been cloned. System A activity has been shown to be induced in Xenopus laevis oocytes following microinjection of mRNA from the liver (13.Palacin M. Werner A. Dittmer J. Murer H. Biber J. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Tarnuzzer R.W. Campa M.J. Qian N.X. Englesberg E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13914-13917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but identification of the mRNA responsible for the activity has not been accomplished.Here we describe the cloning of an amino acid transporter from rat skeletal muscle that is capable of Na+-dependent transport of MeAIB and expressed ubiquitously in rat tissues including skeletal muscle, liver, and brain. The cloned transporter is distinct from GlnT. We have characterized the transport function of the cloned transporter in two different heterologous expression systems using mammalian cells andX. laevis oocytes. The transporter is Na+-dependent, pH-sensitive, and electrogenic and prefers short-chain neutral amino acids as substrates.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned the amino acid transport protein that is responsible for system A activity known to be expressed in most mammalian tissues, including the skeletal muscle, liver, and brain. This transporter, designated ATA2, is distinct from the recently cloned brain-specific glutamine transporter GlnT (12.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because GlnT was the first cloned amino acid transporter with the ability to transport the system A-specific model substrate MeAIB, we identify GlnT as ATA1 in this paper. Functionally, ATA2 behaves similar to ATA1. Both of them are Na+-dependent and pH-sensitive. Both of them are able to transport the system A-specific substrate MeAIB. In the present study, we have investigated the transport function of ATA2 in much greater detail. The most important feature of ATA2 is its electrogenicity. The transport process mediated by ATA2 is associated with the transfer of net positive charge into the cells. The Na+:amino acid stoichiometry is 1:1. Because only neutral amino acids are recognized as substrates by ATA2, the cotransport of one Na+ ion with one amino acid molecule provides the molecular basis for the electrogenicity of the transport process. Such information is not available for ATA1. Another significant finding in the present study is the relatively smaller magnitude of currents induced by MeAIB in rATA2-expressing oocytes compared with most neutral amino acids. Alanine induced the maximum currents. MeAIB-induced currents were only 14% of the alanine-induced currents despite the fact that the affinities of the transporter for the two amino acids are comparable. This suggests that even though MeAIB is a highly specific model substrate for system A, it is not a good substrate for rATA2, a subtype of system A, in terms of the relative transport rate in comparison with other naturally occurring neutral amino acid substrates. Whether or not the same is true for ATA1, another subtype of system A, remains to be seen.The marked pH dependence of ATA2 is very interesting. The transport activity of ATA2 increases markedly when the extracellular pH is higher than 7.5 and decreases markedly when the extracellular pH is lower than 7.5. ATA1 also exhibits this characteristic (12.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence, ATA1 and ATA2 are related to the recently cloned amino acid transport system N (SN1), a Na+- and H+-coupled glutamine transporter (22.Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). SN1 is also pH-sensitive, and the influence of extracellular pH on the transport activity of SN1 is similar to that described in the case of ATA1 and ATA2. However, the basis for the pH influence on SN1 is that this transporter mediates the influx of Na+ and amino acid (glutamine) into the cells coupled to the efflux of H+(22.Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thus, H+ is a transportable coupling ion for SN1, and an outwardly directed H+ gradient serves as an energy source for the transporter in addition to the inwardly directed Na+ gradient. Our recent studies have shown that SN1 is electrogenic with a Na+:amino acid stoichiometry of 2:1. 2Y.-J. Fei, M. Sugawara, T. Nakanishi, W. Huang, H. Wang, P. D. Prasad, F. H. Leibach, and V. Ganapathy, submitted for publication. Taken collectively, the data suggest that SN1 mediates the influx of two Na+ and one amino acid coupled to the efflux of one H+. The Na+:amino acid:H+ stoichiometry of 2:1:1 corroborates with the electrogenic nature of SN1. In contrast to SN1, the Na+:amino acid stoichiometry for ATA2 is 1:1. Therefore, even though ATA2 is highly pH-sensitive, it is unlikely that H+ is a transportable coupling ion for this transporter. This is supported by studies done with system A in rat skeletal muscle (23.Munoz P. Guma A. Camps M. Furriols M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10381-10388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have shown that the alterations in system A activity observed with different extracellular pH values are actually induced by intracellular pH, which changes with extracellular pH. The activity of this transporter is inhibited when the intracellular pH is lowered below physiological pH and is stimulated when the intracellular pH is raised above physiological pH. These findings argue against a role of H+ as an exchange ion coupled to the influx of Na+ and amino acid. Available evidence suggests that the transporter may possess a pH-sensing domain on the cytoplasmic region, most likely a histidine residue, which is responsible for intracellular pH-induced changes in transport function (24.Bertran J. Roca A. Pola E. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 798-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have cloned ATA2 from rat skeletal muscle. Northern blot analysis shows that ATA2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in rat tissues, in contrast to the brain-specific ATA1. Based on the tissue distribution pattern, it is most likely that ATA2 represents the amino acid transport system A known to be regulated by hormones such as insulin and glucagon in the skeletal muscle and liver. The present studies on the molecular identification of this transporter are very important for future investigations of the mechanisms of the hormonal control of the expression and activity of the transporter. Amino acid transport system A was originally described in Ehrlich cells (1.Oxender D.L. Christensen H.N. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 11.Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 456-467Google Scholar). However, the molecular identification of the protein responsible for system A activity has been elusive. Most recently, Varoqui et al. (12.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of a Na+-dependent glutamine transporter (GlnT) from rat brain that is capable of transporting the system A-specific model substrate MeAIB. However, the expression of GlnT is restricted to the brain. GlnT-specific transcripts are not detectable in the skeletal muscle, liver, and other tissues. This suggests that GlnT may represent a subtype of system A that is expressed specifically in the brain. The ubiquitously expressed system A has not yet been cloned. System A activity has been shown to be induced in Xenopus laevis oocytes following microinjection of mRNA from the liver (13.Palacin M. Werner A. Dittmer J. Murer H. Biber J. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14.Tarnuzzer R.W. Campa M.J. Qian N.X. Englesberg E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13914-13917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but identification of the mRNA responsible for the activity has not been accomplished. Here we describe the cloning of an amino acid transporter from rat skeletal muscle that is capable of Na+-dependent transport of MeAIB and expressed ubiquitously in rat tissues including skeletal muscle, liver, and brain. The cloned transporter is distinct from GlnT. We have characterized the transport function of the cloned transporter in two different heterologous expression systems using mammalian cells andX. laevis oocytes. The transporter is Na+-dependent, pH-sensitive, and electrogenic and prefers short-chain neutral amino acids as substrates. DISCUSSIONWe have cloned the amino acid transport protein that is responsible for system A activity known to be expressed in most mammalian tissues, including the skeletal muscle, liver, and brain. This transporter, designated ATA2, is distinct from the recently cloned brain-specific glutamine transporter GlnT (12.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because GlnT was the first cloned amino acid transporter with the ability to transport the system A-specific model substrate MeAIB, we identify GlnT as ATA1 in this paper. Functionally, ATA2 behaves similar to ATA1. Both of them are Na+-dependent and pH-sensitive. Both of them are able to transport the system A-specific substrate MeAIB. In the present study, we have investigated the transport function of ATA2 in much greater detail. The most important feature of ATA2 is its electrogenicity. The transport process mediated by ATA2 is associated with the transfer of net positive charge into the cells. The Na+:amino acid stoichiometry is 1:1. Because only neutral amino acids are recognized as substrates by ATA2, the cotransport of one Na+ ion with one amino acid molecule provides the molecular basis for the electrogenicity of the transport process. Such information is not available for ATA1. Another significant finding in the present study is the relatively smaller magnitude of currents induced by MeAIB in rATA2-expressing oocytes compared with most neutral amino acids. Alanine induced the maximum currents. MeAIB-induced currents were only 14% of the alanine-induced currents despite the fact that the affinities of the transporter for the two amino acids are comparable. This suggests that even though MeAIB is a highly specific model substrate for system A, it is not a good substrate for rATA2, a subtype of system A, in terms of the relative transport rate in comparison with other naturally occurring neutral amino acid substrates. Whether or not the same is true for ATA1, another subtype of system A, remains to be seen.The marked pH dependence of ATA2 is very interesting. The transport activity of ATA2 increases markedly when the extracellular pH is higher than 7.5 and decreases markedly when the extracellular pH is lower than 7.5. ATA1 also exhibits this characteristic (12.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence, ATA1 and ATA2 are related to the recently cloned amino acid transport system N (SN1), a Na+- and H+-coupled glutamine transporter (22.Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). SN1 is also pH-sensitive, and the influence of extracellular pH on the transport activity of SN1 is similar to that described in the case of ATA1 and ATA2. However, the basis for the pH influence on SN1 is that this transporter mediates the influx of Na+ and amino acid (glutamine) into the cells coupled to the efflux of H+(22.Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thus, H+ is a transportable coupling ion for SN1, and an outwardly directed H+ gradient serves as an energy source for the transporter in addition to the inwardly directed Na+ gradient. Our recent studies have shown that SN1 is electrogenic with a Na+:amino acid stoichiometry of 2:1. 2Y.-J. Fei, M. Sugawara, T. Nakanishi, W. Huang, H. Wang, P. D. Prasad, F. H. Leibach, and V. Ganapathy, submitted for publication. Taken collectively, the data suggest that SN1 mediates the influx of two Na+ and one amino acid coupled to the efflux of one H+. The Na+:amino acid:H+ stoichiometry of 2:1:1 corroborates with the electrogenic nature of SN1. In contrast to SN1, the Na+:amino acid stoichiometry for ATA2 is 1:1. Therefore, even though ATA2 is highly pH-sensitive, it is unlikely that H+ is a transportable coupling ion for this transporter. This is supported by studies done with system A in rat skeletal muscle (23.Munoz P. Guma A. Camps M. Furriols M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10381-10388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have shown that the alterations in system A activity observed with different extracellular pH values are actually induced by intracellular pH, which changes with extracellular pH. The activity of this transporter is inhibited when the intracellular pH is lowered below physiological pH and is stimulated when the intracellular pH is raised above physiological pH. These findings argue against a role of H+ as an exchange ion coupled to the influx of Na+ and amino acid. Available evidence suggests that the transporter may possess a pH-sensing domain on the cytoplasmic region, most likely a histidine residue, which is responsible for intracellular pH-induced changes in transport function (24.Bertran J. Roca A. Pola E. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 798-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have cloned ATA2 from rat skeletal muscle. Northern blot analysis shows that ATA2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in rat tissues, in contrast to the brain-specific ATA1. Based on the tissue distribution pattern, it is most likely that ATA2 represents the amino acid transport system A known to be regulated by hormones such as insulin and glucagon in the skeletal muscle and liver. The present studies on the molecular identification of this transporter are very important for future investigations of the mechanisms of the hormonal control of the expression and activity of the transporter.

Unlike cytokine-induced activation of STATs, where JAKs are known to play a pivotal role in phosphorylating STATs, the mechanism for receptor protein-tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of STATs remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the activation of STAT proteins by the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) in vitro and in vivo and assessed the role of JAKs in the process of activation. We found that STAT3, but not STAT5, was activated in response to IGF-I in 293T cells cotransfected with IGF-IR and STAT expression vectors. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, JAK1, and JAK2 was increased upon IGF-I stimulation of endogenous IGF-IR in 293T cells transfected with the respective STAT or JAK expression vector. Supporting the observation in 293T cells, endogenous STAT3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon IGF-I stimulation in the muscle cell line C2C12 as well as in various embryonic and adult mouse organs during different stages of development. Dominant-negative JAK1 or JAK2 was able to block the IGF-IR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in 293T cells. A newly identified family of proteins called SOCS (suppressor ofcytokine signaling), including SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3 and CIS, was able to inhibit the IGF-I-induced STAT3 activation as well with varying degrees of potency, in which SOCS1 and SOCS3 appeared to have the higher inhibitory ability. Inhibition of STAT3 activation by SOCS could be overcome by overexpression of native JAK1 and JAK2. We conclude that IGF-I/IGF-IR is able to mediate activation of STAT3 in vitro and in vivo and that JAKs are essential for the process of activation.

It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has been implicated in diverse biological processes such as mitogenesis, cellular transformation, cell survival, and cell differentiation (1.Ullrich A.

One of the important functions of IGF-IR is its role in organogenesis of various organs during early embryonic development. It continues to play a critical role in mature organs as well. It has been shown that 95% of igf-I −/− mice die immediately following birth. Mice with an igf-Ir gene disruption also die at birth with respiratory failure and exhibit a severe growth deficiency (45% of the normal size) (6.Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). Theigf-Ir −/− mouse embryos display generalized organ hypoplasia, delayed ossification, and developmental abnormalities in the central nervous system and epidermis. Furthermore, abnormalities in renal development were found in igf-I −/−mice that survived past birth, i.e. the number of nephrons per kidney was reduced by ∼20% in igf-I −/−mice (6.Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). In adult animals, IGF-IR is known to play an important role in organ regeneration (such as that in neurons and liver) as well as in compensatory kidney growth after renal failure. The function of IGF-IR in other organs in general is less clear. In addition, IGF-IR has been shown to have cell-transforming potential and has been implicated in tumor development. NIH3T3 cells overexpressing native IGF-IR form colonies in soft agar in response to IGF-I (7.Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Fusion of the 5′-truncated β-subunit of IGF-IR to a retroviral group-specific antigen sequence was shown to activate its oncogenic potential (8.Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 374-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using an IGF-IR null mouse cell line called R−, it was demonstrated that IGF-IR is essential for transformation by a number of oncogenes, including SV40 large T antigen and ras (9.Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar). More important, IGF-IR is widely implicated in the development and/or progression of a variety of human tumors, including breast cancer (5.Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar,9.Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Surmacz E. Guvakova M.A. Nolan M.K.

In addition, IGF-I is known to promote survival in many cell types in response to a range of stresses, including growth factor withdrawal, chemotherapeutic agents, and UV irradiation (15.Rodriguez-Tarduchy G.

Mature IGF-IR is a tetrameric type II receptor protein-tyrosine kinase consisting of two ligand-binding α-subunits and two transmembrane β-subunits. The binding of ligand to IGF-IR results in its conformational change and cross-phosphorylation between the β-subunits of the receptor complex, leading to phosphorylation of additional tyrosine residues and further activation of the protein-tyrosine kinase activity (18.Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 19.Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of various tyrosine residues also creates binding sites on the receptor for its immediate downstream signaling molecules, which typically contain phosphotyrosine-binding or SH2 domains (20.Blenis J.

Through binding and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 and their subsequent recruitment of Grb2 and the regulatory subunit p85 of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase, the two major signaling pathways, viz. the Ras/MAPK pathway and the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway, are activated. Signaling by the MAPK pathway, which includes sequential activation of a cascade of serine/threonine protein kinases, plays an important role in promoting cell growth and in regulating gene expression (20.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 21.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway is known to be involved in various functions, including cell growth and cell survival (25.Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M.

These proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAKs following the binding of cytokine to its receptor. Four members of the JAK family have been identified so far: JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and TYK-2 (29.Aringer M. Cheng A. Nelson J.W. Chen M. Sudarshan C. Zhou Y.J. O'Shea J.J.

Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT proteins form homo- or heterodimers through intermolecular interactions of the SH2 domains with the phosphorylated tyrosines and rapidly translocate to the nucleus and induce gene expression. Thus far, >40 different polypeptide ligands have been shown to cause STAT activation. They include growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) (27.Ihle J.N.

Recent evidence has demonstrated the necessity of STAT3 in cell growth and transformation. STAT3, but not STAT1, -5, or -6, was shown to be activated by Src and Fps protein-tyrosine kinases in NIH3T3 and Rat-1 cells, respectively (31.Garcia R. Jove R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Using oncogenic srcand an NIH3T3 cell system, Turkson et al. (32.Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and Bromberg et al. (33.Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) showed that STAT3 is required for Src-induced cell transformation. Using a group-specific antigen/IGF-IR fusion receptor and an EGF receptor/Ros chimera, we have demonstrated that activation of STAT3 is essential for the establishment and maintenance of cell transformation by these receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (34.Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A growing number of tumor-derived cell lines as well as human tumors have been reported to contain constitutively activated STAT proteins, particularly STAT3, which was observed to be activated in five out of nine breast carcinoma cell lines and in a high proportion of head and neck cancers examined (31.Garcia R. Jove R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that a mutation that causes constitutive dimerization of STAT3 was able to activate its oncogenic potential (35.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). In mouse development, the mRNA of STAT3 could be detected within early post-implantation stages, and STAT3 was activated during this early development (36.Duncan S.A. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the mouseStat3 gene leads to early embryonic lethality, indicating that STAT3 plays an important role in embryonic development (37.Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Using the approach of tissue-specific gene knockout, STAT3 was shown to play an anti-apoptotic role in T cells and in monocytes during their differentiation (38.Takeda K. Kaisho T. Yoshida N. Takeda J. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4652-4660PubMed Google Scholar). The JAK/STAT signaling pathways are tightly regulated processes, but little is known about how these signals are turned off. The family of SOCS proteins, which includes SOCS1–7 and CIS, has recently been isolated and shown to act as negative regulators of cytokine-induced signaling (39.Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 1: 47-52Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). SOCS proteins appear to switch off JAK/STAT signaling by at least two mechanisms. SOCS1 and SOCS3 have been shown to bind to activated JAKs and inhibit their catalytic activity, although their precise mechanism is not clear (39.Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 1: 47-52Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In contrast, CIS appears to bind directly to phosphorylated receptors and to compete with signaling intermediates including STAT5 for binding to the receptor (39.Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 1: 47-52Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). So far, the understanding of the function of SOCS proteins have been derived from using a cytokine system as the experimental model. To date, there is only one report demonstrating the involvement of the SOCS protein in growth factor-mediated signal transduction, viz. suppression of the Steel factor-dependent proliferation by SOCS1 (40.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In view of the accumulating evidence implicating IGF-IR and STAT3 in embryonic development, cell transformation, and tumor development, we set out to investigate the functional interaction between IGF-IR and STAT3 in vitro and in vivo. We observed that STAT3 is activated upon IGF-I stimulation in cells transfected with IGF-IR and STAT3. Following in vivo injection of IGF-I, STAT3 activation was detected in various tissues of mice in different developmental stages. Our results suggest that STAT3 is a physiological signaling molecule of IGF-IR. Using SOCS proteins and dominant-negative mutants of JAKs, we found that IGF-I-induced STAT3 activation requires Janus kinases. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% chicken embryo extract. Transfections were carried out by the standard calcium phosphate method (34.Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 70% confluence/60-mm diameter dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 18 h prior to transfection. Total DNA for transfection was 100–1000 ng of the appropriate plasmids/dish plus 5 μg of calf thymus DNA. Transfection was terminated 15 h later by removing the medium and washing twice with fresh medium. The cells were then maintained in the same medium for 24 h before being starved overnight in serum-free medium for growth factor stimulation. phEFIGF-IR was generated by removing the full-length IGF-IR insert from pMXIGF-IR (7.Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and cloning it into the human elongation factor promoter-based plasmid. Expression plasmids containing CIS and SOCS1–3 were kindly provided by Drs. Tracy Willson and Douglas Hilton. The dominant-negative mutant of JAK1 contains a 3-amino acid change in the conserved region VIII of the kinase domain (FWYAPE → LTYAPV) that impairs its catalytic function. The dominant-negative mutant of JAK2 contains a single amino acid change (Lys → Ala) at the ATP-binding site, resulting in impaired binding of ATP and catalytic activity. These mutants were made in David Levy's laboratory. Monoclonal anti-phospho-STAT5 antibody (18E5) was generated by Tom W. Wheeler and Henry Sadowski with the help of Tom Moran at the Hybridoma Core Facility of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine by using phosphorylated STAT5 peptide as the antigene. Anti-phospho-STAT3 and anti-phospho-p42/44 MAPK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Anti-STAT3, anti-STAT5a, and anti-STAT5b antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-JAK1 and anti-JAK2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was purchase from Sigma. Protein extraction, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were done according to published procedures (34.Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Seventeen-day pregnant DBA mice were injected with 0.2 ml of PBS or PBS containing 2 μg/ml IGF-I via the tail vein. Forty minutes later, the mice were killed, and embryos were removed for sampling of various organs. One-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of PBS or PBS containing 20 μg/ml IGF-I. Thirty minutes later, the mice were killed, and proteins were extracted from various organs. Adult mice were injected with 0.2 ml of PBS or PBS containing 2 μg/ml IGF-I via the tail vein for 1 h and with 0.5 ml of PBS or PBS containing 20 μg/ml IGF-I intraperitoneally for 30 min. A similar intraperitoneal procedure was done for newborn mice. The tissues were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The protein concentration of the cleared lysate was determined. Two milligrams of each tissue lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT3 antibody and subjected to gel electrophoresis and sequential Western blotting with anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was done following the published procedure (34.Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT3 is a downstream signaling molecule of IGF-I and its receptor in vivo, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in different tissues after injection of IGF-I into mice at different stages of development. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was detected in response to IGF-I in liver, kidney, intestine, and muscle in 17-day-old embryos (Fig.1 A). No significant phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed in brain and heart. Although the abundance of STAT3 varied among tissues, its increased phosphorylation was not due to the varying protein amount of STAT3 (Fig.1 A). In 1-week-old mice, STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in lung, kidney, spleen, and thymus in response to injected IGF-I (Fig. 1 B). A similar pattern of STAT3 activation was observed in response to IGF-I in adults compared with newborn mice with the exception of the thymus (Fig. 1 C). Despite a relatively high expression level of IGF-IR in brain, no receptor tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected in response to IGF-I injection (Fig.1, B and C, lower panels). This could be due to failure of the injected IGF-I to pass through the blood-brain barrier. The IGF-IR expression level was relatively lower in adult liver in comparison with that in 1-week-old pups. Both the expression level and extent of activation of STAT3 in response to IGF-I in liver were higher in embryonic mice than in newborn and adult mice. The kidney had the highest level of IGF-IR expression among the adult tissues examined. Taken together, our data indicate that IGF-I and its receptor are able to mediate activation of STAT3 in a number of tissues throughout mouse development. We have shown previously that insulin and the insulin receptor are able to mediate the activation of STAT5 in vitro and in vivo(30.Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since IGF-IR and the insulin receptor are the two most closely related receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, we tested if IGF-IR can also mediate the activation of STAT5 in addition to STAT3. For this purpose, plasmids encoding IGF-IR and control vector, IGF-IR and STAT3, or IGF-IR and STAT5a/STAT5b were transiently transfected, respectively, into 293T cells. The lysates from unstimulated or stimulated cells were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific to tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 or STAT5, respectively (Fig.2, top panels). IGF-IR was detected by immunoprecipitation with specific antibody, followed by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2 A–C, bottom panels). Activation of IGF-IR by IGF-I led to a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig.2 A). The increased tyrosine phosphorylation was correlated with the increased DNA-binding ability of STAT3 using the high affinity M67 DNA-binding site (SIE) deoxyoligonucleotide. No significant tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5a was observed with or without IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 2 B). There was a relatively high background level of STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation; however, reproducibly, no significant increase was observed in response to IGF-I (Fig. 2 C). We conclude that IGF-IR mediates the activation of STAT3, but not that of STAT5. Furthermore, STAT3 was activated upon IGF-I stimulation of endogenous IGF-IR in 293T cells transfected only with the STAT3 expression plasmid (Fig. 2 D). Supporting the observation of 17-day embryonic muscle, STAT3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of the muscle cell line C2C12, in which neither STAT3 nor IGF-IR was overexpressed (Fig.2 E). Previous studies have demonstrated that JAK1 and JAK2 can be activated in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing IGF-IR (41.Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To explore the role of JAKs in IGF-I-induced STAT3 activation, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of transiently expressed JAK1 or JAK2 in 293T cells in response to IGF-I stimulation of endogenous IGF-IR. Increased JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected upon IGF-I stimulation, confirming the published observations in NIH3T3 cells. Dominant-negative JAK1 and JAK2 mutants are inactive in their catalytic activity and, when coexpressed with the wild type, were able to work dominant-negatively against the IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type JAKs (Fig. 3). The dominant-negative JAK mutants had no effect on the activation of IGF-IR. To further investigate whether STAT3 activation by IGF-I requires JAK activity, the dominant-negative JAK mutants were used to test their effect on STAT3 activation upon IGF-I stimulation. The degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was decreased by coexpression of either dominant-negative JAK1 or JAK2, and the inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). At the highest dose (0.4 μg), either dominant-negative JAK mutant was able to completely block the activation of STAT3. Conversely, cotransfection of either JAK1 or JAK2 resulted in the augmentation of the activation of STAT3 by IGF-I (data not shown). Using the kinase inhibitor AG490, which has previously been shown to inhibit JAK activity (42.Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 43.Wang L.-H. Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A., Yu, C.R. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar), we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation that was completely abolished at 100 nm (data not shown). By contrast, no significant inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed with the Src family kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) (44.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar) at a concentration up to 50 nm (data not shown). We conclude that IGF-I/IGF-IR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 requires JAK activity.Figure 4Role of JAK1 and JAK2 in the activation of STAT3 by IGF-I. 293T cells that were transfected with 200 ng of phEFIGF-IR and 400 ng of pcSTAT3 together with increasing amounts of either dominant-negative JAK1 mutant pRK5JAK1M (A) or dominant-negative JAK2 mutant pRK5JAK2M (B) were serum-starved and stimulated with IGF-I as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Twenty micrograms of cell lysate was directly Western-blotted with the antibody indicated below each panel. The upper panels show tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Themiddle panels show expression levels of dominant-negative JAK1 and JAK2, respectively. The lower panels show STAT3 expression levels after stripping and reprobing of the same filters shown in the respective upper panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SOCS proteins have recently been reported to suppress the kinase activity of Janus kinase family members. To check if SOCS can block STAT3 activation, we measured the STAT3 phosphorylation following IGF-I stimulation in 293T cells transiently transfected with IGF-IR and with STAT3 together with control or different SOCS expression vectors. Coexpression of SOCS proteins did not affect the induction of IGF-IR phosphorylation or subsequent MAPK activation (Fig.5). However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly inhibited by SOCS protein expression (Fig.5). The inhibition was more pronounced with the expression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 in comparison with CIS or SOCS2. Our results indicate that SOCS proteins have no effect on the receptor kinase activity, but are potent inhibitors of IGF-IR-mediated STAT3 activation. Our observations of the effects of SOCS and dominant-negative JAKs strongly suggest that JAK(s) plays a critical role in IGF-IR-mediated activation of STAT3. To further understand the role of JAKs and the effect of SOCS on IGF-I-mediated STAT3 activation, we performed the following experiments. 293T cells were transfected with IGF-IR, STAT3, and a constant amount of JAK1 or JAK2 with an increasing amount of SOCS1. We observed that SOCS1 potently inhibited STAT3 activation by IGF-IR and JAK1 (Fig. 6 A). By contrast, SOCS1 inhibition of STAT3 activation by IGF-IR and JAK2 was not as effective, although notable inhibition was observed at the highest dose of SOCS1, suggesting that SOCS1 is a more effective inhibitor of JAK1 than JAK2 (Fig. 6 B). Overexpression of either JAK1 or JAK2 could overcome the SOCS1 inhibition of IGF-I-induced STAT3 activation (Fig. 6 C). Our results further confirm the important role of JAKs in IGF-I-induced STAT3 activation. The results here are consistent with those obtained with dominant-negative JAK1 and JAK2 and the kinase inhibitors described above and suggest that both JAKs are involved in the STAT3 activation. In this study, we show that IGF-I and its receptor are able to induce activation of STAT3 in vivo and in vitro. Our results indicate that the in vivo protocol of IGF-I injection is effective in activating IGF-IR and its downstream signaling. A similar method has been used successfully to study substrate tyrosine phosphorylation in neonatal mice (45.Donaldson R.W. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8477-8481Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in mouse liver in response to EGF stimulation (46.Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have chosen DBA mice here since we have previously demonstrated STAT5 activation by perfusion of insulin in liver (30.Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the current protocol, each mouse was injected with 200 μl of saline or a 10× physiological concentration of IGF-I (2 μg/ml) through the tail vein, which presumably would be diluted to the approximately physiological concentration in vivo. The physiological concentration of IGF-I in the mouse is ∼200 ng/ml (47.Jandziszak K. Suarez C. Wasserman E. Clark R. Baker B. Liu F. Hintz R. Saenger P. Brion L.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R120-R128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under similar stimulation with insulin, no phosphorylation of STAT3 was detected in spleen or kidney; therefore, the observed STAT3 activation by IGF-I was unlikely due to cross-activation of the insulin receptor. STAT3 was activated by IGF-I in many fetal and adult tissues, particularly in kidney, lung, pancreas, and thymus, suggesting that STAT3 plays a role in IGF-IR signaling in these organs during different stages of mouse development and in adult life. Our data also suggest that STAT3 signaling may be more important for fetal as opposed to adult liver and that the opposite is true for kidney, although its precise role in those organs is unclear. The role of STATs in receptor protein-tyrosine kinase signaling and the mechanism of their activation are not well understood. Tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs in response to EGF, PDGF, insulin, and IGF-I among others has been observed (29.Aringer M. Cheng A. Nelson J.W. Chen M. Sudarshan C. Zhou Y.J. O'Shea J.J. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41.Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the role of JAKs in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling is still unclear. EGF has been shown to be able to lead to activation of STAT1, -3, and -5 (41.Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,46.Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), although only STAT3 (but not STAT1) activation is thought to play a significant role in EGF-induced cell growth in vitro (48.Grandis J.R. Drenning S.D. Chakraborty A. Zhou M.Y. Zeng Q. Pitt A.S. Tweardy D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a pharmacological inhibitor of Src kinases and a dominant-negative mutant of Src or JAK expression vectors, it was shown that STAT activation by EGF requires Src kinase activity, which was also shown to be able to regulate JAK activity (49.Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). By contrast, the PDGF receptor was found to be able to activate STAT1, -3, and -6 in the absence of detectable Src activation (50.Sachsenmaier C. Sadowski H.B. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3583-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This was shown by using the PDGF receptor mutant that was impaired in binding to Src. Furthermore, using cell-free system, it was demonstrated that the mechanisms of activation of STAT1 and STAT3 by PDGF are distinct (51.Vignais M.L. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). STAT1 activation seems to involve its direct interaction with the PDGF receptor, whereas STAT3 activation appears to require JAKs (51.Vignais M.L. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since multiple members of the JAK family can be activated by PDGF, it was suggested that each JAK is able to mediate STAT3 activation by PDGF independently (51.Vignais M.L. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our data are in agreement with the previous observation that JAK1 and JAK2 can be phosphorylated upon IGF-I stimulation (41.Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The STAT3 recruitment and activation motif for tyrosine kinases was suggested to be YXXQ or YXXC (52.Chakraborty A. Dyer K.F. Cascio M. Mietzner T.A. Tweardy D.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 15-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasmic domain of IGF-IR does not contain these motifs, this suggests that STAT3 activation by IGF-IR may involve a different sequence motif or, alternatively, is mediated by activation of JAKs. Although JAKs have been shown to interact with phosphorylated IGF-IR (41.Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the mechanism of IGF-IR-mediated STAT3 activation has not been established. Using dominant-negative JAKs and JAK inhibitors, including SOCS and pharmacological agents, we have shown that STAT3 activation by IGF-I requires JAK activity. Since both JAK1 and JAK2 are activated in response to IGF-I and both JAKs are able to augment the IGF-I-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and to rescue the inhibition by SOCS, this strongly suggests that JAK1 and JAK2 can independently mediate the STAT3 activation by IGF-I. The complete abrogation of IGF-I-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by either dominant-negative JAK1 or JAK2 at high doses was most likely due to cross-inhibition of both JAKs by either of the dominant-negative mutants. Among the SOCS family proteins, SOCS2 was isolated using yeast two-hybrid screening for interacting proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of IGF-IR (53.Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Both SOCS1 and SOCS2 were shown to interact with IGF-IR (53.Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We show here that these negative regulators of JAKs are able to block STAT3 activation by IGF-IR. This further confirms the role of JAKs in IGF-I/IGF-IR-mediated activation of STAT3. Among the SOCS proteins tested, SOCS1 and SOCS3 appear to have greater inhibitory potency. This is consistent with the finding that both SOCS proteins are able to bind to activated JAKs and to inhibit their catalytic activity. It is also in agreement with our observation that the inhibition by SOCS1 can be overcome by overexpression of JAK1 or JAK2. These observations imply that either JAK1 or JAK2 is able to independently mediate the IGF-I/IGF-IR-induced activation of STAT3. Like the dominant-negative JAK mutants, each SOCS protein appears to be able to inhibit multiple JAKs since individual SOCS proteins, particularly SOCS1 and SOCS3, are able to substantially abrogate the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Several possibilities of STAT3 activation by IGF-IR via JAKs exist. First, the activated receptor associates with JAKs, which phosphorylate STAT3. The STAT3-binding site could be generated by activated IGF-IR or JAKs. Second, upon activation by IGF-IR, JAKs could directly phosphorylate STAT3. Third, JAKs could provide STAT3 recruitment sites in the receptor complex, as suggested for JAK2 in response to growth hormone receptor activation (54.Carter-Su C. Smit L.S. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 61-82PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the IGF-IR-interacting site for JAKs and assessment of its effect on IGF-I-induced STAT3 activation should help to answer the questions."
https://openalex.org/W2038527467,"The effects of endothelin (ET) are mediated via the G protein-coupled receptors ETA and ETB. However, the mechanisms of ET receptor desensitization, internalization, and intracellular trafficking are poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ET receptor regulation and to characterize the intracellular pathways of ET-stimulated ETA and ETB receptors. By analysis of ETA and ETB receptor internalization in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence of overexpressed βARK, β-arrestin-1, β-arrestin-2, or dynamin as well as dominant negative mutants of these regulators, we have demonstrated that both ET receptor subtypes follow an arrestin- and dynamin/clathrin-dependent mechanism of internalization. Fluorescence microscopy of Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ET receptors revealed that the ETA and ETB subtypes were targeted to different intracellular routes after ET stimulation. While ETA-GFP followed a recycling pathway and colocalized with transferrin in the pericentriolar recycling compartment, ETB-GFP was targeted to lysosomes after ET-induced internalization. Both receptor subtypes colocalized with Rab5 in classical early endosomes, indicating that this compartment is a common early intermediate for the two ET receptors during intracellular transport. The distinct intracellular routes of ET-stimulated ETA and ETB receptors may explain the persistent signal response through the ETAreceptor and the transient response through the ETBreceptor. Furthermore, lysosomal targeting of the ETBreceptor could serve as a biochemical mechanism for clearance of plasma endothelin via this subtype. The effects of endothelin (ET) are mediated via the G protein-coupled receptors ETA and ETB. However, the mechanisms of ET receptor desensitization, internalization, and intracellular trafficking are poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ET receptor regulation and to characterize the intracellular pathways of ET-stimulated ETA and ETB receptors. By analysis of ETA and ETB receptor internalization in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence of overexpressed βARK, β-arrestin-1, β-arrestin-2, or dynamin as well as dominant negative mutants of these regulators, we have demonstrated that both ET receptor subtypes follow an arrestin- and dynamin/clathrin-dependent mechanism of internalization. Fluorescence microscopy of Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ET receptors revealed that the ETA and ETB subtypes were targeted to different intracellular routes after ET stimulation. While ETA-GFP followed a recycling pathway and colocalized with transferrin in the pericentriolar recycling compartment, ETB-GFP was targeted to lysosomes after ET-induced internalization. Both receptor subtypes colocalized with Rab5 in classical early endosomes, indicating that this compartment is a common early intermediate for the two ET receptors during intracellular transport. The distinct intracellular routes of ET-stimulated ETA and ETB receptors may explain the persistent signal response through the ETAreceptor and the transient response through the ETBreceptor. Furthermore, lysosomal targeting of the ETBreceptor could serve as a biochemical mechanism for clearance of plasma endothelin via this subtype. endothelin G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase Chinese hamster ovary green fluorescent protein β-adrenergic receptor kinase transferrin transferrin receptor tetramethylrhodamine-labeled transferrin wild type bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline The multiple physiological effects of the vasoactive peptide hormone endothelin (ET)1 (1.Yanagisawa M.

ET-1 acts directly on ETA receptors expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells to mediate a long lasting vasoconstrictive response. The prolonged response through agonist-stimulated ETA receptors has also been demonstrated in cultured cells expressing this receptor (3.Cramer H. Muller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13325-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the ETB receptor may also mediate vasoconstriction (4.Clozel M. Gray G.A. Breu V. Loffler B.M. Osterwalder R.

Circulating ET-1 is rapidly removed from the plasma, and current evidence suggests that the ETB receptor is important for clearance of plasma ET-1 both under normal conditions (7.Dupuis J.

The mechanism of ETB receptor-mediated clearance of ET-1 is not known, but one hypothesis is that receptor-bound ET-1 is targeted to degradation in the cell. The general model for regulation of GPCR desensitization and internalization is primarily based on studies of the prototypic β2-adrenergic receptor (10.Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol.

According to this model, agonist-activated receptors are phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs), followed by binding of arrestin and initiation of receptor internalization through a clathrin/dynamin-dependent mechanism (16.von Zastrow M.

However, neither the molecular mechanisms of ETAand ETB receptor regulation nor their intracellular trafficking pathways are known. Addressing these issues may not only elucidate the mechanisms of ET receptor regulation but may also provide the molecular basis for the distinct physiological responses mediated by the two receptors. We have used transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS cells as model systems for studying ET receptor internalization and intracellular trafficking. To facilitate the latter, we have constructed chimeric ET receptors with a C-terminal fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP). The chimeric ET receptors were found to have similar functional properties as their wild type counterparts, making them appropriate tools for this study. We found that although both the ETA and the ETB receptors utilize an arrestin and dynamin/clathrin-dependent mechanism of internalization, they follow different intracellular pathways upon ET stimulation. Based on our data, we suggest that different intracellular trafficking routes may be an important mechanism underlying the distinct physiological responses mediated by the ETA and ETB receptors. The human ETA and ETB receptors in pME18sf (22.Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sawamura T. Enoki T. Ohtani T. Sakurai T. Nakao K. Toyo-oka T. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8547-8553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Prof. T. Masaki (Kyoto University, Japan). An EcoRI–NotI fragment of pME18sf-ETA was subcloned into pcDNA1 for expression in CHO cells. For subcloning of the ETBreceptor, PCR-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce aHindIII site in front of the start codon, followed by cloning of the fragments HindIII–EcoRV andEcoRV-XbaI into pcDNA1. The cDNAs of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged dynamin WT and dynamin K44A mutant (23.van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) in pRK5 were gifts from Dr. C. van Koppen (University of Essen, Germany). Rat β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 were in pCMV5 (24.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their respective mutants V53D and V54D in pcDNA1 were from Dr. M. G. Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC). Rat βARK1 in pCMV5 and βARK1-CT in pRK5 were gifts from Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz and Dr. W. Koch, respectively (Duke University). MycRab5 Q79L in pcDNA1 and the human transferrin receptor (TfR) in pGEM1-T7 were from Dr. H. Stenmark (the Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo). An EcoRI digest of pGEM1-hTfR was subcloned into pcDNA1 for expression in CHO cells. pEGFPN1 (CLONTECH), an expression vector containing the coding sequence of a modified form of GFP from Aequorea victoria was chosen for cloning and expression of the ET receptor fusion proteins. For construction of ETA-GFP, PCR-directed mutagenesis was performed on the template pBS-ETA using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-ctaagcaatcatgtggatg-3′ and 5′-gcggatcccggttcatgctgtccttatggctgc-3′ to remove the stop codon of ETA and introduce aBamHI restriction site. TheHindIII–KpnI andKpnI–BamHI fragments of ETA were subsequently inserted into pEGFPN1 to create a receptor fusion protein with GFP linked to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Similarly, for construction of ETB-GFP, PCR was performed on the template pcDNA1-ETB with the primers 5′-gatcccaatagatgtgaac-3′and 5′-cgcggatcccgagatgagctgtatttattactgg-3′ to remove the stop codon and introduce a BamHI site. TheHindIII–BamHI fragment of ETB was subsequently cloned into the pEGFPN1 expression vector. CHO K1 cells (ATCC no. CCL-61) were maintained in Ham's F-12 Kaighn's modified medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bio Whittaker) and 50 μg/ml garamycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. COS-7 cells (ATCC no. CRL-1651) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and garamycin as above. Cells were grown to 40–60% confluency in 35-mm wells before transient transfection using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates before LipofectAMINE transfection. Rab5 Q79L was expressed in CHO cells using the vaccinia T7 expression system as described by Stenmarket al. (25.Stenmark H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Internalization of ETA and ETB receptors was determined using 125I-ET-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were placed on ice, washed, and preincubated in binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA, and 0.1% glucose) before binding of 50 pm125I-ET-1 in binding buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed extensively in ice-cold PBS to remove unbound radioligand before incubation in prewarmed binding buffer at 37 °C for various time points. The cells were subsequently treated for 2 × 10 min at 4 °C with 0.5 m acetic acid, 0.15m NaCl, pH 2.5 (ETA), or 50 mmglycine-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5 (ETB) to strip off surface-bound radioligand. Acid-stripped cells were then lysed for 10 min in 1 m NaOH before the fraction of surface-bound ET-1 in the acid wash and the fraction of internalized ET-1 in the lysate were determined by γ-spectrometry. Internalized receptor was calculated as the fraction of radioactivity not associated with the cell surface after acid wash. Nonspecific binding was determined using excess of unlabeled ET-1 (Peninsula Laboratories). To verify the expression of the different GPCR regulators and their respective mutants, we performed Western blot analysis of samples from the transiently transfected CHO cells. Protein samples were prepared by harvesting cells in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4. 25 μg of protein was loaded per well for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For βARK1 and βARK1-CT, we used TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20, 2.5% dry milk powder, and 2.5% BSA for blocking and antibody incubations. Primary antibody was affinity-purified polyclonal anti-GRK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) used at 1:300. As secondary antibody, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmcia Biotech) diluted at 1:3000. For β-arrestins and dynamin, we used PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, 2.5% dry milk powder, and 2.5% BSA for blocking and antibody incubations. To detect β-arrestins, we used polyclonal antisera raised against the respective proteins (24.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Hemagglutinin-tagged dynamin was detected with a monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody (Babco) diluted 1:1000 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (1:3000). The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transiently transfected CHO cells (35-mm wells) expressing ETA-GFP or ETB-GFP with or without coexpression of βARK1 or βARK2 were labeled with 500 μCi/well of [32Pi] (NEN Life Science Products) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C. To promote receptor activation/phosphorylation, the cells were subsequently incubated with ET-1 (1 μm) for 10 min. After ET-1 stimulation, the cells were rapidly chilled on ice, washed twice in PBS, and lysed for 30 min in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A)). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g (4 °C), and immunoprecipitation of labeled receptors was performed using a rabbit polyclonal peptide antibody against GFP (CLONTECH) and protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Beads with antibody-antigen complexes were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer and subsequently denatured at 65 °C in 2× SDS loading buffer (Laemmli) containing 5% urea and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography on phosphor screens and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Twenty-four hours after transfection, CHO cells (35-mm wells) were labeled with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without inositol (Life Technologies) for 24 h. The cells were subsequently washed and treated with 20 mm LiCl in medium with or without 0.1 μm ET-1 for different time points, with six parallels at each time point. The reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml/well of 0.4 m perchloric acid for 5–10 min at room temperature. The samples (0.8 ml) were neutralized with 0.4 ml of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 mKHCO3 and centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatants were diluted in distilled H2O (1:4), and total inositol phosphates were separated by anion exchange chromatography on Dowex AG1–8x columns (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed twice with 10 ml of distilled H2O to remove free inositol, followed by elution of total inositol phosphates with 7.5 ml of 1 mammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid and determination of3H by liquid scintillation counting. Radioligand binding was performed on membrane preparations according to Elshourbagy et al. (26.Elshourbagy N.A. Korman D.R. Wu H.L. Sylvester D.R. Lee J.A. Nuthalaganti P. Bergsma D.J. Kumar C.S. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications outlined below. CHO cells transiently transfected with receptor were washed in ice-cold PBS and harvested in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors (30 μg/ml benzamidine, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were homogenized on ice using a Dounce glass homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, and protease inhibitors as above, and saturation binding analysis was performed for 1 h at 37 °C using 2–1000 pm125I-ET-1 in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ET-1. For the binding experiments, we used 1 μg of membrane protein in a total volume of 75 μl per sample. The samples were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters presoaked with 0.05% BSA to remove unbound ligand. After three washes in 0.5 m NaCl, the filters were subjected to γ-spectrometric analysis. For analysis of ET receptor trafficking, transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were placed on ice, washed, and preincubated for 10 min with Hanks' balanced salt solution-Hepes before binding of 0.4 μmET-1 in binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution-Hepes with 0.2% BSA and 0.1% glucose) for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound ligand was removed by washing in Hanks' balanced salt solution-Hepes, and the cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before mounting onto object glasses using Mowiol (Hoechst). The specimens were analyzed using either a Zeiss Axiovert-100 fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS laser-scanning microscope with a 100 × 1.3 oil immersion objective. Images were processed and overlaid using Photoshop 4.0 and the Metamorph Imaging System. For the transferrin (Tf) uptake experiments, cells were cotransfected with ET receptor and the human TfR. Cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 30 min before ET-1 binding was performed as described above. During ET-1 internalization at 37 °C, tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated Tf (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added to the cells in binding buffer at a concentration of 25 μg/ml for labeling of the pericentriolar recycling compartment. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and mounting onto object glasses for fluorescence microscopy analysis. Labeling of lysosomes in CHO cells was done overnight with 0.2 mg/ml Texas Red-conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes) followed by a 2-h chase period at 37 °C to wash the probe out of early and late endosomes. To analyze receptor trafficking in this experiment, ET-1 was internalized for various periods of time during the 2-h chase period. The cells were fixed and mounted as described above and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. For staining of intracellular antigens, the cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 after paraformaldehyde fixation. Free aldehyde groups were quenched by adding a few drops of 1 mglycine, pH 8.5, to the PBS wash prior to the permeabilization step. 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS was added for 5 min at room temperature for blocking before antibody incubation. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS to a concentration recommended by the manufacturer or as experienced to give optimal results. Between antibody incubations, the cells were extensively washed in PBS. Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous βCOP in CHO cells was done using a rabbit antiserum and a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology). Late endosomes and lysosomes in COS cells were visualized using a rabbit antiserum against human LAMP-2 and an Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Staining of MycRab5 Q79L expressed using the vaccinia T7 system was performed using a mouse anti-Myc antibody followed by a rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (both from Dr. H. Stenmark, the Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo). To investigate the effects of different regulators of GPCR on ET receptor internalization, CHO cells were transiently transfected with ETA or ETBreceptors alone or together with wild type or mutant forms of βARK1 (GRK2), β-arrestin-1, β-arrestin-2, and dynamin. Receptor internalization was determined by 125I-ET-1 uptake as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Internalized receptor at each time point was calculated as the fraction of radioactivity left after removing surface-bound radioligand with low pH wash. ETA and ETB receptors were both rapidly internalized upon agonist stimulation, reaching 25% within 10 min (Fig. 1), which is consistent with previous reports on ET receptor internalization (3.Cramer H. Muller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13325-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21.Chun M. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10855-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). βARK1-CT, a C-terminal fragment of βARK1 containing a Gβγ binding domain (pleckstrin homology domain) (27.Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), was cotransfected with the ET receptors to competitively inhibit the actions of endogenous βARK. We found that βARK1-CT significantly decreased the rate of ETA receptor internalization (Fig. 1 A). No effect was observed on internalization of the ETBsubtype in this experimental condition (Fig. 1 B), although a small inhibition was discernible at higher levels of βARK1-CT overexpression (not shown). Coexpression of βARK1 wild type had no effect on the internalization kinetics of any of the receptor subtypes (Fig. 1, A and B). However, as shown in the Western blots of Fig. 1, nontransfected CHO cells also express significant amounts of βARK1. β-Arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 are nonvisual arrestins shown to interdict signaling through GPCRs phosphorylated by GRK (24.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestin subsequently targets the receptor to clathrin-mediated endocytosis by binding to the clathrin heavy chain and the β-adaptin subunit of the AP-2 adaptor (15.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 28.Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, C andD, internalization of both ET receptor subtypes increased when overexpressing the wild type β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2. The effect appeared to be more pronounced on internalization of the ETA receptor than the ETB receptor. This observation was substantiated by ET receptor internalization experiments in CHO cells where transfection of increasing amounts of β-arrestin-1 or β-arrestin-2 cDNA was associated with smaller increments of internalization of ETB than of ETA (data not shown). Nevertheless, these results show that both receptors are recognized by arrestins and can be recruited to an arrestin-mediated pathway of internalization. β-Arrestin-1 V53D and β-arrestin-2 V54D are dominant negative mutants of β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2, respectively, which competitively inhibit endogenous arrestin binding to clathrin (14.Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). When the V53D and V54D mutants were cotransfected with the ET receptors in CHO cells, the internalization rate was significantly reduced for both receptor subtypes (Fig. 1,E and F), demonstrating that endogenous arrestins of the CHO cells are involved in regulation of the transfected ET receptors. Cotransfection of the GTPase-deficient mutant dynamin K44A (23.van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 29.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) substantially inhibited internalization of the ETA and ETB receptors, suggesting that both receptors are subjected to endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 1, G andH). As shown, overexpression of wild type dynamin did not affect ET receptor internalization. Impaired endocytosis of both ET receptor subtypes was also observed after incubation in hyperosmotic sucrose and upon potassium depletion (not shown), i.e.methods demonstrated to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (30.Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 31.Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results implicate a role for arrestins and a dynamin/clathrin-dependent pathway in regulation of ET receptor endocytosis. Redistribution of ET receptors from the plasma membrane to intracellular locations has previously been observed (21.Chun M. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10855-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32.Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Tanioka M. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol.

To delineate the intracellular trafficking pathways of the ETA and ETBreceptors, we employed ET receptor-GFP fusion proteins for visualization of receptors during endocytosis. Chimeric ETAand ETB receptors with GFP fused to the cytoplasmic tail were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radioligand binding studies of membrane preparations from CHO cells transiently transfected with ETA-GFP or ETB-GFP demonstrated pharmacological properties very similar to the wild type receptors (Table I). Furthermore, internalization of 125I-ET-1 in CHO cells expressing ETA-GFP or ETB-GFP showed that both subtypes were rapidly internalized with kinetics similar to the wild type ETA and ETB receptors (Fig.2, A and B). The capacity of ETA-GFP and ETB-GFP to mediate ET-1-induced phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and inositol phosphate accumulation was also examined, and as shown in Fig. 2, Cand D, the chimeric receptors displayed similar efficacies as compared with their wild type counterparts.Table IRadioligand binding characteristics of wild type and chimeric ET receptorsReceptorK dB maxpmpmol/mgETAWT99 ± 65.89 ± 0.11ETA-GFP62 ± 52.71 ± 0.07ETBWT31 ± 31.15 ± 0.03ETB-GFP24 ± 23.52 ± 0.08The properties of ET-1 binding, including the number of binding sites, were determined in CHO cells transiently transfected with ETAWT, ETA-GFP, ETB WT, or ETB-GFP receptors.

Golgi membranes contain PI 4-kinase activity and a pool of phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP), which is further increased by ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). COS7 cells were transfected with α and β forms of PI 4-kinase, and only membranes from COS7 cells transfected with PI 4-kinase β increased their content of PIP when incubated with ARF1.

However, when ARF1 was present, PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increased dramatically when membranes were incubated in the presence of cytosol or Type I, but not Type II, PIP kinase. To examine whether ARF1 could directly activate Type I PIP 5-kinase, we used an in vitro assay consisting of phosphatidycholine-containing liposomes, ARF1, and PIP 5-kinase.

Additional functions require the intact lipid, and here it mediates the recruitment of proteins containing appropriate PIP2recognition domains, which include proteins with PH domains and many cytoskeletal proteins (2.Martin T.F.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Many enzymes involved in the synthesis of phosphoinositides have been identified; these include PI 4-kinases α and β, which are localized at the Golgi, and two families of PIP kinases, which are mainly cytosolic (3.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 4.Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the PIP kinases were previously termed Type I and Type II PtdIns(4)P 5-kinases, recent studies have revealed that the two families selectively phosphorylate different positions on the inositol ring (6.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Type I phosphorylates PtdIns(4)P at the 5-position to make PtdIns(4,5)P2, and Type II can phosphorylate PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P at the 4-position to make PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, respectively. Thus, two pathways for the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 can be identified (6.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar): PI can be phosphorylated by PI 4-kinase to PtdIns(4)P and subsequently to PtdIns(4,5)P2 by Type I PIP 5-kinase. An alternative pathway is via phosphorylation of PI to PtdIns(5)P and subsequent phosphorylation by a Type II PIP 4-kinase (see Fig. 6). The enzyme responsible for making PtdIns(5)P could be PIKfyve (7.Sbrissa D. Ikononov O.C. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), although a recent study identifies PIKfyve as a Type III PtdIns(3)P 5-kinase, which specifically phosphorylates PtdIns(3)P to make PtdIns(3,5)P2 (8.McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The Golgi apparatus is an integral component of the secretory pathway. ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) is a small G protein that is localized to the Golgi and is required for Golgi structure and function. One well established function of membrane-bound ARF1 is to recruit a complex of cytosolic proteins collectively known as coatomers, which, upon oligomerization, result in the formation of “COP1”-coated vesicles. Many downstream effectors of ARF1 have been identified; these include a PIP2-dependent phospholipase D (9.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

ARF1 has also been shown to regulate PIP2 levels in cytosol-depleted permeabilized cells (13.Fensome A. Cunningham E. Prosser S. Tan S.K. Swigart P. Thomas G. Hsuan J. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem.

Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the product of phospholipase D. It has therefore been suggested that PIP2 synthesis by ARF1 is indirect and is dependent on phospholipase D activation (13.Fensome A. Cunningham E. Prosser S. Tan S.K. Swigart P. Thomas G. Hsuan J. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggest that ARF1 can stimulate PtdIns(4,5)P2synthesis by mediating the recruitment of PI 4-kinase β and an unidentified PIP 5-kinase from the cytosol to the Golgi complex (15.Godi A. Pertile P. Di Tullio G. Iurisco C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This ability to stimulate PIP2 synthesis was apparently independent of its activities on coat proteins and PLD (15.Godi A. Pertile P. Di Tullio G. Iurisco C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The relationship between ARF and PIP2 is complicated. In addition to stimulating the synthesis of PIP2, ARF1 can directly interact with PIP2 (18.Randazzo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as can the ARF exchange factors and ARF-GTPase activating protein (GAP). Thus, ARNO, the exchange factor for ARF1, has a PH domain that is recognized by PIP2 (19.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and over-expression results in disruption of the Golgi (20.Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ARF-GAP, ASAP1, has a PH domain and is specifically activated by PIP2 in the presence of PA (22.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used Golgi membranes and recombinant PIP kinases to examine the role of ARF1 in PIP2 synthesis. ARF1 was found to increase PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels dramatically by having two effects: it selectively stimulates the activity of the endogenous PI 4-kinase β, and it also directly activates Type I PIP 5-kinase. We conclude that ARF1 has multiple downstream effectors, of which Type I PIP 5-kinase is one. Golgi-enriched membranes were prepared exactly as described (23.Cockcroft S. Taylor J.A. Judah J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and kept at −80 °C until required. In brief, one liver was homogenized in 6 volumes of 250 mm sucrose in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The post-nuclear supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and was layered over a 1.3 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. The primary interface was recovered (see Fig. 5 A), and 1.5 volumes of 2 msucrose were added. This was transferred to a centrifuge tube, overlaid with 1.1, 0.85, and 0.25 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h. Three fractions (F1, F2, and F3) were collected and assayed for galactosyltransferase and ARF-stimulated PLD activity as described previously (24.Morgan C.P. Sengelov H. Whatmore J. Borregaard N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (see Fig.5 A). F1 was highly enriched in galactosyltransferase and is referred to collectively as the Golgi membranes. Cytosol was obtained from pig brain and was kept at −80 °C and used as required. Myristoylated ARF1 was made in Escherichia coliand purified exactly as described previously (25.Jones D.H. Bax B. Fensome A. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Myristoylation was approximately 10% as determined by mass spectroscopy analysis. ARNO was cloned from RBL-2H3 cells and expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein fused to the N terminus, purified by standard techniques. PIP kinases were expressed in E. coli as GST-tagged fusion proteins and purified by standard techniques. The GST was cleaved from the enzyme before use. The Type II enzyme used was the human Type IIα (26.Divecha N. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Hinchliffe K. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the Type I enzyme was murine Type Iα (27.Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,28.Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). ARF1 was recruited to Golgi membranes (2 μg/assay tube) by incubating ARF1 (10 μm) and GTPγS (20 μm) in Buffer A (25 mm Hepes, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgATP, 1.6 mg/ml creatine phosphate, and 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, pH 7.2) for 15 min at 37 °C in an assay volume of 200 μl. Membranes were ultracentrifuged (120000 × g) for 30 min. For determination of phosphoinositide kinase activity, the Golgi membranes (2 μg/assay tube) were incubated for 10 min in Buffer A supplemented with 2 μCi of γ-labeled [32P]ATP at 30 °C in an assay volume of 100 μl final. Cytosol (100 μg), BSA control (100 μg), and recombinant Type I (250 ng) or Type II PIP kinase (625 ng) were also included in the assay as indicated. At the end of the incubation, membranes were quenched with chloroform:methanol, the lipids extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (23.Cockcroft S. Taylor J.A. Judah J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the plates imaged using Fuji phosphorimaging screens. Data were quantitated using AIDA software. For analysis by HPLC, the assay was scaled up between 30–50-fold to obtain enough cpm for HPLC analysis. PIP2 was first isolated by TLC as described above. The PIP2 spot was located by imaging the plates for 2 h and was then excised from the plate. The silica containing the PIP2 was transferred into a tube and the PIP2deacylated by monomethylamine treatment; the glycerol backbone was subsequently removed exactly as described (29.Irvine R.F. Angaard E.E. Letcher A.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The resulting inositol trisphosphates were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on a Partisil 10 SAX column using a gradient of sodium hydrogen phosphate buffers (pH 3.75) (29.Irvine R.F. Angaard E.E. Letcher A.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The peaks were identified by co-elution with3H-labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4)P3. 3H-Labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and the Ins(1,3,4)P3 was prepared from Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (NEN Life Science Products) as described (30.Irvine R.F. Letcher A.J. Lander D.J. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing FLAG-epitope tagged PI 4-kinase α and β were transfected into COS7 cells, and expression was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (4.Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31.Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rapidly growing COS7 cells were trypsinized and harvested, and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated (using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 0.25 V, 125 microfarad) with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μg of herring sperm carrier DNA. Cells were grown for a further 48 h and then harvested, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated in the presence of protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 120,000 × gfor 45 min to separate the membrane and cytosol. Phosphoinositide production was determined as described for Golgi membranes, except that COS7 cell membranes were present at 10 μg/assay tube. Activity was analyzed in 100 μl of Buffer A (but without creatine phosphate and creatine kinase). Lipid vesicles were prepared by sonication to give final concentrations of 80 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine and 8 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in the final assay. When the effect of PA was examined, it was included in the pre-sonication mix so as to give 8 μg/ml in the final assay. All samples also contained 1 mg/ml BSA, 20 μg/ml recombinant rat ARNO, 2 μCi of [32P]ATP as well as 10 μm ARF1 and GTPγS (20 μm). 250 ng of Type I PIP 5-kinase was added, and the tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min unless indicated otherwise. At the end of this time, samples were quenched with chloroform:methanol, and the production of PIP2 was analyzed by TLC. GTPγS binding to ARF1 was measured under identical assay conditions to those described above, except radiolabeled ATP was omitted and 35S-labeled GTPγS (1 μCi) was included. Only 4% of the ARF was GTPγS-loaded, and thus the concentration of active ARF is calculated as 400 nm. We used Golgi membranes from rat liver that have previously been shown to be enriched in PI kinase activity but are devoid of activity that makes PIP2 (23.Cockcroft S. Taylor J.A. Judah J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Golgi membranes were pre-incubated with ARF1 and GTPγS for 15 min to recruit ARF1 to membranes and were subsequently tested for PIP formation. PIP levels in these membranes were nearly double that found in membranes treated with a control protein, with no production of PIP2 (Fig.1). When cytosol is also included during the kinase reaction, PIP2 production is greatly facilitated in membranes pretreated with ARF1/GTPγS compared with no pretreatment or with GTPγS alone. The production of PIP2 only in the presence of cytosol implies that cytosol is the source of the PIP kinases. These data using cytosol as a source of the kinases are similar to those reported by Godi et al. (15.Godi A. Pertile P. Di Tullio G. Iurisco C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), who concluded that ARF1 stimulates the synthesis of PIP2 in Golgi membranes. To examine whether the increase in PIP was due to increased PI 4-kinase activity rather than recruitment, we replaced the cytosol with purified PIP kinases. The addition of Type I or Type II PIP kinases increased the level of PIP2 to a small extent in the untreated Golgi membranes. When Golgi membranes were incubated with ARF1 and GTPγS for 15 min, re-isolated, and incubated with Type I or Type II PIP kinases, PIP2 levels increased considerably in the presence of Type I, but not Type II, PIP 5-kinase. (Fig. 1). To analyze the PIP2 produced by Type I and Type II enzymes, the assay was scaled up. ARF1-pretreated Golgi membranes were incubated with either cytosol, Type I, or Type II PIP kinases, and the PIP2 formed was isolated by TLC. For the experiment using Type II, the scale-up factor had to be much greater, using a higher specific activity of ATP, to obtain sufficient counts for HPLC analysis. The lipids were deacylated and deglycerated to inositol trisphosphates prior to analysis by HPLC. When cytosol was used to generate PIP2, the predominant product was Ins(1,4,5)P3 (derived from PtdIns(4,5)P2) (Fig.2 b). When Type I PIP 5-kinase was substituted for cytosol, the predominant product was again Ins(1,4,5)P3, indicating that PtdIns(4)P must have been phosphorylated by the 5-kinase (Fig. 2 c). When Type II PIP 4-kinase enzyme was used, two isomers of inositol trisphosphates were identified, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4)P3 (Fig.2 d). Thus, Type II enzyme makes both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. These products could be derived only from PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P because Type II enzyme only phosphorylates the inositol at the 4-position. PtdIns(5)P has only recently been identified as a minor component of mammalian cells (6.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Golgi membranes contain a pool of PtdIns(5)P and also a smaller pool of PtdIns(3)P that is available for conversion to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. Alternatively, the relatively smaller size of the PtdIns(3,4)P2 could be because the Type II enzyme is less active toward PtdIns(3)P. Phosphorylation of these minor lipids by Type II PIP 4-kinase is not regulated by ARF1 treatment. In contrast, ARF1 pretreatment leads to an increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2levels, which is derived from PtdIns(4)P phosphorylation by Type I PIP 5-kinase (Fig. 1). ARF1 pretreatment of Golgi has two effects: it increases the activity of an endogenous PI 4-kinase, thus increasing PIP levels, and it causes a dramatic increase in PIP2levels. To identify which PI 4-kinase was regulated by ARF1, we next transfected COS7 cells with FLAG-tagged PI 4-kinase α and β and prepared a crude membrane fraction. PI 4-kinase β was found in both the cytosol and membrane fractions, whereas PI 4-kinase α was mainly membrane-bound. Membranes were examined for ARF1-stimulated PI 4-kinase activity. Despite the expression of PI 4-kinases in the transfected cells (Fig. 3), the incorporation of label into PIP under basal activity was not very different than in untransfected cells. This finding is not surprising, because the p55 enzyme that remains uncloned probably accounts for the bulk of PI 4-kinase activity in most cells (3.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Only membranes prepared from PI 4-kinase β-transfected cells were able to increase their PIP content when incubated with ARF1 and GTPγS (Fig. 3). We confirmed by Western blot analysis that the Golgi membranes used in this study had endogenous PI 4-kinase β (data not shown). To observe whether ARF1 could directly regulate the PI 4-kinase β activity, we immunoprecipitated the PI 4-kinase β from the cytosol using the FLAG-tag and incubated the immunoprecipitate with PI:PC (1:10) vesicles in the presence of ARF1, ARNO and GTPγS. We were unable to show a stimulation of PI 4-kinase β activity by ARF1 in vitro(results not shown); this could be because of incorrect assay conditions or the effect of ARF1 on PI 4-kinase β is indirect. Only in ARF1-pretreated membranes was the Type I PIP 5-kinase able to increase the PIP2 content, despite the presence of PIP in the membranes. The increase in PIP2 stimulated by ARF1 is disproportionate to the increase seen with PIP, suggesting that the increase in PIP2 is not entirely due to the increase in PIP levels. This suggested that ARF1 could be having a direct effect on PIP 5-kinase. We developed an in vitro assay using PC vesicles with 10% PIP to examine this possibility. ARF1, ARNO, and GTPγS were added to these vesicles followed by Type I PIP 5-kinase in the presence of MgATP. ARF1 was able to stimulate PIP 5-kinase activity only when GTPγS or GTP was present (Fig.4 A). The increase in PIP2 was dependent on the amount of ARF1 added to the assay (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, we also purified native ARF proteins from brain cytosol (10.Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), which was also active in stimulating PIP 5-kinase activity (data not shown). Honda et al. (32.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) have recently reported that PIP 5-kinase can also be activated by ARF1 but that this required the presence of PA. In these assay conditions, 50 μm PtdIns(4)P was used as substrate, and PA was added at equimolar concentrations. We therefore examined whether PA also stimulates PIP 5-kinase activity in the in vitro assay used here. The vesicles used here have PC as the major lipid, and PtdIns(4)P is included at 10% of PC. When PA was included at an equimolar concentration to the PtdIns(4)P, no stimulation of PIP 5-kinase was observed. In addition, the ARF-stimulated PIP 5-kinase activity was completely inhibited (Fig.4 C). This result was unexpected, and therefore the assay conditions of Honda et al. (32.Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) were used to confirm that PA alone could be stimulatory, and moreover, ARF-dependent stimulation required the presence of PA (Fig. 4 D). We conclude that the presence of PC inhibits the stimulation of Type I PIP 5-kinase by PA. To further clarify whether PA is required in PIP 5-kinase activation in Golgi membranes, we monitored the level of ARF1-stimulated PLD activity, which would be the source of endogenous PA. Fig.5 A illustrates the protocol for preparing Golgi membranes. The material at the primary interface is used to purify the Golgi-enriched fraction (F1). Measurements of galactosyltransferase (a Golgi marker) and ARF-stimulated PLD activity indicate that the Golgi fraction has only a minor amount of PLD activity (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus the level of PA generated in the Golgi fractions used here is small. To assess whether this PA is a contributory factor to PIP 5-kinase activation by ARF1, butanol was used to divert the PA to phosphatidylbutanol. As a control we used, butan-2-ol, which does not participate in the transphosphatidylation reaction. Fig. 5 D illustrates that ARF1-stimulated PIP2 production was unaffected by the presence of butanol. From our data, we conclude that ARF can directly activate PIP 5-kinase and that PLD-derived PA is not required. This conclusion is supported by three observations. In the in vitro assay used here, PA alone does not activate PIP 5-kinase and potently inhibits ARF1-stimulated PIP 5-kinase activity. Furthermore, Golgi membranes used here that show ARF-stimulated PIP2 production have only minimal ARF-stimulated PLD activity. Finally, butanol (which would remove any PA derived from PLD activity) is without effect on PIP2 production. Whether ARF1 directly regulates PI 4-kinase β still remains to be established. Fig. 6 summarizes the pathways that are likely to be operative at the Golgi and indicates the reactions that are regulated by ARF1. The ability of ARF1 to stimulate an increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels suggests that this lipid has a specific function at this location. A potential function of PIP2 at the Golgi could be in the recruitment of PIP2-binding proteins, which could include spectrin (16.Godi A. Santone I. Pertile P. Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Morrow J.S.

Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), both of which have motifs that recognize PIP2. In addition, PIP2 may also regulate the ARF1 function via its interactions with ARNO, ARF1, and ARF-GAP. Phosphoinositides are also required for secretion from yeast Golgi (34.Hama H. Schnieders E.A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and the yeast PI 4-kinase, Pik1 has been implicated in this. Moreover, it is interesting to note that strains containing a Pik1 mutation exhibit synthetic lethality with mutantarf1 and sec7 alleles (35.Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). PIP2could play a similar function in secretion in the mammalian Golgi. Although the precise requirement for PIP2 at the Golgi still needs to be clarified, it is clear that the need to critically control the levels of PIP2 at this location is essential. The levels of PIP2 at the Golgi are kept in check by a PIP2 5-phosphatase; a deficiency in this enzyme is the cause of Lowe's syndrome (36.Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc.

Recent evidence indicates that SOCS1 interacts with elongins B and C, which are components of a ubiquitin ligase complex, VCB (VHL/elonginC/B), based on the VHL (von Hippel Lindau) tumor suppressor protein. SOCS1 has previously been shown to operate as an inhibitor of Janus kinases. Here we show that SOCS1 has the distinct function of targeting the hematopoietic specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV, for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. VAV and SOCS1 form a protein complex through interactions between the VAV NH2-terminal regulatory region and the SH2 domain of SOCS1 in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. SOCS1 decreases the steady state levels of cotransfected VAV and onco-VAV and reduces the focus forming activity of onco-VAV. SOCS1 stimulates the polyubiquitination of VAV proteins in vivo, which was stabilized by proteasomal inhibitors. These results suggest that SOCS1 programs VAV degradation by acting as a substrate-specific recognition component of a VCB-like ubiquitin ligase complex.

SOCS1 inhibits JAK by binding, via its SH2 domain, to the positive regulatory tyrosine in the kinase domain activation helix (2.Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K.

Although SOCS1 also binds to the receptor tyrosine kinases Kit and Flt3, it does not suppress the kinase activity of these receptors (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, SOCS1 potently blocks KIT- and FLT3-induced proliferation, suggesting that SOCS1 may modulate signaling through a mechanism distinct from kinase inhibition (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition to its interaction with receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, SOCS1 binds to the hematopoietic-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). VAV contains several modular protein domains including an NH2-terminal calponin homology (CH), an acidic region, a Dbl-homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a cysteine-rich region, and two SH3 domains flanking an SH2 domain (reviewed in Ref. 10.Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar and references therein). VAV converts inactive Rac-GDP into active Rac-GTP, which in turn regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and the activation of the c-junNH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38HOG. VAV exchange factor activity is stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation following antigen and cytokine receptor activation. VAV activity is also enhanced by its relocalization to the plasma membrane through interaction of its pleckstrin homology domain with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Deletion of the VAV NH2-terminal sequences renders VAV oncogenic (11.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). VAV is negatively regulated by its NH2-terminal sequences (12.Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) through an unknown mechanism. Here, we provide evidence that SOCS1 binds to the NH2 terminus of VAV and stimulates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. NIH 3T3, COS7, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Plasmid pCMV-VAV was constructed by inserting murine VAV cDNA in the vector pFlag-CMV-5b (Kodak). pEF-VAV and pEF-onco-VAV were gifts from Dr. A. Altman (San Diego). pMT3-SOCS1 expresses hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged murine SOCS1 from the CMV promoter (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A point mutation, R105K, within the SH2 domain of SOCS1 abolishes its ability to bind phosphotyrosine residues (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). pEF-SOCS1 was provided by T. Kishimoto (13.Narazaki M. Fujimoto M. Matsumoto T. Morita Y. Saito H. Kajita T. Yoshizaki K.

Hilton (14.Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). RasV12 was expressed from the plasmid pT22 (15.Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). The HA-ubiquitin construct in pMT123 was from D. Bohmann (16.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). HA-SOCS1 was detected using either a rabbit polyclonal anti-serum raised against SOCS1 (aa 1–172) (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 as indicated in the figures. Rabbit polyclonal anti-VAV antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 was from Sigma. 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36–48 h, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described earlier (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For foci forming assays, 1.5 × 105 NIH 3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected 24 h later by calcium phosphate method with plasmids expressing onco-VAV in the presence or absence of SOCS1 along with 5 μg of mouse genomic DNA as carrier. The cells were fixed 10–14 days post-transfection in 10% formaldehyde for 10 min and stained overnight with 0.02% Giemsa stain. COS7 cells transfected with VAV or onco-VAV in the presence or absence of SOCS1 were washed 36–48 h after transfection and incubated in Cys- and Met-free DMEM (ICN). After 30 min, the medium was replaced with Cys, Met- free DMEM containing 2.5% dialysed calf serum and 100 μCi/ml Trans35S-labelTM (ICN, Specific activity 1175 Ci/mmol) to label the newly synthesized proteins. Following 20 min of labeling, the dishes were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in chase medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10-fold molar excess of Cys and Met). At the end of the indicated chase period, the cells were washed and lysed. The immunoprecipitated VAV or onco-VAV proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, were detected by autoradiography and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In vivoubiquitination was performed essentially as described by Marti et al. (17.Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing VAV, HA-SOCS1, and HA-ubiquitin. After 36–48 h, the cells were washed, lysed in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), boiled, and diluted 10-fold before immunoprecipitation with anti-VAV antibody. Proteasomal inhibitor epoxomycin (Affinity, Exeter, UK) was added during the final 8 h before lysis. An aliquot of the diluted lysate was used to monitor the ubiquitination of total cellular proteins and the expression of SOCS1. Ubiquitinated VAV was detected with anti-HA antibody. To identify proteins that interact with SOCS1, we used the full-length murine SOCS1 cDNA as a bait to screen a cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system and isolated a clone encoding the NH2-terminal region of VAV (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine which region of SOCS1 is involved in this interaction, the NH2 terminus of SOCS1 (aa 1–79), the central SH2 domain (aa 64–172) or the COOH terminus (aa 168–212) were expressed as LexA fusion proteins along with VP16-VAV in yeast. The isolated SOCS1 SH2 domain bound to VAV at levels similar to that of full-length SOCS1, whereas neither the NH2- nor the COOH-terminal regions of SOCS1 were sufficient to mediate VAV binding (not shown). To confirm the VAV-SOCS1 interaction in mammalian cells, HA-tagged SOCS1 was cotransfected with full-length murine VAV cDNA into 293T cells, and coimmunoprecipitation was analyzed by Western blotting. VAV was detected in SOCS1 immune complexes derived from cells transfected with both cDNAs but not from cells transfected with VAV or HA-SOCS1 alone (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, SOCS1 was detected in VAV immunoprecipitates (data not shown). We then tested whether SOCS1 could bind to onco-VAV, an activated form of VAV that lacks the first 67 residues of the wild type protein (11.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). SOCS1 coprecipitated onco-VAV, indicating that the NH2-terminal sequences deleted in onco-VAV are not required for the SOCS1 interaction. To determine whether the VAV acidic domain was sufficient for SOCS1 binding, GST fusion proteins containing the entire NH2 terminus or the minimal acidic domain (aa 116–199) were expressed and used as affinity reagents. Both constructs were capable of binding to SOCS1 from cell lysates, whereas the entire NH2-terminal polypeptide (aa 1–199) failed to bind to a control protein (Fig. 1 C). These results were recapitulated using the yeast two-hybrid assay in which the acidic domain of VAV (aa 116–199) interacted with SOCS1 (data not shown). The interaction of VAV and SOCS1 in yeast suggested that the interaction did not require phosphotyrosine modification as has been reported for other SH2-containing proteins (18.Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 19.Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Geha R. Roncarolo M.G. Oettgen H. De Vries J.E. Aversa G. Terhorst C. Nature. 1998; 395: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, VAV was coprecipitated with a mutant SOCS1 (Fig.1 A, lane 6) that is unable to bind to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins as a result of R105K susbstitution in the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket of the SH2 domain (5.De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that SOCS1 SH2 binds to the acidic region of VAV in a phosphotyrosine-independent fashion. To determine a functional interaction between SOCS1 and VAV proteins, the effect of SOCS1 was tested on the foci forming ability of onco-VAV in NIH 3T3 cells (11.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of SOCS1 reduced foci formation by 50-fold (Fig. 2), whereas SOCS3, the most closely related SOCS family member, did not alter the number of foci. Consistent with the fact that the R105K mutation in SOCS1 did not affect VAV binding, the oncogenic potential of onco-VAV was inhibited by the cotransfected SOCS1-R105K. The effect of SOCS1 on VAV was specific, since SOCS1 did not attenuate the transformation induced by the activated Ras protein RasV12 (Fig. 2). During the course of these experiments, we observed that the steady state levels of transfected VAV and onco-VAV were diminished when coexpressed with SOCS1. This effect was more pronounced in COS7 cells than in 293T cells and was dependent on the dose of cotransfected SOCS1 plasmid (Fig.3 A and data not shown). The capacity of SOCS1 to alter VAV protein expression was specific because other SOCS family proteins, SOCS2 or SOCS3, had no effect on the level of VAV expression (Fig. 3 B). To assess the effects of SOCS1 on VAV protein turnover, COS7 cells were tranfected with VAV in the presence or absence of SOCS1. Metabolically 35S-labeled VAV and onco-VAV immunoprecipitated after various chase times were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography (Fig.3 C). We observed that onco-VAV had an extended half-life (5.2 h) compared with VAV (1.4 h) and that in both cases SOCS1 increased the rate of degradation of VAV proteins. In the presence of SOCS1, the measured half-life of onco-VAV was 1.2 h and of VAV was 0.5 h. A number of signaling proteins have been shown to be down-regulated through proteolytic degradation pathways involving the ubiquitin and the 26S proteasome machinery (20.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6897) Google Scholar). To test for whether SOCS1 might influence ubiquitination of VAV, we expressed HA-tagged ubiquitin together with VAV and SOCS1 in COS7 cells. Western blotting the immunoprecipitated VAV with anti-HA antibody showed that co-expression of SOCS1 results in a marked increase of VAV ubiquitination (Fig.4 A, top panel). Probing whole cell lysates with the anti-HA antibody revealed comparable levels of total ubiquitinated proteins in cells expressing SOCS1 and ubiquitin (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel). Similar results were obtained for onco-VAV (data not shown). Further, the addition of the proteasomal inhibitor epoxomycin resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitinated VAV (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that SOCS1 couples VAV to the ubiquitination machinery and targets the ubiquitinated VAV to proteasomal degradation. In this report we ascribe a new mechanism whereby the SOCS1 protein negatively regulates the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor by facilitating its degradation. This inhibitory function is distinct from its role as an inhibitor of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Insight into the mechanism by which SOCS1 targets VAV for ubiquitination and destruction comes from the recent finding that SOCS1 and SOCS3 interact with the elongin BC complex (21.Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 22.Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M.

Elongin BC also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein VHL to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex called VCB (VHL/elonginC/B) (23.Lisztwan J. Imbert G. Wirbelauer C. Gstaiger M. Krek W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1822-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24.Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

VHL binds to elongin C through an intermolecular four-helical bundle structure formed from one helix of elongin C and the three helices donated by VHL (25.Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The VHL α-helices that bind to elongin C are present as homologous structures contained within the COOH-terminal SOCS box of SOCS1 and all other SOCS family proteins (4.Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

VHL functions as an adapter molecule recruiting specific proteins fated for ubiquitin-mediated degradation such as the hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF-1α, to the VCB E3 ligase (26.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). We propose that different SOCS box proteins have a function similar to VHL and recruit distinct sets of protein substrates such as VAV to the VCB-like E3 ligase complexes, where the substrates are ubiquitinated and targeted to proteasomal degradation. In support of this notion, another SOCS family protein, CIS, appears to suppress erythropoietin signaling by binding to the activated erythropoietin receptor and targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (27.Verdier F.

It remains to be seen whether other SOCS1-binding proteins such as JAK, KIT, GRB2, p85, or ITK are similarly ubiquitinated and destabilized by SOCS1. Two other proteins that have been reported to negatively regulate VAV function are Cbl-b and hSIAH2 (28.Bustelo X.R. Crespo P. Lopez-Barahona M. Gutkind J.S. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29.Germani A. Romero F. Houlard M. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Varin-Blank N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). VAV can bind to both c-Cbl and Cbl-b through its COOH-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 region (28.Bustelo X.R. Crespo P. Lopez-Barahona M. Gutkind J.S. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments have shown that Cbl-b inhibits onco-VAV-mediated activation of JNK (28.Bustelo X.R. Crespo P. Lopez-Barahona M. Gutkind J.S. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). c-Cbl has recently been defined as an E3 ligase that promotes ligand-induced ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor (30.Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The role of the Cbl family in regulating VAV protein turnover has not yet been examined. hSIAH2, a RING-finger containing human homolog of Drosophila Seven in absentia (SINA), binds to the COOH-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 region of VAV and inhibits onco-VAV-induced activation of JNK (29.Germani A. Romero F. Houlard M. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Varin-Blank N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). hSIAH2 appears to be a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein complex that targets the tumor suppressor protein DCC and the N-CoR protein (31.Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L. Xu T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 32.Zhang J. Guenther M.G. Carthew R.W. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Unlike SOCS1, however, coexpression of hSIAH2 with VAV does not destabilize VAV (29.Germani A. Romero F.

In this report, we have provided evidence for a novel function of SOCS1 to recruit signaling molecules such as VAV via dedicated protein-protein interaction domains for ubiquitin-mediated protein destruction. Validation of this model will require in vitroreconstitution of the ubiquitin ligase activity of the VAV-SOCS-VCB-like complex using recombinant components. We thank D. Hilton, B. Zanke, J. R.

To this end, we comparedCCR5 structure/evolution and regulation among humans, apes, Old World Monkeys, and New World Monkeys. The evolution of theCCR5 cis-regulatory region versus the open reading frame as well as among different domains of the open reading frame differed from one another. CCR5 cis-regulatory region sequence variation in humans was substantially higher than anticipated. Based on this variation, CCR5 haplotypes could be organized into seven evolutionarily distinct human haplogroups (HH) that we designated HHA, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -G. HHA haplotypes were defined as ancestral to all other haplotypes by comparison to theCCR5 haplotypes of non-human primates. Different human and non-human primate CCR5 haplotypes were associated with differential transcriptional regulation, and various polymorphisms resulted in modified DNA-nuclear protein interactions, including altered binding of members of the NF-κB family of transcription factors. We identified novel CCR5 untranslated mRNA sequences that were conserved in human and non-human primates. In some primates, mutations at exon-intron boundaries caused loss of expression of selected CCR5 mRNA isoforms or production of novel mRNA isoforms. Collectively, these findings suggest that the response to HIV-1 and SIV infection in primates may have been driven, in part, by evolution of the elements controlling CCR5 transcription and translation.

Yet, despite their common ancestry and close similarity, HIVs and SIVs differ significantly with regard to clinical disease and pathogenesis. Human infection with HIVs results in a progressive immunodeficiency syndrome, whereas African apes and monkeys (e.g. African Green monkeys (AGM)) infected with SIV exhibit no evidence of disease (7.Allan J.S.

These differences in pathogenicity may be due, in part, to primate species-specific variation in the genes controlling the host response or expression of host HIV/SIV entry factors (10.Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the evolution and factors that control the expression of these genes in primates will be an important step towards identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of primates to infections with SIVs and HIVs. In turn, this may illuminate potential strategies that could be used to mitigate or prevent infection with HIV-1. An important host genetic determinant of HIV-1 pathogenesis is polymorphisms in the open reading frame (ORF) andcis-regulatory region of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a major coreceptor for the entry of HIV and SIV (reviewed in Refs. 10.Unutmaz D. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and11.Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). These polymorphisms could potentially influence cell-surface density of CCR5 and thus have an impact on HIV/SIV pathogenesis. For example, homozygosity for a 32-bp deletion in CCR5 ORF leads to loss of surface expression and profound resistance against HIV-1 infection (12.Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R. Horuk R. MacDonald M.E. Stuhlmann H. Koup R.A. Landau N.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2569) Google Scholar). Similarly, a 24-bp deletion in the CCR5 ORF that was discovered in selected non-human primates might influence SIV pathogenesis (13.Chen Z. Kwon D. Jin Z. Monard S. Telfer P. Jones M.S. Lu C.Y. Aguilar R.F. Ho D.D. Marx P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, we and others (14.Martin M.P. Dean M. Smith M.W. Winkler C. Gerrard B.

Lancet. 1998; 352: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) have shown that polymorphisms in the cis-regulatory region of human CCR5 are also associated with altered rates of disease progression and transmission. Thus, due to this close interaction with the lentiviral life cycle, CCR5 is an excellent candidate for exploring whether differences in its gene/RNA structure and regulation account, in part, for the differential pathogenesis of HIV and SIV. Additional interest in analyzing host-specific differences in CCR5 regulation at the gene and RNA level is spurred by the observation that despite having nearly identical CCR5 coding regions, Asian macaques (e.g.Pig-tailed macaques (PTM)) but not AGMs infected experimentally with SIV become symptomatic (reviewed in Refs. 1.Allan J.S. J. NIH Res. 1992; 4: 51-54Google Scholar, 18.Norley S. Kurth R. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1997; 18: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, and 19.Overbaugh J. Luciw P.A. Hoover E.A. AIDS. 1997; 11: 47-54Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Given that the differential pathogenicity of AGMs and PTMs to SIV is very reminiscent of the differential pathogenicity of HIV and SIV, studies aimed at dissecting the genetic basis for this differential pathogenicity might provide additional insights into the varied susceptibility to HIV-1 infection among humans. The gene and RNA structure of human CCR5 is complex. We have demonstrated that alternative splicing in the 5′-untranslated regions (UTR) of CCR5 generates several distinct mRNA isoforms that are under the control of at least two distinct promoters (20.Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. McDaniel B.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30662-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 5′-UTR of CCR5 is encompassed within thesecis-regulatory regions that contain several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with altered rates of HIV-1 disease progression (14.Martin M.P. Dean M. Smith M.W. Winkler C. Gerrard B. Michael N.L. Lee B. Doms R.W. Margolick J. Buchbinder S. Goedert J.J. O'Brien T.R. Hilgartner M.W. Vlahov D. O'Brien S.J. Carrington M.

Lancet. 1998; 352: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, polymorphisms in the noncoding region of CCR5 could influence not onlycis-trans interactions that impact on gene expression but also CCR5 mRNA stability and/or the efficiency of translation. Given the multiple levels at which CCR5 expression could be regulated, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the ORF, mRNA structure, and transcriptional regulatory units of CCR5 relative to four important events in human evolution (21.Goodman M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar): the divergence of humans from chimpanzees 6 million years ago, from the Orang-Utan lineage 15 million years ago, from the cercopithecoids (Old World monkeys (OWM)) ∼35 million years ago, and from New World monkeys (NWM) 50 million years ago. Results from these analyses enabled us to build the evolutionary framework needed to define the relationships among humanCCR5 haplotypes that influence HIV-1 pathogenesis. This evolutionary framework facilitated greatly our ability to determine the influence of CCR5 haplotypes on HIV-1 transmission and disease progression (16.Gonzalez E. Bamshad M. Sato N. Mummidi S.

Additionally, we were able to test directly the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the human and non-human primatecis-regulatory region of CCR5 confer differences in transcriptional efficiencies and/or interact with differenttrans-acting factors or to the same transcription factor but with varying avidity.

However, since we had identified additional 5′-UTR sequences (Fig. 2), and to maintain uniformity in the numbering systems used by different investigators, it was proposed at the CCR5-AIDS symposium 3The CCR5-AIDS Symposium was held April 20, 1999, at the NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD. to designate the first nucleotide of the CCR5 translational start site as +1 and the nucleotide immediately upstream as −1 (22.Carrington M. Dean M. Martin M.P. O'Brien S.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It was also proposed at this meeting to change the numbering system for CCR5 noncoding exons that we had identified previously (20.Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. McDaniel B.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol.

The region corresponding to human CCR5 −2761 to −1835 was PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced on both strands from the following primates (the number of different members of the given non-human species that were sequenced are shown in parentheses): P. troglodytes (n= 4); G. gorilla; P. pygmaeus; P. hamadryas anubis (n = 3); M. mulatta(n = 2); M. fascicularis; M. nemestrina; C. torquatus torquatus (red-capped mangabey); C. galeritus chrysogaster (gold-bellied mangabey); C. guereza; C. guereza kikuyuensis(Kikuyu colobus); Cercopithecus petaurista (lesser spot-nosed guenon); C. neglectus; C. diana (Diana guenon); C. l'hoesti; C.(Miopithecus) talapoin (Talapoin); C.

A single allele per non-human primate was sequenced. For Homo sapiens, 60 alleles were sequenced, and they were derived from individuals with different genotypes, including those who were homozygous or heterozygous for −2733A or −2733G, −2135C or −2135T, −1835T or −1835C (15.Mummidi S.

The PCR protocol used to amplify the human and non-human primate CCR5 cis-regions and the ORF was identical.

Genotyping methods for the CCR5 polymorphisms were described previously (15.Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. Gonzalez E. Anderson S.A. Santiago E.N. Stephan K.T. Craig F.E. O'Connell P. Tryon V. Clark R.A.

Total RNA from human and non-human primate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and human leukocyte subsets was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed on a human leukocyte cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using an exon 2B-specific primer (ggg aac gga tgt ctc agc tct tct) according to the manufacturer's protocols.

All RT-PCR reactions were run with a negative control that included no cDNA template. To study the differences between theCCR5 promoter activity of sabaeus AGM and that of humans, we constructed a series of firefly luciferase-sabaeus (S1 to S5) and human (H1 to H5) CCR5 promoter constructs in the promoterless pGL3Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A single sabaeus haplotype and a haplotype representative of CCR5 human haplogroup (HH)-A (16.Gonzalez E. Bamshad M. Sato N. Mummidi S. Dhanda R. Catano G. Cabrera S. McBride M. Cao X.H. Merrill G.

The constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK), human erythroleukemia (K562), and AGM kidney (COS) cell lines and tested for luciferase reporter activity, as described previously (20.Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. McDaniel B.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30662-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To study differences in promoter activity exhibited by the cis-regulatory regions of human CCR5 haplotypes, the genomic region spanning −2761 to −1814 was PCR-amplified from haplotypes corresponding to HHA, HHC, HHE, HHF, or HHG (16.Gonzalez E.

Transfection into K562 and Jurkat cell lines and dual luciferase assays were as described previously (20.Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. McDaniel B.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30662-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For all promoter activity analyses, at least two different plasmid preparations were used, and the DNA in each plasmid preparation was quantified spectrophotometrically twice. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to compare the mean luciferase activity between homologous sabaeus and human promoter constructs. Statistical analysis to determine the differences in the mean luciferase activity among human CCR5 promoter alleles was by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Scheffe's post hoc test. All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained as described previously (20.Mummidi S. Ahuja S.S. McDaniel B.L. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30662-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from K562, THP-1 (human monocyte), Jurkat (human T-cells), and COS cell lines, according to standard protocols (25.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins from PHA-stimulated human PBMCs were extracted according to the procedure of Schreiber et al. (26.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaftner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Prior to nuclear protein extraction, human PBMCs were stimulated for 3 h with phorbol myristic acid (25 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml). PBMCs from SIV-uninfected sabaeus AGM and vervet AGM were stimulated with 10 μg/ml PHA for 2 days and were maintained in culture for 11 days in the presence of 10% human IL-2 (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD) before extracting the nuclear proteins. Nuclear extracts from similarly PHA/IL-2-treated human PBMCs served as controls for the EMSA experiments that used sabaeus/vervet PHA-blast nuclear extracts. The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides used in EMSAs are shown in TableI. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 10 min on ice prior to adding the labeled probe. The specificity of the binding reactions was confirmed by using nonspecific double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors. For supershift experiments, the indicated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated with the nuclear extracts and the radiolabeled probes for 45 min at room temperature prior to electrophoretic resolution of the complexes. Densitometry analysis of the EMSA gels was performed with the NIH Image software package (version 1.61).Table INucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides used in EMSAsOligonucleotideNucleotide sequenceCCR5−2733A>Gatc tgg agt gaa g (A/G) a tcc tgc cacCCR5 −2554G>Tttt aga caa cag gtt (G/T) ttt ccg ttt aca gagCCR5 −2459G>Agtg gag aaa aag ggg (G/A) cac agg gtt aat gtgCCR5 −2135T>C and −2132C>Tagc ccg taa ata aac (C/T) tt (C/T) aga cca gag atc tatCCR5−2086A>Gaag ctc aac tta aaa (A/G) gaa gaa ctg ttc tctCCR5 −1835C>Tgga aac cca tag aag a (C/T) att tgg caa aca cCCR5 OWM −2554Gttt aga caa cag gtt gtt ttc gtt tac gga gCCR5 NWM-1 −2554Gttc aga caa ttg gtt gtt tta gtt tac aga gCCR5 NWM-2 −2554Gttc aga caa ccg gtt gtt tta gtt tac aga gNF-κB consensusagt tga ggg gac ttt ccc agg cSP1att cga tcg ggg cgg ggc gag cIRF-1gga agc gaa aat gaa att gac tPEA3/ETS-1gat ctc gag cag gaa gtt cgac-MYBtac agg cat aac ggt tcc gta gtg ac/EBPαtgc aga ttg cgc aat ctg caAP-3cag tta ggg tgt gga aag tcc ccg aga tOnly the sequence of the sense oligonucleotides is shown.

One of the RSF subunits is hSNF2h, a SNF2 homologue. Here we set out to isolate and characterize other hSNF2h-containing complexes. We have identified a novel hSNF2h complex that facilitates ATP-dependent chromatin assembly with the histone chaperone NAP-1. The complex possesses ATPase activity that is DNA-dependent and nucleosome-stimulated. This complex is capable of facilitating ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and transcription initiation from chromatin templates. In addition to hSNF2h, this complex also contains a 190-kDa protein encoded by the BAZ1A gene. Since both subunits are homologues of the Drosophila ACF complex (ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor), we have named this factorhuman ACF or hACF.

Rich A. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1989Crossref Google Scholar). The primary unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, composed of 147 bp1 of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins (2.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). In general, the majority of nucleosomes throughout the genome are evenly spaced with a repeat length of ∼190 bp (3.Noll M. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar); however, variations in repeat lengths at particular genes have been observed (4.Spadafora C. Bellard M. Compton J.L. Chambon P. FEBS Lett. 1976; 69: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes within arrays stack along with accessory proteins to form higher order structures (5.Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function. Second Ed. London Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). The packaging of DNA into chromatin allows for efficient storage of genetic information, although this compaction impedes the interaction of proteins with DNA. In the nucleus there are machinery's that facilitate the mobility of nucleosomes and aid proteins to bind to their sites on DNA (6.Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1999; 99: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Through genetic and biochemical studies several of these enzymes have been identified from different organisms. They include the SWI/SNF complexes in yeast, human, and Drosophila; the RSC complex in yeast; the RSF complex in human; the Mi-2/NuRD complexes in human and Xenopus; the ACF, CHRAC, and NURF complexes inDrosophila; and the ISWI1 and ISWI2complexes in yeast. A common property of these enzymes is that they utilize ATP to facilitate the mobility and/or alter the structure of nucleosomes. All of these enzymes contain a subunit with an ATPase/helicase domain with significant homology to yeast SNF2 (6.Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1999; 99: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J.

Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar).In vitro, it has been demonstrated that many of these enzymes are capable of facilitating a local perturbation of chromatin structure near the binding sites for site-specific factors, which is dependent on the binding of the site-specific factors and ATP. This phenomenon is referred to as “nucleosome-remodeling.” Nucleosome-remodeling surrounding factor binding sites explains why “nuclease-hypersensitive” sites are found in the enhancer and promoter regions of active genes (10.Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also demonstrated that nucleosome-remodeling enzymes can participate in transcription from chromatin templates (11.LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 12.Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T.

Cell. 1997; 1: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that while some of these enzymes can be recruited by directly interacting with the site-specific binding factors, others may function by altering the mobility of nucleosomes (7.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 15.Yudkovsky N. Logie C. Hahn S. Peterson C.L.

Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The ability to alter nucleosome mobility explains why some of these enzymes are capable of spacing nucleosomes. It has been demonstrated that theDrosophila CHRAC and ACF complexes, human RSF complex, and yeast ISWI complexes are capable of converting irregularly spaced chromatin into arrays of periodically spaced nucleosomes. In combination with the histone chaperone NAP-1, which deposits histones onto DNA in an ATP-independent manner, these enzymes can assemble chromatin that resembles physiologic conditions (8.Tsukiyama T. Palmer J. Landel C.C. Shiloach J. Wu C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 686-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 11.LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D.

Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the development of a minimal defined system capable of transcribing chromatin templates (11.LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19.Orphanides G. Wu W.H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This system requires a nucleosome-remodeling enzyme to facilitate factor binding and transcription initiation. The nucleosome-remodeling factor that we used was RSF, an enzyme possessing ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and spacing activities. RSF is composed of two subunits, hSNF2h (135 kDa) and a 325-kDa polypeptide. This system also requires a chromatin-specific elongation factor, FACT (facilitateschromatin transcription) for RNA polymerase II to traverse nucleosomes during elongation. FACT is a two-subunit factor composed of a human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt16/Cdc68 protein and the HMG-1-like protein SSRP1. FACT does not require ATP for energy and is thought to function as a histone chaperone (19.Orphanides G. Wu W.H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation of a novel hSNF2h complex, distinct from RSF. This complex also contains a 190-kDa protein encoded by BAZ1A, a recently identified gene with similarity to the WSTF gene, a gene deleted in Williams Syndrome (20.Lu X. Meng X. Morris C.A. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1998; 54: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21.Jones M.H. Hamana N. Nezu J. Shimane M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). BAZ1A stands for bromodomainadjacent to zinc finger domain1A. BAZ1A and WSTF are human homologues of Acf1 the 185-kDa subunit of theDrosophila ACF complex, which also containsDrosophila ISWI (22.Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We therefore named this complex human ACF (hACF). Similar to Drosophila ACF and human RSF, the hACF complex also possesses ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and spacing activities. Like RSF, in combination with FACT, this complex is also capable of supporting transcription from chromatin templates in a defined system. Approximately 7.0 grams of HeLa nuclear extract were applied to 500 ml of phosphocellulose (Sigma) resin equilibrated in BC100 as described in Ref. 23.Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar. The proteins were step-eluted with 0.3 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0m KCl washes. The hSNF2h polypeptide eluted in the 1.0m fraction with ∼10% of the total protein. This fraction was dialyzed against BC100 and then loaded on a 150-ml DEAE-52 (Whatman) column. The column was eluted with 0.3 m KCl and 0.5 m KCl washes. The hSNF2h protein eluted in the 0.3m KCl fraction with half of the total protein. This fraction was dialyzed against buffer C containing 1.0 m(NH4)2SO4, loaded onto a 55-ml phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fast protein liquid chromatography column and eluted with a linear gradient from 1.0 to 0m (NH4)2SO4. The hACF complex eluted between 0.3 and 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4. The hSNF2h-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C containing 0.08m (NH4)2SO4, applied to a 38-ml DEAE-5PW high-performance liquid chromatography column (TosoHaas), and eluted with a linear gradient from 0.08 to 0.4m (NH4)2SO4. The hSNF2h protein eluted between 0.12 and 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C containing 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4 and was loaded onto a 1-ml DEAE-52 column equilibrated in the same buffer. The hSNF2h protein did not bind to the column; it was recovered in the column flow-through, while half of the total protein bound to the column. The DEAE-52 flow-through fraction was loaded directly onto a 1-ml phosphocellulose column and eluted with buffer C containing 1.0m KCl. This fraction was then directly loaded onto a Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column previously equilibrated in buffer C containing 0.5 m KCl. The hACF complex eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 300–400 kDa. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described in Ref. 24.Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar. Monoclonal antibodies used for hSNF2h and RSF p325 were raised by Bios-Chile I.G.S.A. against the purified RSF complex selecting for hybridomas that produced antibodies against the separate subunits. The immunoprecipitations were washed with BC500 buffer C containing 0.5 m KCl and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The input used for the RSF immunoprecipitation was derived from the third step of RSF purification as described in Ref. 11.LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar. The input used for hACF immunoprecipitation was from the phenyl-Sepharose. Recombinant (6×) histidine-tagged Drosophila NAP-1 was expressed from baculovirus in SF9 cells. The protein was purified by standard nickel affinity purification. Reconstituted chromatin assembly assays were performed by incubating 2 μg of plasmid DNA (pG5MLP), 1.9 μg of purified HeLa core histones, 150 μg of bovine serum albumin, 3 mm ATP, 30 mm phosphocreatine, 0.2 μg of phosphocreatine kinase, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol (v/v) and 100 ng of purified hACF at 30 °C for 5–6 h. After assembly the samples were split and digested with two different concentrations of micrococcal nuclease, deproteinated, run on a 1.2% agarose Tris-glycine gel, Southern blotted with a probe with sequence corresponding to the β-galactosidase gene on the plasmid. Chromatin was assembled with Drosophila S-190 extract as described in Ref. 25.Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar with 3 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μg of HeLa-purified histones in a 400-μl volume. The plasmid DNA contains five GAL4 sites upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter followed by a 390-nucleotide G-less cassette. Chromatin was Sarkosyl-treated (0.05%) and purified away from the assembly extract as described in Ref. 23.Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D.

This assay uses periodically spaced nucleosomal templates assembled inDrosophila S190 extract, which have been Sarkosyl-treated and purified by gel filtration chromatography. The templates contain five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter. After incubating the chromatin templates with various combinations of ATP, GAL4-VP16, hACF, or RSF, the chromatin was digested with two different concentrations of micrococcal nuclease. The products were then analyzed by Southern blotting with probes within the vicinity of the promoter (promoter probe), stripped, and reprobed with a probe corresponding to a region 1000 base pairs away from the promoter (distal probe). Nucleosome remodeling is observed by a loss of periodic nucleosome spacing. The reconstituted chromatin transcription assay used was performed as described in (11.LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S.

Using antibodies to both subunits of RSF, we were able to find a fraction that contained hSNF2h, but was devoid of p325. We therefore set out to isolate a hSNF2h-containing complex from this fraction. Proteins were fractionated using a series of conventional chromatography columns as depicted in Fig. 1 A. Each step was assayed by Western blot analysis for the hSNF2h protein. The final step of purification, a Superose 6 gel filtration column, is shown in Fig. 1 B. The hSNF2h protein copurifies with a 190-kDa polypeptide, that together eluted with a native molecular mass of 300–400 kDa, suggesting that they form a heterodimer. We identified the 190-kDa polypeptide and confirmed the identity of hSNF2h by sequencing peptides generated by in-gel tryptic digestion with microcapillary high-performance liquid chromatography directly coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (11.LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences revealed that the 190-kDa polypeptide is BAZ1A, a newly identified protein with homology to Drosophila Acf1 (21.Jones M.H. Hamana N. Nezu J. Shimane M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To further analyze whether the hSNF2h protein is in two distinct complexes, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with hSNF2h-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 C). We used two different fractions for the immunoprecipitations, a crude but hSNF2h-enriched fraction that also contains RSF p325 or a crude but hSNF2h-enriched fraction devoid of RSF p325. When we used the crude fraction that contains RSF p325 (lane 1), we were able to coimmunoprecipitate both RSF subunits, p325, and hSNF2h (lane 3). When we used the crude fraction that is devoid of RSF (lane 4), we were able to coimmunoprecipitate both hACF subunits; the 190-kDa polypeptide (BAZ1A) and hSNF2h (lane 6). No polypeptides were observed in the control lanes where no antibody was used (lanes 2 and 5). The identity of RSF p325 polypeptide and the hSNF2h polypeptide were confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1 C, bottom panel). To determine whether hACF has nucleosome-spacing activity, we performed a chromatin assembly assay (Fig.2 A). Chromatin assembly was monitored by micrococcal nuclease digestion. As shown in lane 3, the presence of ATP, hACF, and dNAP-1, yielded nucleosome arrays with regular periodic spacing. In the absence of hACF or ATP, no appreciable arrays with periodic spacing were observed (lanes 2 and 4). To characterize the ATPase activity of hACF, we performed an ATPase assay in the presence of either sonicated calf thymus DNA (200–400 bp), mononucleosomes, or HeLa core histones. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the hACF complex possesses DNA-dependent ATPase activity that is further stimulated by nucleosomes (6.8-fold when compared with DNA). We next tested the hACF complex for ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling activity. hACF exhibits ATP-dependent and activator-dependent nucleosome-remodeling (Fig.3 A). The remodeling is specific for the promoter region, because reprobing with a distal probe revealed regular periodic nucleosome spacing. Like RSF, hACF does not require an activation domain, because GAL4-(1–94), which lacks an activation domain, was also capable of directing nucleosome remodeling to the promoter region (data not shown). Next, we tested hACF for its ability to allow the accessibility of transcription factors to chromatin templates using a reconstituted chromatin transcription assay. We have previously defined the requirement for a remodeling factor in our reconstituted chromatin transcription assays. The reconstituted transcription assay consists of the purified recombinant factors TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, PC4, GAL4-VP16; the affinity-purified multisubunit factors TFIID, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II; and highly purified FACT. The purified chromatin used for transcription assays was prepared in the same way as chromatin prepared for remodeling assays. As shown in Fig. 3 B, robust transcription is facilitated in the presence of hACF and FACT from chromatin templates (lane 6). Transcription is greatly stimulated in the presence of an activator (lane 5). Transcription is severely compromised in the absence of either of these factors (lanes 4 and 7). Our results indicate that the hSNF2h protein exists in at least two distinct complexes, the RSF complex and the hACF complex. Based on purification yields we estimate that there are approximately equal amounts of RSF and hACF in the cell. We believe that the abundance and redundancy of these enzymes is related to their function. In the nucleus, nucleosomes need to be fluid, so they can reorganize during and after factor binding or any DNA metabolism events. Since both RSF and hACF share the same ATPase subunit, the larger subunits, which make each complex unique, must specialize their function. The hACF complex is homologous to Drosophila ACF in both composition and function. It remains unknown whether there is an analogous complex to RSF in Drosophila. We had predicted in our previous publication that the Drosophila ACF complex would be able to substitute for RSF in our reconstituted chromatin transcription assays (11.LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Here we show that hACF is capable of fulfilling the requirement for a nucleosome-remodeling factor in the reconstituted chromatin transcription assays. Another complex, purified from Drosophila is CHRAC (chromatin accessibility complex), which also contains the ISWI protein in addition to topoisomerase II and three other polypeptides (29.Varga-Weisz P.D. Wilm M. Bonte E. Dumas K. Mann M. Becker P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the course of the purification of hACF we found that some of the hACF copurifies with topoisomerase IIβ. Using conventional chromatography, we were able to purify a complex containing these three polypeptides (hSNF2h, BAZ1A, and topoisomerase IIβ) to near-homogeneity. Moreover, this topoisomerase IIβ-containing complex eluted with an approximate mass of 600 kDa on a gel filtration column, which is 200 kDa larger than hACF, suggesting that they form a complex. Coelution of topoisomerase IIβ and hACF was also observed upon sucrose gradient sedimentation. However, we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate topoisomerase IIβ with hSNF2h-specific antibodies (data not shown). Whether the association between hACF and topoisomerase IIβ is functional remains to be elucidated. However, this complex is likely similar to CHRAC, which is believed to play a role during DNA replication (30.Varga-Weisz P.D. Bonte E. Becker P.B. Gross C. EMBO J. 1998; 12: 3428-3438Google Scholar). Recently Bochar et al. (31.Bochar D.A. Savarad J. Wang W. Lafleur D.W. Moore P. Cote J. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a novel hSNF2h chromatin remodeling complex, which they termed WCRF. The authors indicated that WCRF is composed of a 180-kDa subunit in addition to hSNF2h. The 180-kDa subunit is encoded by a novel cDNA (WCRF180), which appears identical to BAZ1A. However, this group estimated the size of the complex to be 670 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. In light of our results demonstrating that hACF in association with topoisomerase IIβ, elutes from a gel filtration column with an apparent mass of 600 kDa, we speculate that the WCRF complex described by Bochar et al. (31.Bochar D.A. Savarad J. Wang W. Lafleur D.W. Moore P. Cote J. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) includes topoisomerase IIβ. The hACF complex is the latest in the growing list of chromatin remodeling factors. Since there are many other sequences with homology to SNF2 in the DNA data bases, it is likely that this list will continue to grow. We thank Dr. J. Kadonaga for theDrosophila NAP1 baculovirus expression system and Dr. Leroy Liu for topoisomerase IIβ antibodies."

For 17β-estradiol-induced transactivation, the N-terminal A/B domain (AF-1) and the C-terminal E/F domain (AF-2) of ERs are required. Ligand binding is considered to induce functional synergism between AF-1 and AF-2, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. To clarify this synergism, we studied the role of reported AF-2 coactivators, p300/CREB binding protein, steroid receptor coactivator-1/transcriptional intermediary factor-2 (SRC-1/TIF2) family proteins and thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein-220/(vitamin D3 receptor-interacting protein- 205-(TRAP220/DRIP205) on the AF-1 activity in terms of synergism with the AF-2 function. We found that neither any of the SRC-1/TIF2 family coactivators nor TRAP220/DRIP205 is potent, whereas p300 potentiates the AF-1 function of both human ERα and human ERβ. Direct interactions of p300 with the A/B domains of ERα and ERβ were observed in an in vitro glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assay in accordance with the interactions in yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, mutations in the p300 binding sites (56–72 amino acids in ERα and 62–72 amino acids in ERβ) in the A/B domains caused a reduction in ligand-induced transactivation functions of both ERα and ERβ. Thus, these findings indicate that ligand-induced functional synergism between AF-1 and AF-2 is mediated through p300 by its direct binding to the A/B regions of ERα and ERβ.

Based on structural and functional similarities, the nuclear receptors are dissected into five to six functional domains (designated domain A to E/F). Two domains are well conserved among nuclear receptors, the cysteine-rich C domain serving to direct DNA binding (DBD) and the C-terminal E/F domain forming a pocket for ligand binding. For the ligand-induced transactivation function of nuclear receptors, the E/F domain and a variable N-terminal A/B domain are prerequisite (7.Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P.

The transactivation functions of both the A/B (AF-1) and the E/F (AF-2) domain depend on promoter context and cell type, and the properties of these domains in transactivation are distinct. Furthermore, it is reported that phosphorylation of the Ser residues in the A/B domains of human ERβ (2.Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol.

The deletion studies of ERα showed that the activity of AF-2 is ligand-induced, whereas AF-1 itself exhibits constitutive activity (7.Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 8.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Therefore, in ERα whole molecule, the AF-1 activity is considered to be suppressed by the ligand-unbound E/F domain but be restored upon ligand binding. Thus, ligand binding is considered to induce functional and complicated synergism between AF-1 and AF-2 activities (18.McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J. O’Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanism of this synergism is largely unknown. Evidence indicates that, during the ligand-induced transactivation, a coactivator complex is recruited, forming a higher complex with the nuclear receptor to achieve activation and repression of transcription. Several coactivators directly interacting with the E/F domain in a ligand-dependent manner have been identified, including the SRC-1/TIF2 (20.Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc.

More recently, a coactivator complex TRAP/DRIP containing none of the reported coactivators has been identified, and one of the components, TRAP220/DRIP205 is shown to directly interact with the E/F domain of some nuclear receptors including ERα in a ligand-dependent way (34.Fondell J.D.

Thus, such AF-2 coactivators have been well studied, whereas little is known about the AF-1 coactivator (s). The present study was thus undertaken to clarify the ligand-induced functional synergism between AF-1 and AF-2 in ERα as well as ERβ, with attention paid to the actions of known AF-2 coactivators in the AF-1. Consequently, we found that the core domains for both the ERα and ERβ AF-1 activities in the A/B domains are indistinguishable from those responsible for the functional synergism with each of the AF-2s. Though known coactivators (SRC-1, TIF2, and AIB1) enhanced the AF-2 of ERα as well as ERβ, neither of them nor TRAP220/DRIP205 potentiated the AF-1s of ERα and ERβ. However, consistent with the transcriptional potentiation by p300, direct interaction with the ERα and ERβ A/B domains was detected only in p300 in vitro. Furthermore, the ligand-induced transactivation functions of ERα and ERβ were impaired by the mutations of the p300 binding sites in their A/B domains. Thus, the present study indicates that p300 mediates, at least in part, the functional synergism between AF-1 and AF-2 through its direct binding of the A/B regions of ERα and ERβ.

SRC-1, TIF2, AIB1, and TRAP220 cDNAs were also isolated from the HeLa cDNA library, and the expression vectors were constructed by introducing the cDNAs into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (36.Takeyama K.

The cells were transfected with 2 μg of 17M2G-CAT reporter plasmid, either 1 μg of GAL4- or VP16-fused ER expression vector or 3 μg of coactivator expression vector, along with 3 μg of pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Bluescribe M13+ (Stratagene) was used as carrier DNA to adjust the total amount of DNA to 20 μg (32.Yanagisawa J.

After a 24-h incubation in medium containing the precipitated DNA, the cells were washed with fresh medium and continued to grow for an additional 24 h with or without 10−8 M E2. CAT activity was measured and shown as described above. The GST fusion protein or GST alone was expressed in Escherichia coli as described (32.Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and the expression of proteins of the predicted size was then monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For GST pull-down assays, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins or GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with 35S-labeled proteins were expressed byin vitro translation using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega). After 2 h of incubation, free proteins were washed away from the beads with NET-N+ buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Specifically bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, radiolabeled proteins were visualized using an image analyzer (BAS1500, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and lysed in TNE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and detected with anti-GAL4 DBD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (32.Yanagisawa J.

For the ligand-induced transactivation in ERs, two domains in the N-terminal A/B and the C-terminal E/F domain act synergistically to stimulate transcription. However, the molecular mechanism of this synergism is largely unknown. Therefore, we first tested in vivo the interaction between the A/B and E/F domains in hERα and hERβ by a mammalian two-hybrid assay with the hER deletion mutants fused to either the GAL4 DBD or VP16 transactivation domain (32.Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). As expected from previous reports (18.McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J. O’Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19.Tasset D. Tora L. Fromental C. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), ligand-induced interaction between the A/B and E/F domains in hERα was observed (Fig.1 A). Though the hERα A/B domain did not form a homodimer, it interacted with the E/F domain in a ligand-dependent way. Similar interactions between the two domains were detected also in hERβ (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, ligand-induced interactions between the two domains derived from different ER subtypes (α-β) were also detected (Fig.1 C). Thus, the properties of the ligand-induced interactions in the A/B-E/F and the E/F-E/F domains are indistinguishable between hERα and hERβ. We then tried to delineate the regions of ligand-induced interaction of the A/B domain for the E/F domain with a series of A/B domain deletion mutants fused to a yeast GAL4 DBD. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the interaction regions were mapped to the central region (aa 56–127) of the hERα A/B domain and to the N-terminal region (aa 1–62) of the hERβ A/B domain. Interestingly, these regions almost overlapped with the core regions for the full activities of the AF-1s of hERα and hERβ, though the AF-1 activity of hERβ is half that of hERα (Fig.2 A), as expected from previous reports (2.Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 12.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the expression levels of the A/B domain deletion mutants are almost the same by a Western blot analysis with an antibody for GAL4 DBD, when the cell extracts were normalized to the transfection efficiency (data not shown). To test whether the observed in vivo interactions of the A/B domain with the ligand-bound E/F domain of hERα and hERβ are physically direct or indirect, we applied a GST pull-down assay with bacterially expressed chimeric hER proteins fused with GST. Monitoring the properties of ligand-induced direct interactions of the E/F domains with coactivators, we chose a nuclear receptor coactivator, SRC-1, and consequently SRC-1 was found to associate with both the hERα and hERβ E/F domains in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig.3 A, lanes 5–8) as reported (12.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 20.Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, under this condition, physical interaction between the A/B and E/F domains was detected in neither hERα nor hERβ even in the presence of ligand (Fig. 3 A). Thus, these findings indicate that the ligand-induced interaction of the A/B domain with the E/F domain in hERα and hERβ is indirect and possibly mediated through a factor bridging the two domains. To test this idea, we studied whether the well characterized AF-2 coactivators directly interacting with the E/F domains of various nuclear receptors potentiate the AF-1 activities of hERα and hERβ. For this study, all three 160-kDa coactivators, SRC-1, TIF2, and AIB1, and p300 were used. All four coactivators potentiated the ligand-induced transactivations of the full-length hERα and hERβ (data not shown), as we expected from previous reports (21.Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 22.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Such potentiations by these coactivators were also confirmed for the AF-2 activities of hERα and hERβ (data not shown), as reported (22.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 23.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). None of the 160-kDa coactivators potentiated the hERα and hERβ AF-1 activities in the ER A-C domains (HE15, ERα A-C domain and HEβ15, ERβ A-C domain) (Fig.3 B), whereas p300 was clearly potent (Fig.3 B). As p300 appeared to act as a coactivator also for the AF-1s of hERα and hERβ, we examined if p300 directly associates with the A/B domain in vitro and in vivo. The GST pull-down assay clearly showed interactions of p300 with both the hERα and hERβ A/B domainsin vitro, whereas none of the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins were able to bind (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). TRAP220/DRIP205 showed no interaction (Fig. 3 A), reflecting its inability to potentiate the AF-1s (data not shown). Consistent with these results, chimeric hERα and hERβ A/B domains fused to the GAL4 DBD exhibited in vivo interactions with p300, but not with the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins (Fig. 3 C). The binding sites of the A/B domains for p300 in vivo were further mapped to 16 aa residues (ERα aa 56–72) and 72 aa residues (ERβ 1–72) (Fig.4, A and B). Though the p300 binding site of hERα in vivo was essential for direct binding of p300 in vitro (Fig. 4 C, upper panel), the p300 binding to the hERβ A/B domainin vivo (Fig. 4 C) required more region than tested in vitro (only 10 amino acids (62–72) are required for in vitro binding), suggesting that the N-terminal region (1–62 aa) contributes a stable interaction of the ERβ A/B domain with p300 in vivo. Note that the expression levels of the chimeric ER mutants with GAL4 DBD were confirmed at almost the same levels when estimated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Thus, as p300 is able to bind to the A/B domains in both hERα and hERβ, we next tested whether p300 enhances the ligand-induced interactions between the A/B and E/F domains in vivo, as observed in Fig. 1. The mammalian two-hybrid system revealed that the overexpression of p300 potentiates the ligand-induced interactions (Fig. 5 B). The interactions between the A/B and E/F domains were impaired when the p300 binding to the E/F domains is abolished by deleting the AF-2 cores (534–595 aa or hERα (VP16-ERαΔAD) and 432–477 aa of hERβ (VP16-ERβΔAD)) (23.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5 B). Notably, these ligand-induced interactions between two domains were further detected in vitro only in the presence of p300 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 10 and 15). To test an idea that p300 functionally bridges the A/B domain and the E/F domain in ERα and ERβ, we made deletion mutants lacking the p300 binding sites (ΔERα-1 and ΔERβ-1 as illustrated in Fig.6 A). As shown in Fig.6 B, the lack of binding sites caused a clear reduction in the ligand-induced transactivation in hERα and hERβ. Thus, it is most likely that the p300 action of AF-1 by its direct binding contributes to the ligand-induced transactivation function of ERα and ERβ in whole receptor. Taken together, these findings indicate that p300 mediates the ligand-induced interactions between the A/B and E/F domains in hERα and hERβ by its direct binding to the A/B domains. The tissue-specific activity of hERα is considered to play a significant role in the actions of estrogen. Especially tamoxifen, an estrogen partial agonist, is considered to exert its tissue-specific actions through activating AF-1 and inhibiting AF-2 in hERα (9.Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 40.Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of great interest to identify the cofactors responsible for the activities of the ER(s) AF-1, in terms of synergistic function with AF-2. In the present study, we identified the AF-1 activity in the A/B region of hERβ, though it was weaker than that in the hERα A/B domain in COS-1 cells. As the poor activity of hERβ AF-1 was seen in other cell types, such as HeLa cells and MCF-7 cells (data not shown), it is likely that in response to E2, the AF-1 activity contributes less than the AF-2 activity of ERβ as in ERα in most target cells in accordance with previous reports (2.Tremblay G.B.

Giguère V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the ERβ AF-1 activity dominates in some target cells and in cells in a pathophysiological state, because its activity is cell-type specific. Several nuclear receptor coactivators have been studied, including the SRC-1/TIF2 (20.Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been demonstrated that ligand binding induces the interactions of the SRC-1/TIF2 and p300/CBP proteins with ERα and other nuclear receptors. Most recently, a novel coactivator complex has been identified, and one of the components, TRAP220/DRIP205, is shown to bind the E/F domains of nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent way (34.Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 35.Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Further study revealed that helix 12 at the C terminus of the E/F domains serves as a direct interphase for these coactivators (38.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 39.Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Such ligand-induced functional interactions with the coactivators well explain the ligand-induced transactivation function of AF-2 in various nuclear receptors including ERα and ERβ (40.Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 41.Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, little was known about the coactivators for AF-1, and in this respect it is of interest whether the AF-2 coactivators enhance the AF-1 activity or not. We found in the present study that all of the three SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins and p300 potentiate the AF-2 functions of ERβ as well as ERα (data not shown), as expected from previous reports (21.Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 22.Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Under the same conditions, we could detect neither any potentiation of the AF-1 activities of ERα and ERβ by any SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins nor any direct interaction in vivo and in vitro, though previous reports showed that the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins potentiate the AF-1 activities of ERα and ERβ (2.Tremblay G.B.

S. A. 1996; 93: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As these activities are dependent on cell types, we suspect that a cell type-specific factor specifies the actions of the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins in the ER AF-1. In contrast, p300 enhanced the AF-1 activities of both ERs, even though in the Ser residue point mutants to be unphosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (data not shown). Supporting the p300 action, functional association in vivo and direct binding of p300 were detected in the A/B domains of ERα and ERβ. However, we observed a discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro in the hERβ A/B regions required for p300 binding, suggesting the existence of an unknown factor acting with p300 on the ERβ AF-1. Thus, taken together, these observations indicate that p300 is one of coactivators supporting the AF-1 activities of ERα as well as ERβ; however, unknown coactivator(s) also appears to be required for the AF-1 activities. The present findings together indicate that p300 mediates, at least in part, the ligand-induced functional synergism between AF-1 and AF-2 through its direct binding to the A/B domains of ERα and ERβ, because direct interactions between the two domains in vitrowere detected only in the presence of p300 (Fig. 5 A). A previous study indicated that the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins exhibit similar effects on the functional interaction between the two domainsin vivo (18.McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J. O’Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); however, in the present study, the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins failed to induce such a ligand-induced interactionin vitro. Therefore, from the present study, it appears that such action of the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins is mediated through p300 (possibly CBP) bound to the A/B domain. As a coactivator complex containing the SRC-1/TIF2 family proteins and p300/CBP is recruited for the ligand-induced transactivation functions of ERα and ERβ during this ligand-dependent process, p300 (CBP) in this complex may bridge the A/B and E/F domains in association of other component(s). Likewise, a component(s) of the TRAP/DRIP coactivator complex may directly interact with the ER A/B domains when this complex is recruited by the ligand-bound E/F domain (34.Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 35.Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). It is moreover possible to speculate that a coactivator complex different from these two coactivator complexes interacts with the ER A/B domain to fulfill the ER AF-1 function."

In contrast, a large fraction of the fusion in Icmt−/− cells was trapped within the cytoplasm, and fluorescence at the plasma membrane was reduced.

A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition, some forms of Ras undergo palmitoylation of cysteines upstream from the isoprenylcysteine residue (4.Fujiyama A. Tsunasawa S. Tamanoi F. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17926-17931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The post-translational processing steps for the CaaXproteins have attracted considerable scrutiny, in large part because of the key role of activated forms of Ras in the pathogenesis of human cancers. The isoprenylation step is crucial for the proper targeting of the Ras proteins along the plasma membrane (1.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev.

However, the physiologic importance of the “post-isoprenylation” protein processing steps has remained less certain (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar); this is particularly the case for the carboxyl methylation step (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar).The enzyme responsible for catalyzing the formation of the methyl ester on the carboxyl-terminal isoprenylcysteine is protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.100) (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enzyme is encoded by STE14. The yeast enzyme (Ste14p) is predicted to have multiple transmembrane-spanning domains (10.Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and it resides in the ER (11.Romano J.D. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol.

One potential means of approaching this issue would be to competitively inhibit the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase with small, cell-permeable, methyl-accepting isoprenylated substrates (e.g.,N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine orN-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine) (13.Tan E.W.

The drawback of this approach, however, is that these types of small-molecule competitors probably have multiple effects on cells (see Ref. 9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar for a recent review). For example, the fact that these molecules contain isoprenyl groups could lead them to displace isoprenylated proteins from their cellular binding sites (17.Haklai R. Weisz M. Elad G. Paz A. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To avoid such problems, we used gene-targeting techniques to produce a mammalian cell line lacking isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase. In this report, we document the production of a mouse cell line that is homozygous for an Icmt knockout mutation, and we demonstrate that K-Ras localization is abnormal in those cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we inactivated both Icmt alleles in mouse ES cells. One allele was inactivated with a conventional sequence-replacement gene-targeting strategy. The second allele was inactivated by a second round of selection in a high concentration of G418 (6 mg/ml). This procedure, first described by Mortensen et al. (23.Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A.T. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), probably works by selecting for the survival of rare cells in which an interchromosomal gene conversion event has “repaired” the wild-type chromosome with the mutant chromosome, thereby providing it with an extra copy of the neo selection marker. In the case of the Icmt locus, the “high G418” selection procedure was extremely efficient and proved to be far simpler than knocking out the other allele with a second gene-targeting vector containing a different drug selection marker (31.te Riele H. Maandag E.R. Clarke A. Hooper M. Berns A. Nature. 1990; 348: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).The homozygous knockout cells lacked all Icmt activity against a protein substrate (farnesyl-K-Ras4B) or against farnesylated and geranylgeranylated small molecules (AFC and AGGC, respectively). Thus, the Icmt−/− cells did not appear to contain any redundant biochemical activity capable of methylating isoprenylated substrates, at least under the conditions of our assays. Interestingly, we had no difficulty in using methylation assays to document an accumulation ofIcmt substrates in the Icmt−/− cells. In the future, it should be possible to methylate the substrates inIcmt−/− cells withS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine, and then use two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify the most abundant Icmt substrates.Our principal objective in creating an Icmt-deficient mammalian cell line was to assess the importance of the carboxyl methylation step for the intracellular localization of the Ras proteins. To address this issue, we prepared P100 (membrane) and S100 (cytosolic) fractions from Icmt−/−and Icmt+/+ cells and then analyzed the membrane association of K-Ras by Western blotting. We also transfected Icmt−/−andIcmt+/+ cells with a GFP-K-Ras fusion plasmid in which the GFP coding sequences were ligated in-frame to the carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acids of K-Ras 4B. The results of both lines of investigation were clear. Compared with the Icmt+/+ cells, more of the K-Ras in the Icmt−/− cells was in the S100 fraction. In addition, the K-Ras fusion protein in the wild-type cells was localized almost exclusively along the plasma membrane, whereas a large fraction of the fusion in the Icmt−/− cells was trapped in the cytoplasm and less was at the plasma membrane.These data indicating mislocalization of K-Ras in the absence of carboxyl methylation require several comments. First, these results are clearly consistent with the finding of abnormal Ras2p processing and abnormal Ras2p membrane localization in ste14Δ S. cerevisiae (18.Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, despite the concordance of the current data and the yeast data, we are reluctant to extrapolate our results toall Ras isoforms in mammals. In our study, we examined the localization of a K-Ras, which relies in part on a polybasic sequence for plasma membrane localization (32.Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 33.Ghomashchi F. Zhang X. Liu L. Gelb M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11910-11918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34.Leventis R. Sivinus J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7640-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is possible that the methylation step could be less important for other mammalian Ras isoforms (e.g., H-Ras) that undergo palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the carboxyl-terminal part of the molecule (35.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 36.Dunphy J. Linder M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 37.Resh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Second, the degree of the mislocalization of the K-Ras fusion in Icmt−/− cells, although quite marked, did not appear to be as striking as that observed in Rce1-deficient fibroblasts (where the Ras proteins are neither endoproteolytically processed nor methylated) (25.Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for this finding is that both the endoproteolysis step and the carboxyl methylation step contribute independently to Ras localization and that eliminating both steps, as occurs in the Rce1 knockout, has a greater impact than eliminating only the methylation step. Once again, however, caution is warranted, because the Rce1experiments were performed in fibroblasts, whereas the Icmtexperiments were performed in ES cells. Third, we emphasize that the mechanism(s) for the K-Ras mislocalization in Icmt−/− cells is not fully understood. The Icmt-mediated conversion of a carboxylate ion to an α-carboxyl methyl ester would be predicted to render the carboxyl terminus of the protein more hydrophobic, facilitating its interaction with the plasma membrane (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). However, that may not be the only explanation for our results. The subcellular trafficking of K-Ras appears to go through a route distinct from that of H-Ras and N-Ras (38.Thissen J. Gross J. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39.Choy E. Chiu V. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I. Philips M. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and microtubules may be involved in this process for K-Ras (38.Thissen J. Gross J. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the absence of methylation adversely affects the transport of K-Ras, thereby reducing the level of this protein at the plasma membrane.The Icmt−/− cell line will be a valuable reagent for investigators who are interested in the metabolism of isoprenylated proteins. As noted above, two-dimensional gel experiments with these cells could help to identify Icmt substrates. Perhaps more importantly, the cells could yield clues as to why the isoprenylcysteine methylation step has been so conserved in eukaryotic biology. In yeast, theSTE14-mediated “capping” of a-factor (a farnesylated CaaX protein) with an α-methyl ester improvesa-factor stability by preventing rapid intracellular degradation of the protein (18.Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Based on that precedent, we hypothesized that the absence of Icmt might adversely affect the stability of mammalian isoprenylated proteins (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). With the production of Icmt−/− cells, it will be possible to test that hypothesis in a direct fashion. In addition, because many of the substrates for Icmt are signaling molecules (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar), it will be possible to assess the influence of methylation on various signal transduction pathways. Finally, we find it difficult to resist speculating that Icmt might function in mammalian cells to facilitate a receptor-mediated transport of an isoprenylated peptide across a membrane. In yeast, methylation of a-factor is crucial for theSTE6-mediated transport of a-factor out of the cell (10.Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although no a-factor orthologue has been identified in higher organisms, it is nevertheless conceivable that transmembrane transport of an as yet unidentified isoprenylated protein occurs in mammals and that the methylation of the isoprenylcysteine is important for this process. The existence of Icmt−/− cells could be quite helpful in examining that possibility. Ras proteins, as well as other proteins that terminate with a so-called CaaX sequence, undergo several sequential post-translational processing steps. First, a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprene lipid is added to the thiol group of the cysteine (C) residue by a cytosolic protein prenyltransferase (a process generally referred to as protein prenylation or isoprenylation) (1.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). After isoprenylation, the last three amino acids of the protein (i.e., the -aaX) are released by a specific endoprotease associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 (2.Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The newly exposed isoprenylcysteine is then methylated by an ER-associated methyltransferase (3.Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition, some forms of Ras undergo palmitoylation of cysteines upstream from the isoprenylcysteine residue (4.Fujiyama A. Tsunasawa S. Tamanoi F. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17926-17931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The post-translational processing steps for the CaaXproteins have attracted considerable scrutiny, in large part because of the key role of activated forms of Ras in the pathogenesis of human cancers.

In addition, the K-Ras fusion protein in the wild-type cells was localized almost exclusively along the plasma membrane, whereas a large fraction of the fusion in the Icmt−/− cells was trapped in the cytoplasm and less was at the plasma membrane.These data indicating mislocalization of K-Ras in the absence of carboxyl methylation require several comments. First, these results are clearly consistent with the finding of abnormal Ras2p processing and abnormal Ras2p membrane localization in ste14Δ S. cerevisiae (18.Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, despite the concordance of the current data and the yeast data, we are reluctant to extrapolate our results toall Ras isoforms in mammals. In our study, we examined the localization of a K-Ras, which relies in part on a polybasic sequence for plasma membrane localization (32.Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 33.Ghomashchi F. Zhang X. Liu L. Gelb M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11910-11918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34.Leventis R. Sivinus J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7640-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is possible that the methylation step could be less important for other mammalian Ras isoforms (e.g., H-Ras) that undergo palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the carboxyl-terminal part of the molecule (35.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 36.Dunphy J. Linder M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 37.Resh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Second, the degree of the mislocalization of the K-Ras fusion in Icmt−/− cells, although quite marked, did not appear to be as striking as that observed in Rce1-deficient fibroblasts (where the Ras proteins are neither endoproteolytically processed nor methylated) (25.Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for this finding is that both the endoproteolysis step and the carboxyl methylation step contribute independently to Ras localization and that eliminating both steps, as occurs in the Rce1 knockout, has a greater impact than eliminating only the methylation step. Once again, however, caution is warranted, because the Rce1experiments were performed in fibroblasts, whereas the Icmtexperiments were performed in ES cells. Third, we emphasize that the mechanism(s) for the K-Ras mislocalization in Icmt−/− cells is not fully understood. The Icmt-mediated conversion of a carboxylate ion to an α-carboxyl methyl ester would be predicted to render the carboxyl terminus of the protein more hydrophobic, facilitating its interaction with the plasma membrane (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). However, that may not be the only explanation for our results. The subcellular trafficking of K-Ras appears to go through a route distinct from that of H-Ras and N-Ras (38.Thissen J. Gross J. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39.Choy E. Chiu V. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I. Philips M. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and microtubules may be involved in this process for K-Ras (38.Thissen J. Gross J. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the absence of methylation adversely affects the transport of K-Ras, thereby reducing the level of this protein at the plasma membrane.The Icmt−/− cell line will be a valuable reagent for investigators who are interested in the metabolism of isoprenylated proteins. As noted above, two-dimensional gel experiments with these cells could help to identify Icmt substrates. Perhaps more importantly, the cells could yield clues as to why the isoprenylcysteine methylation step has been so conserved in eukaryotic biology. In yeast, theSTE14-mediated “capping” of a-factor (a farnesylated CaaX protein) with an α-methyl ester improvesa-factor stability by preventing rapid intracellular degradation of the protein (18.Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Based on that precedent, we hypothesized that the absence of Icmt might adversely affect the stability of mammalian isoprenylated proteins (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). With the production of Icmt−/− cells, it will be possible to test that hypothesis in a direct fashion. In addition, because many of the substrates for Icmt are signaling molecules (9.Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. Enzymes for Lipid Metabolism. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar), it will be possible to assess the influence of methylation on various signal transduction pathways. Finally, we find it difficult to resist speculating that Icmt might function in mammalian cells to facilitate a receptor-mediated transport of an isoprenylated peptide across a membrane. In yeast, methylation of a-factor is crucial for theSTE6-mediated transport of a-factor out of the cell (10.Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although no a-factor orthologue has been identified in higher organisms, it is nevertheless conceivable that transmembrane transport of an as yet unidentified isoprenylated protein occurs in mammals and that the methylation of the isoprenylcysteine is important for this process. The existence of Icmt−/− cells could be quite helpful in examining that possibility. In this study, we inactivated both Icmt alleles in mouse ES cells. One allele was inactivated with a conventional sequence-replacement gene-targeting strategy. The second allele was inactivated by a second round of selection in a high concentration of G418 (6 mg/ml). This procedure, first described by Mortensen et al. (23.Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A.T. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), probably works by selecting for the survival of rare cells in which an interchromosomal gene conversion event has “repaired” the wild-type chromosome with the mutant chromosome, thereby providing it with an extra copy of the neo selection marker. In the case of the Icmt locus, the “high G418” selection procedure was extremely efficient and proved to be far simpler than knocking out the other allele with a second gene-targeting vector containing a different drug selection marker (31.te Riele H. Maandag E.R. Clarke A. Hooper M. Berns A. Nature. 1990; 348: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The homozygous knockout cells lacked all Icmt activity against a protein substrate (farnesyl-K-Ras4B) or against farnesylated and geranylgeranylated small molecules (AFC and AGGC, respectively). Thus, the Icmt−/− cells did not appear to contain any redundant biochemical activity capable of methylating isoprenylated substrates, at least under the conditions of our assays. Interestingly, we had no difficulty in using methylation assays to document an accumulation ofIcmt substrates in the Icmt−/− cells. In the future, it should be possible to methylate the substrates inIcmt−/− cells withS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine, and then use two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify the most abundant Icmt substrates. Our principal objective in creating an Icmt-deficient mammalian cell line was to assess the importance of the carboxyl methylation step for the intracellular localization of the Ras proteins. To address this issue, we prepared P100 (membrane) and S100 (cytosolic) fractions from Icmt−/−and Icmt+/+ cells and then analyzed the membrane association of K-Ras by Western blotting. We also transfected Icmt−/−andIcmt+/+ cells with a GFP-K-Ras fusion plasmid in which the GFP coding sequences were ligated in-frame to the carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acids of K-Ras 4B. The results of both lines of investigation were clear. Compared with the Icmt+/+ cells, more of the K-Ras in the Icmt−/− cells was in the S100 fraction. In addition, the K-Ras fusion protein in the wild-type cells was localized almost exclusively along the plasma membrane, whereas a large fraction of the fusion in the Icmt−/− cells was trapped in the cytoplasm and less was at the plasma membrane.

This has been thought to be a simple consequence of ςS itself requiring ppGpp for its production. By using four model promoters requiring ςS for normal induction in the stationary phase, we demonstrate that ςS-dependent promoters require ppGpp even in the presence of high levels of ςSproduced ectopically. Similar to ς70-dependent promoters under positive control by ppGpp, the requirement of ςS-dependent promoters for this alarmone is bypassed by specific “stringent” mutations in the β-subunit of RNA polymerase. The results suggest that stationary phase induction of both ςS- and ς70-dependent genes requires the stringent control modulon and that stringency confers dual control on the RpoS regulon by affecting promoter activity and the levels of the required ς-factor.

RNA polymerase RNAP core Cells of Escherichia coli elicit stringent control of ribosome production during amino acid starvation (1.Sands M.K. Roberts R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1952; 63: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Stent G.S. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 2005-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This control encompasses a rapid reduction in superfluous rRNA biosynthesis during cellular starvation (3.Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umberger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium : Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). The effector molecule of the stringent control modulon is guanosine tetraphosphate, ppGpp, which, by binding to RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 (4.Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 5: 279-287Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar), causes a rapid reduction in rRNA transcription, probably by reducing the stability of the open promoter/RNAP complexes at rRNA promoters (5.Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6.Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring. Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The alarmone ppGpp can also act as a positive effector of gene expression, and a large number of ς70-dependent genes require this nucleotide for their induction during stationary phase and starvation (7.Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Nyström T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, many operons encoding amino acid biosynthetic pathways require ppGpp for their transcription, and cells lacking ppGpp (relA spoT double mutants) are polyauxotrophs (7.Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mutants lacking functional relA spoT or the stationary phase ς-factor, ςS, have been found to express similar phenotypes; this has been explained by the fact that ppGpp-deficient mutants fail to induce the RpoS regulon, which, in turn, was demonstrated to be because ςS itself requires ppGpp for its production (9.Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7982-7989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Lange R. Fischer D. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4676-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Zgurskaya H.I. Keyhan M. Matin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the failure of relA spoT mutants to induce a number of different ςS-dependent genes, such as bolAand cfa, has been argued to be the result of the low levels of ςS in these mutants (12.Eichel J. Chang Y. Riesenberg D. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 572-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). If this notion is correct, it would be possible to restore stationary phase induction of ςS-dependent genes in relA spoTmutants by ectopic overproduction of ςS. We demonstrate here that this is not the case and that the ςS-dependent model promoters analyzed, PuspB, bolAP1, Pcfa, and PfadL, all require ppGpp for their induction even in the presence of wild-type levels of ςS. Moreover, the requirement of these promoters for ppGpp is suppressed by the samerpoB alleles that render some ς70-dependent promoters independent of ppGpp for their induction during stasis. The E. coli strains used in this work are listed in TableI. Cultures were grown in liquid M9 defined medium (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The uspB gene has a single, ςS-dependent promoter that is induced when cells enter stationary phase (18.Farewell A. Kvint K. Nyström T. Mol.

We have confirmed that the stringent response (ppGpp accumulation) requires SpoT in this medium rather than RelA (i.e. relA +,relA1, and ΔrelA mutants all give identical results). The dependence of this ςS-dependent gene on ppGpp confirms previous data (9.Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7982-7989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Lange R. Fischer D. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4676-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Zgurskaya H.I. Keyhan M. Matin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) demonstrating that induction of ςS-dependent genes and accumulation of ςS are partly dependent on ppGpp. However, by introducing into our reporter strains the high copy number plasmid pMMKatF2 (20.Mulvey M.R. Sorby P.A. Triggs-Raine B.L. Loewen P.C. Gene. 1988; 73: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that carries the structural gene forrpoS, we demonstrate that the uspB promoter cannot be rescued by producing ςS at close to, or somewhat higher than, wild-type levels in the relA1 spoTmutant (Fig. 1, B and C). It should be noted that pMMKatF2 fully rescues the uspB promoter in anrpoS null mutant (19.Farewell A. Kvint K. Nyström T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6140-6147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to be induced, PuspBrequires ppGpp in concert with the EςS holoenzyme. To investigate whether the dual requirement for ppGpp and ςS of PuspB was promoter-specific, we tested the following ςS-dependent genes: bolA, cfa, and fadL. The bolA P1 promoter (used in this work) is strictly dependent on ςS and ppGpp for stationary phase induction in vivo (Fig.2 A), whereas the cfagene has two promoters, one of which, P1, is ς70-dependent and the other, P2, ςS-dependent (21.Wang A.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We used a construct of the region containing both promoters fused to lacZ (12.Eichel J. Chang Y. Riesenberg D. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 572-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and moved this construct into the λ att site of E. coli. When using this single-copy chromosomal fusion, we noted that about 75% of the stationary phase induction of cfarequires ςS and that a residual induction occurs in the absence of this sigma factor, presumably because of transcription from P1 (Fig. 2 B). Similar to cfa, stationary phase induction of a chromosomal fadL-lacZ fusion depends on both ςS and ς70 in LB medium (18.Farewell A. Kvint K. Nyström T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, in the defined medium used in this work, the stationary phase induction offadL is primarily dependent on ςS (Fig.2 C). As seen in Fig. 2, all of the promoters analyzed require ppGpp for induction, and none are rescued by ςSoverproduction in a relA spoT mutant. It is noteworthy that the residual induction of cfa observed in the absence of ςS requires ppGpp (Fig. 2 B; see below). The ppGpp dependence of Eς70-dependent promoters can be totally or partially suppressed by the rpoB3449 allele (22.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23.Kvint K. Hosbond C. Farewell A. Nybroe O. Nyström T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which renders the RNA polymerase partly constitutively stringent in the absence of ppGpp. We tested whether this allele could alleviate the ppGpp requirement also of the ςS-dependent promoters analyzed. We found that this was the case, although the degree of suppression was promoter-dependent (Fig.3). For instance, we noticed that therpoB3449 allele up-regulated promoter activity somewhat also during exponential phase, at least for three of the promoters tested, which may be expected because the rpoB3449 mutant is constitutively “stringent.” To determine whether this activity was the result of the positive stringent control of ς70-associated RNAP, we introduced a rpoS null allele into the otherwise wild-type strain and into therpoB3449 strain. As seen in Fig.4, the levels of expression ofcfa-lacZ in the rpoS rpoB3449 double mutant were identical to the levels of expression in the rpoB3449 mutant in exponential phase. Thus, the high level of expression of this fusion in the rpoB3449 strain during growth is due to Eς70 transcription, whereas the induction in stationary phase is dependent primarily on ςS (Fig. 4). Finally, it should be noted that the residual expression of cfa-lacZ in an rpoS mutant is also stationary phase inducible because of ppGpp-dependent transcription using Eς70.Figure 4Pcfa-lacZ expression requires stringency and ςS for full induction when cells enter stationary phase. β-Galactosidase activities (closed symbols) and cell density (open symbols) are shown in strains carrying rpoS (KK226,circles), rpoB3449 (KK224, squares), and rpoS rpoB3449 (KK227, triangles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Many Eς70-dependent genes of E. coli are increasingly expressed as cells enter stationary phase and a large fraction of the corresponding promoters are positively regulated by ppGpp. We demonstrate here that this requirement for ppGpp also holds for EςS-dependent promoters even in the presence of high levels of ςS. It is not completely understood how ppGpp activates transcription from some promoters while inhibiting transcription from other (stringent promoters), notably rRNA, promoters. Negative control by ppGpp is suggested to result from the dissociation of ppGpp-programmed RNAP from stringent promoters (22.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) because ppGpp drastically reduces the stability of the open complex with RNAP (5.Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6.Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring. Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The rrnP1 promoter forms an intrinsically unstable open complex with RNAP; such promoters may be argued to be especially sensitive to the destabilizing effects of ppGpp (5.Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6.Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring. Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, the rpoB alleles that render the cell partly constitutively stringent form an RNAP that destabilizes promoter open complexes in vitro (5.Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6.Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring. Harbor Symp. Quant.

Thus the β-mutant RNAPs mimic the effects of elevated ppGpp levels, which explains why rRNA promoters are down-regulated in cells expressing this mutant RNAP. However, the reduction in the half-life of promoter open complexes by ppGpp or β-mutant RNAPs occurs also for promoters that are positively regulated by ppGpp (6.Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring. Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Possibly, as suggested by Gourse and co-workers (5.Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6.Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring. Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a reduction in the stability of promoter open complexes can give rise to both negative and positive effects depending on the intrinsic kinetic properties of the target promoter. The half-lives of complexes of some promoters that are positively regulated by ppGpp and RNAP have been reported to be extremely long, and one could argue that this may be a kinetic problem that is mitigated by ppGpp. If this were the entire role of ppGpp in the positive regulation of these promoters, one might expect that ppGpp would also work as a positive factor of transcription from these promoters in an in vitro assay. However, as far as we know, this is not always the case. There are some examples of a positive effect of ppGpp on gene expression in vitro, but these experiments were performed using a coupled transcription translation assay (24.Stephens J.C. Artz S.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 25.Primakoff P. Artz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1726-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26.Riggs D.L. Mueller R.D. Kwan H.S. Artz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is possible that the effects of ppGpp on promoters that apparently require this alarmone for induction are due to more indirect effects, including ppGpp-dependent changes in RNAP availability. According to a model by Zhou and Jin (22.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), RNAP recruitment is the rate-limiting step of promoters that are positively regulated by ppGpp and these promoters, therefore, are argued to be very sensitive to the concentration of free RNA polymerase. As elaborated above, the accumulation of ppGpp is suggested to result in the dissociation of RNAP from stringent promoters (22.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and as a consequence, more RNAP becomes available to initiate transcription at promoters that have a relatively poor ability to recruit RNAP. Following the assumptions of this model, we would argue that all promoters induced during conditions of stringency, regardless of their dependence on different ς-factors, would require ppGpp for their induction; the results presented in this paper could be explained within the framework of the Zhou and Jin (22.Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) model. For example, up-regulation of the ςS-dependent promoters (which may have a relatively poor ability to recruit RNAP) in cells expressing the β-mutant RNAP may result from a higher level of free RNAP in these cells. In addition, Hernandez and Cashel (28.Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have shown that the amounts of ς70 bound to E (RNAP core) is elevated in ppGppO cells and that a mutation in rpoD, which is epistatic to ppGpp-deficient defects, lower the amount of Eς70. Thus, it is possible that stringent conditions allow alternative ς-factors to compete more successfully for E by lowering the programming of E with ς70. Finally, ppGpp may directly or indirectly aid in the ability of ςS to transcribe ςS-dependent promoters. ςS works poorly in in vitrotranscription systems (29.Kusano S. Ding Q. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1998-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which may indicate that other factors are needed for ςS-dependent transcription. For example, the presence of polyphosphate, elevated levels of potassium glutamate, and the degree of supercoiling of the DNA template have been suggested to influence ςS-dependent transcription (29.Kusano S. Ding Q. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1998-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30.Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol.

The stringent response may alter any of these variables or other unknown factors and thus affect the ability of ςS to transcribe its cognate genes (e.g. Ref.34.Rao N.N. Liu S. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Future work in our laboratory will use both in vitroand in vivo methods to distinguish between these models. Ding Jun Jin, Concetta C.

PBP has recently been identified as a component of the multiprotein complexes such as TRAP, DRIP, and ARC that appear to play an important role in the transcriptional activation by several transcriptional factors including nuclear receptors. To assess the biological significance of PBP, we disrupted the PBP gene (PBP/PPARBP) in mice by homologous recombination. PBP+/− mice are healthy, fertile, and do not differ significantly from PBP+/+ control littermates. PBP null mutation (PBP−/−) is embryonically lethal at embryonic day 11.5, suggesting that PBP is an essential gene for mouse embryogenesis. The embryonic lethality is attributed, in part, to defects in the development of placental vasculature similar to those encountered in PPARγ mutants. Transient transfection assays using fibroblasts isolated from PBP mutant embryos revealed a decreased capacity for ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of PPARγ as compared with fibroblasts derived form the wild type embryos. These observations suggest that there is no functional redundancy between PBP and other coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 and that PBP plays a critical role in the signaling of PPARγ and other nuclear receptors.

The recruitment of most of these proteins to activated receptors is mediated in most part by LXXLL motifs present in these coactivators, which have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction with nuclear receptors (9.Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 12.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation by coactivators are just beginning to emerge. Some of these coactivators, such as p300/CBP, SRC-1, and ACTR, possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and modify the chromatin organization of the target gene promoter regions (13.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Others, such as PBP (14.Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), with no histone acetyltransferase activity, constitute an integral part of the multiprotein complexes that appear to act more directly on the transcriptional apparatus, presumably after the unwinding of chromatin (1.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 2.Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PBP was initially isolated and characterized by us as a coactivator for PPARγ and like other nuclear receptor coactivators, it contains LXXLL signature motifs in the region that interacts with nuclear receptors (10.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Subsequently, PBP has been found to be a critical component of the thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins (TRAPs) (14.Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), vitamin D3 receptor interacting protein (DRIP) complex (15.Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M.

Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More recently, we found PBP gene overexpression and amplification in a significant proportion of breast cancers (17.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa III, R. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10848-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), further underscoring the critical importance of this coactivator in the transcriptional activation (2.Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the function of PBP, and of other nuclear receptor coactivators, is based largely on the results fromin vitro binding assays and transient transfection experiments. There is very little information regarding the in vivo function of PBP and whether a redundancy exists between the biological functions of PBP and of other coactivator molecules. For example, SRC-1 with its histone acetyltransferase activity has been found to be a crucial coactivator under in vitro conditions (3.Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), whereas mice deficient in SRC-1 appeared essentially normal, implying redundancy in nuclear receptor coactivator functions (18.Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 19.Qi C. Zhu Y. Pan J. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Subbarao V. Pulikuri S. Hashimoto T. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We now show, that in contrast to SRC-1 gene deletion, the PBP gene deletion in mice is embryonic lethal after 11.5 days post coitus. Our data also demonstrate that the PBP gene is important for establishing embryonic vascular network in the placenta; the placental defect in PBP−/− mutants shares a great similarity with that occurring in PPARγ-deficient mice. The genomic DNA fragment containing the full-length PBP gene was obtained by screening a mouse 129/Sv P1 bacteriophage library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) using polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-CTCAGAGTGCCCTCTTTGAT-3′ and 5′-TCCCTAATTCTCCAGTGGTC-3′ designed from mouse PBP cDNA sequence (10.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A 2.3-kilobase fragment extending from nucleotide position 38 of exon 10 into intron 11 and a 3.0-kilobase fragment from intron 14 to nucleotide position 19 of exon 16 were inserted into the pPNT targeting vector. The targeting vector contained the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter/neomycin gene (Neo), as well as the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (hsv-tk) gene to allow the use of a positive-negative selection scheme. The final targeting construct, designated pPNT-PBP, is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The NotI-linearized targeting vector (40 μg) was electroporated into HM1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (20.Selfridge J. Pow A.M. McWhir J. Magin T.M. Melton D.W. Somatic Cell Mol.

Surviving colonies were screened for homologous recombination event by PCR with two pairs of primers, P1/P2 and P3/P4. Although P2 (5′-CCTCTGTTCCACATACACTTC-3′) and P3 (5′-TCCAGACTGCCTTGGGAAAA-3′) are located in the neomycin gene, primers P1 (5′-GCTCCCTTGGATAAGATT-3′) and P4 (5′-CTTTGAACAACTTTGGCAATGAA-3′) are located in exons 9 and 16, respectively, outside the homologous recombinant region (Fig. 1 A). Two positive ES cell clones among 120 were identified and injected into 3.5-day-old C57BL/6 blastocysts. Chimeric male mice obtained were then bred to C57BL/6 females to produce F1 heterozygous mice, which were then interbred. DNA from embryos and from the tail tips of 3-week-old mice was genotyped by PCR amplification using primer pair P7 (5′-CCTTCTTTCTCCGCAGTCAC-3′) from exon 12 and P8 (5′-AGTGATGAGTTCATACAGGGG-3′) from exon 13 to detect the wild type allele (Fig. 1, A and D) and primer pair P5 (5′-CCACAGTCGATGAATCCAGAA-3′) and P6 (5′-TGAATGAACTGCAGGACGAGG-3′) from the neomycin cassette to detect the targeted allele. For light microscopy, tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For electron microscopy, whole E10.5 placentas were fixed overnight in cold 3% glutaraldehyde, washed, and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide. Thin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a JEOL 100CX-II electron microscope at 80 keV. E10.5 embryos were dissected from the uterus and cut into small pieces. Each embryo was incubated twice with 5 ml of trypsin with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 10 min. After each digestion, dissociated cells were aspirated, and the trypsin in the digestion medium was neutralized with an equal amount of culture medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in fresh medium, and then plated on a 6-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were seeded at approximately 30% confluence onto 35-mm dishes at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After 24 h, when the cells had become 60–70% confluent, they were transfected using the LipofectAMINE-2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids pCMV-PPARγ, PPRE-TK-LUC, pCMV-RXR, and RXRE-TK-LUC were as described previously (14.Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ was used as a cotransfectant serving as a control for transfection efficiency. Cell extracts were prepared 36 h after transfection and were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Total RNA extracted from fibroblasts using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used in the one-step RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was performed using a pair of primers, 5′-TCTGTATAATCTCCCAGGGG-3′ from exon 6 and 5′-TCAAGAAGGAACACGCAGGA-3′ from exon 12, for 30 cycles of: 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s. Homogenates from fibroblasts isolated from E10.5 embryos were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-PBP antibodies as described (17.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa III, R. Atkins G.B.

PBP contains two LXXLL signature motifs located at amino acid positions 589–593 and 630–634, respectively, which are considered necessary and sufficient for interaction between coactivators and nuclear receptors (9.Torchia J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Accordingly, disrupting this LXXLL-containing region of the PBP gene eliminates the interaction of PBP with PPARγ and other nuclear receptors. The targeting vector was designed to delete exons 12–14 and replace this region with the phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin transgene (Fig.1). Even if there is a successful splicing between exons 11 and 15, the normal open reading frame of PBP from amino acids 269 to the last amino acid 1560 will be disrupted. ES cells were electroporated with targeting vectors and subjected to positive and negative selection. Cells carrying the mutant allele were identified by PCR spanning of the recombinant regions; these cells were then used to produce mice heterozygous for the PBP mutation. Genotype analysis indicated that mating between wild type and PBP+/− mice resulted in the expected approximately 50% frequency of PBP+/− offspring. Mice heterozygous for the disruptedPBP gene were phenotypically normal and indistinguishable from their wild type littermates. When the PBP+/− were intercrossed, no homozygous mutant mice were found among 43 pups born, a statistically significant deficiency compared with the expected Mendelian frequency, whereas PBP+/+ and PBP+/−progeny were found at a 1:2 ratio. To determine the stage of lethality, we genotyped the embryos at different developmental time points. No PBP−/− embryos were detected at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and beyond. At E10.5 and at earlier gestational periods, PBP−/− embryos were viable and recovered at the Mendelian ratio of approximately 25% (Table I). Although the heartbeat was observed in a majority of E11.5 embryos, few were moribund or dead or had started to degenerate. The viable PBP−/− embryos recovered at E11.5 were smaller in size and displayed overall growth retardation compared with the wild type and heterozygous littermates (Fig. 1 E). Histological analysis of homozygous embryos around days E10.5 and E11.5 revealed some differences, such as reduced thickness of the myocardium as compared with wild type embryos (data not shown).Table IEmbryonic lethality of PBP null miceStageNo. of embryosGenotype+/++/−−/−P1aP, postnatal day.4315280E13.510370E12.512580E11.5349187E10.5306168E9.59243a P, postnatal day. Open table in a new tab Establishing the embryonic vascular network in the placenta is essential for the development of embryos. Recent studies demonstrated that embryonic lethality in PPARγ mutants around E10.5 is a reflection of placental vascular defects (21.Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano O. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the PBP mutation is lethal around E11.5, we reasoned that vascular defects might ensue in PBP null placenta because PBP serves as a coactivator for PPARγ (14.Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The absence of PBP, therefore, might adversely affect PPARγ function. In E11.5 PBP null placentas, we found appreciable differences in the fetal and maternal vascular channels compared with wild type placentas (Fig. 2). At E11.5, the labyrinthine zone of the wild type placenta is composed of strands of diploid trophoblast cells and a network of extra-embryonic capillaries interspersed with maternal blood sinuses (Fig.2 A). In contrast to the enrichment of fetal vessels in the labyrinth of wild type and heterozygous placentas, the labyrinth zone in the PBP mutant placenta was poorly developed, with a less distinct network of embryonic capillary blood vessels (Fig. 2 B). Abnormal clumps of cells with few interspersed vessels were prominent in the PBP null placenta (Fig. 2 B). Electron microscopic analysis of normal placental tissue depicts the characteristic three-layer (layers I, II, and III) zone between the maternal blood sinuses and the endothelium lining the fetal vessels (Fig.2 C). Layer III, which abuts the fetal side, is abundantly rich in lipid droplets as compared with layers I and II (Fig.2 C). In PBP null placenta, clear demarcation of the zone between maternal and fetal vasculature is less pronounced because of the abundance of trophoblastic tissue (Fig. 2 D). In these PBP mutant placentas, there is evidence of erythrophagocytic activity of the trophoblast cells (Fig. 2 E), which is also an indication of vascular defects. To demonstrate that the homologous recombination introduced in the PBP gene results in abolishing the expression of PBP, we examined PBP transcripts with RT-PCR using RNA extracted from fibroblasts derived from PBP−/− embryos. PBP mRNA was present in fibroblasts derived from the wild type embryo but not in fibroblasts isolated from PBP−/− embryos (Fig.3 A). This result was further confirmed by Western blot analysis, as it showed no detectable PBP protein in PBP−/− cells (Fig. 3 B). As a nuclear receptor coactivator, PBP has been shown to facilitate transactivation of ligand-bound nuclear receptors under in vitro conditions (10.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

We investigated PPARγ and RXRα function in fibroblasts derived from PBP null embryos to ascertain the function of these nuclear receptors in the absence of PBP. Fibroblasts were isolated from wild type (PBP+/+), PBP+/−, and PBP−/− mouse embryos at E10.5 gestational age, and transcriptional activities of PPARγ and RXRα were evaluated by overexpressing the receptor along with a responsive element-directed reporter gene. Although PPARγ did demonstrate a ligand-dependent transcriptional activity in both PBP+/− and PBP−/− fibroblasts, the activity was lower than that exhibited by fibroblasts derived from wild type embryos (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with RXRα.Figure 4PPAR γ- and RXRα-mediated transcriptional activation of reporter expression in PBP null cells. Fibroblasts isolated from wild type (+/+), heterozygous (PBP+/−), and homozygous (PBP−/−) mouse embryos were cotransfected with 1.5 μg of reporter construct PPRE-TK-LUC, 0.25 μg of pCMV-mPPARγ, and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 10−5m BRL-49653. The activity obtained on transfection of the PPRE-TK-LUC in the absence of ligand with fibroblast from wild type mouse embryo was taken as 1. Results are the mean ± S.D. of four independent transfections and are normalized to the internal controls of β-galactosidase expression. Transfection analysis for RXRα was performed in the same way as for PPARγ, except using RARE-TK-LUC, pCMX-RXRα, and 9-cis-retinoic acid as ligand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous evidence suggested an important role for PBP as a coactivator for PPARγ and for other nuclear receptors (10.Zhu Y.

PBP has also emerged recently as a central piece in a large multiprotein coactivator complex comprising TRAP/DRIP/ARC, which has been shown, in reconstructed transcription systems, to be required for transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors, such as SP1 and NF-κB (2.Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14.Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This multiprotein complex, lacking histone acetyltransferase activity, connects to the nuclear receptor-RXR heterodimer through PBP, implying that the PBP molecule is a pivotal regulator of the nuclear receptor signaling (1.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar,2.Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this paper, using homologous recombination, we demonstrate that PBP is indispensable for embryonic development because a complete absence of this protein leads to embryonic death around E11.5 of development. These observations clearly establish the absence of redundancy between PBP function and that of any of the many known nuclear receptor coactivators. The observation that mice homozygous for the disrupted PBP gene die around E11.5 of the embryonic stage indicates that PBP is apparently not essential for the basic processes of pattern formation, cellular proliferation, and differentiation, at least until the early stages of organogenesis. The failure to survive beyond this point indicates that PBP is essential for the later developmental stages of mouse embryogenesis. The death of embryos at about mid-gestation has been encountered in a number of null mutations induced by gene targeting (22.Copp A.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 87-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For example, mice homozygous for N-myc (23.Charron J. Malynn B.A. Fisher P. Stewart V. Jeanotte L. Goff S.P. Robertson E.J. Alt F.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2248-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), PPARγ (21.Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano O. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), and RXRα (24.Sapin V. Dolle P. Hindelang C. Kastner P. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) die during gestational stages E9.5 and E11.5; some of these mutations, in particular, PPARγ (29) and RXRα (24.Sapin V. Dolle P. Hindelang C. Kastner P. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), cause abnormal placentation, which possibly contributes to embryonic lethality. To determine whether the retardation in the growth of the PBP−/− embryos is the result of placental defects, sections of placenta were examined by light and electron microscopy. Very few fetal vessels in PBP−/− placenta are able to penetrate into labyrinthine layer, suggesting a maturation block of trophoblast. These defects possibly compromise maternal-fetal exchange functions, leading to growth retardation and death of PBP−/− embryos. These observations provide the first glance at the essential function of PBP in the development of the chorioallantoic placenta. More importantly, the abnormality displayed by the PBP−/− placenta shares a striking similarity at both the histological and ultrastructural levels with the PPARγ (21.Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano O. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar) and RXRα (24.Sapin V. Dolle P. Hindelang C. Kastner P. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) null phenotypes. The similarities in placental defects provide the first in vivo clues to the role of PBP as coactivator for PPARγ and RXR. PPARγ expression was discerned in the placenta beginning at E8.5; the placental defects observed in the absence of PPARγ might readily explain the death of the null embryos at around E10.5 (21.Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano O. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). PBP expression was detected in the mouse embryo beginning at E9.5, and its expression was robust in many organs at E13.5 (10.Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus, PBP mutation might affect the function of PPARγ and other critical nuclear receptors at this mid-gestational period. Many coactivators isolated to date interact nonselectively with ligand-bound nuclear receptors and facilitate their transactivation under in vitro conditions. Unlike with SRC-1, in which thein vivo function can be compensated by other coactivators (18.Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 19.Qi C. Zhu Y. Pan J. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Subbarao V. Pulikuri S. Hashimoto T. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), our results now show that the loss of PBP cannot be compensated by other coactivators. Thus, PBP gene disruption differs greatly from that of SRC-1 gene disruption in that mice null for SRC-1 are viable and fertile (18.Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 19.Qi C. Zhu Y. Pan J. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Subbarao V. Pulikuri S. Hashimoto T. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); this indicates a functional redundancy of SRC-1. This activity may be compensated by functionally similar coactivators such as ACTR (7.Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chkravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), CBP/p300 (4.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W.

The mechanisms for nuclear receptor transcriptional activation calls for a multistep model. Initially, chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF and SAGA are recruited to relieve the repressive action of chromatin (2.Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is followed by complexes such as CBP/p300/SRC-1 with histone acetyltransferase activity for further chromatin unfolding (13.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The third step then necessitates the recruitment of complexes TRAP/DRIP/ARC with PBP as an anchor for the initiation of transcription (2.Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to the embryonic lethality of PBP null mutation, the PBP null fibroblast still exhibited, albeit at a somewhat reduced capacity, ligand-dependent activation of both PPARγ and RXR transcriptional activity under the in vitrotransactivation conditions, possibly because the transient templates are not assembled into phased arrays of a nucleosome and are constitutively hypersensitive.

After immunopurification on a GT335 affinity column, two prominent proteins of ∼50 kDa were observed. They were identified by microsequencing and mass spectrometry as NAP-1 and NAP-2, two members of the nucleosome assembly protein family that are implicated in the deposition of core histone complexes onto chromatin. Strikingly, NAP-1 and NAP-2 were found to be substrates of an ATP-dependent glutamylation enzyme co-purifying on the same column. We took advantage of this property to specifically label and purify the polyglutamylated peptides. NAP-1 and NAP-2 are modified in their C-terminal domain by the addition of up to 9 and 10 glutamyl units, respectively. Two putative glutamylation sites were localized for NAP-1 at Glu-356 and Glu-357 and, for NAP-2, at Glu-347 and Glu-348.

They are formally similar to each other, consisting of the addition of a variable number of glutamyl units, in the case of polyglutamylation, or of glycyl units in the case of polyglycylation. In both cases, the first unit is linked by an amide bond between its α-amino group and the γ-carboxylic group of a glutamate residue of the polypeptide chain. Additional units are linked together by isopeptidic bonds, thus leading to the formation of a linear side chain of amino acid residues, which extends from the main polypeptidic chain and exhibits a second C terminus. In some cases, especially for polyglycylation, several glutamate residues of the polypeptide can be modified, leading to the formation of several side chains (8.Redeker V. Rossier J. Frankfurter A.

The sites of modification are located in the C-terminal region of α- and β-tubulin, which are known to be exposed on the surface of the MT1 lattice and to interact with various microtubule associated proteins. Polyglutamylation and polyglycylation are thought to profoundly affect the tridimensional structure of these domains and to interfere with the binding of essential effectors involved in MT function. Tubulin polyglutamylation is a very old modification, widely distributed among species, from protozoa to mammals. It is relatively abundant in centrioles, basal bodies, cilia, and flagella but is not restricted to these very particular structures. For instance, in neurons, ∼90% of α-tubulin and ≥50% of β-tubulin are polyglutamylated (13.Audebert, S., Koulakoff, A., Berwald, N. Y., Gros, F., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1994) J. Cell Sci. 2313–2322Google Scholar). Modification of the α-tubulin subunit is triggered at the beginning of neurite extension, while the β subunit is modified much later, during a phase probably related to neuronal maturation (13.Audebert, S., Koulakoff, A., Berwald, N. Y., Gros, F., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1994) J. Cell Sci. 2313–2322Google Scholar, 14.Eddé B. Denoulet P. De Néchaud B. Koulakoff A. Berwald-Netter Y. Gros F. Biol. Cell. 1989; 65: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The modification occurs also, but at much lower levels, in proliferative non-neuronal cells, such as HeLa or 3T3 cells (15.Bobinnec Y. Moudjou M. Fouquet J.P. Desbruyères E. Eddé B. Bornens M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 39: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In these cells, interphasic microtubules are poorly glutamylated while other structures like mitotic spindle MTs, and especially MTs of the centrioles, are more highly glutamylated (15.Bobinnec Y. Moudjou M. Fouquet J.P. Desbruyères E. Eddé B. Bornens M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 39: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistent with its wide distribution, tubulin polyglutamylation is believed to be involved in multiple functions. In vitro blot overlay assays strongly suggest that the polyglutamyl side chain of tubulin can regulate differentially the binding of various microtubule-associated proteins, in a manner dependent on the length of the side chain (16.Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17.Larcher J.C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These results are of particular interest because binding of microtubule-associated proteins strongly influences MT dynamics and is particularly important during neuronal differentiation, where plasticity and rigidity of the axodendritic processes must be precisely regulated in relation with environmental cues. Indications that polyglutamylation is involved in other biological processes come from ex vivo experiments using a mAb raised against glutamylated tubulin (GT335). For instance, mAb GT335 was shown to strongly inhibit the motility of demembranated, re-activated spermatozoa. Interestingly, the amplitude of the beating waves was strongly reduced while the frequency was unaffected (18.Gagnon C. White D. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Eddé B. Desbruyères E. Paturle-Lafanechère L. Multigner L. Job D. Cibert C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that introduction of mAb GT335 into HeLa cells by either microinjection or electroporation leads to the unexpected disappearance of the centrioles and the dispersion of the pericentriolar material (19.Bobinnec Y. Khodjakov A. Mir L.M. Rieder C.L. Eddé B. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1575-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Whether polyglutamylation and polyglycylation are specific for tubulin or are common to other proteins was not yet known. Recently, we examined polyglutamylation of tubulin in HeLa cells and its variations during the cell cycle (20.Regnard, C., Desbruyères, E., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1999) J. Cell Sci. 4281–4289Google Scholar). In the course of that study, we observed a minor reactivity of mAb GT335 with proteins comigrating with tubulin on SDS-PAGE but not on two-dimensional PAGE. The possibility that this reactivity corresponded to a particularly high background seemed unlikely since other very abundant proteins were not labeled at all. In this report, we show indeed that proteins other than tubulin are subjected to polyglutamylation and identify two nucleosome assembly proteins as new targets for this modification. NAP-1 and NAP-2 are recognized by mAb GT335 in both their native and denatured states and are substrates of a polyglutamylase activity present in HeLa cells. The sites of modification have been localized in the very acidic C-terminal domains of both proteins, which bear up to 9–10 glutamyl units. Examination of other cell types and organisms indicates that polyglutamylation of NAPs appears as a general phenomenon. These results provide new insights for studying the regulation of NAP function. They furthermore suggest that polyglutamylation might be a more general posttranslational modification than previously believed. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. SDS-PAGE (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) was performed on 8% acrylamide, 0.11% bisacrylamide, slab gels (8 cm long) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS (90% pure; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Isoelectric focusing in denaturing 9.5 m urea cylindrical gels (12 cm long) was performed as described (22.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a mixture of pH 3.5–10 and 5–8 (1:4) ampholytes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Saclay, France). Second dimension was performed on 24-cm-long slab gels as described above. Exposures of radioactive gels were performed at −80 °C, typically for 2–4 weeks, using XAR-5 films (Eastman Kodak Co.) after enhancement with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Electrotransfer of polyacrylamide gels was performed onto nitrocellulose (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (23.Towbin H. Staehelin S. Gordon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44922) Google Scholar). mAb GT335 was biotinylated and incubated simultaneously with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, as described (20.Regnard, C., Desbruyères, E., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1999) J. Cell Sci. 4281–4289Google Scholar). α- and β-tubulin were detected by DM1A (1:5000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Tub 2.1 (1:2000, Sigma), respectively. Anti-NAP-1 hybridoma supernatant (mAb 4A8; Refs. 24.Ishimi Y. Sato W. Kojima M. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1985; 10: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 25.Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Y. Ishimi (Mitsubishi-Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) and was diluted 1:20. All steps were performed at 4 °C. HeLa cells were extracted in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, each at 10 μg/ml). The high speed supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. mAb GT335 (25 μg) was diluted in TBS and preincubated 3 h with 25 μl of a suspension of agarose beads coupled to protein G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a rotatory agitator. After washing with TBS, the beads were incubated overnight with the HeLa supernatant (400 μl, 10 mg/ml). After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 2 × 30 μl of extraction buffer containing 1 m NaCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. mAb GT335 (1 ml, 7–10 mg of Ig) was purified by affinity on a tubulin column and coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Hi-Trap columns (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. High speed supernatant of HeLa cells, obtained as described in the previous paragraph, was diluted in TBS to a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml and loaded on the column (50 mg/ml of gel) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After extensive washing with TBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100, bound proteins were eluted by increasing the NaCl concentration to 0.65 m. This was sufficient to break the ionic interactions involved in the antigen-antibody binding. The eluted fractions were detected by their absorbance at 280 nm, pooled, supplemented with protease inhibitors, and concentrated on an Amicon ultrafiltration device (2 ml, cut-off 10,000, Millipore). The yield of this last step was highly variable, ranging from 20% to 70%. Proteolytic fragments of proteins X and Y (see Fig. 3) were obtained according to the method of Aebersold et al. (26.Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Briefly, after one-dimensional or two-dimensional PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred on nitrocellulose. After Ponceau Red staining, the bands or spots were excised from the nitrocellulose sheets, saturated with 20 mg/ml PVP40 (Sigma), and incubated overnight at 30 °C, under constant agitation in digestion buffer (Tris 50 mm, pH 8) containing 2.5 μg/ml Trypsin (sequence grade, Promega). In the experiment presented in Fig. 4, reversed phase chromatography was performed on an HPLC system (Waters) with a C18 column (Brownlee, 2.1 × 220 mm) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Solution A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solution B was 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid, 70% acetonitrile in water. A gradient of 5–50% B in 50 min followed by 50–100% B in 20 min was developed. In the experiments presented in Fig. 7, a DEAE column suitable for HPLC was used (AX300, Brownlee, 4.6 × 100 mm) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Solution A was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and solution B was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 1 m NaCl. A linear gradient of 0–100% B was developed. The main glutamylated peak eluted at ∼0.75 m NaCl. In the experiment presented in Fig. 7 A, an on-line flow radioactivity detector (Flo-One, Radiomatic, Packard Instruments) was placed immediately after the UV detector. The radioactive signals were accumulated for 9-s intervals. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out to desalt the radioactive peptides eluted from the DEAE chromatography. A column (1 × 50 cm) of Trisacryl gel GF05 (IBF, France) with a separating range of 300–2500 Da was used at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Radioactive peptides were followed by counting an aliquot of each fraction and eluted just before the salt peak. Before being analyzed by microsequencing and mass spectrometry, the fractions were concentrated under speed vacuum. The enzymatic assay was performed as described previously (27.Regnard C. Audebert S. Desbruyères E. Denoulet P. Eddé B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8395-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (final pH: 8.7), 2 mm ATP (equilibrated to pH 7 with NaOH), 8 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, andl-[3H]glutamate (45–55 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To increase the radioactive signal, the [3H]glutamate solution was concentrated 10-fold under speed vacuum and added at a final concentration of 50 μm. Incubation was performed at 30 °C, usually for 1 h. For the assay presented in Fig. 6, concentrated affinity-purified fraction was used at a final protein concentration of 0.11 mg/ml, in the presence or absence of tubulin polyglutamylase partially purified from mouse brain (fraction IV of Ref. 27.Regnard C. Audebert S. Desbruyères E. Denoulet P. Eddé B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8395-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, at a final concentration of 0.04 mg/ml) or from HeLa cells (phosphocellulose-purified fraction of Ref. 20.Regnard, C., Desbruyères, E., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1999) J. Cell Sci. 4281–4289Google Scholar, final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml). Quantitation of the radioactivity incorporated in the different proteins was performed by scintillation counting of the protein bands after one-dimensional PAGE and electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose sheets, as described previously (20.Regnard, C., Desbruyères, E., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1999) J. Cell Sci. 4281–4289Google Scholar). A duplicate sample (10 μl) of that presented in Fig.6 A (lane 3) gave ∼1000, 500, and 800 dpm for the 52-, 48-, and 40-kDa proteins, respectively. If each of these species accounts for 10% of proteins present in the fraction, specific radioactivity could be grossly estimated to ∼10,000, 5,000, and 8,000 dpm/μg protein, respectively. For the preparative experiment presented in Fig. 7, affinity-purified fraction was assayed at a final protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml in the presence of 50 μm l-[3H]glutamate (in the absence of any exogenous tubulin polyglutamylase). After incubation, the reaction mixture (0.8 ml) was mixed with unlabeled affinity-purified fraction (10 ml) before loading on one-dimensional PAGE. A total of 100,000 dpm were recovered in the proteolytic peptide fraction of NAP-1 plus NAP-2. Of these, 5% (5,000 dpm) were analyzed in Fig. 7 A, and the remainder was used for the preparative chromotography shown in Fig.7 B. The specific activity attained for NAPs in these conditions could be estimated from amino acid sequencing data. The aliquot of fraction A loaded on the sequencer contained 10,000 dpm and 24 pmol of NAP peptides, thus corresponding to a specific radioactivity of ∼400 dpm/pmol, that is to say that 4 × 10−3pmol of Glu/pmol of peptide were incorporated. Thus, in the conditions used for labeling the glutamylation sites in vitro, the overall level of glutamylation of native NAPs was not significantly affected. Edman sequencing was performed using a a 494-HT Procise apparatus (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reversed-phase samples were spotted on glass fiber disks treated with Biobrene (1.5 mg). The ion-exchange fractions were adsorbed onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and centrifuged at 500 ×g in Prospin tubes deprived of the 3-kDa ultrafiltration membrane, washed with 10% methanol, dried, and treated with 0.1 mg of Biobrene prior to loading onto the sequencer. A Hewlett-Packard MALDI-TOF G2025 equipment was utilized for reversed-phase separated peptides using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix (Hewlett Packard). For the analysis of the ion-exchange separated peptides, mass spectra were acquired with a Voyager DE-PRO (PE-Biosystems) MALDI-TOF device, in linear mode, with dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix (Sigma). Western blotting analysis of HeLa cell soluble extract with GT335, a mAb directed against the polyglutamylated motif of tubulin (28.Wolff A. de, N. B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar), revealed several reactive proteins of 48–52 kDa that fall within the region of migration of α- and β-tubulin. Two additional bands of ∼66 and ∼180 kDa were also detected after long exposure (Fig.1, lanes 2 and3). We showed previously by two-dimensional PAGE analysis that one of the reactive proteins indeed corresponds to glutamylated β-tubulin but that other ones of similar M rare more acidic than α- and β-tubulin (Ref. 20.Regnard, C., Desbruyères, E., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1999) J. Cell Sci. 4281–4289Google Scholar, see also Fig.3). Whether the reactivity observed with non-tubulin components was an artifact related to denaturation by SDS or indicated the presence of polyglutamylation in these proteins was first tested by carrying out immunoprecipitation experiments in TBS buffer. A strong enrichment of the same reactive proteins was observed in the immunoprecipitate, indicating that they are efficiently recognized by mAb GT335 under native conditions (Fig. 1, lane 6). Preparative scale purification of the immunoreactive proteins was performed by affinity chromatography on a GT335 column. SDS-PAGE analysis of the affinity-purified fraction showed the presence of prominent proteins with apparent M r of 40 and 48–52 kDa and a less represented one of ∼200 kDa (Fig.2 A, lane 3). Probing of the immunopurified fractions with mAb GT335 (Fig. 2 B) revealed a strong enrichment of the 48–52- and 66-kDa species. A faint band corresponding to the 180-kDa species was also detected. In some experiments, this band was much more intense, most likely depending on the efficiency of the transfer onto nitrocellulose. The 66- and 180-kDa species were not observed on the stained blots but could be detected after silver staining of gels run in parallel (data not shown). All the reactive proteins observed in the affinity-purified fraction were no longer detected in the flow-through, indicating that they have been efficiently retained on the column. Some of the proteins present in the affinity-purified fraction, such as the 40- and 200-kDa species, did not react with mAb GT335 on immunoblots. These proteins were probably retained on the column via their interaction with GT335-reactive proteins. However, we cannot exclude that they are recognized by the mAb only in their native form (see “Discussion”). When the affinity-purified fraction was analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE electrophoresis, two prominent spots, denoted X and Y, were observed in the 50-kDa mass range (Fig.3 A). Two other much less intense spots were also present in the same region (horizontal arrows). These four spots were all labeled by mAb GT335 proportionally to their relative abundance (Fig.3 B). An intense labeling corresponding to glutamylated β-tubulin was also observed although the protein was not detected by Coomassie Blue staining, which indicates a stronger reactivity of mAb GT335 toward glutamylated tubulin. None of the three ∼40-kDa proteins resolved in these gels (arrowheads) was detected by mAb GT335. We focused this study on the identification of the most abundant proteins in the affinity-purified fraction, proteins X and Y. Tryptic peptides were obtained after digestion of the excised two-dimensional spots and fractionated by reversed phase chromatography on a C18 column. Several well resolved peaks (Fig.4) were analyzed by automated Edman degradation and mass spectrometry (TableI). All of the peptides analyzed resulted in amino acid sequences and mass values that allowed identification of proteins X and Y as members of the nucleosome associated protein family, NAP-2 and NAP-1, respectively (29.Hu R.J.

Kojima M. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1985; 10: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25.Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, this mAb reacted very strongly with the 48–52-kDa proteins enriched in the affinity-purified fraction. On two-dimensional gels, mAb 4A8 strongly labeled proteins X and Y, corresponding to NAP-2 and NAP-1, respectively, and faintly labeled the two minor species also detected by mAb GT335 (Fig.5 B). Although this antibody was obtained using NAP-1 as immunogen, it also recognized the spot corresponding to NAP-2. This is consistent with the suggested epitope of mAb 4A8 previously described to recognize the domain of NAP-1 from amino acids 290–305, and in particular the sequence FNF also present in NAP-2 (25.Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodetection with mAb 4A8 indicated that ∼50% of the total NAPs present in the extract were retained on the GT335 column. This result suggests the existence of two subpopulations of NAPs, one being glutamylated and recognized by mAb GT335 and the other one not. It was not possible to directly identify the fractions corresponding to the glutamylated peptides in the bulk of the eluted peptides. We thus searched for a way to specifically label glutamylated peptides and allow their efficient detection. For this purpose, the affinity-purified fraction was incubated, in the presence of [3H]glutamate and MgATP, with partially purified preparations of mouse brain or HeLa cell tubulin polyglutamylase, as described previously (20.Regnard, C., Desbruyères, E., Denoulet, P., and Eddé, B. (1999) J. Cell Sci. 4281–4289Google Scholar, 27.Regnard C. Audebert S. Desbruyères E. Denoulet P. Eddé B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8395-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Glutamate incorporation into proteins was followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Proteins of 180, 48–52, and 40 kDa were labeled similarly with either enzyme preparation (Fig.6 A, lanes 1 and 2).

https://openalex.org/W2068948015,"Cooperation between integrins and growth factor receptors plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The function of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can be regulated by cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) even in the absence of ligand. We investigated the pathway involved in integrin-mediated RTK activation, using RON, the receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein. Adhesion of RON-expressing epithelial cells to ECM caused phosphorylation of RON, which depended on the kinase activity of both RON itself and c-Src. This conclusion is based on these observations: 1) ECM-induced RON phosphorylation was inhibited in cells expressing kinase-inactive c-Src; 2) active c-Src could phosphorylate immunoprecipitated RON from ECM-stimulated cells but not from unstimulated cells; and 3) ECM did not cause RON phosphorylation in cells expressing kinase-dead RON, nor could active c-Src phosphorylate RON immunoprecipitated from these cells. The data fit a pathway in which ECM-induced integrin aggregation causes both c-Src activation and RON oligomerization followed by RON kinase-dependent autophosphorylation; this results in RON becoming a target for activated c-Src, which phosphorylates additional tyrosines on RON. Integrin-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation also depended on both EGFR and c-Src kinase activities. This sequence appears to be a general pathway for integrin-dependent growth factor RTK activation."

It is also distinctive in its ability to post-translationally interact with light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins (LHCP), hydrophobic proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm and targeted to the thylakoid via the stroma. LHCP integration into thylakoid membranes requires the two subunits of cpSRP, cpFtsY, GTP, and the membrane protein ALB3. It had previously been shown that the L18 domain, an 18-amino acid peptide between the second and third transmembrane domains, and a hydrophobic domain are required for interaction with cpSRP. In the present study we used a pull-down assay, with cpSRP43 or cpSRP54 fused to glutathione-transferase, to study interactions between cpSRP43, cpSRP54, LHCP, and cpFtsY. cpFtsY was not observed to form significant interactions with any of the proteins even in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs. Our data indicate that cpSRP43 binds to the L18 domain, that cpSRP54 binds to the hydrophobic domain, and that LHCP and cpSRP54 independently bind to cpSRP43. These data confirm that the novel post-translational interaction between LHCP and cpSRP is mediated through binding to cpSRP43.

Our data indicate that cpSRP43 binds to the L18 domain, that cpSRP54 binds to the hydrophobic domain, and that LHCP and cpSRP54 independently bind to cpSRP43. These data confirm that the novel post-translational interaction between LHCP and cpSRP is mediated through binding to cpSRP43. signal recognition particle chloroplast SRP chloroplast FtsY light-harvesting chlorophyll protein the 18-amino acid domain on LHCP that binds to cpSRP glutathioneS-transferase a GST-cpSRP43 fusion protein a GST-cpSRP54 fusion protein preprolactin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) 5′- guanylylimidodiphosphate. SRP1 is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein that mediates the co-translational targeting of endomembrane and secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and of polytopic membrane proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 1.Walter P.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). All cytoplasmic forms of SRP contain an RNA and a 54-kDa GTPase, SRP54. SRP54 plays a major role in SRP-dependent targeting, where it binds to nascent chains via an interaction with hydrophobic domains of signal sequences. The bound ribosome-nascent, chain mRNA is piloted to the membrane in part because of the affinity of SRP for its membrane-bound receptor. Upon binding its receptor, SRP dissociates from the nascent chain, and translation resumes at the membrane. A specialized organellar SRP identified in chloroplasts (cpSRP) (3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S.

The known substrates of cpSRP are the LHCPs, hydrophobic proteins that are synthesized in the cytoplasm and post-translationally transported to the internal membranes of the chloroplast via a soluble pathway that proceeds through the stroma (9.Cline K.

Biochem. 1990; 194: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The solubility of LHCP is maintained in the stroma by its binding to cpSRP to form the targeting intermediate termed the transit complex (8.Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11.Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Localization of LHCP to the thylakoid membrane further requires two additional soluble components, GTP (12.Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and chloroplast FtsY. The latter is a homolog of the SRP receptor α subunit (6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the thylakoid membrane localized translocon needed for translocation of LHCP into the lipid bilayer is composed minimally of the integral membrane protein ALB3 (14.Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The unique ability of cpSRP to bind LHCPs post-translationally prompted a comparison of mammalian and chloroplast SRPs. In co-translational assays, both SRPs exhibited similar substrate binding properties in which signal peptide hydrophobicity played an important role (15.High S. Henry R. Mould R.M. Valent Q. Meacock S. Cline K. Gray J.C. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, DeLille et al. (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) found that the bovine preprolactin (PPL) signal sequence, which acts as an efficient substrate for cpSRP binding in co-translational assays (15.High S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), lacks the recognition elements necessary to support post-translational binding to cpSRP. This finding suggested that different recognition elements present in LHCP are required for the formation of an LHCP/cpSRP transit complex (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An investigation of the LHCP structural properties required for post-translational binding to cpSRP determined that two domains of LHCP are important for binding to cpSRP, a hydrophobic domain and a unique recognition element that is used to promote post-translational interaction (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The latter element was determined to be an 18-amino acid hydrophilic domain (L18) located in the stroma between the second and third transmembrane domains. In the present study, we have examined interactions between LHCP, cpSRP54, cpSRP43, cpFtsY, and cpSRP reconstituted from individual subunits. Our data indicate that the post-translational interaction between LHCP and cpSRP largely involves binding of the L18 domain to cpSRP43. The second interaction between a hydrophobic domain of LHCP and cpSRP is shown to involve cpSRP54. The construction of the 54HIS translation vector (pAF1) and G43 expression vector (pGEX4Tchaos(m)) were described by Schuenemann et al. (3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I.

The construction of G54 expression vector (pGTK+54HIS) and FtsY translation vectors (pTu1) were described in Tu et al. (6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Preprolactin and the LHCP preprolactin translation vectors H*, L18PPL, and L33PPL were described by DeLille et al. (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The collection of pea stroma and the methods for formation of the transit complex were described previously (3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6.Tu C.J.

Radiolabeled LHCP precursor, H*, and L33PPL (0.15 μCi) synthesized in wheat germ extracts (17.Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were mixed with either pea stroma (equivalent to 80 μg of chlorophyll), 160 ng of cpSRP54 synthesized in wheat germ extract (3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), or recombinant cpSRP43 (50 ng) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 55 mmsorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP in a final volume of 15 μl for 15 min at 25 °C. The transit complex was fractionated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (11.Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and detected by fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant G43 was over-expressed from pGEXchaos(m) in the Escherichia coli strain BL21, whereas G54 was over-expressed from pAF1 in the E. coli strain XL1-Blue (MRF). The over-expression and purification of recombinant G43 has been described (3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For over-expression of G54, cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg Ampicillin to an A600 of 0.8 at 30 °C. The expression was induced by adding 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h. Cells were collected, sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Phenylmethylsufonylfluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefablok), and the extract incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The over-expressed G54 proteins were eluted in 10 mm glutathione in lysis buffer. Recombinant G43 protein (0.1 μg), recombinant G54 (0.1 μg), radiolabeled LHCP precursor (2.4 μCi), 54HIS synthesized in wheat germ extract (0.6 μCi), and in vitro translated FtsY protein (2.4 μCi) were combined as indicated. The proteins were diluted into incubation buffer (final concentration: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mmKOAc, 10 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 120 μl and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C (6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reactions were mixed end-over-end with 70 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were transferred to a Wizard minicolumn (Promega) and washed three times with 1.5 ml of washing buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.3 m KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1% Tween 20). The samples were eluted by suspending the beads in 45 μl of 10 mm glutathione in incubation buffer for 20 min at 25 °C followed by brief centrifugation. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 13% acrylamide gels and detected by fluorography using Amplify according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblot analyses of G43 and G54 were as described (6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The L18 peptide sequence corresponding to the sequence NH4-VDPLYPGGSFDPLGLADD-COO from LHCP residues 189–206 was synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Protein binding was conducted as described above using either GST43 (0.1 μg) and radiolabeled LHCP precursor (2.4 μCi) or GST43 and radiolabeled 54HIS (0.6 μCi) in the presence of 0, 5, 10, 25, and 100 μmL18 peptide, respectively. To look at interactions between cpSRP subunits, cpFtsY, and LHCP, we developed a pull-down assay using glutathione S-transferase fused to cpSRP43 (G43) or cpSRP54 (G54). The GST-fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. Purified GST was used as a control. GST or GST-fusion protein was incubated with the indicated radiolabeled translation products, and the resulting solution was passed over glutathione-Sepharose. The fusion protein and material bound to it were eluted with glutathione, and the eluates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B). None of the translation products bound to the column in the presence of GST alone (for example, see Fig. 2). Fig.1 A, lanes 1–3, shows the extent of binding of cpSRP54, cpFtsY, and LHCP to G43. Consistent with previous reconstitution experiments (3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), more than 30% of the cpSRP54 bound to G43. Unexpectedly, a significant amount of LHCP also directly bound to G43. The amount of cpFtsY interacting with G43 under the conditions of the assay was low but detectable. Binding of cpFtsY to G54 was also minimal (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Some LHCP was found to interact directly with G54; however, the amount bound was less than 2% of that which bound to G43 (Fig. 1 A, lane 3 versus lane 5). Pairwise combinations of cpSRP54, LHCP, and cpFtsY were simultaneously incubated with G43, and little to no variation in binding was observed compared with incubations with G43 and the individual proteins (Fig. 1, B, lanes 1–3 versus A, lanes 1–3). When LHCP and cpFtsY were simultaneously incubated with G54, the level of LHCP binding to GST54 was similar compared with binding in the absence of cpFtsY (Fig. 1, B, lane 4 versus A, lane 5). When all four proteins were present simultaneously, there was no further change in the amount of binding (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). The cpFtsY binding was minimal in all cases tested (Fig. 1, A, lanes 2 and4 and B, lanes 2–5). The binding data were unaffected by the presence of GTP, GTP-γ-S, and GMP-PNP (data not shown), suggesting that the binding of cpSRP54 and LHCP to cpSRP43 is unaffected by the presence of GTP or GTP analogs. Together, these data indicate that cpSRP43 and, to a lesser extent, cpSRP54 directly bind to LHCP.Figure 2The L18 domain of LHCP binds to cpSRP43. A, diagram of constructs made between LHCP and preprolactin. The sequence of the L18 domain from the LHCP, Lhcb1, is shown: 1 PPL, only the first 30 residues of preprolactin are displayed; 2 L18-PPL, residues 189–206 of LHCP fused to L13 of preprolactin; 3 L33-PPL, residues 189–222 of LHCP fused to L13 of preprolactin; 4 H*, residues 189–222 of LHCP fused to V18 of preprolactin. The signal sequence of preprolactin isunderlined. B, results of a pull-down assay in which 3 μCi of the indicated radiolabeled translation product is incubated with 0.1 μg of the indicated glutathione S-transferase protein, as described under ”Materials and Methods.“ Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 13% acrylamide gels and detected by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The L18 domain, a hydrophilic region derived from the stromal loop between the second and third transmembrane domains of LHCP (Fig. 2 A), has been shown to be important for interaction with cpSRP (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this context, pull-down assays were utilized to investigate the interactions between each subunit of cpSRP and the L18 domain, using constructs illustrated in Fig. 2 A. LHCP and bovine PPL were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. LHCP contains three transmembrane domains, whereas PPL contains a single hydrophobic domain in the N-terminal signal sequence. For the construct L18PPL, the L18 domain of LHCP was fused to the N terminus of full-length PPL. When incubated with stroma, this construct forms a transit complex with cpSRP (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A second construct, L33PPL, which contains the L18 domain plus an additional 15 amino acids downstream from L18 fused to PPL beginning at the PPL signal peptide hydrophobic domain, also forms the transit complex when incubated with stroma (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). H* is similar to L33PPL with the exception that the first five leucines in the H-domain of the PPL signal sequence have been deleted. This type of mutation destroys the co-translational interaction between the signal sequence and cytoplasmic SRP (18.High S. Flint N. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, H* does not form a transit complex when incubated with stroma (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The binding of LHCP, PPL, H*, and L18PPL to GST, G43, and G54 are shown in Fig. 2 B. As also observed in Fig. 1 A, LHCP binds G43 more extensively than it binds G54. The interaction with G54 appears to be significant, as no LHCP binds to GST alone. The negative control, PPL, does not bind to any of the three GST proteins. In contrast, the two PPL constructs containing the L18 domain, H* and L18PPL, bind G43 nearly as well as LHCP binds. The two PPL constructs bind to G54 less effectively than LHCP. These data clearly demonstrate that cpSRP43 binds the L18 domain. Furthermore, a hydrophobic sequence in the substrate protein is not required for this binding. The transit complex formed between cpSRP and LHCP can be demonstrated as a soluble form of LHCP that migrates into nondenaturing gels (11.Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the absence of cpSRP, LHCP aggregates and remains at the top of the gel (Fig. 3 lane 1; Refs. 3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 8.Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The finding that H* and PPL did not form transit complexes when incubated with stroma provided strong evidence that both a hydrophobic domain and the L18 domain are required for transit complex formation (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fact that a transit complex can be reconstituted from cpSRP43, cpSRP54, and LHCP allows us to test this hypothesis explicitly (6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The transit complex formed between LHCP and pea cpSRP migrates more slowly than the complex formed from native or reconstituted Arabidopsis cpSRP (Fig. 3, lane 2 versus lane 3, and Ref. 3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Despite the efficient binding of cpSRP43 with LHCP, no complex is formed when cpSRP54 is lacking (Fig. 3, lane 4). Likewise, the complex does not form in the absence of cpSRP43. Reconstitution assays with L33PPL and H* are consistent with previous observations (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The transit complex can be reconstituted with L33PPL, cpSRP43, and cpSRP54 but not when the substrate is H*. As H* efficiently interacts with cpSRP43 but not with cpSRP54, these data clearly demonstrate that a hydrophobic domain and cpSRP54 are required to form a transit complex. The binding sites for LHCP and cpSRP54 on cpSRP43 have not been mapped. To examine whether distinct binding sites are present on cpSRP43, we added L18 peptide to compete with either LHCP or cpSRP54 for binding to G43 in a pull-down assay. The cpSRP54 used was a 1:4 mixture of wheat germ translation products translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and cold methionine, respectively. The LHCP was radiolabeled by translation in wheat germ extracts containing [35S]methionine. The G43 was expressed in E. coli and detected by specific antisera. Fig.4 shows that LHCP binding to cpSRP43 is competed by as little as 5 μm L18 peptide. In contrast, no competition of cpSRP54 binding to G43 is observed with as much as 100 μm L18. L18 peptide had no effect on the binding of G43 to the glutathione-Sepharose column (Fig. 4, lower panel). Together these data clearly demonstrate that LHCP and cpSRP54 bind distinct sites on cpSRP43. One distinctive feature of the LHCP targeting reaction is the post-translational interaction between LHCP and cpSRP. The novel interaction has been attributed to the unique presence of the 43-kDa subunit in the chloroplast SRP (3.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7.Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) This notion has been further substantiated by the results of the present study. Two cpSRP binding domains have previously been identified in LHCP, a hydrophobic domain and the L18 domain (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using a post-translational pull-down assay, we show that the L18 domain is necessary and sufficient for binding to cpSRP43. By comparison, the interaction of cpSRP54 with the L18 domain is negligible and likely to be insignificant. It was previously observed that Arabidopsis plants lacking cpSRP43 exhibit a specific defect in LHCP biogenesis (7.Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19.Amin P. Sy D.A. Pilgrim M.L. Parry D.H. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This specificity can now be attributed to the binding of cpSRP43 to LHCP proteins containing an L18 domain. As cpSRP43 binds two distinct proteins, LHCP and cpSRP54, the possibility arose that the cpSRP43 binds these two proteins at independent binding sites. A competition study using L18 peptide revealed that the two proteins indeed bind cpSRP43 independently. The L18 peptide has been successfully used to compete with LHCP transit complex formation and integration reactions containing stroma (16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, in these studies L18 peptide was 10–100 times less effective than LHCP, which is an effective competitor at 1–2 μmlevels. A possible explanation, that the L18 peptide is unstable in stroma, is corroborated by the present study, where we observed competition of LHCP using 5 μm concentrations of L18 peptide in the absence of stroma. Thus, we have further substantiated the utility of L18 peptide as a tool for the study of LHCP biogenesis. Although cpSRP43 can efficiently bind to LHCP, from prior reconstitution studies it is clear that a functional cpSRP requires cpSRP54. Although direct evidence is lacking that cpSRP54 binds the hydrophobic sequence, the following indirect evidence strongly suggests this possibility. First, a hydrophobic domain on the substrate and cpSRP54 are required for the formation of a transit complex (Ref. 16.DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholarand this work). Second, substrates lacking the hydrophobic domain still bind efficiently to cpSRP43 (this work). Third, cross-linking studies indicate that cpSRP54 directly binds to LHCP (8.Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Fourth, it is well known that cytoplasmic SRP54 binds to hydrophobic sequences (20.Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Bielka H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1986; 320: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As very little post-translational binding occurs between cpSRP54 and LHCP (or PPL), we favor the idea that the initial interaction between LHCP and cpSRP occurs through the binding of the L18 domain to cpSRP43. cpSRP43 was found to be a dimer (6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, it is not known whether LHCP binding to cpSRP43 requires the dimeric state. The initial binding between LHCP and cpSRP43 should facilitate an interaction between the hydrophobic domains of LHCP and cpSRP54. Although only one hydrophobic domain is required for a productive interaction between cpSRP and LHCP, LHCP has three such domains. It remains to be determined whether all three hydrophobic domains of LHCP are sequestered from the aqueous phase by interacting with cpSRP. If so, cpSRP has additional distinctive properties compared with cytoplasmic SRP. By interacting with its substrate co-translationally, cytoplasmic SRP54 only binds to a single signal sequence. In the case of cpSRP, additional hydrophobic binding sites could be contributed by cpSRP43. However, because L18 quantitatively competed for the LHCP binding site, we consider this possibility unlikely. Alternatively, if the binding of the hydrophobic domains is exclusively the role of cpSRP54, it raises the possibility that this protein is capable of binding to multiple domains on the substrate or to a single preferred domain that induces a partially folded and stable conformation of LHCP. By interacting with the hydrophobic domains of LHCP, cpSRP presumably functions as a chaperone that maintains the integration competence of LHCP. A second role may be to pilot LHCP to the thylakoid membrane. The role of cpFtsY remains poorly understood, although it and GTP are clearly required for the integration of LHCP into thylakoid membranes (6.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12.Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We observed negligible binding between cpSRP and cpFtsY even in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP. In this regard the interaction between cpFtsY and cpSRP is distinguishable from that of SRP and its receptor (21.Connolly T. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Science. 1991; 252: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This apparent difference may be a reflection of the fact that the chloroplast proteins have evolved to accommodate cpSRP43."

Although no specific biological function has been attributed to the SCAN domain, its predicted amphipathic secondary structure led to the suggestion that this domain may mediate protein-protein associations. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified members of two SCAN domain protein families that interact with the SCAN domain of the zinc finger protein ZNF202.

Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Most SCAN domain sequences are linked to Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs through their carboxyl-terminal end. Although the function of the SCAN domain has not yet been elucidated, the predicted amphipathic structure of the domain led to the suggestion that SCAN box elements have the capacity to interact with other proteins, in particular with components of the transcriptional machinery (1.Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The zinc finger protein ZNF2021 is expressed in two common splice variants, here referred to as m1 and m3 (2.Monaco C. Helmer Citterich M. Caprini E. Vorechovsky I. Russo G. Croce C.M. Barbanti-Brodano G. Negrini M. Genomics. 1998; 52: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whereas the m1-splice form encodes a full-length protein of 648 amino acids with a SCAN box, a KRAB repression domain, and eight Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs, the 133 amino acid product of the m3-splice form encompasses only the SCAN domain. 2S. Wagner, unpublished results. These splice forms are conserved in the murine ZNF202 homolog, suggesting that the SCAN motif itself is an independent functional domain. 3S. Morham, L. Huwyler, and M. Toth, unpublished results. The existence of other genes that encode SCAN elements as an isolated structural feature is further demonstrated by the recent identification of the murineLeap1/PCG-2 gene (GenBankTM accession AF106473) (3.Castillo G. Brun R.P. Rosenfield J.K. Hauser S. Won Park C. Troy A.E. Wright M.E. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3676-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In order to study the function of the SCAN domain, we performed an extensive yeast two-hybrid screen for the identification of SCAN binding proteins. The screen, supported by biochemical association studies, suggested that SCAN motifs have the ability to associate selectively with each other. Furthermore, the first human gene encoding an isolated SCAN domain was identified. The formation of SCAN domain-mediated protein complexes may therefore modulate the biological function of transcription factors. A Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4-DBD) fusion construct was generated by ligating a cDNA fragment of ZNF202 (amino acids 1–199) encompassing the SCAN domain into the Gal4p DNA-binding domain vector pGBT-C (bait Z1) (4.Bartel P.L. Roecklein J.A. SenGupta D. Fields S. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Additional Gal4-DBD fusion constructs contained the SCAN domain of SDP1, amino acids 1–179, or ZNF191, amino acids 1–204. The Gal4-DBD constructs (“baits”) were transformed into the mating type yeast strain J692. Gal4 activation domain (Gal4-AD) libraries (“prey”) from human B-cell, liver, kidney, and brain cDNA were obtained fromCLONTECH and transformed into the α-mating type yeast strain J693. Individual Gal4-AD fusion constructs of ZNF202 encoded amino acids 1–44 (Z6), 1–171 (Z7), 202–328 (Z8), and 235–278 (Z10). Yeast strains containing the bait plasmid and the activation domain library were mated on filters and plated on minimal media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine but containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2-triazole. After incubation for approximately 8 days at 30 °C, the colonies that grew on the triple dropout media were subjected to a β-galactosidase assay (5.Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Positive cDNA clones were sequenced and analyzed for homologies using the BLAST program (6.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA for SDP1 was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments from Marathon cDNA libraries (CLONTECH). The cDNAs were sequenced on both strands by fluorescent-labeled dye primer sequencing on ABI 377 sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The assembled sequence was confirmed by sequencing a representative EST cDNA (GenBankTM accession number N75095; IMAGE Consortium cDNA clone 284448 obtained from Genome Systems). Labeled SDP1 probes were synthesizedin vitro in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from a cDNA template encompassing the open reading frame using random primers and Klenow enzyme (Promega) and were used to probe multiple human tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH). Hybridization analysis was carried out in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) at 65 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The blots were then stripped of radioactivity and reprobed with a 32P random prime-labeled glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (CLONTECH) to confirm equal loading. The cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–199 (Z1) and 177–329 of the ZNF202-m1 open reading frame were subcloned directionally into the pGEX-4T bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the ZNF191 cDNA which includes the SCAN domain was subcloned into pGEX1. The entire open reading frame of the SDP1 cDNA was subcloned directionally into pGEX-4T. All constructs were sequenced through the junctions to verify sequence fidelity and orientation. Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins was done as described (7.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Purity and integrity of the fusion proteins was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie Blue staining (8.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeling of GST-ZNF202[SCAN] was performed as detailed (9.Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Wong T.W. Hanafusa H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 ml of fresh LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) is inoculated with an overnight bacterial culture and grown for 3 h at 37 °C. The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2 mm glutamate and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) but lacking cysteine and methionine and was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 10 min. Tran35S-label (ICN) was then added (5 mCi), and the incubation was continued for 2 h. The purification and elution was according to the standard procedure, and the eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The GST fusion protein was thrombin-cleaved according to the procedure of Smith (10.Smith D.B. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 220-229Google Scholar). Briefly, bead-coupled fusion protein was resuspended in cleavage buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 and treated with 0.1% w/w thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifugation to extract the beads, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ZNF202 antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with the GST-ZNF202[KRAB] protein fragment that encompasses amino acids 177–329 of the ZNF202-m1 open reading frame. Antigen-specific antibodies were isolated from the polyclonal antiserum by immunoaffinity purification using an UltraLink™ immobilization column (Pierce). Anti-Xpress™ epitope mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. A polymerase chain reaction amplicon of the ZNF202-m1 open reading frame was subcloned into the expression vector pBIND (Promega) to afford pGal4-ZNF202-m1. The SDP1 open reading frame was directionally subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/His vector (Invitrogen) which encodes an amino-terminal Xpress epitope™. HEK 293 cells (2.5 million in a 100-mm dish) were transfected with expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) per manufacturer's recommendations. Control plates were transfected with green fluorescent protein and were inspected by fluorescent microscopy after 24 h to confirm >40% transfection efficiency. After 48 h, cells were removed from the plates, were pelleted by centrifugation, and then were lysed in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer that contained 1.0% Triton X-100 in Tris-HCl-buffered saline in the presence of sodium azide and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For each precipitation, 50 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 1 μg of monoclonal antibody against the Xpress tag (Invitrogen) or 2 μl of affinity purified anti-ZNF202 KRAB domain antibody in a total volume of 0.25 ml of binding buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline with sodium azide). Immune complexes were permitted to form for 2 h at 4 °C on an orbital mixer. Protein-A Sepharose slurry (40 μl, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and rocked for an additional hour. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation; the supernatant was removed, and the pelleted beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The beads were finally mixed with 40 μl of reducing loading buffer and heated prior to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels. Reference samples (10 μl) of the lysates were loaded on each gel to confirm expression of the constructs and to permit an estimation of precipitation efficiency. Immunoblotting was performed under standard conditions using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon). Immobilized proteins were renatured overnight in binding buffer. Binding buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. After renaturation, the membranes were probed with either 35S-labeled GST-ZNF202[SCAN] or GST-cleaved ZNF202[SCAN] protein at 2 μg/ml binding buffer for 6 h. After washing the membrane in binding buffer three times, bound GST fusion protein was detected by autoradiography. A cDNA amplicon encoding the ZNF202-m3 splice form was subcloned into the NdeI-cloning site of the pET11a expression vector (Novagen). The expressed SCAN protein of 133 amino acids was purified over a cation exchange column using a POROS HS20 column (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography. The analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. A purified protein sample of approximately 1.0 mg in 100 μl of column equilibration buffer was loaded on the column and was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were analyzed by absorbance at 280 nm and by the Bradford method for protein detection (Bio-Rad). The column was calibrated with bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) as protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the postcentrifugation measurement of sedimentation equilibrium, 1.0 mg of purified protein sample was layered on top of a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient established in equilibration buffer. As molecular weight standards, aldolase (154 kDa) and ovalbumin (43 kDa) were analyzed onto a second gradient, whereas bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) was eluted onto a third gradient. Centrifugation was carried out in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 23 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected from the bottom to the top of the gradient, and the presence of protein was analyzed by the Bradford method. For chemical cross-linking experiments, a purified ZNF202-m3 sample of 1.6 mg/ml (0.1 mm protein) concentration was incubated with 0.4 or 2 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was subsequently quenched with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. A recombinant HtrA protease (a dodecamer in solution) and bovine serum albumin (a monomer) were used as cross-linking control samples in parallel reactions (11.Kim K.I. Park S.C. Kang S.H. Cheong G.W. Chung C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). DNAs encoding the m1- and m3-splice form of ZNF202, SDP1, ZNF191 along with two SCAN domain encoding cDNA clones (mLD5–1, the murine homologue of LD5–1 or ZNF192: GenBankTM accession number NM006298; Zfp110, the murine neurothrophin receptor interacting factor: GenBankTM accession number MMU242914; mFPM315, the murine homologue of FMP315: GenBankTM accession number O14978) were directionally subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) or pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). The cDNA templates were subsequently expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT T7 Quick Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's procedure. GST fusion proteins (1.0 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2.0 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate sample expressing a SCAN domain encoding cDNA template supplemented with HNTG buffer to a final volume of 200 μl. HNTG buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were subsequently added for 40 min to collect the protein complexes. All samples were washed three times with ice-cold HNTG buffer, boiled in electrophoresis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography using an autoradiographic image enhancer (National Diagnostics). A yeast two-hybrid approach was used to search for proteins that interact with the SCAN domain in vivo. The amino-terminal end of ZNF202 (amino acids 1–199) was fused in frame to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and was used as bait (Z1) to screen independently brain, kidney, liver and B-cell Gal4 activation domain libraries (Fig. 1 A). The screen resulted in the isolation of 48 interacting cDNA clones, 42 of which encoded a SCAN homology domain (Fig. 1 B). Five cDNA clones corresponded to ZNF191, 28 to SDP1 (SCAN domain protein 1), 4 to SDP2, and 5 to SDP3. Whereas ZNF191 encodes a SCAN domain-containing zinc finger protein, the novel SDP1 cDNA of 0.9 kilobases was found to encode an isolated SCAN box without adjacent zinc finger motifs. The presence or absence of zinc finger motifs in SDP2 and SDP3 is unknown since the respective cDNAs are incomplete. An additional yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with a SDP1 bait and a kidney library that resulted in the isolation of five SCAN domain encoding cDNA clones (Fig. 1 B). One cDNA clone corresponded to SDP1, indicating self-association, three clones represented SDP2, and one cDNA clone was identical to GenBankTM EST N29000 encoding SDP4. All individual interactions were subsequently confirmed by domain swap experiments (data not shown). In order to further define the ZNF202 binding domain, additional ZNF202 Gal4 activation domain fusion constructs were directly probed with SCAN domains derived from ZNF202 (Z1), ZNF191, or SDP1 (Fig. 1 A). The directed yeast mating reactions demonstrated that amino acids 1–171 of ZNF202 (Z7), in contrast to 1–44 (Z6), were sufficient for the interaction (Fig. 1 C). The directed mating reactions indicated also the ability of ZNF202 to self-associate. In comparison, two KRAB domain-encompassing baits of ZNF202 (Z8 and Z10) did not interact confirming a sequence-specific association between these SCAN domain proteins. The yeast two-hybrid screen suggested associations between SCAN domain proteins with two distinct motif features. ZNF191 or ZNF202 represent SCAN domain-containing zinc finger proteins, whereas SDP1 is characterized, similar to the m3-splice form of ZNF202, by an isolated SCAN domain. Tissue mRNA analysis showed that the SDP1 is ubiquitously highly expressed (Fig.2 A). The homology between the SCAN domains in SDP1, ZNF191, and ZNF202 is high with 47% identical residues over an alignment of 60 amino acids (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the SCAN domains align with the conserved sequence residues published by Castillo et al. (3.Castillo G. Brun R.P. Rosenfield J.K. Hauser S. Won Park C. Troy A.E. Wright M.E. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3676-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the binding interactions of ZNF202 with ZNF191 and SDP1, we generated GST fusion proteins encompassing the ZNF202 KRAB domain or the respective SCAN boxes of these proteins. In an affinity purification study, we tested the ability of GST-ZNF202 fusion fragments to extract in vitro radiosynthesized SDP1 or ZNF191 protein from reticulocyte lysate preparations (Fig.3, A and B). The SDS-PAGE showed that the GST-ZNF202[SCAN] protein construct, in contrast to the GST-ZNF202[KRAB] or the GST tag itself, precipitated the radiolabeled SDP1 or ZNF191 protein. The ability of ZNF202 to self-associate as detected in the yeast two-hybrid screen was further validated by affinity purification studies and far Western blotting (Fig. 3, C and D). The affinity purification study confirmed the ability of the GST-ZNF202[SCAN] protein construct to precipitate radiolabeled ZNF202-m3 protein from cell lysates (Fig.3 C). In a far Western blot approach, GST-linked ZNF202 protein fragments were probed with an [35S]methionine/cysteine metabolically labeled GST-ZNF202[SCAN] protein (Fig. 3 D). The radiolabeled probe associated specifically with its unlabeled counterpart. The GST protein tag was not responsible for the observed protein complex formation. Likewise, far Western membranes of SCAN domain-encompassing GST fusion proteins probed with a radiolabeled GST-ZNF202[SCAN] fusion protein demonstrated binding of ZNF202 to SDP1, ZNF191, or ZNF202 itself (Fig.3 E). In order to test the possibility that the observed associations were facilitated by the GST protein tag, a GST-cleaved radiolabeled ZNF202[SCAN] protein was shown to maintain the association with the SDP1 fusion protein (Fig. 3 F). Because we could demonstrate association between SCAN domain-containing proteins in several experimental systems in vitro, we next sought to determine whether SCAN domain-containing proteins interact in a cellular milieu. Various expression constructs of ZNF202 and SDP1 with epitope tags were employed in co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiments in order to demonstrate intracellular associations. Fig.4 A shows an anti-ZNF202[KRAB] immunoblot of lysates from cells transfected with pGal4-ZNF202-m1 alone or with pGal4-ZNF202-m1 plus pXpress-SDP1. Lysates from these cells contain an appropriately sized (∼110 kDa) immunoreactive band (3rd and 4th lanes). The anti-Xpress immunoprecipitation of the pGal4-ZNF202-m1/pXpress-SDP1 cotransfection shows a robust band (2nd lane), indicative of intracellular association between ZNF202 and SDP1, whereas a control antibody yielded no band (1st lane). Fig. 4 B represents the reciprocal of Fig. 4 A. Instead of coprecipitating ZNF202 with antibodies to tagged forms of SDP1, Xpress-SDP1 was precipitated with anti-ZNF202[KRAB] antibody (2nd lane). Thus, in lysates from appropriately transfected cells, ZNF202 precipitates SDP1 and SDP1 precipitates ZNF202 precisely as was seen in affinity purification studies and in far Western experiments. In order to determine the stoichiometry of the ZNF202 SCAN protein complex in solution, a bacterially expressed ZNF202-m3 protein was purified over a cation exchange column and subjected to size exclusion chromatography. A fast protein liquid chromatography experiment using a prepacked Superdex-75 HR column eluted the SCAN protein in a 52-kDa molecular size fraction as calculated by plotting the logarithm of the molecular mass of the protein standards against the elution volume (Fig.5 A). In contrast, an SDS-PAGE analysis of this protein separated the denatured and thus monomeric form at 15-kDa molecular size as detected by Coomassie Blue gel staining (Fig. 5 A, inset). In addition, the postcentrifugation sedimentation equilibrium of the ZNF202-m3 protein through a 5–20% sucrose gradient was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the sedimentation profile of the m3 protein showed a well defined peak at approximately 48 kDa in the presence of 100 mm KCl. Thus, the migratory properties of the ZNF202-m3 protein subjected to size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation analysis suggest that the SCAN domain of ZNF202 forms either a trimeric complex or a modestly asymmetric dimer in a native environment. Chemical cross-linking experiments, however, did not reveal a trimeric complex but rather a dimeric species (Fig. 5 C). Thus, the combination of gel filtration, sedimentation equilibrium, and cross-linking experiments of the ZNF202-m3 protein support the presence of an asymmetric dimeric protein. In a preliminary attempt to evaluate the selectivity of the SCAN domain-mediated protein associations, we transcribed and translated in vitro cDNA templates for ZNF202-m1, ZNF191, SDP1, and three unrelated SCAN domain-containing zinc finger proteins indicated as mLD5–1, Zfp110, and mFPM315. The cell lysates were incubated with GST-fused SCAN box sequences derived from ZNF202, SDP1, or ZNF191, and the recaptured fusion proteins were analyzed for binding in vitro produced radiolabeled protein (Fig.6). All three GST fusion proteins associated strongly with radiolabeled SDP1. Conversely, the GST-SDP1 construct readily precipitated ZNF202, SDP1 itself, ZNF191, mLD5-1, and Zfp110. Therefore, the SCAN domain encoded by SDP1 revealed the highest association affinity that was also observed in the far Western experiment (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, SDP1 showed the ability to self-associate. which confirmed the interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid screen. The fusion proteins of ZNF202 and ZNF191 revealed similar affinities for the radiolabeled proteins yet differed in their affinity for mLD5-1 and Zfp110. Whereas the ZNF202 fusion protein interacted weakly with mLD5-1, the ZNF191 fusion protein precipitated Zfp110. In comparison, the GST-SDP1 construct bound both mLD5-1 and Zfp110. None of the fusion proteins interacted with mFPM315. Therefore, the individual affinity of the fusion proteins to the unrelated SCAN proteins suggests the ability of SCAN domains to associate selectively with each other. The SCAN domain is a sequence motif of unknown function that is common to zinc finger proteins. We provide evidence that the SCAN domain mediates selective protein oligomerization. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified homotypic and heterotypic interactions between SCAN domain-containing proteins. Biochemical binding experiments confirmed the interactions in vitro as well as in vivo and revealed selectivity in the SCAN domain-mediated protein associations as individual SCAN domains exhibited distinct differences in their ability to bind to other SCAN domain proteins. The structural components within a SCAN domain protein that contribute to binding selectivity and affinity remain to be elucidated. Sequence alignments of SCAN domains show a high degree of amino acid conservation that suggests that relatively few amino acids contribute to binding specificity (3.Castillo G. Brun R.P. Rosenfield J.K. Hauser S. Won Park C. Troy A.E. Wright M.E. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3676-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A hydrodynamic analysis of the ZNF202-m3 protein by gel filtration chromatography and postcentrifugation measurement of sedimentation equilibrium suggests the formation of a trimeric or asymmetric dimeric protein complex in solution. Dynamic light scattering investigations of the ZNF202-m3 protein in solution could not distinguish between these two oligomerization states. 4K. Clark and T. Stams, unpublished results. In vitrochemical cross-linking experiments, however, indicated a dimeric protein in identical buffer conditions. Therefore, we presume the ZNF202-m3 protein to form an asymmetric dimer in solution. The state of oligomerization in SCAN domain-mediated homo- or heterotypic protein associations may share similarities with the BTB/POZ domain-containing proteins (12.Bardwell V.J. Treisman R Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 13.Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). The GAGA protein has been shown to form BTB/POZ domain-mediated dimers, tetramers, and oligomersin vitro, whereas the BTB/POZ domain from the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger oncoprotein crystallized in a tightly intertwined dimer (14.Espinas M.L.

Privé G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the BTB/POZ domain formed dimer-dimer interactions in the crystals that suggested a mode of higher order protein oligomerization (16.Li X. Peng H. Schultz D.C. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Rauscher III, F.J. Marmorstein R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5275-5282PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factors are composed of functional domains that contribute to DNA binding, ligand binding, and transcriptional activation or repression (17.Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 18.Tan S. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One important regulatory mechanism affecting both DNA binding affinity as well as transcriptional activation is oligomerization (19.Chen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20.Wolberger C. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Whereas zinc finger transcription factors of the Cys2-His2 class are reported to bind DNA in monomeric form, SCAN domain-mediated association with other zinc finger proteins may modulate their biological function (21.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar, 22.Fairall L. Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

The juxtaposition of zinc finger motifs through protein oligomerization may lead to altered DNA binding activities. For example, the self-oligomerization of the amino-terminal BTB/POZ domain of the GAGA zinc finger protein resulted in increased DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity (14.Espinas M.L. Jimenez-Garcia E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernues J. Azorin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24.Katsani K.R. Hajibagheri M.A. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recently, BTB/POZ domain-mediated oligomerization of transcription factors has been suggested to serve as combinatorial codes for gene expression (25.Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K. Morita M. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1733-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The identification of the SDP1 protein establishes a new family of proteins characterized by an isolated SCAN domain. The amino acid sequence conservation between SDP1 and PGC-2 is high, and consequently SDP1 may represent the human ortholog of the murine PGC-2 protein (3.Castillo G. Brun R.P. Rosenfield J.K. Hauser S. Won Park C. Troy A.E. Wright M.E. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3676-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A third protein that contains only a SCAN domain is encoded by the m3-splice form of ZNF202. Single domain proteins that function as intermolecular regulators of transcription have been described previously. The PGC-2 protein was shown to interact with the nuclear receptor peroxosome proliferator-actived receptor γ. Upon association, PGC-2 increases the transcriptional activity of peroxosome proliferator-actived receptor γ in the absence of any intrinsic transcriptional activity of PGC-2 (3.Castillo G. Brun R.P. Rosenfield J.K. Hauser S. Won Park C. Troy A.E. Wright M.E. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3676-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The biological effect of peroxosome proliferator-actived receptor γ may be modulated through competitive binding of PGC-2 and other transcriptional cofactors. Conversely, the DNA binding activities of some basic helix-loop-helix motif-containing transcription factors were shown to be inhibited by Id proteins. The Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins, which lacks a basic DNA-binding domain, functions as a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix proteins through the formation of inactive heterodimers with intact basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (26.Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 27.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Similarly, isolated SCAN domain proteins such as SDP1 or ZNF202-m3 may modulate the formation of functional SCAN domain zinc finger transcription factors. The elucidation of the biological consequences arising from associations between SCAN domain proteins may offer new insights into the regulation of zinc finger transcription factors. Transient transfection experiments with appropriate reporter gene constructs may address the impact of SCAN domain-mediated oligomerization on gene expression. Particularly, the association of two different splice forms, such as the m1 and m3 forms of ZNF202, may represent a novel biological mechanism to regulate transcriptional activity.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) similarly reported that SCAN domain zinc finger proteins may form oligomeric associations. We thank Drs.

Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This organization is vital to the visual process, as it maximizes the area available for photoreception and allows efficient renewal of the photoreceptor outer segments. Any elements involved in the formation and maintenance of this structure are, therefore, of vital importance to the visual process. One protein that has been implicated to have such an involvement is peripherin/rds. Peripherin/rds is a 39-kDa integral membrane glycoprotein localized exclusively to the rim regions of photoreceptor cell discs (2.Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Arikawa K. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Williams D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A topological model has been proposed (4.Connell G.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) in which the protein possesses four transmembrane helices and cytosolically oriented N and C termini. The protein has been shown to form disulfide-linked homodimers (2.Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar). These peripherin/rds dimers and homodimers of the related disc rim protein ROM-1 (5.Bascom R.A. Manara S. Collins L. Molday R.S. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1171-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) are believed to non-covalently associate to form a functional heterotetrameric complex (6.Goldberg A.F.X. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7.Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The clinical significance of the human peripherin/rds gene is illustrated by its involvement in a wide range of degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa (8.Keen T.J. Inglehearn C.F. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To date, over 50 pathogenic mutations within the human gene have been identified. In addition there is a mutation in the murine gene that causes the related disorder, retinal degeneration slow (rds) (9.Van Nie R. Ivanyi D. Demant P. Tissue Antigens. 1978; 12: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Phenotypically rds mice exhibit distinctive photoreceptor degeneration (10.Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 224: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11.Hawkins R.K. Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 701-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and hence, murine rds is considered an important animal model for the inherited human retinal degenerative condition. Mice homozygous for the rds condition have no detectable peripherin/rds and fail to form outer segments. In contrast, heterozygous mice possess reduced levels of peripherin/rds and form highly abnormal outer segments, which are much shorter in length, with the disc membranes aligned in irregular whorls that appear swollen and vacuolated (11.Hawkins R.K. Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 701-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This evidence has led to the proposition that peripherin/rds plays a role in maintenance of the curvature of the rim region and the flattened vesicle morphology (3.Arikawa K. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Williams D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4.Connell G.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12.Molday R.S. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 1994; 13: 271-298Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study we provide the first direct experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis. The in vitro expression of peripherin/rds and accompanying membrane insertion of the protein have allowed examination of the effects of peripherin/rds on vesicle morphology. Electron microscopical analysis demonstrates that under non-reducing conditions peripherin/rds expression leads to a widespread flattening of microsomal vesicles. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to demonstrate that pathogenic mutants of peripherin/rds are unable to elicit this effect. The construct denoted pRDS was produced by subcloning the murine peripherin/rds cDNA (13.Travis G.H. Brennan M.B. Danielson P.E. Kozak C.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) into the pBluescript-KS expression vector under the control of the T3 promoter. A second construct containing the murine peripherin/rds cDNA under the control of the T7 promotor was also produced. In this construct the FLAG antigenic tag was incorporated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis downstream of the peripherin/rds cDNA prior to the stop codon. This construct was denoted pRDSF. In vitrotranscription and translation were performed using a TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Reactions were performed for 90 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 25 μl, using T7 RNA polymerase, 1 μg of template DNA, and 2 μl of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml, ICN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where appropriate, reactions were supplemented by the addition of 2.5 μl (5 eq) of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega; 1 eq is the amount of membranes required to cleave the signal sequence of preprolactin by 50%). For electron microscopy, [35S]methionine was omitted, and reactions were supplemented with the full complement of unlabeled amino acids. The expression of peripherin/rds in these samples was assessed by immunoblotting for the FLAG antigenic tag with the M2-anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.).N-Glycosylation was competitively inhibited by the inclusion of 32 μm Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 (10.Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 224: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Non-reducing conditions were ensured by the inclusion of 2 mm oxidized glutathione (Sigma) (14.Hayat M.A. Basic Techniques for Transmission Electron Microscopy. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 275-277Google Scholar). 20 μl of the translation mixture was diluted with 4 volumes of 10 mmTris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.9 (buffer A). The microsomal vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation (109,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A, repelleted, and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A for electron microscopy. 3.05-mm, 400-mesh copper grids were either prepared with a simple carbon film (14.Hayat M.A. Basic Techniques for Transmission Electron Microscopy. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 275-277Google Scholar) or were collodian-coated with a thin layer of carbon being applied prior to glow discharge treatment (15.Drummond D.G. J. R. Microsc. Soc. 1950; 70: 1-139Crossref Google Scholar). Samples to be viewed were applied to the grids and negatively stained by application of an aqueous solution of 4% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined in a Phillips CM10 transmission electron microscope, operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutant constructs were produced using the pRDSF construct as the template. Mutations were confirmed by double-stranded automated DNA sequencing (A.B.I.). Mutant constructs were prepared containing the C150S, C165Y, P216L, and N229S mutations. To facilitate in vitro expression and identification of the protein two constructs were produced containing the murine peripherin/rds cDNA. The construct denoted pRDS comprised the murine cDNA subcloned into the pBluescript-KS expression vector. pRDSF also comprised the murine peripherin/rds cDNA within pBluescript-KS but possessed an additional FLAG antigenic tag at the C terminus of the protein. The recombinant proteins were expressed in an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented, where indicated, with canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. The expression of pRDS and pRDSF in the absence of membranes yielded products of 36 and 38 kDa respectively (Fig. 1). In addition, pRDSF displayed immunoreactivity toward the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1 a). When expressed in the presence of microsomal membranes, both products exhibited an increase in apparent molecular mass of approximately 2.5 kDa (Fig. 1 b). However, upon inclusion of Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 the intensity of this band shift was reduced. In contrast, expression of the mutant form of peripherin/rds containing the N229S mutation yielded a product of 38 kDa in both the absence and presence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 1 c). The inclusion of Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 was observed to have no effect on this product. When expressed in the presence of membranes and 5 mmoxidized glutathione, wild-type peripherin/rds displayed an altered mobility upon SDS-PAGE1 analysis (Fig.2). In contrast to the 41-kDa species produced under reducing conditions, pRDS expression in the presence of 5 mm glutathione yielded a product with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa. In addition, a second product of approximately 66 kDa was also visualized. To investigate the role of peripherin/rds in maintaining the morphology of photoreceptor discs, electron microscopy was used to detect whether in vitro peripherin/rds expression alters microsomal vesicle morphology (Fig.3). Notably, over 60% of the microsomal vesicles expressing peripherin/rds under non-reducing conditions exhibited a highly unusual flattened morphology (Fig.3 a). In contrast, under reducing conditions all microsomes from peripherin/rds expression displayed a typical rounded morphology (Fig. 3 b). Vesicular flattening was, however, observed in microsomes from the expression of peripherin/rdsin the presence of membranes and Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 (Fig.3 c). A flattened vesicle morphology was also visualized upon expression of the N229S mutant form of peripherin/rds under non-reducing conditions in the presence of microsomal membranes (Fig.3 h). As an additional control, the four-transmembrane 16-kDa proteolipid of the vacuolar ATPase (15.Drummond D.G. J. R. Microsc. Soc. 1950; 70: 1-139Crossref Google Scholar) and the seven-transmembrane visual protein squid rhodopsin (16.Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were also expressed under reducing and non-reducing conditions. These integral membrane proteins were both unable to elicit any vesicular flattening (Fig. 3 d). Following site-directed mutagenesis, electron microscopical visualization of microsomal vesicles incorporating the C165Y (Fig.3 e), P216L (Fig. 3 f), or C150S (Fig.3 g) peripherin/rds mutants demonstrated a rounded appearance. The mapping of the rds phenotype to a genetic lesion in the cloned gene has led to the proposal that peripherin/rds plays a crucial role in the maintenance of photoreceptor disc morphology. To date, evidence for this role has come from the appearance of retinas of human and murine rds-defective individuals suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and related retinopathies. In this communication we present the first direct evidence for the ability of peripherin/rdsto alter the characteristic structure of microsomal membranes and to produce a morphology that resembles the discs of photoreceptor cells. In vitro expression of peripherin/rds from the pRDS construct successfully yielded a product of 36 kDa, in agreement with the expression of peripherin/rds in other systems. The production of a 38-kDa species from pRDSF expression corresponds to the additional mass of the FLAG antigenic tag. The immunoreactivity of the latter product to the anti-FLAG antibody confirmed this species as peripherin/rds tagged with the FLAG epitope (Fig.1 a). The increase in apparent molecular mass of peripherin/rdsobserved in the presence of microsomal membranes is indicative of theN-glycosylation of the protein (Fig. 1 b). This was confirmed as the inclusion of the competitiveN-glycosylation inhibitor Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2abolished this change in molecular mass (16.Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The magnitude of this shift in apparent molecular mass implies that only oneN-glycosylation site within the protein was utilized (16.Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This is further substantiated by the inability of the N229S mutant peripherin/rds to exhibit any shift in molecular mass in the presence of membranes (Fig. 1 c). The removal of the Asn229 N-glycosylation sequon therefore appears to completely abolish N-glycosylation of the protein, and this implies that the Asn229 sequon is entirely responsible for the N-glycosylation of native peripherin/rds. As N-glycosylation occurs on the luminal side of microsomal membranes (16.Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and all of the putative N-glycosylation sites within peripherin/rds are predicted to occur in an extracytosolic loop, the N-glycosylation of peripherin/rds in this system also indicates that the protein is oriented in the vesicles in accordance with the current topological model. Therefore it would seem that microsomal expression resembles peripherin/rds expression in photoreceptor outer segments, with the protein traversing the membrane and having its two intradiscal loops in the lumen of the sealed vesicles and its N and C termini exposed to the extracellular environment. Physiologically, the expression of peripherin/rds is believed to lead to the formation of a functional heterotetrameric complex (6.Goldberg A.F.X. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7.Goldberg A.F.X. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) by the non-covalent association of disulfide-linked dimers of peripherin/rds and ROM-1 (13.Travis G.H. Brennan M.B. Danielson P.E. Kozak C.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that the inclusion of 2–5 mm oxidized glutathione in a translation reaction promotes disulfide bond formation (17.Scheele G. Jacoby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12277-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments reported here illustrate the ability of peripherin/rds alone to form a 66–69-kDa cross-linked dimer when expressed in vitro under non-reducing conditions (Fig.2). In addition to dimerization, an increase in mobility of approximately 3 kDa was observed for both the glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of the protein in the presence of 5 mm oxidized glutathione. This is indicative of the presence of at least one intramolecular disulfide linkage in addition to the intersubunit bonds within the protein. Together these findings suggest that the expressed protein is folded correctly and integrated into the microsomal membrane in the correct orientation. Electron microscopical investigation of the ability of peripherin/rds to elicit any alterations in microsomal vesicle morphology produced a dramatic result. The finding that over 60% of microsomal vesicles from the expression of peripherin/rds displayed an uncharacteristic flattened morphology supports the proposed role of peripherin/rds in maintenance of a flattened photoreceptor disc morphology. This flattening results in regions where both sides of the vesicle can be seen to run parallel to each other, as well as tight turns within the membrane, reminiscent of a disc rim. In contrast, under reducing conditions the microsomes showed a typical rounded morphology (Fig.3 b). As vesicular flattening is only seen under conditions conducive to the formation of disulfide linkages, it would appear that disulfide bond formation and probably dimerization of peripherin/rds is required for the morphological effect, presumably by constraining a particular structural feature. We have also shown that N-glycosylation of peripherin/rdsdoes not appear to be a prerequisite for vesicular flattening, as inhibition of this modification by Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 does not alter the percentage of flattened vesicles seen under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3 c). This result was confirmed by analysis of the peripherin/rds mutant incorporating the N229S mutation (Fig. 3 h). The inability of this mutant to display a band shift in the presence of microsomal membranes demonstrates that the removal of the Asn229 N-glycosylation sequon completely abolishes N-glycosylation of peripherin/rds (Fig. 1 c). The vesicular flattening observed with this mutant form of peripherin/rdstherefore further verifies that the N-glycosylation of peripherin/rds is not a prerequisite for this ability of the protein. The inability of the 16-kDa proteolipid of the vacuolar ATPase (18.Holzenberg A. Jones P.C. Franklin T. Heimburg T. Marsh D. Findlay J.B.C. Finbow M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and squid rhodopsin to elicit such an effect demonstrates the specificity of this peripherin/rds-induced flattening. This also distinguishes the roles of peripherin/rds and rhodopsin in the pathogenesis of retinitis pigmentosa. To determine whether the loss of this function may be responsible for the abnormal disc appearance in retinitis pigmentosa, several retinitis pigmentosa-inducing mutants of peripherin/rds were produced by site-directed mutagenesis of the pRDSF construct. The P216L and the C165Y mutants were chosen as they have been shown to cause retinitis pigmentosa in humans and in transgenic mice (19.Souied E. Gerber S. Rozet J.M. Camuzet A. Dufier J.L. Soubrane G. Coscas G. Munnich A. Kaplan J. Vision Res. 1995; 35 (suppl.): 221Google Scholar, 20.Kajiwara K. Hahn L.B. Mukai S. Travis G.H. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P.

The C150S mutation was selected as this side chain may be important in protein dimerization (22.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The observation that peripherin/rdsincorporating the C165Y or P216L mutations is unable to induce vesicular flattening is of particular clinical significance. These results imply strongly that retinitis pigmentosa-causing mutations may precipitate the disorder by abolishing the ability of peripherin/rds to flatten disc membranes. Another interesting observation was that the C150S peripherin/rdsmutant also abolished vesicular flattening (Fig. 3 g). This is consistent with recent proposals that this residue plays a crucial role in the dimerization of the protein (22.Goldberg A.F.X. Loewen C.J.R. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and that dimerization is necessary for the function of peripherin/rds. Although it has not yet been linked to a retinopathy, we postulate that any mutation of this residue will be associated with a pathogenic mutation in the future. Almost a decade after the first suggestion of a structural role for peripherin/rds in stabilization of the photoreceptor outer segment discs (4.Connell G.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), these data provide the first direct experimental evidence in support of this role. It has also been suggested that peripherin/rds may promote membrane fusion (23.Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli Jr., A.A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, no evidence for that activity was seen in these studies. The approach described in this study may provide a tool by which the involvement and mechanisms by which dysfunctional forms of peripherin/rdsprecipitate retinal degenerative disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa may be delineated. Further mutational analysis should allow the determination of the precise sites in the protein that are important to this critical function of peripherin/rds and ultimately may aid research into therapeutic approaches alleviating this form of retinal degeneration. We are grateful to Dr. G. H. Travis for the generous gift of murine peripherin/rds cDNA. We also thank Professor Reinhart A. F. Reithmeier for kindly donating the glycosylation inhibitor acetyl-NYT-amide."

In the absence of the PH domain RalGPS 1B cooperated with Grb2 to promote Ral activation, indicating that SH3 domain interaction also contributes to RalGPS regulation.

Ras proteins exist predominantly in their inactive GDP-bound state in resting cells. However, upon activation by extracellular stimuli guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 promote the release of GDP from Ras, permitting GTP, which is present in molar excess in the cytoplasm, to associate with Ras (1.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 2.Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This GTP-bound Ras adopts an active conformation and signals to downstream effector proteins such as Raf, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and RalGDS (reviewed in Ref. 1.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) subsequently enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras resulting in its rapid return to the inactive GDP-bound state. In addition to the classic Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras proteins, ∼15 other GTPases make up the Ras sub-group of the Ras superfamily. These include R-Ras, TC21/R-Ras2, M-Ras/R-Ras3, RalA and B, Rap1A and B, Rap2A and B, Rit, Rin, Rheb, Rhes, and Dex-Ras (1.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Although the function of many of these GTPases remains to be determined, they are presumably all regulated by a similar GDP/GTP cycle to Ras. However, only a limited number of Ras GEFs have so far been identified that regulate Ras family GTPases; Sos, GRF and GRP for Ras, C3G, CalDAG1 and Epac for Rap1, and RalGDS family members for Ral (2.Quilliam L.A.

The catalytic domains of mammalian Ras GEFs share approximately 30% homology with each other and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC25 (2.Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 8.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify the upstream GEFs and extracellular ligands responsible for the activation of Ras sub-family GTPases we searched the National Center for Biotechnology Information DNA sequence databases for novel cDNAs sharing catalytic domain homology with existing Ras family GEFs. We identified a family of GEFs that contain a catalytic/CDC25 homology domain, a proline-rich PXXP motif similar to SH3 domain binding motifs (9.Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffmann N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (10.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that this family of GEFs promotes GTP loading of the Ral GTPase in vivo, binds to the SH3 domain-containing adapter proteins, Grb2 and Nck, and requires their PH domain for bioactivity. We refer to these exchange factors as RalGPS for Ral/PH/SH3-binding GEFs. The RalGDS family of Ral GEFs (consisting of RalGDS, Rgl, and Rgl2/Rlf) are downstream effectors of Ras (1.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). However, because of the lack of a Ras-binding RA (RalGDS/AF6 homology or Ras-associated) domain (11.Wojcik J. Girault J.A. Labesse G. Chomilier J. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12.Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) it is anticipated that this new Ral GEF family is regulated independently of Ras activation. RalGPS 1A partial cDNA was obtained as a human expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (AA121710). Further sequence was obtained by 5′ RACE using nested primers and a Marathon-Ready™ human heart cDNA library (CLONTECH). ClaI and BamHI sites were incorporated immediately 5′ of the presumed start codon by polymerase chain reaction, and RalGPS 1A (ClaI-XhoI) was inserted into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.), creating FLAG-RalGPS 1A. Full-length human RalGPS 1B (KIAA0351) was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan. The FLAG-tagged construct was prepared by purifying theXbaI-SmaI fragment of RalGPS 1B and inserting it into the XbaI-SmaI site of pFLAG-CMV2 RalGPS 1A from above. The C termini (residues 392–529 and 433–557 for RalGPS 1A and B, respectively) encompassing the PH domain were removed from RalGPS 1A/B by digesting with NcoI, blunting, and inserting the fragment (ClaI-NcoI/blunt) into theClaI-EcoRV sites of pFLAG-CMV2. The CAAX construct was generated by inserting the above (ClaI-NcoI/blunt) fragment into theClaI-EcoRV sites of pE-CAAX vector (created by G. Clark, NCI, National Institutes of Health). RalGPS 1A/B-ΔPH-CAAX was then directionally ligated into theBamHI site of pFLAG-CMV2. Ral, Rap2B, and Rheb were generously provided by D. Andres (University of Kentucky), J. de Gunzburg (Institut Curie, Paris, France), and G. Clark (NCI, National Institutes of Health), respectively. Rlf and the pGEX-RID (Ral interacting domain from RalBP1, residues 648–778) were provided by D. Andres. C3G was obtained from S. Tanaka and H. Hanafusa (Rockefeller University). SH3 domain-encoding plasmids have previously been described (13.Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21-DE3(lysE). Bacteria were lysed using a French press in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and aprotinin (0.05 TIU/ml). For GTPases, 10 μm GDP and 1 mm MgCl2 were added in place of EDTA. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and tumbled with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm EDTA (or 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 μm GDP for GTPases) and stored at 4 °C as a 50% slurry containing 0.02% NaN3 (w/v). A 1.5-kb XbaI-XhoI fragment from RalGPS 1A was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP and used to probe human multitissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) as described previously (13.Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 293T human embryonic kidney cells were cultured as described (13.Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SH3 binding assays were performed essentially as described (14.Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Three 100-mm dishes of 70% confluent 293T cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of FLAG-RalGPS 1A/B using 15 μg of NovaFECTOR/dish (Venn Nova Inc.) following the manufacturer's directions. After 72 h, cells were lysed (1 ml/100-mm dish) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% IGEPAL (Sigma), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05 TIU/ml of aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF. Ras-bound beads containing ∼20 μg of protein were mixed with empty glutathione-agarose beads (50% slurry) to give a final volume of 35 μl. The beads were rinsed twice with 1 ml of Ras buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT) and then incubated with the Ras buffer spiked with 10 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature. Approximately 400 μl of cell lysate containing FLAG-RalGPS 1A/B was added to the rinsed Ras-bound beads. This slurry was tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C and then the beads were washed 4 times with Ras buffer supplemented with EDTA to 5 mm. 293T cells were transfected with 750 ng of pFLAG-CMV2-RalA and 750 ng of the indicated GEF using 8 μl of NovaFECTOR/60-mm dish. After 24 h, serum was removed for another 18 h. Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate buffered saline, lysed with Ral buffer (0.5 ml/dish; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1% IGEPAL (Sigma), aprotinin (0.05 TIU/ml), 1 mm PMSF), and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. Approximately 10 μg of GST-RID or -Raf (residues 2–140) bound to 35 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (50% slurry) were rinsed twice with Ral buffer and then tumbled with 400 μl of cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with Ral buffer, omitting protease inhibitors. 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads, and the activated Ral proteins bound to GST-RID were visualized by immunoblotting of the FLAG-tagged Ral proteins. 293T cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-RalGPS 1B and 2 μg of either pCGN-Grb2 or -Nck using 15 μl of NovaFECTOR/100-mm dish. After 72 h the cells were lysed in 1 ml of Ral buffer. Cellular debris was removed by a 3 min, 13,000 × g spin, and the cellular lysate was precleared for 15 min at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The precleared lysate was tumbled with 3 μl of M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 5 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated by a 30-min incubation with 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. The Grb2 and Nck proteins that coprecipitated with Flag-RalGPS 1B were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Babco) following SDS-PAGE. Levels of RalGPS 1B expression were determined by M2 anti-FLAG antibody using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The catalytic (CDC25 homology) domains of Ras family GEFs share ∼30% homology with each other. Highest sequence homology is found within SCRs (structurally conserved regions) 1–3 as defined in Ref. 8.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar. Using a consensus SCR2 sequence supplemented with GRF1 residues at positions of low homology, we searched the EST database and identified several novel putative GEF sequences. One of these, AA121710, was obtained, sequenced, and found to encode the C-terminal portion of a CDC25 homology domain, as well as a proline-rich region similar to SH3 binding motifs, a pleckstrin homology domain, a stop codon, and a 3′ non-coding region (Fig. 1). This protein is referred to as RalGPS 1A. Using 5′ RACE we obtained the core catalytic domain (SCRs 1–3) but could not isolate SCR0 (also known as REM, Ras exchange motif or the conserved non-catalytic domain (15.Lai C.C. Boguski M. Broek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)), an additional N-terminal domain found in most GEFs and shown in the Sos1 crystal structure to play a role in maintaining the conformation of the catalytic domain (16.Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Subsequently an additional full-length sequence, KIAA0351 (accession number AB002349), which encoded a splice variant of RalGPS 1A, referred to subsequently here as RalGPS 1B, was entered in the NCBI database. The 5′ end of this clone extended beyond our 1A sequence and revealed a stop codon 5′ to a potential initiating ATG. This indicated that like the yeast GEF, BUD5, the RalGPS proteins do not contain the SCR0 domain (15.Lai C.C. Boguski M. Broek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RalGPS 1B contained an extra 8-amino acid insertion within loop 3 of its PH domain, a shorter, alternate C terminus, and a unique 69-amino acid central portion that replaced 27 amino acids in RalGPS 1A (Fig. 1 A). An additional mouse sequence, AA110466, appears to represent a novel family member, RalGPS 2 (Fig. 1 B), because a closely related partial human sequence (AA252781) is also present in the database. The AA110466partial cDNA was obtained and sequenced and found to similarly contain a PH domain (Fig. 1 C) and PXXP motif. SCRs 1–3 were originally defined primarily using yeast Ras GEF sequences (8.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Alignment with subsequently identified mammalian GEF sequences has revealed two other regions of high homology that are indicated as SCRs 4 and 5 in Fig. 1 B. Interestingly, SCR4, a highly conserved I/VNF motif has been reported to sit within a small hydrophobic groove formed by the SCR0 domain in the Sos1 crystal structure (16.Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Because SCR0 is absent from RalGPS, it is not surprising that charged residues (ENE) occupy the place of the INF motif of Sos1 (Fig. 1 B). Further, RalGPS family members do not have the extension in SCR3 characteristic of the RalGDS family of Ral GEFs (Fig. 1 B). A 1.5-kb XbaI-XhoI fragment of AA121710encompassing most of the RalGPS 1A/B coding region was used to probe a human multitissue Northern blot to examine mRNA expression. Three bands were observed (Fig. 2), presumably because of alternate splicing of the message. Because the full-length KIAA0351 cDNA is 6336 base pairs in length, RalGPS 1B likely represents the middle, ∼7-kb band that is ubiquitously expressed. Assuming that RalGPS 1A and B have identical 5′ ends the 1A message is predicted to be ∼2 kb and is therefore represented by the lower, 2.6-kb blot band that was preferentially expressed in heart and testis. The identity of the larger ∼12-kb doublet was not established. Therefore, similarly to GRF1 (17.Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Zippel R. Lowy D.R. Zhang K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), there are multiple spliced variants of the RalGPS GEFs that are differentially expressed in human tissues. To identify Ras substrates for RalGPS 1A and B, we first assessed their ability to bind a panel of nucleotide-free GTPases. Because GEFs bind with high affinity to Ras proteins in the absence of Mg2+/GTP or GDP and stabilize the nucleotide-free state (2.Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), epitope-tagged RalGPS 1 proteins expressed in 293T cells were incubated with GST-Ras fusion proteins that had been stripped of GDP in the presence of EDTA. As shown in Fig.3 A, nucleotide-free Ral but not other GTPases or GST bound to both RalGPS 1 splice variants. To confirm that the interaction of RalGPS with Ral resulted in nucleotide exchange we examined the ability of RalA to be loaded with GTP in vivo following cotransfection with known and putative Ral GEFs. For these assays we took advantage of the fact that the putative Ral effector RalBP1 binds preferentially to Ral-GTPversus Ral-GDP to specifically extract activated Ral from cell lysates (18.Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19.Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, there was little Ral-GTP present in serum-starved 293T cells. However, following co-transfection with the RalGDS family member Rlf or with RalGPS 1B, Ral-GTP levels were increased by an equivalent amount, indicating that RalGPS was indeed a Ral GEF. Because a trace of Rap1A binding to RalGPS was detected in some assays (see Fig. 3 A), we examined the Ras protein nucleotide exchange specificity of RalGPS. Using a GST fusion protein containing the Ras/Rap1-GTP-binding domain of cellular Raf1 to precipitate activated Rap1A from cell lysates we found that cotransfection with RalGPS 1B failed to activate Rap1A under conditions where the known Rap1 GEF, C3G, promoted significant accumulation of Rap1A-GTP in vivo. Taken together, the data in Fig. 3,A and B indicate that RalGPS 1 is a highly specific Ral GEF. We have not confirmed that RalGPS 2 is also a Ral GEF, but given the high degree of sequence conservation with RalGPS 1A/B within its catalytic domain (Fig. 1 B) this seems likely. PH domains are typically involved in protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (10.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the PH domains of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase and GRF bind to the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (20.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas most PH domains associate with the polyphosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (21.Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Comparison of the RalGPS PH domain with that of other molecules demonstrated strongest identity with the N-terminal PH domains of Tiam-1 and the Drosophila melanogaster Still life (Fig.1 C), GEFs that regulate Rho family GTPases (22.Sone M.

It has been reported that the Tiam-1 N-terminal PH domain binds to PIP3 (21.Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P.

Therefore, we deleted the PH domain from RalGPS 1B (RalGPS-ΔPH) and examined the consequence of this modification on in vivo GEF activity. As shown in Fig. 3 C, this deletion completely abrogated the ability of overexpressed RalGPS 1B to activate Ral in vivo. To address whether the PH domain might be responsible for interaction of the GEF with the plasma membrane, it was replaced with the C-terminal 18 residues of Ki-Ras that we and others have previously reported will target heterologous proteins to the plasma membrane (24.Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8512-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,25.Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N.

Upon addition of this Ras CAAX sequence to RalGPS-ΔPH, we rescued its ability to promote Ral-GTP accumulationin vivo (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that the role of the PH domain was indeed membrane targeting. It has previously been established that Ras is responsible for the recruitment of RalGDS family members to the plasma membrane and that this membrane targeting is essential for GEF activity (26.Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27.Matsubara K. Kishida S. Matsuura Y. Kitayama H. Noda M. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RA domain responsible for RalGDS association with Ras-GTP (11.Wojcik J. Girault J.A. Labesse G. Chomilier J. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12.Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) is absent from the RalGPS family and is presumably replaced in RalGPS by the PH domain. We have not established whether the sequence difference between RalGPS 1A and B in loop 3 of the PH domain affects their ligand specificity or function. However, the sequence of RalGPS 1B includes a consensus phosphorylation site for the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (KKVSI (28.Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), underlined in Fig. 1 C). Introduction of a negatively charged phosphate group at this site could inhibit binding of the PH domain to PIP3. Although full-length RalGPS 1A was expressed poorly in 293T cells, RalGPS 1A-ΔPH-CAAXactivated Ral as effectively as its 1B counterpart. 2J. F. Rebhun and L. A. Quilliam, unpublished observation. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the proline-rich motif present in RalGPS 1A/B bears sequence homology with the SH3 binding motifs of the Grb2 and Nck adapter protein targets, Sos1 and PAK. In addition to the core PXXP motif, there are surrounding proline residues to form a left-handed P3 helix plus adjacent arginine residues that help orient the peptide and confer binding specificity (9.Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffmann N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Indeed the proline-rich region in RalGPS matches consensus sequences derived for Grb2 and Nck SH3 binding peptides by phage-displayed random peptide libraries (9.Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffmann N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 14.Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K.

To examine the ability of RalGPS 1 to bind to SH3 domain-containing proteins in vitro, FLAG-tagged RalGPS 1B was expressed in 293T cells and cell lysates incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of various proteins. As seen in Fig.4 B, RalGPS 1B was precipitated by SH3 domains from Grb2, Nck, Src, and PLCγ but not those of p120 Ras GAP, Crk, Abl, or p67phox. To determine whether the interactions with adapter proteins might occur in vivo, 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged RalGPS 1B and HA-tagged Grb2 or Nck. Following lysis and precipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, both Grb2 and Nck were found to coprecipitate with RalGPS (Fig.4 C). It is well documented that Grb2 contributes to the recruitment of the Ras GEF, Sos1, to the plasma membrane, leading to Ras activation (2.Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and that the Sos PH domain also plays a role in this process (29.Chen R.H. Corbalan-Garcia S. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Association of Grb2 with Sos may also alleviate negative allosteric control imparted by the Sos C terminus (25.Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 30.Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although over-expression of Grb2 did not enhance the ability of recombinant RalGPS to activate Ral in vivo (Fig. 4), we rationalized that the adapter protein/GEF interaction likely contributes to the physiological regulation of RalGPS. Because RalGPS did not activate Ral following removal of the GEF's PH domain, we examined whether over-expression of Grb2 might enhance the activity of this ΔPH mutant. As seen in Fig. 4 D, co-transfection with Grb2 did indeed promote Ral activation by RalGPS-ΔPH, indicating that, as described for Sos1, growth factor stimulation may be responsible for promoting the translocation and/or activation of RalGPS. Because Grb2 alone did not promote Ral-GTP accumulation we can conclude that this effect was dependent on the presence of transfected RalGPS and was not due to activation of an endogenous Grb2>Sos>Ras>RalGDS>Ral pathway. This notion was further supported by failure of a dominant inhibitory Ras(17A) mutant to block the ability of Grb2 to activate Ral in the presence of RalGPS-ΔPH.2 Although Ras could potentially modulate full-length RalGPS activity in vivo via a PI3K-PIP3 pathway, surprisingly, we did not see an effect of a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002, 30 μm) on Ral activation by this GEF. As seen in Fig. 4 A, RalGPS 2 deviates from 1A and B in residues surrounding the PXXP motif. Whether this deviation affects the ability of RalGPS 2 to differentially interact with SH3 domain-containing adapter proteins will require further investigation. In conclusion, we have identified a novel family of putative GEFs that includes at least two members plus differentially expressed splice variants. RalGPS 1 specifically associated with and activated the Ras-related GTPase, Ral, when overexpressed in 293T cells. In contrast to the RalGDS family of Ral GEFs that rely on interaction with Ras-GTP for membrane translocation and Ral activation (27.Matsubara K. Kishida S. Matsuura Y. Kitayama H. Noda M. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but similarly to the Ras GEF, Sos1 (30.Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), RalGPS 1 nucleotide exchange activity is regulated in vivo by a PH domain and a Grb2-binding PXXP motif. Although Ca2+ has been reported to activate Ral in a Ras-independent manner (31.Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) there is no indication from their primary sequences that RalGPS 1A/B could respond to Ca2+ elevation. Why nature has created so many Ral GEFs and how they are differentially regulated will be the topics of future investigation. We are grateful to Chen Bi for tissue culture support and to Drs. Doug Andres, Geoff Clark, and Hidesuburo Hanafusa for plasmids."

Madin-Darby canine kidney cells wild type green fluorescent protein Infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a major risk factor for development of duodenal ulcers and has been implicated in gastric cancer (1.Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). One of the major determinants in Helicobacter disease is secretion of a 90-kDa toxin called VacA, which causes rapid intracellular vacuole formation in vitro and gastric ulceration in mice (2.Cover T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These vacuoles are acidic and are believed to be a consequence of the reorganization of the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments (3.Molinari M. Galli C. Norais N. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R.

Although it is accepted that VacA plays a key role in the pathogenesis of H. pylori, relatively little is known about how the toxin works or the intracellular mechanisms that regulate the reorganization of the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Recent data suggest that multiple VacA molecules may complex to form membrane-spanning pores, and there is evidence that implicates the GTP-binding protein Rab7 in the formation of the hybrid late endosomal-lysosomal compartments (5.Czajkowsky D.M.

Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar). It is well established that over-expression of constitutively active mutants of Rac1 results in increased pinocytic activity, and more recent reports have indicated that Rac1 and other members of the Rho family play an important role in a variety of other membrane trafficking events (10.Bretscher M.S.

Members of the Rho family have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of microrganisms including Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri (16.Mounier J. Laurent V. Hall A. Fort P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Given the known links between Rac1, membrane trafficking, and microbial pathogenesis, we were interested in whether the pathogenic events associated with H. pylori infection are regulated by members of the Rho family. In this study we demonstrate that activity of the VacA cytotoxin is regulated by Rac1. SCC12F keratinocytes were cultured using the method of Rheinwald and Green (18.Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3933) Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (19.Hotchin N.A. Watt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14852-14858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK1 cell lines, stably expressing N-terminal myc-tagged N17Rac1 and V12Rac1 under control of the tetracycline repressible trans-activator, were provided by James Nelson (Stanford University). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 20 ng/ml doxycycline as described elsewhere; expression of myc-tagged N17Rac1 and V12Rac1 was achieved by culturing cells in the absence of doxycycline for 16 h (20.Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Expression of V12Rac1 and N17Rac1 was monitored by indirect immunofluorescent staining using an antibody to the myc epitope (9E10). In all cases, ammonium chloride was added to a final concentration of 10 mm before the addition of VacA. VacA was purified from H. pylori 60190 culture supernatant as described elsewhere (21.Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Before VacA was added to cell cultures, it was acidified by dropwise addition of 200 mm HCl to a final pH of 2.5. Construction and functional characterization of pCDNA3-GFPc and pCDNA3-GFP-WTRac1 are described in detail elsewhere (22.Akhtar, N., Hudson, K. R., and Hotchin, N. A. (2000) Cell Adh. Comm., in pressGoogle Scholar). Briefly, polymerase chain reaction was used to generate an open reading frame encoding GFP coupled to the N terminus of full-length wild type (WT) Rac1 via a -Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser linker that was subcloned into pCDNA-3.1(+) (Invitrogen). For control experiments a GFP expression vector was made by subcloning GFP into pCDNA-3.1(+). Plasmids were microinjected into the nuclei of SCC12F cells as described elsewhere (23.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3744) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were plated out at low density in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of doxycycline and cultured for 16 h, after which VacA was added and cells left for a further 4 h. The vacuolating activity of VacA was analyzed using a previously published method, in which uptake of Neutral Red dye into acidic compartments is quantitated using a microtiter plate reader to determine absorbance at 540 nm (24.Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Background uptake of Neutral Red dye in the absence of VacA was subtracted from the values obtained in the presence of VacA to provide a measure of the vacuolating activity induced by VacA. Duplicate plates were analyzed using an enzyme-based cell quantitation assay to correct for potential differences in cell numbers in each treatment (25.Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Triplicate wells were assayed for each condition and results expressed as the mean plus standard error from three separate experiments. Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and a number of intracellular signaling events (9.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar). Members of the Rho family, including Rac1, have been shown to be important for the pathogenic activity of a number of micro-organisms and are increasingly seen as important in membrane trafficking events (12.Gampel A. Parker P.J. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 955-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13.Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L.

We recently observed that expression of a constitutively active form of Rac1 in epithelial cells resulted in formation of multiple, large vesicular structures reminiscent of those seen in cells exposed to the VacA cytotoxin ofH. pylori (22.Akhtar, N., Hudson, K. R., and Hotchin, N. A. (2000) Cell Adh. Comm., in pressGoogle Scholar). VacA is a small pore-forming toxin, which acts by inhibiting endosomal biogenesis, resulting in the expansion of acidic compartments (2.Cover T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5.Czajkowsky D.M. Iwamoto H. Cover T.L. Shao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed whether the vacuolating activity of VacA is regulated by Rac1. Treatment of two different epithelial cell lines, SCC12F keratinocytes and MDCK cells, with 200 ng ml−1 VacA toxin for 4 h resulted in the formation of large intracellular vacuoles in some, although not all, cells (Fig. 1). Treatment of cells with VacA for longer periods (16–24 h) resulted in vacuolation of virtually all cells (data not shown). This vacuolation of non-gastric epithelial cells is consistent with the previously reported effects of this toxin on epithelial cells derived from a variety of different tissue sources (2.Cover T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 26.de Bernard M. Moschioni M. Papini E. Telford J. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 99: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expression of Rac1 in cells is associated with increased pinocytic activity and is believed to play a role in endocytosis (13.Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 27.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3081) Google Scholar). Consistent with this role, Rac1 has been shown to localize around intracellular vesicles (22.Akhtar, N., Hudson, K. R., and Hotchin, N. A. (2000) Cell Adh. Comm., in pressGoogle Scholar, 28.Robertson D. Paterson H.F. Adamson P. Hall A. Monaghan P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To analyze whether Rac1 localized to VacA-induced vesicles, we microinjected SCC12F cells with a cDNA vector expressing wild type Rac1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (22.Akhtar, N., Hudson, K. R., and Hotchin, N. A. (2000) Cell Adh. Comm., in pressGoogle Scholar). Injected cells were incubated for 16 h to allow expression of the GFP-Rac1 chimera before the addition of VacA for a further 4 h. Expression of wild type GFP-Rac1 did not induce cell vacuole formation in the absence of VacA (Fig.2, A and B), but in cells treated with VacA Rac1 it was clearly seen to localize to the periphery of the vacuoles (Fig. 2, C and D). Cells microinjected with a control plasmid expressing GFP alone and treated with VacA showed no specific localization of GFP around these vacuoles (Fig. 2, E and F). Localization of Rac1 to VacA-induced vacuoles implicated Rac1 in the VacA-mediated response; we analyzed the role of Rac1 in this process using MDCK cells expressing dominant negative and constitutively active Rac1 mutants under the control of the tetracycline repressible trans-activator (20.Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured overnight in the absence of the tetracycline analogue doxycycline to induce expression of either dominant negative (N17) or constitutively active (V12) Rac1 mutants before adding VacA for a further 4 h. Expression of the Rac1 mutants was verified by staining cells for the presence of themyc epitope located at the N terminus of the mutants (20.Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). No expression of dominant negative or constitutively active Rac1 was observed in the presence of doxycycline (data not shown). In the absence of doxycycline, dominant negative and constitutively active Rac1 was expressed in most, although not all, cells (Fig.3, B, D,F, and H). In cells expressing constitutively active Rac1, the majority of cells demonstrated extensive vacuole formation in the presence of VacA (Fig. 3, C andD). In the absence of VacA, expression of constitutively active Rac1 did not result in vacuole formation (Fig. 3, Aand B). In contrast to the results observed following expression of constitutively active Rac1, cells expressing dominant negative Rac1 showed markedly less vacuole formation (Fig. 3,E and F). As with the cells expressing constitutively active Rac1, expression of dominant negative Rac1 was variable with approximately 20–30% of cells not expressing N17Rac1 following withdrawal of doxycycline. Significantly, those cells in which dominant negative Rac1 was not expressed at detectable levels, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence, appeared more susceptible to the effects of VacA (Fig. 3, G and H). To confirm the apparent effects of expressing dominant negative and constitutively active Rac1 on the ability of VacA to induce vacuole formation in MDCK cells, we used a quantitative assay for vacuole formation based on uptake of Neutral Red dye into acidic vacuoles (24.Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data from these experiments clearly support the finding that Rac1 regulates the cellular response to VacA toxin. Expression of dominant negative Rac1 inhibits vacuole formation by approximately 50%, and expression of constitutively active Rac1 results in a 2–3-fold increase in vacuole formation over and above that seen in cells expressing endogenous Rac1 (Fig. 4). The inability of dominant negative Rac1 to completely inhibit vacuole formation in response to VacA may reflect the fact that approximately 20–30% of cells fail to switch on expression of dominant negative Rac1 when doxycycline is removed. Although it is clear that Rac1 regulates the activity of VacA in epithelial cells, the mechanism by which this occurs is not yet clear. The localization of wild type GFP-Rac1 around the vacuoles induced by VacA might point to a role in the formation of these structures. The VacA-induced vacuoles are known to be hybrid late endosomal-lysosomal compartments, and it is possible that Rac might be involved in lysosomal biogenesis (3.Molinari M. Galli C. Norais N. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Luzio J.P. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25339-25344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, a clear role for another GTPase, Rab7, has been established in the late endosomal-lysosomal fusion events that occur in response to VacA, and as yet no role for regulation of Rab7 by Rac1 has been identified (6.Papini E. Satin B. Bucci C. de Bernard M. Telford J.L. Manetti R. Rappuoli R. Zerial M. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it might be that Rac1 is regulating the uptake of VacA across the plasma membrane, although, while there is good evidence that VacA acts intracellularly, the mechanism of entry is far from clear (29.de Bernard M. Arico B. Papini E. Rizzuto R. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Even though this is the first report describing a role for Rac1 in regulating VacA activity, it is interesting to note that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which has been reported to increase the sensitivity of cells to VacA (30.de Bernard M. Moschioni M. Papini E. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), is a potent stimulator of Rac-dependent signaling events (27.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

The observation that members of the Rho family play important roles in the pathogenesis of a number of other micro-organisms, including L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri, has generated a great deal of interest in understanding how micro-organisms regulate intracellular signaling events (16.Mounier J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Clearly it will be important to establish the signaling events that occur following attachment ofH. pylori, and it is important to note there are significant distinctions between the mechanisms of infection employed by S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes and those employed byH. pylori. Both Shigella and Listeriaeffect entry into, or movement within and between, epithelial cells by regulating the actin cytoskeleton via members of the Rho family. In contrast, Helicobacter infection does not involve entry into epithelial cells, but rather it attaches to the apical surface of epithelial cells where it is protected from the acidic environment of the gut by the mucus lining. Interestingly, there is evidence for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at sites of attachment, and there is some evidence that this is an event regulated by members of the Rho family (32.Palovuori R.

In summary, we have demonstrated that activity of VacA, the major virulence factor of H. pylori, is regulated by the Rac1 GTPase, raising the possibility that other noninvasive pathogens might employ similar mechanisms. We are grateful to James Nelson (Stanford University) for the very generous gift of the MDCK TetR cells lines."
https://openalex.org/W2060265430,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic diseases. IL-4-induced gene expression is largely mediated through the activation of the latent transcription factor STAT6. We identified a STAT6 mutant (STAT6VT)) that is activated independently of IL-4 stimulation. STAT6VT carries two amino acid changes in the SH2 domain that affect the overall structure and stability of the monomeric and dimeric protein. When overexpressed in mammalian cells, STAT6VT undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, binds DNA, and activates transcription in the absence of IL-4 stimulation. Using the Jak1- and Jak3-deficient fibroblast line U4A, we demonstrate that phosphorylation is mediated by an IL-4-independent tyrosine kinase that is not able to activate the wild-type STAT6 protein. These results suggest that small changes in STAT6 could result in hyperactivation of the protein and constitutive expression of STAT6-dependent genes. Such a mutation, if found in vivo, could cause genetic predisposition for atopic diseases.

Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Among the many physiological responses mediated by IL-4 is its ability to promote the differentiation of T-helper (Th) precursors toward the Th2 lineage while inhibiting Th1 development (3.Mosmann T.R. Coffman R.L. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 46: 111-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 4.Mosmann T.R. Coffman R.L. Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, IL-4 stimulation of B-cells triggers immunoglobulin class switching to the IgE isotype (6.Stavnezer J. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 79-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Ig recombination is thought to be initiated following the transcriptional activation of the germline ε promoter, which leads to the generation of the sterile ε transcript. Numerous studies have shown that the IL-4-induced activation of the ε promoter requires STAT6, a transcription factor activated upon IL-4 stimulation (7.Delphin S. Stavnezer J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Upon IL-4 binding to its cognate receptor, the latent, monomeric STAT6 protein is recruited to the α chain of the IL-4 receptor, where it specifically interacts with two phosphotyrosine-containing regions (12.Hou J.

Subsequently, STAT6 becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine 641 by Jak1 and/or Jak3, two members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The activated protein dimerizes, migrates to the nucleus, binds specificcis-acting elements, and activates transcription of IL-4 responsive genes (16.O'Shea J.J.

One of the best characterized IL-4 responsive elements is located in the germline ε promoter (7.Delphin S. Stavnezer J. J. Exp.

B-cells derived from STAT6 knock-out mice do not produce IgE in response to IL-4 treatment, illustrating that STAT6 is absolutely required for this event (19.Kuperman D. Schofield B. Wills-Karp M. Grusby M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20.Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet.

These observations suggest that STAT6 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention in cases of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma, which are often associated with hyper-IgE production. We recently conducted an extensive alanine scan mutagenesis of the STAT6 SH2 domain (22.Mikita T. Daniel C. Wu P. Schindler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17634-17642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These studies revealed amino acids that are critical for dimer formation and subsequent DNA binding. Consistent with the model that the STAT SH2 domain is also required for receptor interaction, the same amino acids were shown to be important for binding a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from the IL-4 receptor signaling chain. Furthermore, STAT6 mutants that were unable to bind DNA were also unable to activate transcription in response to IL-4 stimulation, whereas STAT6 derivatives that could bind DNA were transcriptionally active (22.Mikita T. Daniel C. Wu P. Schindler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17634-17642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized one of these mutants (STAT6VT) in greater detail. STAT6VT differs from the wild-type in that it carries two amino acid changes in the SH2 domain. These mutations alter the confirmation of the protein such that it becomes phosphorylated, binds DNA, and activates transcription independent of IL-4 stimulation. This hyperactivation of STAT6, if found in vivo, could lead to increased IgE production. Hence, it will be interesting to see whether such a mutation occurs in patients suffering from allergic rhinitis and/or allergic asthma. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Meditech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human fibrosarcoma U4A cells (a gift from Dr. George Stark) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human IL-4 (4.1 × 107 unit/mg) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The IL-4 inducible luciferase reporter construct carries four copies of the IL-4 response element (C/EBP-N4 site) found in the human germline ε promoter. Preparation of this construct has been described previously (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression plasmids for Jak1, the wild-type STAT6 protein as well as the mutant STAT6 derivatives, carrying two amino acid changes in the SH2 domain, have been described elsewhere (22.Mikita T. Daniel C. Wu P. Schindler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17634-17642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The triple mutant STAT6VT/Y was prepared using polymerase chain reaction to introduce two alanine residues at amino acid positions 547/548 and a phenylalanine at amino acid position 641. The fragment containing the indicated mutations was then used to replace the BglII/SacI fragment of TPU 389 (22.Mikita T. Daniel C. Wu P. Schindler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17634-17642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The baculovirus expression plasmids, wild-type STAT6 and STAT6VT, have also been described (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 22.Mikita T. Daniel C. Wu P. Schindler U. J. Biol.

A control plasmid carrying the β-galactosidase gene under the cytomegalovirus promoter was co-transfected in each experiment. The cells were stimulated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) 6 h before harvesting. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined 2 days post-transfection using the Promega assay system. Probes corresponding to the STAT6 binding site (N4) have been described previously (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared, and mobility shift assays were performed as described (12.Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.Z. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 24.Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nable G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Peptide binding studies using the tyrosine-phosphorylated IL-4 receptor peptide, ASSGEEGPY*KPFQDLI, have been described elsewhere (12.Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.Z. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 24.Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nable G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The same nuclear extracts were used for immunoprecipitations with an anti-STAT6-specific polyclonal antibody. The precipitated material was electrophoretically separated and subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots using the 4G10 monoclonal anitbody (Upstate Biotechnology). Wild-type STAT6 and STAT6VT were expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (13.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). 30 μg of each protein were exposed to 3 μg of activated trypsin (Sigma) protease. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C in 1× digestion buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). 10 μl aliquots were removed every 20 min for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For each reaction, a negative control was performed without protease. Previously, we generated a series of STAT6 mutants that differ from the wild type in that they carry two amino acid substitutions in the SH2 domain (22.Mikita T. Daniel C. Wu P. Schindler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17634-17642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have compared the transcription potential of these mutants in the presence and absence of cytokine. The proteins were co-expressed in HEK293 cells with an IL-4 inducible luciferase reporter carrying four copies of the STAT6-dependent IL-4 response element derived from the human germline ε promoter. HEK293 cells lack endogenous STAT6, but they are able to activate an IL-4 responsive promoter upon ectopic expression of STAT6, suggesting that this is the only component missing in the IL-4/STAT6 signaling cascade (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As observed previously, all STAT6 derivatives that were known to bind DNA also activated transcription (Fig. 1). With one exception, all proteins were active only in the presence of IL-4 and were not active without cytokine stimulation. Strikingly, the substitution of two residues at positions 547 (V) and 548 (T) in the SH2 domain resulted in a STAT6 mutant that was transcriptionally active even in the absence of IL-4 stimulation (VT, Fig. 1). In addition, this protein was about three times more active than wild-type STAT6 in the induced state. These data suggested that mutations of these two amino acids (VT) dramatically affect the IL-4-dependent regulation of STAT6. To explore the mechanism underlying the constitutive activity of STAT6VT, we asked whether the protein is able to dimerize and bind DNA without IL-4 stimulation. STAT6 or STAT6VT were expressed in HEK293 cells, and nuclear extracts were prepared from IL-4-treated or untreated cells and subjected to DNA binding studies using the IL-4 response element. Fig.2 shows that the DNA binding activity of wild-type STAT6 can be seen only upon IL-4 stimulation (lane 2), but not under unstimulated conditions (lane 1). In contrast, STAT6VT was able to bind the IL-4 response element even in the absence of cytokine (lane 5). Some increase in binding was observed after IL-4 treatment (lane 6). These results show that the double amino acid substitution yields a protein that binds DNA and activates transcription in an IL-4-independent manner. Phosphorylation of Tyr-641 is critical for STAT6 dimerization and DNA binding (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To explore whether Tyr-641 phosphorylation is required in the context of the V547A/T548A mutation, we substituted tyrosine 641 with phenylalanine (STAT6VT/Y) and analyzed the protein using DNA binding. Fig. 2 A shows that the tyrosine mutation abolished DNA binding activity even in the presence of IL-4 stimulation (lanes 7 and 8). STAT6Y carrying the Tyr-641 mutation in the context of the wild-type was used as control (lanes 3 and 4). We also investigated the phosphorylation status of these proteins in the absence and presence of IL-4 stimulation using immunoprecipitations followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Fig. 2 Bshows that STAT6VT is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the absence of IL-4 treatment (lane 5). Consistent with the DNA binding studies, some increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was seen upon IL-4 stimulation (lane 6). In contrast, no phosphorylation of the wild-type protein was seen in the uninduced state, whereas strong phosphorylation was seen following IL-4 treatment (lanes 1and 2). Phosphorylation was completely abolished when Tyr-641 was replaced by phenylalanine in the context of the wild-type (lanes 3 and 4) or the mutant protein (lanes 7 and 8). We also asked whether these proteins were able to activate transcription when expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2 C). Both STAT6Y and STAT6VT/Y were unable to activate transcription even after IL-4 stimulation. In contrast, STAT6 and STAT6VT were fully active. These studies clearly show that Tyr-641 is absolutely essential for STAT6 function even in the context of the V547A/T548A mutation. STAT6VT is not able to utilize an alternative tyrosine residue for dimerization nor to bind DNA or activate transcription in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. IL-4 binding to its receptor triggers the phosphorylation of tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the IL-4 receptor α chain, which allow the specific recruitment of STAT6 (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12.Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.Z. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 13.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). So far, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of STAT6VT is required but also that this event is independent of IL-4 binding to its receptor. Hence, one could argue that the gain-of-function phenotype seen with STAT6VT is due to a structural change mediated by the two amino acid substitutions. To address the possibility of conformational change, we compared the stability of STAT6 and STAT6VT by limited proteolysis (Fig.3 A). Recombinant proteins were expressed in insect cells, purified to homogeneity (lane 1), and exposed to trypsin protease for increasing incubation periods (lanes 2-9). The results clearly demonstrate that STAT6VT is more resistant to protease digestion. Even after prolonged exposure to the protease, STAT6VT did not generate the complex digestion pattern obtained for wild-type STAT6. This finding suggests that the two amino acid changes in the SH2 domain alter the conformation of the protein. Tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides derived from the IL-4 receptor α chain inhibit STAT6 DNA binding because they interact with the SH2 domain, which is required for dimer formation (12.Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.Z. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 13.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of STAT6VT is the same in the induced and uninduced state even though its phosphorylation status and DNA binding activity can still be increased upon IL-4 stimulation. Hence, we wished to determine whether the V547A/T548A mutation stabilizes the dimer upon DNA binding. Proteins expressed in HEK293 cells were subjected to DNA binding in the presence or absence of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor peptide (Fig. 3 B). In agreement to previous results (13.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), the peptide inhibited DNA binding of the wild-type STAT6 protein in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2-4). Interestingly, the peptide had no effect on DNA binding of the mutant STAT6VT protein (lanes 7-9). Using fluorescence polarization experiments (13.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that the monomeric wild-type and mutant proteins bound this peptide with the same affinity (K d ∼ 0.3 μm). The failure of IL-4 receptor-derived peptides to displace the STAT6VT dimer as it is seen for the wild-type protein strongly suggests that the STAT6VT dimer is more stable. These results help explain the high transcriptional activity in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1). The data indicate that receptor ligation is not required for the activation of STAT6VT. However, tyrosine phosphorylation at residue Tyr-641 is absolutely essential. HEK293 cells do not express Jak3, demonstrating that this kinase is not necessary for STAT6 phosphorylation. We next determined whether the function of Jak1, which is associated with the IL-4 receptor α chain, is required for STAT6VT activation. In these studies we characterized the behavior of wild-type STAT6 and STAT6VT in U4A cells, a Jak1-deficient fibroblast cell line (25.McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5061) Google Scholar). The parental line 2fTGH served as positive control. First, we compared the transcription activation potentials of STAT6 and STAT6VT in both 2fTGH and U4A cells. Fig. 4 A shows that IL-4-induced luciferase activity could be detected in 2fTGH but not in U4A. Overexpression of wild-type STAT6 increased the activity in 2fTGH about 2-fold but had no effect in U4A cells, supporting the notion that Jak1 is absolutely essential for STAT6 function. In contrast, strong luciferase activity was observed in 2fTGH and U4A cells upon overexpression of STAT6VT. Again, transcription activation was seen in the absence of cytokine stimulation. For reasons we do not understand, STAT6VT was even more active in U4A cells than in the parental line, 2fTGH. However, the data shows that STAT6VT is constitutively active even in the absence of Jak1 and Jak3. Next we wished to determine the DNA binding activity of both proteins when expressed in U4A or 2fTGH cells. Both cell lines were transfected with constructs encoding either wild-type STAT6 or STAT6VT. Nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for their ability to associate with a STAT6-specific DNA binding element (Fig. 4 B). In agreement with our activation studies and earlier data, wild-type STAT6 protein could not be activated in U4A cells because of the lack of Jak1 (top panel, lane 4) (26.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5061) Google Scholar, 27.Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the protein was active upon IL-4 stimulation in the parental line 2fTGH (bottom panel, lane 4). Furthermore, when Jak1 was co-expressed, IL-4-induced activation of wild-type STAT6 was reconstituted in U4A cells (top panel, lane 10). In contrast, STAT6VT was active in both the parental line 2fTGH as well as the mutant U4A line independent of whether Jak1 was co-transfected (lanes 6 and 12). As observed in HEK293 cells, activation of STAT6VT did not require cytokine stimulation. Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that STAT6VT is phosphorylated by a kinase that does not need to be activated by IL-4 stimulation. We have identified two amino acids in the STAT6 SH2 domain that, when mutated, uncouple the activity of the STAT6 protein from its regulatory cytokine, IL-4. Strikingly, this mutant, STAT6VT, is tyrosine-phosphorylated and is able to bind DNA and activate transcription in the absence of IL-4. Using limited proteolysis, we show that STAT6VT expressed in insect cells is more resistant to protease digestion than the wild-type protein. This observation does not reflect the difference in tyrosine phosphorylation, because STAT6VT is not differentially phosphorylated in insect cells when compared with the wild-type protein (data not shown). Hence, we argue that the two amino acid changes stabilize STAT6VT so that it is less susceptible to protease digestion. In mammalian cells, this change in conformation seems to give rise to a protein that is phosphorylated by an IL-4-independent tyrosine kinase. These results are supported by the observation that Jak1- and Jak3-deficient cells are able to phosphorylate STAT6VT but fail to phosphorylate the wild-type protein. Furthermore, STAT6VT forms a more stable protein:DNA complex than the wild-type protein. These two mechanisms, phosphorylation in the absence of IL-4 and increased DNA binding stability, help to explain the constitutive transcription activity seen with STAT6VT. Obviously, these studies do not rule out the possibility that wild-type STAT6 is also phosphorylated by this IL-4-independent kinase. In this scenario, STAT6 may be rapidly dephosphorylated in the absence of IL-4 stimulation. This phosphatase may be unable to recognize STAT6VT because of the two amino acid changes. Our results do not allow us to discriminate between these two potential mechanisms. Constitutively active versions of STAT1 and STAT5 have been identified (28.Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29.Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L.-F. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A Ktamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the case of STAT1, it was shown that a mutation of amino acid 31 (Arg to Ala) inhibits the dephosphorylation of STAT1. Furthermore, a deletion of the N terminus resulted in a protein that was constitutively phosphorylated (28.Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism does not apply for STAT6 because deletion of the N terminus has no effect on the activation/phosphorylation properties of STAT6 (8.Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Two amino acids have been identified in STAT5 that, when mutated simultaneously, yield a constitutively active STAT5 protein (29.Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L.-F. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A Ktamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). One of these resides is upstream of the DNA binding domain and the other is located in the C-terminal activation domain. Also for STAT6VT, both amino acid changes were required to observed the full constitutive phenotype. Hence, it appears that different mutations can yield STAT proteins that are either phosphorylated in a ligand-independent manner or that render them less susceptible to dephosphorylation. Inappropriate activation of STAT proteins has been described for some pathological conditions. For example, STAT3 and STAT5 are constitutively active in HTLV-1 transformed T-cells (30.Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Mulloy J.C. O'Shea J.J. Franchini G. Leonard W.J. Science. 1995; 269: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). STAT3 has also been shown to be activated in a cytokine-independent manner by Src, resulting in cell transformation (31.Campbell G.S., Yu, C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32.Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, constitutively active STAT3 is found in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with multiple myelomas and is thought to contribute to pathogenesis by preventing apoptosis (34.Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Also, the oncogene v-abl can activate the Jak/STAT pathway (35.Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 36.Carlesso N. Frank D.A. Griffin J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). More recently, constitutively active STAT1 has been observed in airway epithelial cells from asthmatic individuals (37.Sampath D. Castro M. Look D.C. Holtzman M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These observations illustrate that the inappropriate activation/tyrosine phosphorylation of a STAT protein, in the absence of cytokine signaling, can have a profound effect on the status of a cell. Our finding that the mutation of two key residues within the STAT6 SH2 domain results in a protein that is constitutively active provides the first reported evidence of a hyperactive form of STAT6. Asthma is familial, and many genetic loci predispose individuals to the disease (38.Daniels S.E. Bhattacharrya S. James A. Leaves N.I. Young A. Hill M.R. Faux J.A. Ryan G.F. le Souef P.N. Lathrop G.M. Musk A.W. Cookson W.O. Nature. 1996; 383: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Furthermore, asthma as well as allergy are multifactorial in that they are influenced by many genetic and environmental factors. IL-4 is a critical cytokine in the development of atopy, the IgE-mediated syndrome of allergic asthma and rhinitis (39.Marsh D.G. Neely J.D. Breazeale D.R. Ghosh B. Freidhoff L.R. Ehrlich-Kautzky E.

Gain-of-function polymorphisms in the IL-4 gene as well as the gene encoding the IL-4 receptor α chain are associated with higher serum IgE levels and asthma (40.Deichmann K.A. Heinzmann A.

A gain-of-function mutation in STAT6 could lead to a similar phenotype, because IgE production in response to IL-4 is STAT6-dependent (11.Akira S.

Curcumin induces apoptosis of several, but not all, cancer cells. Many cancer cells protect themselves against apoptosis by activating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/Rel, a transcription factor that helps in cell survival. Signal-induced activation of NF-κB is known to be inhibited by curcumin. To understand the role of NF-κB in curcumin-induced apoptosis, we stably transfected relA gene encoding the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB, into l-929 cells (mouse fibrosarcoma) and the relA-transfected cells were resistant to varying doses of curcumin (10−6–10−4m), whereas the parental cells underwent apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The relA-transfected cells showed constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity that could not be inhibited by curcumin and did not show nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation upon treatment with curcumin.

Many chemopreventive agents induce programmed cell death or apoptosis, a potent mechanism by which they eliminate preneoplastic or cancer cells. Curcumin induces several characteristics of apoptosis such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation in cells from colon, kidney, blood, and liver of human origin and NIH3T3, erbB2-transformed NIH3T3, and fibrosarcoma cells of murine origin (6.Jiang M.-C. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Lin J.K. Nutr. Cancer. 1996; 26: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 7.Jiang M.-C. Yang-Yen H.F. Lin J.K. Yen J.J.-Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). However, curcumin fails to induce apoptosis in some fibroblastic and leukemic cell lines, and inhibition of cell proliferation is not always associated with apoptosis (8.Gautam S.C. Xu Y.X.

Although the molecular mechanisms of antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of curcumin remain elusive, the resistance of various cell types to apoptosis following treatment with curcumin may be attributed to the abnormal expression of specific proteins that regulate apoptosis. Many cancer cells protect themselves against therapy (tumor necrosis factor, ionizing radiation, and chemotherapeutic compounds) by activating NF-κB1/Rel, a family of dimeric transcription factors, that helps in cell survival through unknown anti-apoptotic mechanisms (11.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 12.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Interestingly, constitutive expression of NF-κB has been reported in breast and pancreatic cancer cells and tumors (but not in their normal counterparts), contributing to their apoptosis resistance/survival and tumor progression (15.Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rojers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 16.Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 1: 119-127Google Scholar). The typically active NF-κB/Rel is a heterodimer composed of a 50-kDa (p50) and a 65-kDa (p65 or RelA) subunit, although other homo/heterodimers of the mammalian Rel family (c-Rel, p52, and RelB) also exist. Knockout mice lacking the RelA subunit of NF-κB die before birth and show massive degeneration of liver cells caused by apoptosis. NF-κB proteins are sequestered in cytoplasm as inactive forms by associating with inhibitory proteins known as IκBs. IκB-α represents a prototype of several IκB proteins and IκB kinases, which phosphorylate them on specific serine residues upon getting a signal, have been cloned and characterized recently (17.May M.J. Ghosh S. Science. 1999; 284: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB-α leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation eventually releasing the heterodimers of NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus (18.Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curcumin is known to inhibit the activation of NF-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, phorbol esters, and hydrogen peroxide (19.Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Curcumin inhibits cytokine-mediated NF-κB activation by blocking a signal leading to IκB kinase activity (20.Jobin C. Bradham C.A. Russo M.P. Narula A.S. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, curcumin-induced apoptosis is regulated, in part, by the extent of NF-κB inactivation by curcumin and the level of expression of NF-κB in cells. To understand the role of NF-κB in curcumin-induced apoptosis, we stably transfected relA gene intol-929 cells (mouse fibrosarcoma), and upon treatment with curcumin, the relA-transfected cells were resistant even to higher doses of curcumin, whereas the parental cells underwent apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner highlighting a critical anti-apoptotic role for NF-κB. l-929 cell line (murine lung fibrosarcoma) was obtained from the National Center for Cell Science, Pune, India. The cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air. Curcumin, TPA, and MTT were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies to p65 and FLAG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Stock concentrations of curcumin and TPA were made in Me2SO. All other chemicals were procured from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The in vitrogrowth rate of cells was assessed by counting the cell number using hemocytometer. For MTT assay (21.Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J.

Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar), the cells (3 × 103/well) were cultured in 96-well plates treated with or without curcumin for 24 h, and MTT was added to each well (5 mg/ml final concentration). Cells were incubated for an additional 4 h, MTT was removed, Me2SO was added, and cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. For immunocytochemical analysis, the cells were cultured on coverslips, washed with PBS, and fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 30 min. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to RelA/p65 (sc-109, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used, and immunoreactivity was visualized using the vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. cells were cultured for 24 h and treated with or without curcumin. The cells were trypsinized, fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS, and stained with ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml PBS) for 10 min. After washing, the cells were observed under a Nikon fluorescent microscope using a green filter (× 40 magnification). Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (22.Shao R. Karunagaran D. Zhou B.P. Li K. Lo S.-S. Deng J. Chiao P. Hung M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32739-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using a goat polyclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-807G). This was carried out essentially as described previously (23.White E. Grodzicker T. Stillman B.W. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 410-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vector for RelA (pMT2T) has been described previously (24.Bours V. Burd P.R. Brown K. Villalobos J. Park S. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection, 1.0 × 106 cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and suspended in 0.8 ml of serum-free medium in a 0.4-cm cuvette and electroporated with 10 μg of DNA (empty or RelA expression vector) using the Gene Pulser II Electroporation System (Bio-Rad) under the conditions of 300 V and 950 microfarads with a time constant below 20. Cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing the neomycin-resistant gene. Cells were then plated in 60-mm Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% newborn calf serum. After 36 h, G418 (0.5 mg/ml) was added and continued for a period of 10 days. The resistant clones were pooled and used. In transient transfection experiments, the super-repressor form of IκB-α fused downstream to a FLAG epitope in an expression vector (pCMV4) was used for electroporation (25.Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinscy T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured and treated with or without curcumin. The medium was removed, and 0.2 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well was added in serum-free medium and incubated for 6 h. The wells were washed with PBS, and proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Supernatant was removed and after washing with ethanol, the cells were solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. The assay was performed as described (22.Shao R. Karunagaran D. Zhou B.P. Li K. Lo S.-S. Deng J. Chiao P. Hung M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32739-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Earlier, we reported that curcumin and several natural or synthetic curcuminoids are cytotoxic to l-929 (murine fibrosarcoma) cells (1.Ruby A.J. Kuttan G. Babu K.D. Rajasekharan K.N. Kuttan R. Cancer Lett. 1995; 94: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 27.Anto R.J. Kuttan G. Babu K.D. Rajasekharan K.N. Kuttan R. Int. J. Pharm. 1996; 131: 1-7Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Now, we have examined the possible involvement of NF-κB in curcumin-induced apoptosis ofl-929 cells, since its expression/activation is an important mechanism for apoptosis resistance/survival. To this end,l-929 cells were transfected with a human cDNA encoding the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB, and the transfected pool of cells were selected for their resistance (achieved by co-transfection with a neomycin resistance gene) to G418. Immunocytochemical examination of the parental and relA-transfected cells using a specific polyclonal antibody to RelA revealed more intensive staining in therelA-transfected cells (Fig.1 A), confirming the expression of RelA. The staining pattern of cells transfected only with the pMT2T vector was similar to the untransfected parental cells (data not shown). The parental (l-929) andrelA-transfected cells (RelA) treated with different concentrations of curcumin for 24 h at 37 °C clearly show that the transfected cells effectively resist curcumin-induced cytotoxicity (more than 90% of cells survived with 10−6mcurcumin, and 50–58% were still viable at 10−4m curcumin treatment), while the untransfected cells progressively underwent cell death (20% of cells died with 10−6m curcumin, and more than 95% died with 10−4m curcumin treatment) with the increase in concentration of curcumin (Fig. 1 B). The dose-dependent cell death of the parental l-929 cells induced by curcumin and the resistance ofrelA-transfected cells to curcumin prompted us to check the time dependence of this phenomenon, and the results after a 5-day period of incubation with different concentrations of curcumin show that about 40% of the relA-transfected cells were still viable at 10−4m curcumin, whereas none of the parental cells survived at this concentration (Fig. 1 C). DNA synthesis as measured by the incorporation of labeled thymidine also confirmed that it is inhibited by curcumin in l-929 cells, whereas RelA can impart resistance to this inhibition of DNA synthesis by curcumin (Fig. 1 D). These results show that NF-κB/RelA expression can effectively resist the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects induced by curcumin in l-929 cells. Consistent with our results, proliferation rate of a human pancreatic cancer cell line (MDAPanc-28) showing constitutive activation of NF-κB remained unaffected upon treatment with 50 μm of curcumin (16.Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 1: 119-127Google Scholar). To confirm whether the cytotoxic effects induced by curcumin inl-929 cells involve apoptotic changes and ascertain the role of NF-κB, l-929, and relA-transfected cells were examined for typical apoptotic patterns (nuclear condensation and fragmentation) with or without curcumin. Upon treatment with 10−6m curcumin, nuclear condensation (examined by staining the cells with ethidium bromide) was visible in l-929 cells at 24 h and increased at 48 h, but the relA-transfected cells did not show nuclear condensation even up to 72 h treatment with curcumin (Fig.2). Since one of the most distinct biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis is the cleavage of DNA into multiple internucleosomal fragments of 180–200 base pairs (28.Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar, 29.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar), nuclear DNA isolated from the curcumin-treated cells was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results show that in l-929 cells DNA fragmentation gradually increased with time (24–72 h) upon treatment with 10−6m curcumin, whereas therelA-transfected cells did not show typical apoptotic DNA fragmentation patterns even up to 72-h treatment with curcumin, although some high molecular weight fragments appeared at 72 h (Fig. 3). In addition, relatively large numbers of apoptotic bodies were observed in curcumin-treatedl-929 cells as compared with therelA-transfected cells during morphological examination (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest the involvement of apoptosis in curcumin-induced cytotoxicity in l-929 cells and also emphasize the anti-apoptotic potential of NF-κB expression. To our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt to unravel the anti-apoptotic role of NF-κB in curcumin-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. The present molecular approach of ectopic expression of RelA was considered as it is probably difficult to examine and interpret the effects of curcumin on cells with varying levels of NF-κB due to variations in their genetic background. For instance, in many human breast cancer cells, curcumin neither induced apoptosis nor any significant changes in the expression of apoptosis-related genes, including p53, Bcl2, cyclin B, and transglutaminase (10.Mehta K. Pantazis P. McQueen T. Aggarwal B.B. Anticancer Drugs. 1997; 5: 470-481Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), although a multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cell line underwent apoptosis upon curcumin treatment and showed changes in p53 mRNA (30.Ramachandran C. You W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human breast cancer cells are known to exhibit widely varying NF-κB expression levels, which negatively correlate with their estrogen receptor status (31.Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3DNA fragmentation is induced by curcumin in L-929 cells but not in relA-transfected cells.Cells were treated with or without 10−6mcurcumin. Cells were scraped out and DNA was extracted as described under “Materials and Methods.” DNA fragments were resolved by 1.5% of agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since curcumin is well known to block the activation of NF-κB induced by several agents, it became relevant to assess NF-κB DNA binding activity in l-929 cells. We used TPA to induce NF-κB, and treatment with curcumin inhibited TPA-induced activation of NF-κB inl-929 cells. The inactivation was complete at higher concentrations of curcumin (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the relA-transfected cells showed constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity, and even 10−4m curcumin could not inhibit this activity (Fig. 4), consistent with the capacity of these cells to resist curcumin-induced apoptosis (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). If indeed, the constitutive NF-κB activity is responsible for the observed resistance to curcumin, blocking the activation is expected to reverse it. Super-repressor IκB-α is a mutant form of IκB-α (1–36 amino acids deleted) that has been shown to block the activation of NF-κB by other workers (12.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 25.Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinscy T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we transiently transfected the super-repressor form of IκB-α into relA-transfected cells and measured the viability by MTT assay, and the results show that the relA-transfected cells, which were resistant to curcumin (Fig. 1), also became responsive upon IκB transfection (Fig.5). Apparently, even the basal level of NF-κ B in l-929 cells has some potential to block the action of curcumin as introducing IκB into these cells marginally increased curcumin-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5). These experiments demonstrate that NF-κB activation blocks curcumin-induced apoptosis, and NF-κB activation by the degradation of IκB-α is the major pathway for its activation in l-929 cells. Further work is needed to know whether NF-κB expression regulates apoptosis induced by other NF-κB inhibitors such as gliotoxin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (32.Ozaki K. Takeda H. Iwahashi H. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our results highlight a critical anti-apoptotic role for NF-κB in curcumin-induced apoptosis. The actual mechanism of curcumin-induced apoptosis is not clear but our results provide a plausible mechanism for cells resisting curcumin. Such a mechanism may also regulate the apoptotic susceptibility of curcumin-treated cells to other anti-cancer agents. Further work is also needed to understand the relative importance of NF-κB and other anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl2 in the regulation of curcumin-induced apoptosis. Our findings have implications for developing curcumin-based anti-cancer therapies.Figure 5IκB reverses the resistance of relA-transfected cells to curcumin-induced cytotoxicity. l-929 orrelA-transfected cells were subjected to transient transfection with IκB-α super-repressor as described under “Materials and Methods.” The untransfected and transfected cells were then treated with different concentrations of curcumin for 24 h. Then the medium was removed, MTT was added, and the cell viability was determined as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the results are expressed as percent of control. The inset shows the results of Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to the FLAG epitope of the super-repressor form of IκB-α in l-929 or relA-transfected cells transfected with or without the super-repressor form of IκB-α.

Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Its structure has been studied extensively and currently is a classical example of a truly beautiful molecular architecture (2.Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The core 20 S proteasomal particle has a molecular mass of about 700 kDa, and degrades peptides and unfolded proteins. The 20 S proteasome is built from four stacked rings (α-β-β-α), seven subunits in each ring, with active centers located inside the chamber formed by the two inner rings (β-β). The 20 S core plus two 19 S regulatory complexes create the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome, which can recognize and degrade ubiquitinated substrates. Superb quality electron micrographs of the 20 and 26 S particles are available, and the crystal structure of archaebacterial and budding yeast 20 S proteasomes have been solved (2.Bochtler M.

The crystal structure ofThermoplasma acidophilum 20 S proteasome resembles the hollow cylinder, with the 1.3-nm opening in α-rings. The opening leads to the internal catalytic compartment (4.Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the budding yeast 20 S particle crystallized with inhibitors showed the α-rings sealed by the tightly interwoven polypeptide chains of the α-subunits (5.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. et al.Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Therefore, the following hypotheses were proposed to explain the path of substrates into the catalytic chamber: (i) the attachment of the 19 S complexes is necessary to open the entrance to the central channel; (ii) a substrate may enter the catalytic chamber by narrow side windows between the rings (5.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. et al.Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar); (iii) a presumed open conformation exists, but was not captured in the crystal form (1.Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy is a widely used technique to supply the dynamic structural data about protein complexes (6.Bustamante C. Erie D.A. Keller D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3025-3030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taking advantage of these features, we were able for the first time to image the native 20 S proteasome in action. The 20 S proteasomes were isolated from an exponentially growing culture ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe strain 972h− and purified by a set of differential centrifugation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography (11.Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 12.Osmulski P.A. Gaczynska M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1023-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Electrophoretically pure proteasomes (about 50 μg of protein/ml) were stored at −20 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, with 20% glycerol. The sample diluted to 2 μg/ml with 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8 (buffer I; no glycerol) displayed proteolytic activity against the commonly used fluorogenic peptide substrates (Bachem): succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (SucLLVY-MCA),1butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA (BocLRR-MCA), and carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide (Z-LLE-βNA) (11.Gaczynska M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1023-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thermally denatured lysozyme was degraded by our proteasome preparations as well, as was assessed by the electrophoretic method (11.Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 12.Osmulski P.A. Gaczynska M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1023-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). No degradation of LVY-MCA and AAF-MCA was detected. Lactacystin (40 μm), carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (Z-LLnL; 100 μm) and carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinyl sulfone (Z-LLL-VS; 100 μm; all from Calbiochem), inhibited degradation of SucLLVY-MCA by at least 98%. For the AFM imaging 2 μl of the sample diluted in buffer I to the final concentrations of 1–10 μg/ml were deposited on a freshly cleaved mica surface, after a few minutes overlaid with buffer I, and mounted in the “wet chamber” of the NanoScope IIIa (Digital Imaging). The imaging was performed in a tapping mode, using oxide-sharpened silicon nitride cantilevers with tips of nominal spring constant 0.32 N/m (Nanoprobe). Resonant frequency of the tip was tuned to 8–10 kHz, with amplitude 200–600 mV and a setpoint of about 2 V. Areas ranging from 0.04 to 1 square micrometer were continuously scanned with a rate of 2.1 Hz. The observed lateral drift reached about 10 nm per scan. For the 2 μg/ml samples a field of one square micrometer typically contained at least 100 of proteasome molecules, and it was possible to image the same group of molecules for an hour or longer. Peptide substrates (final concentration: 100 μm), the protein substrate (final concentration: 0.5 μg/ml), or inhibitors (40 or 100 μm) were injected directly into the chamber. This enabled imaging the same molecules before (control) and after addition of the ligands. To test the influence of increased ionic strength on the imaging conditions and results (13.Muller D.J. Fotiadis D. Scheuring S. Muller S.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the Tris-buffered NaCl solution, pH 7.0, was added to the chamber to the final concentration of up to 20 mm Tris and 200 mm NaCl. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Stock solutions of the peptides and lactacystin were made with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and final concentration of the solvent reached 2% in the sample. Addition of the solvent alone (169 top view particles were analyzed) did not induce detectable changes in the proteasomes' conformation, as compared with the samples without Me2SO. Standard plain fit and flattening provided with the NanoScope IIIa software were the only processing applied to the images in the height mode. Measurements of the particles were carried out with the section analysis software after applying the tip locus compensation on the images (Digital Imaging and NIH Image). We established conditions for successful observation of a field of unfixed, active eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes in sequence. The objects detected with AFM were identified as proteasomes on the basis of their distinctive shape and dimensions (Fig.1). The resolutions of about 1 nm (a field of 200 × 200 nm) to 4 nm (a field of 1 square micrometer) allowed us to distinguish outlines of single subunits of the complex, in full agreement with the results of Dorn et al. (14.Dorn I.T. Eschrich R. Seemuller E. Guckenberger R. Tampe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where side view archaebacterial 20 S molecules were imaged with a resolution of about 3 nm. About a third of our molecules were in an “upright”, or top view position, “standing” on their α-ring (Fig. 1). Their average diameter was in a range of 10–13 nm. That agreed with the reported 11–12 nm diameter of 20 S particles (2.Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 15.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The majority of the molecules were in a side view position, “lying” on their side with the longitudinal axis pointing at different directions, although always parallel to the mica surface. They displayed the presence of four rings with outlines of the subunits. The average length of the molecules in the side view position was 15–17 nm and compared perfectly with the 15–17 nm range observed under electron microscope or modeled after crystal structure (2.Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 15.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Closer inspection of the control top view molecules surprisingly revealed that the apical part of their α-ring could acquire two distinct conformations. Most of the α-rings had a cone-shaped, rounded top with no signs of a central opening. Such molecules were classified as “closed” in accord with the crystallographic data. However, about 24% of the molecules showed an arrangement of the α-subunits forming a crater-like cavity in the middle. This seemingly “open” top suggested an open entrance to the central channel. The closed and open molecules were univocally distinguished by inspection of their median cross-sections (Fig.2 a). The AFM technique gave us the opportunity to image the same molecules a specific number of times (9.Engel A. Lyubchenko Y. Muller D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 77-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10.Muller D.J. Baumeister W. Engel A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3025-3030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We noticed that the same, control 20 S particles scanned repeatedly switched from the open to closed conformation during successive scans (Fig. 2 b). Similar conformational changes have also been observed with the AFM for the membrane pore complex (10.Muller D.J. Baumeister W. Engel A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3025-3030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We concluded that our observations represented the real movements of the native proteins and that the molecules were not simple “frozen” in just one of the conformations (Fig. 2 b). All molecules imaged in sequence were able to change their conformations. However, the long term observations did confirm that all the control molecules spent preferably most of time in the closed conformation (Figs. 2 b and 3). Consequently, in any successive scan the closed particles significantly outnumbered the open particles (Fig. 2 b and 3). This result was independent of the concentration of proteasomes, the ionic strength of the buffer, the direction of the scan, or the resolution of the imaging (Fig. 3). The closed conformation prevailed in the control, “idle” proteasomes. However, the constant presence of a small population of open molecules stimulated us to test if addition of a substrate would shift the equilibrium between the conformers. For this purpose we added to the scanned sample a commonly used model substrate of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, peptide SucLLVY-MCA, and collected data as before. Both the open and closed molecules were still clearly distinguishable after addition of the peptide substrate. However, in sharp contrast to the control sample, now the open molecules constituted a majority (74%) among the top view proteasomes, regardless the conditions of the imaging (Figs. 3 and4). Similar experiments executed with other model peptide substrates, like BocLRR-MCA for trypsin-like activity or Z-LLE-βNA for caspase-like activity of the proteasome, and also with a protein substrate, lysozyme, induced effects comparable with those obtained with SucLLVY-MCA (Fig. 4). We concluded that the presence of the substrate led to a shift in the equilibrium between the closed and open forms, favoring the latter. On the basis of these findings we speculated that the addition of a peptide which is noncleavable by the proteasome would preserve the control-like equilibrium between the forms. We selected two such peptides: LVY-MCA, which closely resembles the good proteasomal substrate SucLLVY-MCA, and peptide AAF-MCA used as a substrate for proteolytic complexes like tricorn, multicorn, and tripeptidyl peptidase II (16.Yao T.T. Cohen R.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R551-R553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with our prediction, the top view molecules showed partitioning between the open and closed states exactly as the control (Fig. 4). The nondegradable peptide clearly did not block the active centers, since subsequent addition of SucLLVY-MCA resulted in a massive opening of the α-rings (Fig.4). As the next step we tested how addition of the specific proteasome inhibitors would affect conformation of the 20 S complexes. We choose three inhibitors: lactacystin, Z-LLnL, and Z-LLL-VS. Lactacystin binds covalently and irreversibly to the active site threonines inside the β-rings. The sites affected are responsible for the most of the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome (2.Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 17.Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Z-LLnL and Z-LLL-VS are examples of tripeptide-based inhibitors that bind reversibly (Z-LLnL) or irreversibly (Z-LLL-VS) to all the proteasomal active centers (17.Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Both Z-LLnL and Z-LLL-VS are able to interact with high affinity with the substrate-binding sites of the proteasome, since their blocked tripeptide chains mimic well the structure of model substrates (17.Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). A preference for the closed conformation was expected upon the treatment with the inhibitors. Indeed, the ratio of the open to closed top view molecules remained similar in the control and the proteasomes treated with the inhibitors (Fig. 4). All individually analyzed molecules could still oscillate between the two conformations. However, the inhibited 20 S particles were no longer able to react on the addition of the SucLLVY-MCA substrate with a massive α-ring opening and remained in the control-like equilibrium of the open and closed conformants (Fig.4). The work presented here is to the best of our knowledge the first dynamic atomic force microscopy analysis of the structure of 20 S proteasomes at work. The use of electron microscopy allowed the detection of the rotation of the 19 S caps with respect to the 20 S core as the major movement in the 26 S proteasome complexes (3.Walz J. Erdmann A. Kania M. Typke D. Koster A.J. Baumeister W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The recently published AFM images of the archaebacterial 20 S proteasomes contained molecules in a side view position only (14.Dorn I.T. Eschrich R. Seemuller E. Guckenberger R. Tampe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our purpose was not to confirm the structure of the 20 S complex already known at high resolution. Instead of averaging the collected images, we aimed at obtaining a set of dynamic representations of the topmost parts of the molecules in action. Nevertheless, we could still identify the outlines of single subunits and the expected overall shape and size of the 20 S particles. The imaged shape of the particles was a result of the physical shape of the molecule and its movements and of the dynamic interactions of a tip with the molecule surface. We aimed at comparing molecules imaged under the same physical scanning conditions, with potentially the same tip-molecule interactions, but under different catalytic conditions. A field of the particles imaged during a single scan contained always a randomly oriented population of molecules. The specific distribution of the two conformants in all analyzed fields was always independent of the scan direction, the scan size, and the achievable resolution. Since altering the ionic strength of the aqueous environment alters the tip-sample interactions (13.Muller D.J. Fotiadis D. Scheuring S. Muller S.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we performed our scans in buffers of different ionic strength to explore the influence of the tip-sample interactions on the observed results. The distribution and overall appearance of the two conformers remained unchanged in all tested buffers. Therefore, we postulate that the presence of the two conformants and the differences observed in their distribution were caused by the distinct behavior of the molecules and not by tip-induced effects or by an imaging artifact. We detected that the proteasome was switching between forms with an apparently closed and open entrance to the central channel. Both the size and shape of the sensing tip, and repulsion forces acting on the tip, did not allow us to image very narrow and deep openings. Therefore, on the basis of the collected images alone we cannot draw any conclusion as to whether the opening penetrates completely through the α-ring into the catalytic chamber. However, since the archaebacterial proteasome possess an all open channel, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the eukaryotic proteasome can potentially open the channel, too. In accord with crystallographic data we found that the resting state and inhibitor bound proteasomes stay preferably in the closed conformation (5.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. et al.Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). It is possible that the detection of only this particular form in the crystal structure originated from its abundance and its thermodynamic preference to crystallize. On the other hand, our AFM data provided evidence of continuous conformational changes of native 20 S proteasomes. All the individual top view molecules repeatedly switched between open and closed forms during subsequent scans. The particles remained open for most of the time only when the substrate was added to the catalytically active (uninhibited) enzyme. The presence of a cleavable ligand was clearly not sufficient to shift the equilibrium between the closed and open molecules. Otherwise, the addition of a substrate to the proteasomes blocked with an inhibitor would open most of the molecules. None of the inhibitors tested cause a preference for the open conformation. Therefore, we excluded the possibility that binding any ligand to the catalytic center and/or to the substrate-binding sites caused the shift of equilibrium toward the open conformation. Apparently, both the presence of an unblocked active center and the presence of a cleavable ligand were necessary for the molecules to remain open for most of the time. Both the inhibitors and the substrates acylate the active site threonines. However, in the case of inhibitors there is no release of the leaving group (N-terminal product) and no deacylation of the active site threonine with the release of the remaining group (C-terminal product). Therefore, we may hypothesize that the actual release of the leaving products, or the deacylation step in general, promote the open conformation. There is no basis, though, to conclude that any of these steps directly cause opening of the molecule. Our observations stimulated us to search for the possible mechanism driving the nanometer scale structural transition. The open-close transition was not simple harmonic motions, since the proteasomes were captured staying in one of the conformations for a relatively extended period of time. Since a single act of degradation of a polypeptide by the 20 S proteasome may take seconds (17.Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), it seems entirely possible for the molecule to remain in a stable conformation for a relatively long time. A single picture of a field was collected every 4 min, and it took a few seconds to obtain the image of an individual molecule. On this basis the estimated period of the oscillations was in the range of at least several seconds with fast switches between the two stable conformers. The spatial and temporal extent of the protein movement fitted the commonly accepted properties of only one type of structural change, namely the allosteric transition. Since there is strong biochemical evidence for β- to β-subunit allostery (18.Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castilio V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and for the interdependence of the substrate binding and cleaving processes (14.Dorn I.T. Eschrich R. Seemuller E. Guckenberger R. Tampe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and since the polypeptide chains of α- and β-subunits are tightly interwoven, it is reasonable to envision a transfer of structural changes not only within the β-rings, but also onto the α-subunits, to cause the open-close transition. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that interactions of ligands directly with α-rings may be, at least in part, responsible for the observed structural changes. Taking into account the complexity of the proteasome molecule we may envision that the described changes in α-rings are only a part of the observed allosteric transition. In fact, we already observed ligand-induced conformational changes in the side view molecules. 2P. A. Osmulski and M. Gaczynska, manuscript in preparation. Another direction of AFM studies will be to explore the dynamics of the 26 S particle. We already obtained well resolved AFM images of 26 S molecules from fission yeast in our preliminary studies. Capturing the stages during which 26 S proteasome works on the degradation of a ubiquitinated substrate will be a future challenge."

In the present study, we demonstrate a physical association between a Rho family member, Cdc42, and PLD1. Binding of Cdc42 to PLD1 and subsequent activation are GTP-dependent. Although binding of Cdc42 to PLD1 does not require geranylgeranylation, activation of PLD1 is dependent on this lipid modification of Cdc42. Specific point mutations in the switch I region of Cdc42 abolish binding to and, therefore, activation of PLD1 by Cdc42.

Phosphatidic acid is a second messenger involved in membrane remodeling events that are critical to cell growth, such as vesicle trafficking and regulated secretion. Phosphatidic acid and one of its metabolic products, lysophosphatidic acid, are potent mitogens and can activate target protein kinases, as well as phospholipases other than PLD. Because of the important cellular functions of PLD and its products, the enzymatic activity of PLD is tightly regulated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and other agonists involved in cellular signaling (1.Exton J.H.

Like other members of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins, members of the Rho subfamily act as molecular switches, cycling between an inactive, GDP-bound form and the active, GTP-bound form. Activation of the GTPase through GTP-GDP exchange is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as Dbl, whereas inactivation of the GTPase occurs through intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, which is stimulated by GTPase activating proteins (12.Geyer M. Wittinghofer A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 786-792Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Activated Rho GTPases interact with target effectors to control a wide variety of cellular responses, including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, regulation of gene transcription, and cell cycle progression (13.Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14.Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Activation of each member of the Rho subfamily, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, not only leads to distinct outcomes with respect to cytoskeletal rearrangements but also makes a specific and unique contribution to Dbl transformation (15.Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that Rho and Rac activate PLD1 in vivo through growth factor receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins (16.Hess J.A. Ross A.H. Qiu R.G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Plonk S.G. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4823-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To address the role of Cdc42 activated PLD1 in signaling processes, we have initially undertaken a domain analysis study of Cdc42 with respect to binding and activation of PLD1. Several regions on Cdc42 are of potential interest to PLD1 activation because they play important roles in binding and activation of other target effectors, as well as being implicated in activation of PLD1 by RhoA (18.Bae C.D. Min D.S. Fleming I.N. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For example, the switch I region, or effector loop, is highly conserved between Cdc42 and RhoA, and mutations in this region alter the regulation of effectors, such as PAK and IQGAP. Of particular interest is a region of 13 amino acids (residues 122–134 in Cdc42) designated the Rho insert region. This region is unique to the Rho subfamily and is not present in Ras and other small G proteins. Although this region does not function as a “switch domain” upon GTP-GDP exchange (19.Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8760Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20.Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Karoda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it may provide a surface for binding interactions with target effectors. A deletion mutant of Cdc42 in which the insert region is replaced with loop 8 of Ras (designated (ΔL8)Cdc42) is capable of both intrinsic and stimulated GTP binding and GTP hydrolytic activities. Furthermore, (ΔL8)Cdc42 can functionally interact with regulators of the GTP-binding and hydrolytic cycle, as well as with all known target effectors of Cdc42. Removal of the insert region does not perturb Cdc42-mediated JNK activation or filopodia formation (21.Wu W.-J. Leonard D.A. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26153-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22.Wu W.-J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, further characterization of the (ΔL8)Cdc42 mutant implicated the insert region in the transforming ability of Cdc42, specifically interfering with anchorage-dependent growth. Here, we present evidence that binding of Cdc42 to PLD1 and subsequent PLD1 activation are distinct events. PLD1 utilizes the switch I domain of Cdc42 as part of its binding interface but requires the Rho insert region for complete activation by Cdc42, as well as for the synergistic activation of PLD1 caused by Cdc42 working together with either Arf or PKC. The binding of Cdc42 to PLD1 is GTP-dependent but does not require either the geranylgeranyl moiety or the insert region on Cdc42. However, activation of PLD1 by GTP-bound Cdc42 requires both the insert region and geranylgeranylation of the GTPase. To date, PLD1 is the only effector of Cdc42 that requires the Rho insert region for stimulated activity, making PLD1 a candidate effector for Cdc42-mediated signaling events leading to cellular transformation. Monolayers ofSpodoptera frugiperda 21 (Sf21) cells were infected with baculovirus encoding human PLD1. Cells were resuspended in Buffer A (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 174,000 × g for 1 h to prepare a cytosolic fraction, which was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After washing with Buffer B containing 20 mm KCl, the PLD activity was eluted with a linear gradient of 20–1000 mm KCl in Buffer B. The baculovirus encoding human PLD1 was a kind gift from Drs. Michael Frohman and Andrew Morris at SUNY Stony Brook. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-tagged Cdc42Hs constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described (23.Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cloning of wild type and (ΔL8)Cdc42Hs baculovirus were described previously (21.Wu W.-J. Leonard D.A. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26153-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and cloning of (Q61L), (T17N), and (F37A/Q61L)Cdc42Hs into the insect cell baculovirus vector pVL1392 was achieved using the same protocol. For the production of geranylgeranylated Cdc42Hs, monolayers of Sf21 cells were infected with baculovirus encoding hexahistidine-tagged Cdc42Hs constructs. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mmNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.4% CHAPS, 100 μmGDP, protease inhibitor mixture). The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) charged with 50 mm nickel sulfate and equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer followed by wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mmNaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 0.2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). The protein was eluted using the same buffer supplemented with 250 mmimidazole. Recombinant Arf1 was co-expressed with N-myristoyltransferase in E. coli and purified by anion exchange on a DEAE-Sepharose column as described previously (24.Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Kahn R. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

Cells were resuspended in Buffer C (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 174,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to prepare a cytosolic fraction, which was loaded onto a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was washed in Buffer C, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in Buffer C. The PKCβII baculovirus was a kind gift from Dr. Alexandra Newton at the University of California, San Diego. Binding experiments with GST-tagged Cdc42Hs were carried out essentially as described previously (26.McCallum S.J. Wu W.-J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PLD1 binding to Cdc42 was analyzed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against the carboxyl terminus of human PLD1. COS7 cells or NIH(pcsrc527/foc/ep)BI cells (NIH3T3–527 cells) (27.Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with pKH3-Cdc42Hs constructs and pCMV3-PLD1 using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's standard protocols (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture). The lysates were precleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was incubated with antibody to the hemagglutinin (HA) tag on Cdc42Hs for 3 h at 4 °C. Following primary antibody incubation, protein A beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and three times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA (Berkeley Antibody Co.) or anti-PLD1 antibodies. PLD activity was measured essentially as described previously (25.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Kahn R. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14935-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), using the SP-Sepharose peak described above. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm GTPγS. We initially set out to examine which regions on Cdc42, a Rho family GTPase, were involved in binding to PLD1 by examining the ability of different forms of GST-Cdc42 fusion proteins to precipitate ectopically expressed PLD1 from COS7 cell lysates. As shown in Fig.1, the constitutively active, GTP-bound (Q61L)Cdc42 mutant more effectively bound PLD1 compared with wild type Cdc42. Deletion of the Rho insert region does not interfere with the binding of Cdc42 to PLD1. However, two effector loop mutations (Y40C and F37A) abolish the GTP-dependent binding of Cdc42 to PLD1. RhoA and Cdc42 exhibit higher sequence similarity in the effector loop, or switch I region, than other members of the Rho subfamily, and identical mutations (Y42C and F39A) in RhoA were previously shown to interfere with the activation of PLD1 by RhoA (18.Bae C.D. Min D.S. Fleming I.N. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The GTP-dependent binding of Cdc42 to PLD1 does not require the geranylgeranyl modification of the GTPase, because the binding results shown in Fig. 1 were carried out using bacterially expressed Cdc42 constructs. The specificity of Cdc42 binding to PLD1 was verified by co-expressing these proteins in cells (Fig.2 A). HA-tagged GTPase defective (Q61L)Cdc42 was more effective in co-immunoprecipitating PLD1 than was wild type HA-Cdc42 (compare lanes 1 and3). Here again, this binding does not require the insert region of the GTPase (compare lanes 3 and 5). The effector loop region is required for in vivo binding, because identical mutations to those used in the in vitrobinding experiments abolished the interaction of Cdc42 and PLD1in vivo (data not shown). Finally, endogenous PLD1 from NIH3T3–527 cells also associated with GST-Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner independent of the insert region (Fig.2 B). Previous reports have demonstrated associations between RhoA and PLD1 by two-hybrid analysis (28.Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Yamazaki et al.(29.Yamazaki M. Zhang Y. Watanabe H. Yokozeki T. Ohno S. Kailbuchi K. Shibata H. Mukai H. Ono Y. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6035-6038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showed that RhoA interacts with a carboxyl-terminal fragment of human PLD1 and that this interaction was decreased by deletion of the CAAX box from RhoA. Our findings demonstrate a physical association between full-length PLD1 and a Rho family activator, Cdc42. We next examined the ability of specific Cdc42 mutants to activate PLD1 in an in vitro system. Unlike binding of Cdc42 to PLD1, activation of PLD1 by this Rho family GTPase requires geranylgeranylation. Isoprenylation of RhoA is also required for activation of PLD1, suggesting that protein-lipid interactions, as well as protein-protein interactions, may be required for activation of PLD1 by Rho family members (18.Bae C.D. Min D.S. Fleming I.N. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistent with the binding data, activation of PLD1 by Cdc42 is GTP-dependent. Stimulation of PLD1 activity in vitro by Cdc42 requires either an activated form of the GTPase (either wild type protein preloaded with a GTP analog or the Q61L mutation) or the addition of GTPγS to the assay (25.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Kahn R. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14935-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the switch I mutations that abolish binding of Cdc42 to PLD1 are incapable of activating PLD1 (data not shown). Although wild type Cdc42 activates PLD1 in the presence of exogenous GTPγS, (ΔL8)Cdc42 inhibits PLD1 under the same conditions (Fig.3, top panel). Activation of PLD1 by Cdc42 is synergistic with Arf and PKC as shown previously by Singer et al. (10.Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In contrast, (ΔL8)Cdc42 inhibits both Arf1 and PKC activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3,middle and bottom panels, respectively). The ability of the (ΔL8)Cdc42 mutant to inhibit both Arf- and PKC-mediated activation of PLD1 activity suggests that the insert region on Cdc42 is not only essential for activation of PLD1 by Cdc42 but also plays an essential role in the formation of an activated Cdc42/Arf/PLD or Cdc42/PKC/PLD complex. Nonproductive binding of (ΔL8)Cdc42 to PLD1 in the presence of GTPγS can be reversed by the addition of an activated form of Cdc42 (Q61L Cdc42) that stimulates PLD activity (Fig. 4). In the absence (top panel) or presence (bottom panel) of Arf1, (Q61L)Cdc42 (closed circles) activates PLD1 in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of a fixed concentration (40 nm) of (ΔL8)Cdc42 (open circles), (Q61L)Cdc42 reverses the (ΔL8)Cdc42 inhibition of PLD1. This reversal is competitive, demonstrating the specificity of the (ΔL8)Cdc42 inhibition of PLD1 activity.Figure 4Inhibition of PLD1 by (ΔL8)Cdc42 is reversed in the presence of an activated mutant (Q61L) of Cdc42. Purified PLD1 (20 nm) was assayed for catalytic activity in the absence (●) or presence (○) of a fixed concentration of (ΔL8)Cdc42 (40 nm). Increasing amounts of modified (Q61L)Cdc42 were added in the absence (top panel) or presence (bottom panel) of 250 nm Arf1. The PLD1 activity data were plotted using a simple equilibrium model (PLD1/(Q61L) Cdc42 + (ΔL8)Cdc42 ↔ PLD + (Q61L) Cdc42 + (ΔL8)Cdc42 ↔ PLD1/(ΔL8)Cdc42 + (Q61L) Cdc42). Curves were obtained using the iterative, nonlinear least squares fitting regime in the IGOR Pro software package (Wave Metrics).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these data indicate that binding of PLD1 to Cdc42 and subsequent activation of PLD1 by this GTPase are distinct events. First, unprenylated Cdc42 can bind PLD1 in a GTP-dependent manner but is unable to stimulate substrate hydrolysis. Unmodified Cdc42 interacts with all target effectors, including PLD1 as demonstrated here. The requirement of the geranylgeranyl moiety on Cdc42 specifically for activation of PLD1 (but not binding to PLD1) suggests that this lipid modification may serve a dual role in the activation of this lipase. The modified Cdc42 may help to position PLD1 in a favorable orientation with respect to its lipid substrate in the membrane, as well as inducing a catalytically active conformation in the lipase itself. Second, the switch I region on Cdc42 mediates GTP-dependent binding to PLD1, but the insert region is required for complete activation of PLD1. That is, primary interactions between PLD1 and Cdc42 are mediated through the classical effector loop, but secondary interactions between PLD1 and the insert region of the fully modified Cdc42 are necessary for PLD1 to adopt a catalytically active conformation. Furthermore, these secondary interactions are important in regulating the synergistic activation of PLD1 by Cdc42, Arf, and PKC. The ability of (ΔL8)Cdc42 to inhibit both Arf- and PKC-stimulated PLD activity suggests that the insert region of Cdc42 is involved in the synergistic stimulation of PLD by these activators. Specifically, the insert region may indirectly influence the binding sites on PLD for Arf and PKC or may itself contribute to the interaction surface, leading to the observed cooperativity between Cdc42 and these activators with respect to PLD stimulation. With the lack of specific inhibitors of PLD1 activity, the (ΔL8)Cdc42 mutant provides a novel reagent for studying the mechanisms of PLD1 activation by Cdc42 alone and in combination with Arf and PKC. Activating mutations in Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 that mimic their in vivo activation by exchange factors, such as the Dbl oncoprotein, result in specific and unique contributions of each Rho family GTPase to Dbl-induced cellular transformation (15.Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This observation raised the issue of whether specific downstream targets mediate the particular signal contributed by each GTPase. In the presence of a specific inhibitor of the RhoA effector, p160-ROCK, Dbl-induced focus formation was blocked, suggesting that focus formation induced by RhoA is mediated by this target kinase (30.Sahai E. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Treisman R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 136-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cdc42 was implicated in anchorage-independent growth induced by the Dbl oncogene (15.Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The specific Cdc42 effector that mediates this anchorage-independent growth has remained elusive, because none of the known effectors of Cdc42 have been shown to potentiate this phenotype. Removal of the insert region from Cdc42 eliminates the transforming activity of Cdc42 in fibroblasts (22.Wu W.-J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, Cdc42-mediated JNK1 activation and filopodia formation were unaffected by removal of the insert region and thus are not likely to be essential components in Cdc42-mediated transformation. The inhibition of PLD1 by (ΔL8)Cdc42 is the first demonstration of a Cdc42 effector whose activity is perturbed by deletion of the insert region from Cdc42. This observation implicates PLD1 as a highly specific effector for a Cdc42-mediated signaling pathway that, when up-regulated, leads to transformation. In a series of elegant studies, both the Lambeth and Bar-Sagi laboratories independently demonstrated that the insert region in Rac serves as an effector binding domain that is specific for the NADPH oxidase (31.Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is critical for the ability of Rac to promote cell cycle progression, as well as mitogenesis through regulation of superoxide production (32.Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac-induced elevation of superoxide levels plays a critical role in Ras-mediated transformation (33.Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Similar to the demonstration that a specific effector of Rac, the NAPDH oxidase, mediates Rac-induced transformation events, we demonstrate here that PLD1 is a candidate effector for the potentiation of Cdc42 induced anchorage-independent growth. Future studies will be directed at establishing the in vivo relationship between Cdc42-PLD1 interactions and Cdc42-mediated anchorage-independent growth.

In the present work, we evaluated the involvement of calmodulin (CAM) in 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of SOC influx in chick skeletal muscle cells. Treatment with 10−9m 1,25-(OH)2D3 in Ca2+-free medium resulted in a rapid but transient Ca2+ rise correlated with the sterol-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production. The SOC influx stimulated by the hormone was insensitive to both CAM antagonists (fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, compound 48/80) and the CAM-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) inhibitor KN-62 when added after the sterol-dependent Ca2+transient, but it was completely abolished when added prior to the IP3-induced mobilization of Ca2+ from endogenous stores. Moreover, in cells microinjected with antisense oligonucleotides directed against the CAM mRNA the sterol-stimulated SOC influx was reduced up to 60% respect to uninjected cells. The present results suggest that the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced (IP3-mediated) cytosolic Ca2+ transient is required for CAM, activation which in turn activates SOC influx in a mechanism that seems to include CAMKII.

Int. 1993; 31: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar). We recently examined the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) levels in these cells (10.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cytosolic Ca2+ response to the hormone involves an initial rapid sterol-induced Ca2+mobilization from IP3/thapsigargin-sensitive stores followed by cation influx from the extracellular milieu, accounting for a sustained Ca2+ phase. This Ca2+ influx was shown to be contributed not only by the well established L-type VDCC-mediated Ca2+ entry but also by a store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway, thus introducing a novel aspect into the mechanism of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane of muscle cells. The information obtained points to a role for both PKC and tyrosine kinase activities, but not the cyclic AMP/PKA cascade, in the regulation of the sterol-dependent SOCE pathway. In previous studies it was shown that the rapid changes in45Ca2+ influx induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in both intact soleus muscle and cultured myoblasts are paralleled by an increase in the amounts of calmodulin (CAM) bound to membranes at the expense of a decrease in its cytosolic concentration without any change in total CAM cellular content (13.de Boland A.R. Massheimer V. Fernández L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1988; 43: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Fernández L. Massheimer V. de Boland A.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1990; 47: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There is a diversity of cellular responses controlled by Ca2+-dependent pathways utilizing CAM as the signaling mediator (15.James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the activation and/or modulation of which occurs either through direct interaction with target proteins or via CAM-dependent activation of regulatory proteins (16.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Although a plethora of signaling cascades and putative mechanisms have been related to SOCE regulation (17.Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18.Putney J.W. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), mobilization and/or depletion of Ca2+ from endogenous stores seems to be an almost ineludible step in SOC channel activation. In the present work we investigated whether CAM was involved in the mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates SOC entry in chick skeletal muscle cells. The results suggest that the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced cytosolic Ca2+transient is required for CAM activation, which in turn activates SOC influx in a mechanism that might include the CAM-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII). 1α,25-(OH)2D3 was kindly provided by Dr. Heinrich Bachmann (Hoffmann-La Roche). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME), fetal bovine serum (FBS), Fura-2/AM, pluronic F-127, calmidazolium, chlorpromazine, compound 48/80, trifluoperazine, and fluphenazine were from Sigma. KN-62 was from Calbiochem. Lipofectin was from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal (mouse) Anti-CAM antibody (IgG1) was from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. (Golden, CO). The ECL chemiluminescence detection kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Chick skeletal muscle cells were isolated from the breast muscle of 13-day-old chick embryos (Gallus gallus) and cultured at 37 °C in DME plus 10% FBS as described previously (11.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to grow until confluence (4–6 days after plating) before use, by which time all of the myoblasts become differentiated into myotubes expressing both the biochemical and morphological features of adult skeletal muscle fibers (19.Capiati D.A. Limbozzi F. Téllez-Iñón M.T. Boland R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74 (3000): 292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For intracellular Ca2+ measurements, cells grown onto glass coverslips were loaded with 4 μm Fura-2/AM in buffer A (containing (in mm) 138 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 Hepes (pH 7.35), 1.5 CaCl2, plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.012% pluronic) for 45 min at room temperature. Unloaded dye was washed out, and cells were stored in buffer B (buffer A without bovine serum albumin, Fura-2/AM, and pluronic F-127) in the dark at room temperature for at least 40 min prior to use. Cells were then mounted on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with a 40× NA objective lens. The excitation wavelength was rapidly (5.5 Hz) switched over 340 and 390 nm, employing a dual excitation monochromator (DMX1100, Spectronics Inc., Urbana, IL) from an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorimeter (Spectronics Inc.) connected to the epifluorescence port of the microscope through an optic fiber. Emitted fluorescence was reflected by a 400 nm dichroic mirror and filtered through a 510 nm band pass filter. Ratios from short and long wavelength signals were obtained (r = 340/390), and for each single cell or cell group measured (each recording represents the response of at least 200–300 cells analyzed), calibration of cytosolic Ca2+ signal was accomplished in situ at the end of each experiment as described previously (12.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A determination of changes in cytosolic Ca2+ was achieved by overlayering the cells with 500 μl of a nominally Ca2+-free buffer B plus 0.5 mmEGTA. Cells were seeded (10,000/mm2) on coverslips imprinted with squares for localization of injected cells. Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with phosphorothioate linkages throughout the entire molecule were synthesized by the DNAgency (Malvern, PA). Injection of ODN was performed by a manual injection system (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The injection solution contained 10–15 μm ODN in sterile deionized water; 10–30 fl were injected with commercially microcapillaries (Femtotips, Eppendorf). Injection pressure was 60 hectopascals and the injection time 0.1 s. After injection, cells were cultured in DME containing 1% FBS for 48 h before fluorimetric measurements. The following ODN sequences were used: anti-CAM, 5′-ATCAGCCATGGTGGCTCGGC-3′ (antisense against the 49–68 nucleotide sequence from G. gallus CAM mRNA); sense-CAM, 5′-GCCGAGCCACCATGGCTGAT-3′; scrambled, 5′-ATCCTTAGAGTCGCGTACTT-3′. Transfection with ODNs using Lipofectin was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. ODNs were incubated with Lipofectin in DME for 15 min at room temperature. Plates of subconfluent cells were washed to remove serum before the addition of ODN-Lipofectin mixtures, and incubation was performed for 12 h at 37 °C. The ODN solution was removed, DME was added, and the plates were placed into a metabolic incubator for an additional period of 36 h. Control treatments included DME only and Lipofectin only. Dose- and time-response curves for Lipofectin and ODN were optimized previously (not shown). Cell homogenization, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gels) protein fractionation, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunostaining of blots with mouse anti-CAM antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, as well as visualization and digitalization of immunoreactive bands, were as described previously (20.Capiati D. Tellez-Iñón M.T. Boland R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 153: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). The statistical significance of data was evaluated using Student's t test (22.Snedecor G. Cochran W. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1967Google Scholar), and probability values below 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered significant. As shown previously (10.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), stimulation of chick skeletal muscle cells with 10−9m1,25-(OH)2D3 in Ca2+-free medium results in a rapid (30 s) but transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 1) entirely because of mobilization from IP3-sensitive stores. Ca2+ re-admission to the bath, once the Ca2+transient occurred, causes a fast and substantial entry of Ca2+ (about 2-fold over basal) from the outside. This procedure has been shown to reveal the existence of a Ca2+influx pathway that becomes activated by the depletion of endogenous Ca2+ stores (10.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23.Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29169-29175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although blocking of VDCC by either nifedipine or verapamil does not affect the Ca2+influx that normally follows Ca2+ re-addition, in the following experiments SOC influx was recorded in the presence of 2 μm nifedipine and 5 μm verapamil to ensure functional isolation of a SOC entry pathway (see Ref. 12.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether CAM was involved in the mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates SOC entry, the effects of different CAM antagonists were assayed. Fig.2 A shows the effect of a classical CAM antagonist, fluphenazine (50 μm), on the sterol-dependent SOC entry. Application of the inhibitor 2 min prior to hormone-induced discharge of intracellular Ca2+ stores completely prevented Ca2+ influx after cation re-admission to the bath. In addition to fluphenazine, a series of CAM antagonists as well as KN-62, a specific inhibitor of the CAMKII (25.Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were tested for their ability to block 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent SOC influx. As for fluphenazine, the addition of trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, compound 48/80, or the CAMKII inhibitor before the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced cytosolic Ca2+transient reduced the subsequent Ca2+ entry through the SOCE pathway by more than 80% (Fig. 2 B). However, the addition of either the CAM antagonists or KN-62 after the sterol-induced Ca2+ transient, but 2 min prior to Ca2+ re-admission to the bath, had no effect on the SOCE pathway (Fig. 3). The possibility arises that the lack of inhibition by all of the inhibitors tested could be due to a significantly shorter preincubation time (2 min) with these compounds than in the situation of an application prior to hormone exposure (8-min delay from antagonist addition to Ca2+re-admission; Fig. 2); however, a 10-min delay interval between fluphenazine or KN-62 addition after the Ca2+ transient and Ca2+ re-addition did not affect the sterol-dependent SOC influx (data not shown). Activation of CAM requires an elevation in cytosolic Ca2+, which in turn binds to the protein activating it. Once activated, the Ca2+-complexed CAM becomes insensitive to CAM antagonists. Moreover, KN-62 inhibits the kinase activity of CAMKII by interacting with the CAM binding site of the enzyme but does not affect the CAM-independent activity of already active enzyme (25.Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results are consistent with the concept that the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced IP3-mediated Ca2+ transient is a critical step in the activation of CAM and thus in the mechanism by which CAM activates SOC influx. This mechanism seems to involve CAM-mediated activation of CAMKII, in line with the notion that phosphorylation events are crucial in the modulation of the SOC channel function (17.Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As we observed essentially the same effects with the CAM antagonists as with the CAMKII inhibitor, we cannot exclude a role of CAM itself in the regulatory process. Although it has been shown by others that some CAM antagonists could directly inhibit both VDCC and SOC channels (26.Li G. Hidaka H. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Cao Y. Chatton J.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3 allow us to exclude a direct interaction of the CAM inhibitors with the channel itself, which would be observed regardless at which point of the assay the drug is added to the bath. However, interaction of these antagonists with components of the signaling mechanism regulating SOC influx other than CAM cannot be ruled out from these data. Antisense technology allows selective inhibition of the expression of one particular protein involved in signal transduction and to investigate how its knock-out affects a determined cell function (28.Albert P.R. Morris S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This technique, used in combination with fluorimetric detection of hormone-induced changes in [Ca2+]i has proven to be a powerful tool for identifying signaling cascades involved in VDCC regulation (29.Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 30.Kalkbrenner F. Degtiar V.E. Schenker M. Brendel S. Zobel A. Hescheler J. Wittig B. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4728-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine the extent to which complete abolition of 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated SOC influx by CAM antagonists reflects an absolute requirement of the sterol-dependent SOCE pathway for CAM activity, we inhibited the expression of CAM by intranuclear microinjection of an antisense ODN against the CAM mRNA from G. gallus. In cells microinjected with the anti-CAM ODN, the SOC influx induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was reduced by as much as 60% in respect to the control (Fig. 4). Neither the sense ODN nor the scrambled ODN was able to modify the magnitude of the sterol-dependent SOC entry. In skeletal muscle cells the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+/Mg2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin induces a SOC influx highly similar to that dependent upon 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation but driven by signaling mechanisms different from those triggered by the steroid (12.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the injection of cells with the anti-CAM ODN did not affect the SOC channel itself, as the SOCE pathway induced by thapsigargin remained intact (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, this finding suggests that 1,25-(OH)2D3-regulated CAMKII activity modulates proteins other than those forming the channel itself but still closely associated, regulatory ones. The immunoblotting of CAM from lysates of cells transfected with the ODNs (Fig. 4 C) proved the ability of the antisense ODN to suppress the expression of the targeted CAM protein. The remaining SOC influx observed in CAM-depleted cells suggests that additional signaling mechanisms are involved in the regulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced SOC influx in muscle cells. In fact, previous data from our laboratory indicate that sterol-dependent activation of both PKC and tyrosine kinases (TKs) strongly contributes to the modulation of SOC influx (12.Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that PKC or TKs could be involved in the residual SOC influx observed in CAM-depleted cells, we assayed SOC influx sensitivity to either PKC or TK inhibitors. Bisindolylmaleimide I (50 nm) and calphostin C (100 nm), two highly specific PKC inhibitors, added into the incubation medium 2 min prior to Ca2+ re-admission almost completely suppressed (up to 98%) the residual SOCE in CAM-depleted cells, whereas under the same conditions, a 60% reduction was produced by the TK antagonists genistein (50 μm) and herbimycin (10 μm). This finding agrees with evidence indicating that both TK- and PKC-mediated protein phosphorylation are involved in the modulation of SOCE (see Ref. 17.Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and references therein). Although not directly addressed here, it seems likely that TK-mediated regulation of the SOC influx induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 occurs in a PKC-dependent fashion, as no remnant SOC influx could be observed in the presence of PKC inhibitors. In addition, it has been observed recently that PKC inhibition blocks 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of the TK cascade. 2S. Morelli, R. Boland, and A. R. de Boland, submitted for publication. Moreover, the residual SOCE measured in CAM-depleted cells was completely insensitive to fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, or KN-62, thus ruling out the possibility that residual CAM could be mediating such Ca2+entry.Figure 3Addition of either the CAM antagonists or a CAMKII inhibitor after the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transient does not affect the sterol-dependent SOC influx in skeletal muscle cells. A, cells were stimulated with 10−9m 1,25-(OH)2D3 in Ca2+-free medium, and the sterol-dependent Ca2+ transient was monitored until completion. Then fluphenazine (Ffz, 50 μm) was added, and 2 min later Ca2+ (1.5 mm) was re-admitted to the medium. Shown is a time-trace recording representative of 260 cells analyzed. B, cells were stimulated with the sterol as inpanel A; after the Ca2+ transient, fluphenazine (50 μm), trifluoperazine (50 μm), chlorpromazine (40 μm), 48/80 (15 μm), KN-62 (10 μm), or vehicle (isopropanol < 0.01%) was added, and 2 min later Ca2+ (1.5 mm) was re-added to the medium.

The nature of the non-genomic actions of 1,25-(OH)2D3 has led to the proposition that a putative membrane receptor for the hormone is involved in the activation of signaling systems in muscle cells as postulated for this and other steroids in different cell types (2.Boland R. de Boland A.R. Marinissen M. Santillan G. Vazquez G. Zanello S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 114: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but the existence of such a novel receptor has been not conclusively demonstrated. Other lines of evidence have alternatively pointed to a role of the classical vitamin D receptor (VDR) itself in mediating some of the rapid effects of the hormone (31.Kim Y.S. MacDonal P.N. Dedhar S. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3649-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32.Barsony J. McKoy W. Renyi I. Liberman M.E. Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Thomasset M. Vitamin D, a Pluripotent Hormone: Structural Studies, Molecular Endocrinology and Clinical Applications. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1994: 345-346Google Scholar). However, compounds CB1093 and GS1500, two synthetic side-chain analogues of 1,25-(OH)2D3, which are devoid of the ability to bind to VDR, promote Ca2+ entry through muscle SOC channels equipotently with respect to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (33.Vazquez G. Sellés J. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although these results suggest that a receptor other than the VDR mediates sterol actions on the SOCE pathway, the application of antisense technology to deplete VDR expression in muscle cells would significantly improve our understanding on the role of the VDR in such mechanism. Efforts using this experimental approach are currently underway in our laboratory. The general scenario of SOC influx triggering and regulation appears at present complex, involving Ca2+ influx-soluble factors, G proteins, phosphatases, and several kinases (reviewed in Refs. 17.Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and34.Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal regions of transient receptor potential (TRP) and TRP-like channel proteins from Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor cells, which function as Ca2+-permeable channels mainly regulated by store depletion, contain, respectively, one and two CAM-binding sites (35.Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although several TRP and TRP-like homologues from vertebrate tissues have been cloned and characterized as candidates for mediating SOC influx in animal cells (see Ref. 36.Vannier B. Peyton M. Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar and references therein), none of them exhibits CAM-binding motifs as their invertebrate counterparts do. Moreover, evidence on the functional roles of CAM on either vertebrate or invertebrate SOC channel function remains scarce. In this context, the present work not only enhances our knowledge on the role of CAM in the non-genomic mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3activates and modulates SOC entry in chick muscle cells but also contributes to the understanding of the function of CAM and its target protein CAMKII in animal cell SOC influx regulation."

Comparison of 12 KdpD sequences from various microorganisms reveals that this part of the kinase is highly conserved and includes two motifs (Walker A and Walker B) that are very similar to the classical ATP-binding sites of ATP-requiring enzymes. By means of photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, direct evidence was obtained for the existence of an ATP-binding site located in the N-terminal domain of KdpD. The N-terminal domain, KdpD/1–395, was overproduced and purified. Although predicted to be hydrophilic, it was found to be membrane-associated and could be solubilized either by treatment with buffer of low ionic strength or detergent. The membrane-associated form, but not the solubilized one, retained the ability to bind 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. Previously, it was shown that the phosphatase activity of a truncated KdpD, KdpD/Δ12–395, is deregulated in vitro (Jung, K., and Altendorf, K. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17406–17410). Here, we demonstrated that this effect was reversed in vesicles containing both the truncated KdpD and the N-terminal domain. Furthermore, coexpression of kdpD/Δ12–395 and kdpD/1–395 restored signal transduction in vivo. These results highlight the importance of the N-terminal domain for the function of KdpD and provide evidence for an interaction of this domain and the transmitter domain of the sensor kinase.

Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the high affinity K+-translocating complex KdpFABC (see Ref. 2.Altendorf K. Epstein W. Lee A.G. Biomembranes. 5. JAI Press Inc., London1996: 403-420Google Scholar for review). KdpD consists of a long hydrophilic N-terminal domain, four putative transmembrane domains (TM1–TM4),1 and an extended C-terminal transmitter domain (see Fig. 1) (3.Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). KdpD undergoes autophosphorylation at a histidine residue in the presence of ATP, and subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to the response regulator KdpE (4.Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5.Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Momoi H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1777-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated KdpE exhibits an increased affinity to bind upstream of the kdpFABC promoter region and consequently triggers transcription of this operon (6.Sugiura A. Nakashima K. Tanaka K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of KdpD have been shown with purified protein reconstituted into proteoliposomes and purified KdpE (7.Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, KdpD is found to be the only protein that mediates the dephosphorylation of purified KdpE∼P (7.Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that KdpD is a homodimer and that there is no change of the oligomeric state upon phosphorylation (8.Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1415: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on studies with KdpD proteins, in which different Arg residues were individually replaced with Gln, an electrostatic switch mechanism within the protein is proposed, which regulates the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity (9.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The concept of this is supported by the fact that KdpD kinase activity is dependent on negatively charged phospholipids (10.Stallkamp I. Dowhan W. Altendorf K. Jung K. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The stimulus, which KdpD senses, is believed to be a decrease in turgor or an effect thereof. Expression of kdpFABC is induced under K+-limiting growth conditions (less than 2 mm), where the constitutive K+-translocating systems TrkG, TrkH, and Kup of E. coli are unable to maintain the required intracellular pool of K+. In mutants lacking these K+ transport systems, kdpFABC is already expressed in media containing less than 50 mmK+. Therefore, KdpD seems to sense the cell's “need” for K+ to maintain turgor (11.Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12.Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1992; 607: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Malli R. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5102-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control by turgor is supported by the finding that a sudden increase in medium osmolarity, which reduces turgor, transiently turns on kdpFABCexpression. This model has been challenged by the finding that under some conditions expression of kdpFABC is only significantly induced when the osmolarity of the medium is increased by salt and not in case of sugar (9.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14.Sutherland L. Cairney J. Elmore M.J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 805-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4528-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on kdpD mutants, which give rise to K+-independent kdpFABC expression but regain the ability to respond to changes in medium osmolarity independently of the solute, it is suggested that KdpD senses two stimuli: increase in osmolarity and K+ limitation (16.Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This presumption is supported by the differentiated response of KdpD proteins with individual substitutions of Arg residues toward K+ limitation and osmotic upshock (9.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Compared with other known sensor kinases, KdpD is the only protein that has a large, hydrophilic N-terminal domain of about 400 amino acids in length (17.Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Sequence comparison of 12 KdpD sequences of various bacteria reveals that this domain is more conserved then other regions of KdpD. This N-terminal domain includes two sequence motifs, which are very similar to those of a typical ATP-binding site (Walker A and B motifs) (18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Sequences of short N-terminal versions of KdpD have been found in Synechocystis sp. (19.Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar) and in Anabaena sp. L-31 (GenBank™ accession numberAF213466). It is suggested that such a fragment may form a functional KdpD complex with a C-terminal fragment that includes the membrane-spanning domains. It has been shown recently that the phosphatase activity of KdpD is significantly increased in the presence of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, whereas other nucleotides have no effect. Truncated KdpD proteins lacking different parts of the N-terminal domain, including amino acids 12–128 are characterized by phosphatase activities independent of the presence of ATP. This finding suggests that an ATP-binding site has a regulatory role within this domain (18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of E. coli KdpD can be produced separately allowing both the functional and biochemical characterization of this domain. [γ-32P]ATP, NAP-5 gel filtration columns and thrombin were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP was from ICN Biomedicals.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar), in which expression of kdpD is under control of the arabinose promoter (22.Jung K. Heermann R. Meyer M. Altendorf K.

Introduction of a thrombin cleavage site following amino acid 395 in KdpD (KdpD/Th) was achieved by individual amino acid substitutions. Constructs kdpD/1–395 andkdpD/1–395(6His) were obtained by insertion of three stop codons or six codons for His and three stop codons, respectively, after the triplet corresponding to amino acid 395. All site-specific mutations were directed by synthetic mutagenic oligonucleotide primers using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overlap extension method (24.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). PCR products were purified in agarose gels and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. DNA fragments were isolated from the gel and ligated to similarly treated pPV5(6His) (7.Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or pPV5-3 resulting in plasmids pPV5-3/Th(6His), pPV5-3/1–395 and pPV5-3/1–395(6His), respectively. Plasmids pPV5-3/1–395/G37A, K38A, T39C and pPV5-3/1–395/G37A, K38A, T39A(6His) were obtained by restriction of plasmids pPV5-3/1–395 and pPV5-3/1–395(6His) with SacI andStuI, and the resulting fragments were ligated with a similarly treated vector, pPV5-1/G37A, K38A, T39C. E. coli strain TKR2000 transformed with plasmids pPV5-3, pBD, or pBD3 carrying different kdpD mutations was grown aerobically at 37 °C in KML complex medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% KCl) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or with chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Overexpression of genes under control of the arabinose promoter was achieved by addition of 0.2% arabinose to the medium. Cells were harvested at an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼1.0. Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (7.Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the exception that vesicles containing the N-terminal domain were not washed with buffer of low ionic strength. Vesicles were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until use at −80 °C. Solubilization and purification of KdpD/1–395(6His) and KdpD/Th(6His) were carried out as described for wild-type KdpD (7.Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, after solubilization with 2% (v/v) lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) and centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, the protein was bound batchwise to the resin [equilibrated with column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 0.5 m NaCl; 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol; 0.04% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside; 10 mmimidazole)] by incubation of the solubilized protein with Ni2+-NTA resin for 30 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, the N-terminal domain, KdpD/1–395(6His), was purified in the absence of detergent. For this purpose, membrane vesicles were washed four times with buffer of low ionic strength (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 3 mm EDTA). After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, KdpD/1–395(6His) was found in the soluble fraction. 49 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 m NaCl were added before the protein was loaded on a Ni2+-NTA column, which was equilibrated with column buffer without detergent. The protein-resin complex was then packed into a column, and unbound protein was removed by washing with column buffer. Bound His-tagged KdpD derivatives were eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration up to 100 mm. Purified KdpD/Th(6His) was reconstituted into E. coli phospholipids essentially as described (7.Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). KdpD/Th(6His) was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes as described above. Proteoliposomes (10 μg of protein) in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 10 mm MgCl2; and 2 mm dithiothreitol) were incubated with 5 μCi of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol) for 5 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was achieved by irradiating with UV light at 302 nm for 0.5 min. Then, thrombin (5 units) and phosphate-buffered saline were added and incubation was extended for 3 h at room temperature. Inverted membrane vesicles containing KdpD/1–395(6His) (10 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm MgCl2 (total protein concentration, 1 mg) were incubated with 25 μCi of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol) for 5 min at room temperature, and UV cross-linking was carried out. After photoaffinity labeling, KdpD/1–395(6His) was purified essentially as described above; however, the whole procedure was done in batch using 1.5-ml reaction tubes, because of the small amounts of protein; Ni2+-NTA agarose was separated by centrifugation at 2,000 × g. All samples were immediately subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). Gels were dried, ATP binding was detected by exposure of the gels to a phosphor screen, and images were analyzed using the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). To confirm that equal amounts of protein were used, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. E. coli strains TKW22692, transformed with plasmids pBD/1–395 and pBD/1–395/G37A, K38A, T39C, respectively, and TK2240 were grown in minimal medium (25.Epstein W. Davies M. J.

A sudden decrease of K+ was achieved by adding minimal medium without K+ resulting in 20 mm K+ (final concentration). After 30 min of further incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in SDS sample buffer (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, KdpFABC production was detected using antibodies against KdpFABC. KdpE∼32P was obtained as described (9.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation was initiated by addition of inverted membrane vesicles (1 mg/ml) containing KdpD derivatives and, when indicated, 20 mm MgCl2 and 20 μm ATPγS. At different times, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). All samples were immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE. Shortly before stopping SDS-PAGE, an [γ-32P]ATP standard was loaded on the gels. Gels were dried, and phosphorylation of KdpE was detected and quantified as described above. Protein was assayed by a modified Lowry method (27.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7113) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunodetection of KdpD, KdpFABC, and His-tagged proteins was performed with polyclonal antibodies against KdpD and KdpFABC, respectively, and monoclonal penta-His antibodies according to a previous study (4.Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A short version of KdpD comprising the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–395) followed by six His residues (KdpD/1–395(6His)) was generated by insertion of six codons for His and three stop codons at the appropriate site in kdpD. This gene was overexpressed in E. coli strain TKR2000, which was transformed with plasmid pPV5-3/1–395(6His) (data not shown). Localization studies indicated that KdpD/1–395(6His) was membrane-associated (Fig. 3, lane 2); none of the protein was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, lane 3). KdpD/1–395(6His) could either be completely solubilized by detergent (data not shown) or partially detached from the membrane under low ionic conditions (Fig.3, lanes 4 and 5) (see also “Experimental Procedures”). Protein obtained by both methods was used for purification. As illustrated in Fig. 4, KdpD/1–395(6His) binds either in the presence or absence of detergent specifically to Ni-NTA agarose and can be eluted from the resin by increasing the imidazole concentration to 100 mm. Because under low ionic buffer conditions only membrane-associated proteins are released, purification of KdpD/1–395(6His) reaches about 95% homogeneity, whereas in the presence of detergent two major contaminating proteins are detectable (Fig. 4).Figure 4Purification of KdpD/1–395(6His) by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.

Moreover, it contains a highly conserved region, which is very similar to a classical ATP-binding site (Walker A and Walker B motifs) (Fig. 2). Direct biochemical evidence for binding of ATP to this site was obtained by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. The purified and reconstituted full length sensor kinase, carrying a thrombin cleavage site at amino acid position 395 (KdpD/Th(6His)) to separate the ATP-binding sites of the N-terminal and C-terminal domain, was first labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and then treated with thrombin. The protein fragments were loaded on an SDS gel, and the corresponding autoradiography was performed (see Fig.5). Besides the labeled and uncleaved KdpD, two labeled fragments were detectable; however, their size did not correspond to the expected fragment size after thrombin cleavage. Determination of the N-terminal sequences of these fragments confirmed that the large (∼29 kDa) fragment represents amino acids 1–240 and thus compromises the ATP-binding site within the N-terminal domain of KdpD. The amount of protein of the large (∼35-kDa) fragment was too low to determine the N-terminal sequence, thus the corresponding amino acid composition of this fragment is unknown. The same experiment was performed after preincubation of the protein with an excess of nonradioactive ATP. As shown in Fig. 5 (lane 3), labeled full length KdpD but no labeled fragments were detectable indicating the specificity for binding of ATP. Labeling of KdpD, in which the ATP-binding site was inactivated (KdpD/G37A, K38A, T39C) was detectable, although the value reached only 10% compared with that of wild-type KdpD (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 (lane 4), the isolated N-terminal domain retains the ability to bind 8-azido-ATP when it is membrane-associated. In contrast, no labeling of the solubilized N-terminal domain was observed, neither after solubilization by detergent nor after treatment with low-ionic buffer (lane 5). The importance of the N-terminal domain for the function of the sensor kinase was shown by complementation experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For this purpose, anEscherichia coli strain TKW22692 (17.Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) carrying an in-frame deletion within kdpD encoding KdpD/Δ12–395 was used.kdpFABC expression was monitored by Western blotting using antibodies directed against the transport complex, KdpFABC. Using a polyclonal antiserum against KdpFABC, only subunit KdpB is easily detectable (Fig. 6). In confirmation of earlier data, which were based on a transcriptional fusion of thekdpFABC promotor and lacZ (17.Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is found that KdpFABC production is drastically reduced in this strain in comparison to a control strain (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). However, transformation of E. coli TKW22692 with plasmid pBD/1–395, encoding the N-terminal domain of KdpD, KdpD/1–395, gave rise to a significant increase in the amount of produced KdpFABC complex (Fig. 6, lane 3). The same effect was detectable for the His-tagged N-terminal domain, KdpD/1–395(6His), indicating that the His-tag does not disturb complementation (data not shown). Remarkably, no increase in KdpFABC production was observed when the ATP-binding site in the N-terminal domain was inactivated by amino acid replacements (Fig. 6, lane 4). These results clearly indicate the importance of the ATP-binding site in the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of KdpD and provide evidence for the first time of an interaction of this domain with the rest of the protein. The sensor kinase KdpD is characterized by two enzymatic activities: kinase and phosphatase activity. In vitro, phosphatase activity is high in the presence of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, whereas in the absence of ATP dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P is very slow. However, KdpD constructs lacking the ATP-binding site of the N-terminal domain (KdpD/Δ12–228 or KdpD/Δ12–395) by truncation are characterized by a phosphatase activity that is independent of the presence of ATP (18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), (Fig.7 A). To test whether the N-terminal domain can complement the truncated KdpD in vitro, plasmids pBD6-92, encoding KdpD/Δ12–395, and pBD3/1–395(6His), encoding the N-terminal domain of KdpD, were cotransformed in E. coli strain TKR2000. Cells were cultivated, the two kdpD derivatives were overexpressed, and KdpD phosphatase activity was determined after preparation of inverted membrane vesicles. As shown in Fig. 7 B, inverted membrane vesicles containing both the truncated KdpD as well as the N-terminal domain are characterized by a KdpE∼P phosphatase activity, which shows a restored dependence on ATP. These data further support the assumption of a direct interaction of the N-terminal domain (KdpD/1–395) with the rest of the protein and stress the importance of the ATP-binding site located in this region. The stimulus that KdpD senses to activate signal transduction, which results in induction of kdpFABC expression, is believed to be a decrease in turgor or some effect thereof, reflecting the role of K+ as an important cytoplasmic solute (12.Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1992; 607: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether KdpD is a turgor sensor or not (13.Malli R. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5102-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sutherland L. Cairney J. Elmore M.J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 805-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4528-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite this, the nature of the primary stimulus for KdpD is still unknown. Although KdpD shares high similarity to transmitter domains of other histidine kinases, it is unusual in regard of the large input domain. This input (sensor) domain comprises an extended N-terminal cytoplasmic region, four transmembrane domains, and part of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). Three regions within the input domain have been identified to be important for the activity of KdpD: (i) A cluster of positively charged Arg residues close to transmembrane domain four (TM4) is involved in the shift between kinase and phosphatase activities of KdpD (9.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). (ii) The four transmembrane domains seem to be important for the correct positioning of N- and C-terminal domains to each other as well as for perception and/or signal transduction (7.Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17.Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22.Jung K. Heermann R. Meyer M. Altendorf K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1372: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). (iii) Amino acids 12–128, including a slightly modified Walker A site, seem to be important for the regulation of the phosphatase activity of KdpD (18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the overexpression and purification of the N-terminal domain of KdpD as well as its functional importance. Although the Walker A motif found in the N-terminal domain of KdpD is slightly different from a classical motif (an additional amino acid is found between the first and second Gly), photoaffinity labeling by 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP shown here provides direct evidence that the N-terminal domain binds ATP. This has been shown for the full length sensor kinase and for the separately produced domain. The other known example for the same modification of the Walker A motif is found in the dethiobiotin synthetase (28.Huang W. Jia J. Gibson K.J. Taylor W.S. Rendina A.R. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10985-10995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), for which ATP binding was shown. ATP binding was detected only for the membrane-associated N-terminal domain, but not for the solubilized peptide. Although the N-terminal domain is mainly composed of hydrophilic amino acid residues, there is a stretch of 17 hydrophobic amino acid residues around the Walker A site (3.Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). From the differences found in the ability to bind azido-ATP, it is concluded that only the membrane-associated domain retains the proper folding to accommodate the nucleotide. It has been shown for the ATP-sensitive channel (K ATP channel), which is blocked by intracellular ATP, that binding affinity changes significantly depending on the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bis-phosphate (29.Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Because negatively charged phospholipids influence the kinase activity of KdpD (10.Stallkamp I. Dowhan W. Altendorf K. Jung K. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that alterations in the attachment of this domain to the lipid bilayer influences the binding to ATP. The truncated KdpD proteins KdpD/Δ12–395 and KdpD/Δ12–228 but not KdpD/Δ128–391 diminish kdpFABC expression significantly under K+-limiting growth conditions (18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these are the only known examples of KdpD derivatives, which influence the response to K+ limitation. Although other amino acid replacements within KdpD alter the response to osmolarity and/or to an increase in the external K+ concentration, none of them influence the response to K+ limitation (9.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26415-26420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that separate expression of the N-terminal domain significantly increases kdpFABC expression under K+-limiting growth conditions. This result indicates the importance of this domain for signal transduction and provides evidence for an interaction between the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal transmitter domain of KdpD. It has been described before that truncation of amino acids 12–128 causes deregulation of the phosphatase activity in vitro. In the presence of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P is fast, whereas in the absence of ATP only a very slow rate is observed (18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Truncated KdpD derivatives, in which amino acids 12–128 are missing, are characterized by an ATP-independent phosphatase activity (18.Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that an ATP dependence of the dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P by KdpD/Δ12–395 is restored in the presence of the separately produced N-terminal domain. The physiological role of the ATP-binding site within the N-terminal domain is still puzzling. Interestingly, under conditions of an osmotic upshock (30.Ohwada T. Sagisaka S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as well as under K+-limiting growth conditions 3K. Jung, unpublished observation. a sudden increase of the intracellular ATP concentration is observed. Because ATP binding affects the phosphatase activity of KdpD, a role of the intracellular ATP concentration as a primary stimulus for KdpD to regulate the ratio between kinase and phosphatase activities is conceivable. However, the direct link between the increased intracellular ATP concentration and binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain is unproved. In summary, the results presented here indicate that the N-terminal domain is essential for modulating the phosphatase activity of KdpD and thus proper signal transduction. The data provide direct evidence for the existence of an ATP-binding site within this domain. The role of this binding site remains unclear. KdpD activity can be restoredin vivo as well as in vitro from two separately produced domains providing indirect evidence for the interaction between the N-terminal domain and the rest of the protein. Finally, the purification protocol for the N-terminal domain presented here provides the prerequisite to characterize this interaction in more detail.

https://openalex.org/W1997995790,"Yolk is the major source of nutrients for the developing chicken embryo, but molecular details of the delivery mechanisms are largely unknown. During oogenesis in the chicken, the main yolk components vitellogenin and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) are taken up into the oocytes via a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family termed LR8 (Bujo, H., Hermann, M., Kaderli, M. O., Jacobsen, L., Sugawara, S., Nimpf, J., Yamamoto, T., and Schneider, W. J. (1994) EMBO J.13, 5165–5175). This endocytosis is accompanied by partial degradation of the yolk precursor protein moieties; however, fragmentation does not abolish binding of VLDL to LR8. The receptor exists in two isoforms that differ by a so-called O-linked sugar domain; the shorter form (LR8−) is the major form in oocytes, and the longer protein (LR8+) predominates in somatic cells. Here we show that both LR8 isoforms are expressed at ratios that vary with embryonic age in the extraembryonic yolk sac, which mobilizes yolk for utilization by the embryo, and in the allantois, the embryo's catabolic sink. Stored yolk VLDL interacts with LR8 localized on the surface of the yolk sac endodermal endothelial cells (EEC), is internalized, and degraded, as demonstrated by the catabolism of fluorescently labeled VLDL in cultured EEC. Addition to the incubation medium of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, which inhibits all known LR8/ligand interactions, blocks the uptake of VLDL by EEC. The levels of endogenous receptor-associated protein correspond to those of LR8+ but not LR8−, suggesting that it may play a role in the modulation of surface presentation of LR8+. Importantly, EEC express significant levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and protein disulfide isomerase, key components required for lipoprotein synthesis. Because the apolipoprotein pattern of VLDL isolated from the yolk sac-efferent omphalomesenteric vein is very different from that of yolk VLDL, these data strongly suggest that embryo plasma VLDL is resynthesized in the EEC. LR8 is a key mediator of a two-step pathway, which affects the uptake of VLDL from the yolk sac and the subsequent delivery of its components to the growing embryo.

The yolk, accumulated via uptake from the circulation of precursor proteins during the vitellogenic phase of oocyte growth (1.Schneider W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), serves as the sole source of lipid, carbohydrate, and protein. Interestingly, only 350 mg of the 5–6 g of lipid in the yolk are mobilized during the first 2 weeks of embryogenesis; the major portion is transported during the final week. Such uptake, to a large part, occurs via the yolk sac (2.Bellairs R. Adv. Morphog. 1964; 4: 217-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which utilizes the yolk lipoprotein components, following their degradation or modification, for resynthesis of lipoproteins that are subsequently secreted and delivered to the embryo through the embryonic circulatory system. The chick yolk sac is characterized by an outer layer of loosely associated mesenchymal tissue containing fetal blood islands and an inner single layer of endodermal cells that line the lumen of the yolk sac cavity (3.Rugh R. A Guide to Vertebrate Development. 7th Ed. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York1977: 123-215Google Scholar). The yolk sac-derived very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)1 contains much higher proportions of cholesteryl esters than VLDL in the yolk (4.Noble R.C. Connor K. World's Poult. Sci. J. 1984; 40: 114-120Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 5.Schjeide O., A. Prog. Chem. Fats Other Lipids. 1963; 6: 251-289Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6.Noble R.C. Connor K. Smith W.K. Poult. Sci. 1984; 63: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and, as shown here, harbors the intact form of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) rather than the proteolytic fragments thereof found in yolk VLDL. Furthermore, VLDL in the embryonic circulation lacks the protein apo-VLDL-II, which is synthesized by laying hens and is present in yolk VLDL. These findings suggest that processing of yolk components inside the yolk sac proceeds in controlled fashion, initially involving degradation of their constituents.Inasmuch as (i) receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins is the most active pathway known for their uptake and degradation, (ii) yolk uptake into the oocyte is mediated by a highly expressed member of the LDL receptor gene family termed LR8 (a LDL receptor relative with eight ligand binding repeats) (1.Schneider W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7.Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), (iii) yolk VLDL, despite its lack of intact apoB, is known to bind to LDL receptor family members (8.Nimpf J. Radosavljevic M. Schneider W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and (iv), not only the oocytes but also somatic cells express LR8, we wanted to determine whether LR8 might be involved in the uptake of yolk VLDL into the yolk sac. Further support for this rationale is provided by reports that yolk uptake occurs, at least to some extent, via coated structures, the sites of localization of endocytic receptors, at the apical surface of the yolk sac endoderm in the area vasculosa (9.Mobbs I.G. McMillan D.B. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10.Lambson R.O. Am. J. Anat. 1970; 129: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11.Noble R.C. Cocchi M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 107-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).As indicated above, members of the LDL receptor (LDLR) family play important roles in lipid metabolism and reproduction of the chicken (1.Schneider W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,7.Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J.

Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The LDLR superfamily is defined by common structural elements, which show high degrees (70–100%) of sequence identity between the molecules harboring them and among a wide range of species. Such sequence conservation is thought to have evolved by duplication and/or exon shuffling events from an ancestral gene. Obligatory for belonging to the gene family are the so-called extracellular LDLR type A repeats, also known as LDLR ligand binding repeats, which consist of approximately 40 amino acids and contain 6 cysteines each. These repeats are arranged in head to tail fashion and are preceded and/or followed by so-called epidermal growth factor-precursor repeats with 6 cysteines each as well. Other common elements are the YWTD repeats, characterized by a length of ∼50 residues containing a consensus tetrapeptide sequence, (F/Y)WXD. Typically these are present in group(s) of five, flanked by epidermal growth factor-precursor repeat elements. There is a single membrane-spanning stretch. In the intracellular domain, all LDLR family members identified so far contain one or more tyrosine-containing hexapeptides that serve as internalization signals, e.g. FDNPVY or FANSHY (14.Yamazaki H. Bujo H. Kusunoki J. Seimiya K. Kanaki T. Morisaki N. Schneider W.J. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24761-24768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).In ovarian follicles of the hen, alternative splicing of the mRNA for LR8 has been observed, which leads to the expression of two isoforms of the chicken protein, i.e. with (LR8+) and without (LR8−) a 30-residue so-called O-linked sugar domain (15.Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The expression of these two receptor isoforms in the ovary is cell-specific, i.e. the receptor lacking the O-linked sugar domain is found almost exclusively in oocytes, whereas the receptor containing the O-linked sugar domain is predominantly expressed in the adjacent somatic cells, specifically the granulosa cells (15.Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This characteristic receptor distribution in the follicular cells implies that the splicing event is important for normal folliculogenesis and, furthermore, supports the critical role for LR8− in the rapidly growing oocyte. As shown here, both LR8 isoforms are expressed in the yolk sac, an extraembryonic structure composed of somatic cells, where the receptors are involved in import of yolk components into the endodermal cells.RESULTSFirst, we used our previously raised polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against LR8, which recognizes both splice variant forms of the receptor, LR8− (95 kDa) and LR8+ (100 kDa) (15.Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol.

For reference, the two forms could be clearly demonstrated in extracts of oocyte-plasma membrane enriched material and of heart, respectively (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2). In the extraembryonic tissues, yolk sac and allantois, both forms of LR8 were detectable as well (lanes 3–8). However, the expression levels of the two forms varied depending on source (allantois versus yolk sac) and embryonic age. In the yolk sac, levels of LR8− were high in 9-day-old embryos and decreased with age, whereas LR8+ was detectable only at 9 days but not later (both forms were also undetectable up to day 7; not shown). Opposite to the pattern in yolk sac, the allantois contained increasing amounts of LR8+ with increasing age, and at later stages (increasing from 11 to 16 days) also expressed LR8−; in 16-day-old embryos, there were almost equal amounts of the two splice variants in the allantois (lane 8). These data indicated regulated and differential expression of the two splice variants in extraembryonic tissues.The cells of the yolk sac exposed to the yolk are the EEC, and thus expression of LR8 in these cells is a prerequisite for LR8 to function in lipoprotein uptake from the yolk. Previously, Kanai et al. (33.Kanai M. Soji T. Herbert D.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have suggested a role of the epithelium in lipid transfer from the yolk to the vitelline circulation, including lipoprotein processing and resynthesis. Therefore, to determine whether such transport could be mediated by LR8 of EEC, we prepared primary cultures of these cells. Triton X-100 extracts from cultured EEC, and for negative control, from cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts, which do not express LR8 (20.Hayashi K. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were subjected to Western blotting with our rabbit anti-LR8 antibody (Fig. 1 B). Chicken embryo fibroblasts were maintained in complete serum supplemented with 4 μg/ml OH-cholesterol or in lipoprotein-deficient serum supplemented with 2 μg/ml mevinolin, conditions known to regulate the LDLR (34.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Stone N.J. Cell. 1977; 12: 629-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As positive control, membrane extracts from oocytes, yolk sac, and heart were analyzed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1,2, and 4). As seen in Fig. 1 B(lane 3), cultured EEC (derived from an 9-day-old embryo) express both forms of LR8. The predominant presence of LR8− in EEC is compatible with the data obtained with whole yolk sac tissue (Fig. 1,B, lane 2, and A, lanes 3,5, and 7).To correlate the immunoblotting data with the levels of LR8 transcripts and to assure that the protein bands seen in Fig. 1 correspond to the splice variant forms of LR8, we performed reverse transcription PCR on RNA from allantois and yolk sac (Fig. 2). When we used oligonucleotides corresponding to the amino acid residues flanking the O-linked sugar domain of LR8 (15.Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in reverse transcription PCR of yolk sac and allantois RNA, we obtained two products. As confirmed by sequencing, the smaller amplified fragment (285 bp) represented the transcript for the splice variant lacking the O-linked sugar domain, and the larger one (375 bp) represented the transcript for the receptor containing this domain. LR8− transcript was clearly detectable in yolk sac, and transcripts for both splice variants were present in allantois. These data were in excellent agreement with those at the protein level. Finally, we analyzed the expression of LR8 in the yolk sac by immunohistochemistry (Fig.3). Staining of yolk sac tissue obtained from 9-day-old embryos with the polyclonal rabbit anti-LR8 antibody revealed that the receptor was predominantly present in the EEC (Fig.3 B); nonimmune IgG was used as control and did not result in any staining (Fig. 3 A).Figure 2Expression of LR8 splice variants in yolk sac and allantois isolated from chicken embryos. RNA from allantois and yolk sac (9-, 11-, and 16-day-old embryos, as indicated ontop) were used for cDNA synthesis and further amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotides flanking the region coding for the O-linked sugar domain of LR8 (15.Bujo H.

Thus, we tested whether this would also be the case in the extraembryonic tissues, in which the two LR8 splice variants are distributed unevenly. When we analyzed the expression of RAP in yolk sac and allantois at the protein level by immunoblotting (16.Lindstedt K.A. Mahon M.G. Foisner R. Hermann M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30221-30227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), the 39-kDa protein was shown to be expressed in all tissues, at apparently higher levels in yolk sac than in allantois. This higher expression of RAP in the yolk sac may relate to the higher endocytic activity of this tissue. Furthermore, in both membranes the amount of RAP does not appear to change dramatically with embryonic age. Thus, although LR8− levels in the yolk sac decrease during embryo growth, those of RAP do not. This is in agreement with our previous data (16.Lindstedt K.A. Mahon M.G. Foisner R. Hermann M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30221-30227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which showed that oocyte-specific expression of LR8− was not correlated with the levels of RAP expression. In the follicle, we had found positive correlation of RAP levels with those of LR8+ in the somatic granulosa cells (16.Lindstedt K.A. Mahon M.G. Foisner R. Hermann M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30221-30227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), compatible with the present findings in the allantois, where both proteins do not dramatically change during embryo development.Figure 4Western blotting of RAP in chicken embryo yolk sac and allantois. Triton X-100 extracts obtained from testes of an adult rooster (20 μg, lane 1); yolk sac (lanes 2, 4, and 6); and allantois (lanes 3, 5, and 7) from chicken embryos of different ages (lanes 2 and 3, 9 days old;lanes 4 and 5, 11 days old; lanes 6and 7, 16 days old) were subjected to 4.5–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, and Western blot analysis using rabbit antiserum (1:500) against chicken RAP was performed.

Thus, to determine whether yolk sac endodermal cells display functional receptor-mediated uptake of yVLDL, we isolated the EEC from the yolk sac of 9-day-old chicken embryos and incubated them with fluorescently labeled yVLDL for 20 min at 37 °C (Fig.5). Indeed, following incubation with 10 μg/ml fluorescent yVLDL, punctate fluorescence apparently within endocytic vesicular compartments was observed, indicating that the lipoprotein had been taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fig.5 A). Moreover, when 200 μg/ml RAP (Fig. 5, Band C) or 200 μg/ml unlabeled yVLDL (Fig. 5, day andE) were added to the incubation media, uptake of fluorescent yVLDL was almost completely inhibited. Panels C andE of Fig. 5 show the DAPI-stained nuclei of the cells inpanels B and D. Furthermore, we tested for the expression of RAP-binding proteins in yolk sac extracts by ligand blotting with radiolabeled RAP (Fig. 6) and could not detect any other bands than LR8. These data strongly support our notion that LR8 is one of the major mediators, if not the exclusive mediator, of VLDL endocytosis in EEC. Finally, we performed uptake experiments in which we incubated EEC for 4 h with various concentrations of 125I-labeled yVLDL at 37 °C (Fig.7). Cell-associated radioactivity, representing uptake and binding of 125I-yVLDL, increased as a function of ligand concentration with high affinity and saturability, with half-saturation occurring at approximately 6 μg/ml. Moreover, in the presence of 1 mg/ml of unlabeled VLDL as competitor, the high affinity component was completely abolished, in agreement with an LR8-mediated uptake mechanism.Figure 5Receptor-mediated uptake of fluorescently labeled yVLDL by endodermal epithelial cells. The cells were isolated from the yolk sac of 9-day-old chicken embryos and incubated with 10 μg/ml fluorescent yVLDL (A–E), plus 200 μg/ml RAP (B and C) or 200 μg/ml unlabeled yVLDL (D and E) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C and E show the DAPI-stained nuclei of the cells in B and D, respectively.

To this end, we tested for the reactivity of the cultured yolk sac cells and of fibroblasts from the same embryo with an antibody directed against the endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) (30.Xie Y. Muller W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5569-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 8, the cultured EEC, but not the fibroblasts, displayed immunoreactivity; inspection of several such experiments (not shown) demonstrated that over 95% of the cultured yolk sac cells were PECAM-1-positive.Figure 8Immunofluorescence staining of EEC.

Incubation of the cells with 1 mg/ml of purified yVLDL for 24 h indeed resulted in massive accumulation of triglycerides in cellular lipid droplets, as shown by Oil red-O staining (Fig. 9 B); without prior incubation with yVLDL, the cells did not display lipid-staining structures (Fig. 9 A). In three independent experiments, the triglyceride content of the control cells (time 0) was determined to be 0,23 ± 0,04 mg/mg cell protein (mean ± S.E.), which rose to 0.74 ± 0.12 mg/mg after 6 h, and to 0.96 ± 0.08 mg/mg after 24 h of incubation.Figure 9Triglyceride accumulation in EEC incubated with yVLDL.

Thus, we (i) tested whether resynthesis of VLDL could be documented, by comparison of the protein components of VLDL from yolk versus that in the embryonic circulation and (ii) analyzed for the presence of component(s) known to be prerequisite for VLDL production, such as MTP, an essential factor for the loading of apoB with lipids in liver and intestine (for review see Ref. 36.Wetterau J.R.

Analysis of the apolipoprotein content of lipoproteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-apoB antibody (Fig. 10) revealed that indeed, the protein composition of plasma VLDL from embryos and adult animals was very different from that of yolk VLDLs from the yolk sac and laid eggs, respectively. Yolk VLDL contained immunoreactive apoB fragments, previously shown to result from cathepsin D-catalyzed intraoocytic proteolysis of apoB-100 (8.Nimpf J. Radosavljevic M. Schneider W.J. Proc. Natl.

Moreover, VLDL in the circulation of laying hens, but not of the embryo, contained apoVLDL-II (the predominant band at ∼16 kDa in lanes 1–3 of Fig.10 A), in perfect agreement with the known strictly estrogen-dependent synthesis of this apo (38.Schneider W.J.

We cloned the disrupted locus of kisimo and identified a novel testis-specific gene, THEG, which is specifically expressed in spermatids and was disrupted in the transgenic mouse. The yeast two-hybrid screening method revealed that THEG protein strongly interacts with chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide-1ε, suggesting that THEG protein functions as a regulatory factor in protein assembly.

By using the introduced DNA as a probe to screen genomic libraries from mutant animals, it has been possible in a few instances to isolate clones that contain DNA flanking the exogenous integrated material and, thus, include portions of the interrupted gene (4.Krulewski T.F.

Ohtsuka A. Akatsuka H. Imai Y. Michibata H. Fujishige K. Kawai E. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As the mice were bred, it became evident that many males of one line were sterile and that the sterility arose from a defect in spermatogenesis (we named this mutant kisimo for a Japanese goddess of easy delivery). Because the sterility segregated with the hemizygous transgene and occurred in the absence of the detectable expression of the transgene, we concluded that the abnormal phenotype was due to mutagenesis by insertion of the transgene. In this study, to clone the junctions between the inserted transgene and adjoining cellular DNA, we used thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR) (7.Liu Y.G. Whittier R.F. Genomics. 1995; 25: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and defined a genomic locus important for spermatogenesis.The process of spermatogenesis in the mouse has been well characterized at the morphological level. The spermatogenic process can be subdivided into three main phases. Spermatogonia, the germinal stem cells, undergo mitosis to produce additional spermatogonia, a portion of which develop into primary spermatocytes. The spermatocytes enter meiosis and proceed through two cell divisions to give rise to haploid round spermatids. These, in turn, undergo a complex morphological transformation involving nuclear condensation and elongation resulting in the production of mature spermatozoa. However, at the molecular level, relatively little is known about the control of cellular differentiation and the architectural changes during spermatogenesis.In this study, we found that an insertion of foreign DNA results in abnormal male germ-cell development, showing abnormal elongated spermatids in the lumina of seminiferous tubules with severely abnormal or absent flagella, and that a novel testis-specific gene was disrupted in the transgenic mouse. This novel mouse autosomal recessive mutant exhibited a phenotype similar to asthenospermia and provides us an approach to understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of flagella during spermiogenesis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAll twelve independent transgenic lines carrying the human PDE5A gene (6.Yanaka N. Kotera J. Ohtsuka A. Akatsuka H. Imai Y. Michibata H. Fujishige K. Kawai E. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were bred to homozygosity to screen for recessive insertional mutations. One of these mice transmitted the transgene to its progeny, but when they were intercrossed the resulting homozygotes (ki/ki mice) were infertile. The average testis weight ofki/ki mice (46.9 ± 8.2 mg; n = 5) was 60% that of wild-type littermates (78.0 ± 6.3 mg;n = 5) at 12 weeks of age. In wild and heterozygous mice, none of the spermatogenic cell types at stages II-III, V, VII, and XI showed either pathological or quantitative changes. On the contrary, ki/ki mice had virtually no spermatozoa in the lumina of seminiferous and epididymal tubules. As shown in Fig.1 B, elongated spermatids in the vicinity of the lumina of seminiferous tubules showed vacuolation and were occasionally phagocytosed by Sertoli cells. Several studies on male mice that were sterile because of blocked spermatogenesis have demonstrated the appearance of multinucleated giant cells and numerous spermatocytes undergoing apoptotic cell death (13.Roest H.P. van Klaveren J. de Wit J. van Gurp C.G.

However, analysis of cross-sections of these testes by Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling assay showed the absence of apoptotic cells in the lumina of seminiferous tubules from ki/ki mice (data not shown). Further characterization of spermatids by electron microscopy revealed the elongated spermatids to have abnormal or completely nonexistent flagella. In the elongated spermatids of wild-type mice, the axoneme was composed of microtubules emanating straight from the centriole at the base of the spermatid nucleus (Fig. 1 C). On the contrary, the microtubules and coarse fibers were arranged in a whirl, the nuclei were misshapen, and the cytoplasmic electron density was increased in elongated spermatids of ki/ki mice (Fig.1 D). Intracytoplasmic vacuoles and autophagolysosomes were increased in elongated and some round spermatids. In addition, in the quantitative evaluation of spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules, elongated spermatids were significantly decreased at all stages (stage VII is shown in Fig. 1 E). Neither the number of spermatogonia nor that of spermatocytes exhibited significant differences. Furthermore, we analyzed testis RNAs derived from wild-type and ki/ki mice for markers of testis development, post-meiotic-specific cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), and haploid-specific protamine 2 transcripts. Neither CREM nor protamine 2 RNA levels were significantly affected by the insertional mutation (Fig. 2 C), also indicating that spermatogenesis was not suppressed in the proliferative and meiotic phases.Figure 2Identification of the mouse kilocus.

The chromosomal localization of the transgene insertion site was determined by FISH using the whole transgene as a probe, which resulted in a single pair of symmetrical signals mapped to the C1 region of chromosome 10, showing multiple copies of the transgene to be integrated in tandem at a single locus (Fig. 2 B). To clone the junctions between the inserted transgene and adjoining cellular DNA, we employed TAIL-PCR by using degenerated primers and specific primers corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the transgene. One junction fragment containing DNA flanking the transgene insertion site was identified. A wild-type mouse genomic phage library was screened using the flanking DNA fragment as a probe. These isolated phage clones covered about 25 kb of the mouse genome, showing that the integration of the transgene produced a deletion of about 20 kb in the genomic locus (Fig.2 A).To identify exons in the genomic locus, Northern blot analysis was performed using several DNA fragments (3–6 kb) obtained by endonuclease digestion, covering the deleted region, as a probe. When using 5 kb of the KpnI/XhoI fragment as a probe, a 1.6-kb transcript was detected in the testes from wild-type mice. However, Northern blot analysis showing no signal in testis RNA fromki/ki mice revealed ki/ki mice to be a null strain for this transcript (Fig. 2 C). Next, a mouse testis cDNA library was screened with the 5-kbKpnI/XhoI fragment to isolate the corresponding cDNA. We cloned three cDNAs generated by alternative splicing. The proteins predicted from these nucleotide sequences are 313, 351, and 375 amino acids long (Fig.3 A). In vitrotranscription/translation analysis demonstrated that the mouse cDNAs encode corresponding proteins (data not shown). To isolate a human counterpart, a human testis cDNA library was screened at a reduced stringency using the mouse full-length cDNA as a probe. The isolated human cDNA encoded a 380-amino acid protein and showed 59.6% identity with the mouse protein (Fig.3 B). A search of the database using the nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that the isolated cDNA is identical to a novel THEG (15.Nayernia K. von Mering M.H. Kraszucka K. Burfeind P. Wehrend A.

Expression of the THEG is highly specific to the testes of mice (data not shown) and humans (Fig.4 A). To identify the cell types that express the THEG, we performed in situhybridization with a cRNA probe (Fig. 4 B). In testis, the transcripts were detectable only in round and elongated spermatids, consistent with the abnormal spermiogenic process of ki/kimice.Figure 3A, three isoforms of the mouse THEG protein (mTHEG1a, mTHEG1b, andmTHEG1c) are produced by alternative splicing.

We found a single positive clone, CCTε, that could interact with the THEG protein (Fig.5 A). To confirm this interaction between THEG protein and CCTε in intact cells, we co-expressed a FLAG epitope-tagged THEG (FLAG-mTHEG1b) with an Xpress epitope-tagged CCTε (Xpress-CCTε) in 293 cells. The ability of antibody against the Xpress epitope to precipitate a complex of THEG and CCTε suggests that the two proteins interact in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B). The TCP-1 gene is located in the mouset-complex on chromosome 17 (16.Phillips D.M. Pilder S.H. Olds-Clarke P.J. Silver L.M. Biol.

A mouset-complex mutation was discovered to produce a phenotype with a tail-less sperm and, to date, TCP-1 identical to the α subunit of CCT has been shown to be highly expressed during haploid stages of spermatogenesis (18.Silver L.M.

In the testis, one possible candidate for such a substrate may be α tubulin; α-tubulin has constitutively expressed subtypes and testis-specific subtypes (22.Villasante A. Wang D. Dobner P. Dolph P.

The basic element of the cytoskeleton is the axoneme, which has an identical structure in both cilia and flagella. Structural anomalies of the axoneme, which are associated with impaired motility, have been described inChlamydomonas (25.Mitchell D.R. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, asthenozoospermia is a very frequent cause of male infertility. Previous reports demonstrated that ultrastructural abnormality of spermatozoa is observed in asthenozoospermic or teratozoospermic sterile men (26.Gentleman S. Kaiser-Kupfer M.I. Sherins R.J. Caruso R. Robison Jr., W.G. Lloyd-Muhammad R.A. Crawford M.A. Pikus A. Chader G.J. Hum. Pathol. 1996; 27: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 27.Chemes H.E. Olmedo S.B. Carrere C. Oses R. Carizza C. Leisner M. Blaquier J. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A high incidence of flagellar pathology was found to be the underlying cause of motility disorders in severely asthenozoospermic patients (28.Escalier D. David G. Biol. Cell. 1984; 50: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mammalian spermatozoa the flagellum is distinguished by adjoining structures, particularly the dense fibers and fibrous sheath. In particular, poor development of outer dense fibers is considered to be a major cause of tail abnormality; however, research in this area has been limited by the lack of appropriate animal models. The present study indicated that availability of this novel mouse autosomal recessive mutant showing a phenotype similar to asthenospermia enables us to investigate the developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of flagella. The integration of foreign DNA into the mouse germ line by retroviral infection or microinjection can result in insertional disruption of endogenous genes with important roles in development (1.Pellas T.C.

By using the introduced DNA as a probe to screen genomic libraries from mutant animals, it has been possible in a few instances to isolate clones that contain DNA flanking the exogenous integrated material and, thus, include portions of the interrupted gene (4.Krulewski T.F. Neumann P.E. Gordon J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3709-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5.Magram J. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10327-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have produced a series of 12 transgenic mouse lines with the human phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A)1 gene (6.Yanaka N. Kotera J. Ohtsuka A. Akatsuka H. Imai Y. Michibata H. Fujishige K. Kawai E. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As the mice were bred, it became evident that many males of one line were sterile and that the sterility arose from a defect in spermatogenesis (we named this mutant kisimo for a Japanese goddess of easy delivery). Because the sterility segregated with the hemizygous transgene and occurred in the absence of the detectable expression of the transgene, we concluded that the abnormal phenotype was due to mutagenesis by insertion of the transgene. In this study, to clone the junctions between the inserted transgene and adjoining cellular DNA, we used thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR) (7.Liu Y.G. Whittier R.F. Genomics. 1995; 25: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and defined a genomic locus important for spermatogenesis. The process of spermatogenesis in the mouse has been well characterized at the morphological level. The spermatogenic process can be subdivided into three main phases. Spermatogonia, the germinal stem cells, undergo mitosis to produce additional spermatogonia, a portion of which develop into primary spermatocytes. The spermatocytes enter meiosis and proceed through two cell divisions to give rise to haploid round spermatids. These, in turn, undergo a complex morphological transformation involving nuclear condensation and elongation resulting in the production of mature spermatozoa. However, at the molecular level, relatively little is known about the control of cellular differentiation and the architectural changes during spermatogenesis. In this study, we found that an insertion of foreign DNA results in abnormal male germ-cell development, showing abnormal elongated spermatids in the lumina of seminiferous tubules with severely abnormal or absent flagella, and that a novel testis-specific gene was disrupted in the transgenic mouse. This novel mouse autosomal recessive mutant exhibited a phenotype similar to asthenospermia and provides us an approach to understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of flagella during spermiogenesis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAll twelve independent transgenic lines carrying the human PDE5A gene (6.Yanaka N. Kotera J. Ohtsuka A. Akatsuka H. Imai Y. Michibata H. Fujishige K. Kawai E. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were bred to homozygosity to screen for recessive insertional mutations. One of these mice transmitted the transgene to its progeny, but when they were intercrossed the resulting homozygotes (ki/ki mice) were infertile. The average testis weight ofki/ki mice (46.9 ± 8.2 mg; n = 5) was 60% that of wild-type littermates (78.0 ± 6.3 mg;n = 5) at 12 weeks of age. In wild and heterozygous mice, none of the spermatogenic cell types at stages II-III, V, VII, and XI showed either pathological or quantitative changes. On the contrary, ki/ki mice had virtually no spermatozoa in the lumina of seminiferous and epididymal tubules. As shown in Fig.1 B, elongated spermatids in the vicinity of the lumina of seminiferous tubules showed vacuolation and were occasionally phagocytosed by Sertoli cells. Several studies on male mice that were sterile because of blocked spermatogenesis have demonstrated the appearance of multinucleated giant cells and numerous spermatocytes undergoing apoptotic cell death (13.Roest H.P. van Klaveren J. de Wit J. van Gurp C.G. Koken M.H. Vermey M. van Roijen J.H. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Vreeburg J.T. Baarends W.M. Bootsma D. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). However, analysis of cross-sections of these testes by Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling assay showed the absence of apoptotic cells in the lumina of seminiferous tubules from ki/ki mice (data not shown). Further characterization of spermatids by electron microscopy revealed the elongated spermatids to have abnormal or completely nonexistent flagella. In the elongated spermatids of wild-type mice, the axoneme was composed of microtubules emanating straight from the centriole at the base of the spermatid nucleus (Fig. 1 C). On the contrary, the microtubules and coarse fibers were arranged in a whirl, the nuclei were misshapen, and the cytoplasmic electron density was increased in elongated spermatids of ki/ki mice (Fig.1 D). Intracytoplasmic vacuoles and autophagolysosomes were increased in elongated and some round spermatids. In addition, in the quantitative evaluation of spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules, elongated spermatids were significantly decreased at all stages (stage VII is shown in Fig. 1 E). Neither the number of spermatogonia nor that of spermatocytes exhibited significant differences. Furthermore, we analyzed testis RNAs derived from wild-type and ki/ki mice for markers of testis development, post-meiotic-specific cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), and haploid-specific protamine 2 transcripts. Neither CREM nor protamine 2 RNA levels were significantly affected by the insertional mutation (Fig. 2 C), also indicating that spermatogenesis was not suppressed in the proliferative and meiotic phases.Several copies of the transgene were integrated into theki/ki genome (data not shown). The chromosomal localization of the transgene insertion site was determined by FISH using the whole transgene as a probe, which resulted in a single pair of symmetrical signals mapped to the C1 region of chromosome 10, showing multiple copies of the transgene to be integrated in tandem at a single locus (Fig. 2 B). To clone the junctions between the inserted transgene and adjoining cellular DNA, we employed TAIL-PCR by using degenerated primers and specific primers corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the transgene. One junction fragment containing DNA flanking the transgene insertion site was identified. A wild-type mouse genomic phage library was screened using the flanking DNA fragment as a probe. These isolated phage clones covered about 25 kb of the mouse genome, showing that the integration of the transgene produced a deletion of about 20 kb in the genomic locus (Fig.2 A).To identify exons in the genomic locus, Northern blot analysis was performed using several DNA fragments (3–6 kb) obtained by endonuclease digestion, covering the deleted region, as a probe. When using 5 kb of the KpnI/XhoI fragment as a probe, a 1.6-kb transcript was detected in the testes from wild-type mice. However, Northern blot analysis showing no signal in testis RNA fromki/ki mice revealed ki/ki mice to be a null strain for this transcript (Fig. 2 C). Next, a mouse testis cDNA library was screened with the 5-kbKpnI/XhoI fragment to isolate the corresponding cDNA. We cloned three cDNAs generated by alternative splicing. The proteins predicted from these nucleotide sequences are 313, 351, and 375 amino acids long (Fig.3 A). In vitrotranscription/translation analysis demonstrated that the mouse cDNAs encode corresponding proteins (data not shown). To isolate a human counterpart, a human testis cDNA library was screened at a reduced stringency using the mouse full-length cDNA as a probe. The isolated human cDNA encoded a 380-amino acid protein and showed 59.6% identity with the mouse protein (Fig.3 B). A search of the database using the nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that the isolated cDNA is identical to a novel THEG (15.Nayernia K. von Mering M.H. Kraszucka K. Burfeind P. Wehrend A. Kohler M. Schmid M. Engel W. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression of the THEG is highly specific to the testes of mice (data not shown) and humans (Fig.4 A). To identify the cell types that express the THEG, we performed in situhybridization with a cRNA probe (Fig. 4 B). In testis, the transcripts were detectable only in round and elongated spermatids, consistent with the abnormal spermiogenic process of ki/kimice.Figure 3A, three isoforms of the mouse THEG protein (mTHEG1a, mTHEG1b, andmTHEG1c) are produced by alternative splicing.

In the testis, one possible candidate for such a substrate may be α tubulin; α-tubulin has constitutively expressed subtypes and testis-specific subtypes (22.Villasante A. Wang D. Dobner P. Dolph P.

Taken together with the previous observations that mutations in individual CCT subunits affect microtubule assembly and produce morphologically abnormal structures detected by anti-α-tubulin antibodies in yeast (24.Ursic D. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), abnormal or absent flagella in ki/ki mice appear to be associated with impairment of the assembly of cytoskeletal proteins such as the tubulins that are major structural proteins of flagella. In the sperm flagellum, as in the epithelial cilia, the cytoskeleton is highly differentiated to permit motility. The basic element of the cytoskeleton is the axoneme, which has an identical structure in both cilia and flagella. Structural anomalies of the axoneme, which are associated with impaired motility, have been described inChlamydomonas (25.Mitchell D.R. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, asthenozoospermia is a very frequent cause of male infertility. Previous reports demonstrated that ultrastructural abnormality of spermatozoa is observed in asthenozoospermic or teratozoospermic sterile men (26.Gentleman S. Kaiser-Kupfer M.I. Sherins R.J.

A high incidence of flagellar pathology was found to be the underlying cause of motility disorders in severely asthenozoospermic patients (28.Escalier D. David G. Biol. Cell. 1984; 50: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mammalian spermatozoa the flagellum is distinguished by adjoining structures, particularly the dense fibers and fibrous sheath. In particular, poor development of outer dense fibers is considered to be a major cause of tail abnormality; however, research in this area has been limited by the lack of appropriate animal models. The present study indicated that availability of this novel mouse autosomal recessive mutant showing a phenotype similar to asthenospermia enables us to investigate the developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of flagella.

The roles of individual residues in agonist-induced activation of Gq/11-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis were determined by mutational analysis of the amino acids in this region. Functional studies on mutant receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 cells showed that alanine substitutions of the amino acids in positions 232–240 of the third loop had no major effect on signal generation. However, deletion mutations that removed Ile238or affected its position relative to transmembrane helix VI significantly impaired angiotensin II-induced inositol phosphate responses. Substitution of Ile238 with an acidic residue abolished the ability of the receptor to mediate inositol phosphate production, whereas its replacement with basic or polar residues reduced the amplitude of inositol phosphate responses.

The binding of Ang II to the AT1-R initiates conformational changes that lead to activation of its cognate G protein(s), predominantly Gq/11, in numerous Ang II target tissues. The subsequent stimulation of phospholipase C causes the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to the elevation of [Ca2+] and activation of protein kinase C (1.Goodfriend T.L.

The AT1-R is also coupled to other signaling pathways, including the Ras-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and cell growth responses (4.Berk B.C. J. Am. Soc.

Although GPCRs exhibit a remarkable degree of structural and functional diversity, all share a common architecture in which seven transmembrane helices are linked by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops. Agonist binding to the extracellular loops, and/or the exofacial regions of the transmembrane domains, induces conformational changes in the transmembrane helices and intracellular regions that promote coupling of the activated receptor to its cognate G protein(s). The receptor domains that are involved in G protein coupling have been analyzed in many GPCRs. Studies using chimeric α2/β2-, α1B/α2-, and α1/β2-adrenergic receptors and chimeric M2/M3 muscarinic receptors have shown that modification of IL3 influences G protein selectivity, suggesting that IL3 has a critical role in receptor-G protein interaction (6.Cotecchia S.

The importance of the C-terminal portion of IL3 in receptor conformation has been further indicated by the ability of mutations of specific residues in this region to cause constitutive activation of several adrenergic receptors (6.Cotecchia S.

Studies on spin-labeled double cysteine mutants of rhodopsin have indicated that rigid body motion of helix VI compared with helix VII is an important event in receptor activation (10.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) and that movement of the C-terminal region of IL3 occurs in constitutively active receptors (11.Kim J.M. Altenbach C.

In the β2-adrenergic receptor, substitution of the C-terminal region of IL3 with those of the α1B- or α2A-adrenergic receptors abolished the ability to couple to Gs (9.Campbell P.T. Hnatowich M.

In M2, M3, and M5 muscarinic receptors, this region has been implicated in agonist-induced coupling to Gq/11 or Gi, respectively (13.Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. J. Biol.

Studies on chimeric human AT1- and AT2-Rs have demonstrated that the membrane proximal portions of IL3 are important for coupling to Gq (16.Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also, the substitution of all charged residues in the C-terminal region of IL3 markedly reduces Ang II-induced inositol phosphate signal generation (17.Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exchange of this region of the AT1-R with the corresponding sequence of the β2-adrenergic receptor caused coupling of the receptor to Gs as well as Gq during agonist stimulation (18.Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that a 16-amino acid peptide comprising the N-terminal portion of IL3 of the AT1-R stimulates the binding of GTPγS to Gq (19.Sano T. Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Nakagomi Y.

Although these findings have clearly implicated the C-terminal region of IL3 in the coupling of the AT1-R to Gq, the amino acids that are critical for this interaction have not been identified. To resolve this question, agonist-induced functional responses of mutant AT1a-Rs bearing replacements and deletions of amino acids in this region were determined in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. DMEM, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotic solutions were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). Ang II was from Sigma.125I-Ang II and [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II were from Covance Laboratories (Vienna, VA) or NEN Life Science Products.myo-[2-3H]Inositol was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. OptiMEM, inositol-free DMEM, and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. Mutations were created using the Mutagene kit (Bio-Rad) in the sequence of the rat AT1a-R cDNA subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and mutated sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing as described previously (20.Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat AT1areplacement mutant receptors are indicated by the single letter code of the original amino acid followed by the position number and the single letter code of the exchanged amino acid. Deletion mutant AT1a receptors are indicated by Del followed by the single letter code of the deleted amino acid and its position number. COS-7 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well culture plates in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (COS-7 medium) and cultured for 3 days before transfection using 0.5 ml of OptiMEM containing 8 μg/ml of LipofectAMINE and the required DNA (usually 2 μg/ml) for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were cultured for 2 additional days in fresh COS-7 medium prior to use. To determine the expression level and structural integrity of the mutant receptor, the number of Ang II binding sites was determined by incubating the transfected cells with [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (0.05–0.1 μCi/sample) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II in DMEM for 6 h at 4 °C. The bound radioactivity associated with the cells was measured by γ-spectrometry, and the binding curves were analyzed with the LIGAND computer program using a one-site model as described previously (21.Hunyady L. Bor M. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Internalization of mutant and wild-type AT1a-Rs were measured using125I-Ang II at 37 °C by γ-spectrometry, and values of the endocytotic rate constants (Ke) were calculated as described previously (21.Hunyady L. Bor M. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The percent of internalized ligand at each time point was calculated from the ratio of the acid-resistant specific binding to the total (acid-released + acid-resistant) specific binding. Transfected COS-7 cells in 24-well plates were labeled by incubation for 24 h in inositol-free DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 20 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol. After washing and preincubation with 10 mm LiCl for 30 min, 1 μm Ang II was added for a further 20 min, and incubations were stopped with perchloric acid. Inositol phosphates were extracted, the combined inositol bisphosphates + inositol trisphosphates fractions were separated using Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 columns, and their radioactivities were determined by liquid scintillation counting as described (22.Hunyady L.

At the expression levels used in this study, there was a linear relationship between cell surface receptor expression and the magnitude of agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate production (21.Hunyady L.

To identify residue(s) in the C-terminal region of IL3 of the AT1a-R that are required for receptor activation, we analyzed a series of mutant receptors containing replacements or deletions of residues in the Lys232-Phe239 segment (Fig.1). All mutants retained high binding affinity for [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (Table I), indicating their retention of the normal global conformation of the wild-type receptor. However, the mutant receptors displayed considerable variation in their expression levels compared with the wild-type receptor, and the expression of the Del N235 mutant receptor was markedly reduced (TableI).Table IBinding parameters of mutant rat AT1a-Rs for [ 125 I-Sar 1,Ile 8 ]Ang IIAT1a-RK dB maxnm(% of wild-type)Wild-type1.75 ± 0.24100.0K232A2.35 ± 0.50117.4 ± 24.1P233A1.88 ± 0.5091.1 ± 5.2R234A1.71 ± 0.3953.1 ± 1.0N235A1.74 ± 0.1844.7 ± 2.4D236A2.13 ± 0.6523.5 ± 1.5D237A2.96 ± 0.4817.1 ± 0.1K232A/R234A1.52 ± 0.41110.4 ± 5.9N235A/D236A/D237A1.38 ± 0.355.3 ± 1.97I238A/F239A/R240A1.47 ± 0.4412.1 ± 0.31I238A1.45 ± 0.11128.0 ± 5.7I238S1.55 ± 0.15146.3 ± 15.4I238K1.60 ± 0.1899.6 ± 5.2I238D1.80 ± 0.22240.0 ± 4.4F239A1.20 ± 0.0628.6 ± 2.7F239L1.66 ± 0.48138.2 ± 36.6F239N1.12 ± 0.22126.7 ± 45.1F239S1.94 ± 0.1587.8 ± 1.8F239Y1.21 ± 0.1775.3 ± 24.1F239K0.96 ± 0.2431.3 ± 0.3F239R2.55 ± 0.0736.3 ± 0.8F239D1.56 ± 0.0491.6 ± 0.3Del P2331.69 ± 0.56103.3 ± 10.3Del R2342.05 ± 0.5898.5 ± 2.1Del N2351.53 ± 0.060.4 ± 0.2Del D2371.28 ± 0.2644.6 ± 3.2Del I2381.84 ± 0.39139.8 ± 6.2Del F2391.88 ± 0.1448.0 ± 3.6Del R2404.43 ± 1.0630.0 ± 0.3K d and B max values were calculated using the LIGAND program.

Open table in a new tab K d and B max values were calculated using the LIGAND program.

The expression level of the wild-type AT1a-R was 2.48 ± 0.76 pmol/mg of protein. The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate. The ability of each mutant receptor to couple to Gq was evaluated by measuring the Ang II-induced stimulation of inositol phosphate production in transfected COS-7 cells. Alanine substitutions of the AT1a-R caused no major changes of the basal inositol phosphate levels (Fig.2). The Ang II-stimulated inositol phosphate responses were significantly reduced in the D236A and D237A mutant receptor (Fig. 2, upper panel), but the expression levels of these mutant receptors were also lower (Table I). When the inositol phosphate responses were normalized to the number of expressed receptors, it was evident that the replacement of each residue in the Lys232-Phe239 segment by alanine had no significant effect on the ability of the receptor to couple to Gq and initiate signal transduction (Fig. 2, lower panel). Double alanine substitution of Lys232 and Arg234 had no major effect on receptor expression (Table I) or inositol phosphate signal generation (Fig. 2). Triple alanine substitution of Asn235, Asp236, and Asp237 markedly decreased the expression level (Table I) and the InsP responses of this mutant receptor (data not shown). The reduced inositol phosphate responses observed after triple alanine substitution of Ile238, Phe239, and Arg240 (Fig. 2, upper panel) could be attributed to the decreased expression level of this mutant receptor (Fig. 2,lower panel, Table I). These data indicate that negatively charged amino acids in this region are required for normal receptor expression and argue against the role of charged residues in inositol phosphate signal generation. The C terminus of IL3 of GPCRs has been predicted to assume an α-helical structure that is continuous with the sixth transmembrane helix (23.Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Because deletions of individual residues within a helix change the orientation of the remaining amino acids, such mutations are likely to modify or abolish functionally important contacts by the constituent residues of the helix. When single amino acids in the C-terminal region of IL3 were deleted to identify functionally important residues, only the removal of Asn235 reduced the expression of the AT1a-R to such an extent that normalization of its inositol phosphate response was not reliable. Deletion of residues Arg240, Phe239, and Ile238, adjacent to the sixth intramembrane helix, markedly impaired Ang II-induced inositol phosphate generation (Fig.3). However, deletion of Asp237, Arg234, or Pro233, residues that are more distant from helix 6, had no effect on the inositol phosphate responses (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the residue located in position 238 is an important structural determinant of Ang II-induced signal generation. In adrenergic receptors, substitutions of amino acids in the location corresponding to position 239 of the AT1a-R cause constitutive activation of the mutant receptors (24.Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A more detailed analysis of the structural requirements in positions 238 and 239 was performed to study the role of this region in AT1a-R activation. Replacement of Phe239 with other apolar residues such as alanine and leucine or with tyrosine, a polar residue, had little or no effect on inositol phosphate signal generation (Fig.4). However replacement with asparagine or serine significantly impaired the signaling ability of the AT1-R. Replacement of Phe239 with the acidic residue, aspartate, had the most profound effect and reduced inositol phosphate production by about 90%. In contrast, replacement of Phe239 with basic residues (lysine or arginine) significantly enhanced inositol phosphate responses. None of the tested mutants had a major effect on inositol phosphate levels in unstimulated cells, indicating that, in contrast to the adrenergic receptor(s), replacement of the amino acid in this position with other residues does not cause constitutive activation of the AT1a-R (Fig. 4, Table I). Replacement of Ile238 with polar or charged amino acids also affected the signal generation efficacy of the AT1-R (Fig. 5). Substitution of Ile238 with apolar alanine had no effect on inositol phosphate responses, but replacement with polar serine impaired inositol phosphate production when the data were normalized to the expression levels of the receptor (Fig. 5, lower panel). Replacement of Ile238 with aspartate considerably increased the expression of the receptor in COS-7 cells (Table I). However, despite the increased expression level of the I238D receptor its inositol phosphate responses were significantly impaired and when normalized for expression were reduced by ∼85%. Substitution of Ile238 with lysine, a basic residue, had no effect on the expression level of the receptor, but the inositol phosphate responses of the I238K receptor were significantly reduced (Fig. 5, Table I). Individual replacements of each amino acid in the Lys232-Ile238 segment with alanine had no major effect on the agonist-induced internalization kinetics of the AT1a-R in COS-7 cells, but replacement of Phe239 with alanine modestly reduced the internalization rate of the receptor (Fig. 6). Other substitutions of Ile238 and Phe239 caused impairment of the internalization kinetics of the mutant receptors (Fig. 7) that paralleled their reductions in inositol phosphate generation (Fig. 2). Replacement of Ile238 with alanine had no effect on the internalization kinetics, but substitution with charged residues caused a significant decrease in the internalization kinetics of the receptor (Fig. 7 and Table II). Compared with the wild-type AT1a-R, the Ke values of the I238K and I238D mutant receptors were reduced to 45 ± 2% and 10 ± 0.1% of the wild-type value, respectively. TheKe values of mutant receptors in which Phe239 was replaced by other residues (F239K, F239R, F239Y, F239A, and F239L) were 132 ± 1.8%, 79.4 ± 0.7%, 85.8 ± 6.4%, 60.6 ± 8.3%, and 66.3 ± 8.6% of that of the wild-type receptor, respectively. In contrast, theKe values of the F239S, F239N, and F239D mutant receptors were reduced to 4.5 ± 2.1%, 6.1 ± 3.5%, and 2.9 ± 1.0% of that of the wild-type receptor, respectively (Fig.7 and Table II).Figure 7Internalization kinetics of Ile238 and Phe239 replacement mutant AT1a-Rs.

Discontinuous sequences of IL3, IL2, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail have been predicted to comprise an agonist-induced conformation-dependent surface that permits interaction with G proteins (28.Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Earlier studies using chimeric AT1-Rs (16.Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol.

Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggested that this region of the receptor is also required for Ang II-induced signal generation. In addition to activating G protein-dependent second messenger systems, the AT1a-R also undergoes phosphorylation and rapid internalization after agonist stimulation (29.Ishizaka N. Alexander R.W. Laursen J.B. Kai H. Fukui T. Oppermann M. Lefkowitz R.J. Lyons P.R. Griendling K.K. J. Biol.

Substitution of amino acids 234–240 of the AT1-R with the corresponding sequence of the β2 receptor impaired its internalization kinetics, suggesting that this region has a role in the agonist-induced internalization of the receptor (18.Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, alanine substitutions of individual amino acids in the C-terminal region of IL3 did not affect the internalization kinetics of the AT1-R, with the exception of the F239A mutation, which reduced the internalization kinetics in a moderate extent. Studies on the effects of replacing the distal segment of IL3 of the AT1a-R with the corresponding regions of the α1-adrenergic, β2-adrenergic, and AT2 receptors revealed that the RNDDIFR sequence (from Arg234 to Arg240) of the AT1a-R has a major role in G protein coupling and receptor signaling (18.Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present work, alanine substitutions or deletions of Arg234, Asn235, Asp236, or Asp237 had no significant effect on the inositol phosphate signaling or internalization kinetics of the receptor, but individual deletions of Ile238, Phe239, or Arg240 markedly attenuated inositol phosphate production. Because the C-terminal region of IL3 is believed to form an extension of the α-helical structure of the sixth transmembrane helix, this effect of amino acid deletions could result from changes in the position of Ile238relative to the rest of the helix. The lack of effect of alanine substitutions raises the possibility that, similar to the role of Leu222 in the N-terminal region of IL3 (33.Hunyady L. Zhang M. Jagadeesh G. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10040-10045Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34.Laporte S.A. Roy S.F. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Receptors Channels. 1998; 5: 103-112PubMed Google Scholar), apolar amino acids in this region are favorable for signal generation. Although substitutions with alanine or other apolar amino acids were tolerated, replacements of Ile238 with polar or charged amino acids significantly impaired the Ang II-induced inositol phosphate responses of the AT1a-R. These data suggest that the presence of a hydrophobic amino acid at position 238 is required for AT1-R activation. It has been reported that the four amino acid sequence, VTIL (Val385, Thr386, Ile389, and Leu390) located at the boundary of IL3 and helix 6, determines the Gi coupling specificity of the M2 muscarinic receptor. Also, this region of the M2 receptor has been proposed to interact with the C-terminal domain of Gαi/o (15.Liu J. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35.Liu J. Blin N. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6172-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The corresponding AALS motif (Ala488, Ala489, Leu492, and Ser493) of the Gq-coupled M3muscarinic receptor together with IL2 and the N-terminal part of IL3 were suggested to be directly involved in coupling to Gq(36.Kostenis E. Gomeza J. Lerche C. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23675-23681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The position of Ile238 of the AT1-R corresponds to the position of Val385 of the M2receptor and Ala488 of the M3 receptor. As in the muscarinic receptors, this region appears to be an important determinant of G protein activation of the AT1-R. In addition to their effects on inositol phosphate signal generation, mutations of Ile238 also impaired the internalization kinetics of the AT1a-R. Although the agonist-induced internalization of GPCRs often occurs in parallel with G protein activation, mutational analysis of the AT1 and other receptors has shown that the structural requirements of these processes are distinct, and AT1-R internalization can occur in the absence of inositol phosphate signal generation and G protein coupling (20.Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Hunyady L. J. Am. Soc.

Because receptor internalization does not depend on G protein-mediated signaling, the inhibitory effects of substituting Ile238 with polar and charged amino acids on receptor internalization are independent of G protein coupling. Although it cannot be excluded that Ile238 directly couples the receptor to G protein activation and internalization, these data suggest that Ile238 is required for a step in receptor activation that is proximal to receptor G protein coupling. The most likely mechanism is the participation of Ile238 in an intramolecular interaction that is required for the active conformation of the receptor. Such a mechanism is consistent with a recent report on the mapping of G protein binding domains of the AT1a-R (39.Kai H. Alexander R.W. Ushio-Fukai M. Lyons P.R. Akers M. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast to peptides derived from the N-terminal region of IL2 and IL3 and the juxtamembranous region of the cytoplasmic tail, peptides derived from the C-terminal region of IL3 did not compete for receptor G protein coupling (39.Kai H. Alexander R.W. Ushio-Fukai M. Lyons P.R. Akers M. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The proposed participation of Ile238 in an intramolecular interaction is also in agreement with the GPCR model of Baldwin (40.Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), which predicts that the side chain of the amino acid in the position of Ile238faces helix 7 and thus points away from the putative G protein binding region (28.Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 40.Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In view of the requirement for an apolar amino acid in the position of Ile238 in the AT1-R, the properties of the amino acids in this location in other members of GPCR family I were examined. Among 171 GPCR sequences from the data base of comprehensive alignment of G protein-coupled receptor sequences compiled by the Molecular Recognition Section of the National Institutes of Health, only 22 receptors contain polar amino acids at this position. These residues were 15 threonines, 4 serines, 1 asparagine, and 2 histidines. All other members of the GPCR family I contain an apolar residue at this position. The frequent occurrence of a corresponding apolar amino acid in GPCRs raises the possibility of a general requirement for such residues in GPCR activation by agonist ligands. The position of Phe239 in the AT1-R has a different amino acid requirement compared with that of position 238. The location of this amino acid corresponds to Thr386 in the VTIL motif of the M2 muscarinic receptor and Ala489 in the AALS motif of the M1, M3, and M5 muscarinic receptors. In addition, Phe239 corresponds to a position that frequently causes constitutive activation if substituted in adrenergic receptors (24.Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, a completely different mechanism of constitutive activation has been reported for the AT1-R (41.Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ile238, replacement of Phe239 with polar residues had a variable effect on AT1-R activation. Substitutions of apolar amino acids or tyrosine caused only minor changes in signal generation and internalization of the receptor, but substitution of asparagine or serine decreased these responses. Although substitution of a negatively charged aspartic acid for Phe239 severely impaired inositol phosphate generation and receptor internalization, replacement by positively charged residues increased these responses. Recent studies have predicted that AT1-R activation involves an outward movement of the cytoplasmic end of the sixth transmembrane helix, accompanied by a clockwise rotation (as viewed from the cell interior) by ∼30° (42.Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Inagami T. J. Hypertens. 1997; 15: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the opposite effects of basic and acidic amino acids is that positively charged residues facilitate this movement, whereas the presence of a negative charge interferes with it. Similar to the results obtained with mutations of Ile238, substitution of Phe239 caused a parallel impairment of inositol phosphate signal generation and receptor internalization. These data suggest the Phe239, like Ile238, has a role in the formation of the active conformation of the receptor. This conclusion is in accordance with the results of studies on rhodopsin-transducin interaction that showed that substitution of the amino acids (Val250 and Thr251) of rhodopsin that correspond to Ile238 and Phe239 of the AT1a-R interfere with the formation of the active (M II) state of the photoreceptor and thus indirectly affect its interaction with transducin (43.Acharya S. Saad Y. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6519-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In summary, this study demonstrates the importance of two specific residues, Ile238 and Phe239, in the C terminus of IL3 in the mechanism of activation of the AT1-R. The parallel impairment of receptor signaling and internalization suggests that these adjacent apolar residues may participate in intramolecular interaction(s) that are required for receptor activation. The exact mechanism of this interaction and its role in other GPCRs requires further investigation. However, based on the present findings, and other evidence that implicates this region of GPCRs in signal transduction, it is possible that these amino acids and their counterparts have a general role in receptor activation by agonist ligands.

Rabphilin-11-full and rabphilin-11-1 (1–631 aa) werein vitro translated using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.) and incubated with MBP or MBP-tagged mSec13p (100 pmol) prebound to an amylose resin column in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mmNaCl) at 4 °C for 90 min. After the beads were washed four times with the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by adding 100 μl of buffer A containing 10 mm maltose. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The mouse brain cytosol was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 10 pmol of the anti-mSec13p antibody or the preimmune rabbit polyclonal antibody bound to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Comparable amounts of the pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the anti-rabphilin-11 antibody. The antibodies used here were prepared as described below. HeLa cells and BHK cells were supplied by Dr. S. Orita (Discovery Research Laboratory, Shionogi & Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Both HeLa cells and BHK cells were cultured at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. These cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids encoding the indicated proteins by use of Superfect reagent (Qiagen). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against mSec13p was raised against glutathioneS-transferase-tagged mSec13p. The antiserum was affinity-purified with MBP-tagged mSec13p covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An anti-rabphilin-11 antibody was obtained as described (9.Mammoto A. Ohtsuka T. Hotta I. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25517-25524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hybridoma cells expressing the mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). An anti-Golgi p58 antibody was purchased from Sigma. An anti-Calnexin antibody was purchased from StressGenn Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada). Second antibodies for immunofluorescence microscopy were obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (9.Mammoto A. Ohtsuka T. Hotta I. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25517-25524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cells were examined by use of an Eclipse E800 immunofluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Equal amounts of the plasmids encoding several rabphilin-11 deletion mutants and GFP-tagged VSV G protein were used for cotransfection experiments. After 17 h, transfected BHK cells were incubated at 20 °C for 2 h. Parallel samples were transferred to 37 °C for 1 h immediately after incubation at 20 °C. Cells were then fixed and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. We first attempted to isolate a rabphilin-11-interacting protein(s) by use of the yeast two-hybrid method with the N-terminal fragment (rabphilin-11-1, 1–631 aa) as a bait from a human T cell cDNA library. Screening of 1 × 106 transformants yielded 16 positive clones, and 6 of these clones encoded full-length mSec13p. One of the six clones was selected for further analysis. The selected clone (clone 5) indeed interacted with rabphilin-11-1 (Fig.1 A). This clone also interacted with full-length rabphilin-11 (rabphilin-11-full), to a lesser extent, but did not interact with the C-terminal fragment (rabphilin-11-4, 632–908 aa) (Fig. 1 A). To examine whether rabphilin-11 directly interacts with mSec13p, the binding of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled rabphilin-11-1 (1–631 aa) or rabphilin-11-full to MBP-tagged recombinant mSec13p was examined. Both rabphilin-11-1 and rabphilin-11-full directly interacted with mSec13p (Fig. 1 B, a and b). The interaction of rabphilin-11 with mSec13p was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from the mouse brain cytosol (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, subcellular localization analysis in HeLa cells showed that overexpressed Myc-tagged mSec13p localized at the ER and the Golgi complex (Fig.2 , A and B), whereas endogenous rabphilin-11 localized in perinuclear regions and along microtubules oriented toward the plasma membrane; Myc-tagged mSec13p and rabphilin-11 colocalized in perinuclear regions, most presumably the Golgi complex (Fig. 2 C). Essentially equivalent results were obtained in BHK cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (data not shown). These results suggest that rabphilin-11 directly interacts with mSec13p in both cell-free and intact cell systems. We next studied the mSec13p-binding region of rabphilin-11 by the yeast two-hybrid method. Rabphilin-11-full interacted with mSec13p to some extent, but the region (rabphilin-11-3, 504–631 aa) that contains the second and third WD-40 repeats and is located next to the Rab11p-binding region (300–504 aa), interacted with mSec13p to a greater extent (Fig. 3 A). Other regions, excluding this region, did not interact with mSec13p. These results suggest that a region(s) other than the mSec13p-binding region masks this region, thereby hindering the interaction with mSec13p, and that another factor is necessary to open this folded structure. We next examined the effect of Rab11p on the rabphilin-11-mSec13p interaction by the yeast two-hybrid method. The rabphilin-11-full-mSec13p interaction was greater upon coexpression with a dominant active mutant of Rab11p (Rab11pQ70LΔC) than upon coexpression with a dominant negative mutant of Rab11p (Rab11pT25NΔC) or with no expression of these mutants (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the rabphilin-11-full-mSec13p interaction is enhanced by the binding of GTP-Rab11p to rabphilin-11. This enhancement, however, did not reach the level of the rabphilin-11-3-mSec13p interaction. We attempted to determine the rabphilin-11-binding region of mSec13p by the same method. The N-terminal one-third (1–187 aa), the middle one-third (135–249 aa), or the C-terminal one-third (249–323 aa) of mSec13p did not interact with rabphilin-11-2 (300–631 aa) (data not shown), suggesting that the whole structure of mSec13p is necessary for the interaction with rabphilin-11. Finally, we examined whether the rabphilin-11-mSec13p interaction is important in vesicle trafficking. For this purpose, we took advantage of the VSV G protein transport system. VSV G protein is a membrane protein encoded by the vesicular somatitis virus (which is transported to the cell surface along the exocytic pathway) and can be utilized as an ideal marker of vesicle trafficking (6.Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3241-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 26.Hughson E. Wandinger-Ness A. Gausepohl H. Griffiths G. Simons K. Schwartz M.

Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). As described (6.Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3241-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), in BHK cells, exogenously expressed GFP-tagged VSV G (GFP-VSV G) protein accumulated in perinuclear regions, which presumably correspond to the Golgi complex, by incubation at 20 °C for 2 h and was transported to the plasma membrane by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h (Fig. 4 A, a andb). Overexpression of a Myc-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rab11p (Rab11pT25N) markedly inhibited transport of GFP-VSV G protein to the cell surface as compared with control cells (data not shown), consistent with earlier observations (6.Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3241-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of the Rab11p-binding region of rabphilin-11 (Myc-tagged rabphilin-11-5; 300–504 aa) or the mSec13p-binding region of rabphilin-11 (Myc-tagged rabphilin-11–3; 504–631 aa) markedly inhibited the transport of GFP-VSV G protein (Fig. 4 B, a andb). However, overexpression of Myc-tagged rabphilin-11-full (data not shown) or Myc-tagged rabphilin-11-2 (300–631 aa), which contains both the Rab11p-binding and mSec13p-binding regions, did not affect this transport (Fig. 4 Bc). These results, together with the earlier observation that Rab11p regulates Golgi-to-plasma membrane vesicle transport (6.Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3241-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), suggest that the rabphilin-11-mSec13p interaction is important in vesicle transport. We have shown here that rabphilin-11 directly interacts with mSec13p by use of three different methods: yeast two-hybrid, affinity column chromatography, and immunoprecipitation. The interaction of full-length rabphilin-11 with mSec13p is weaker than that of the mSec13p-binding region of rabphilin-11 with mSec13p, suggesting that a region(s) other than the mSec13p-binding region masks this region and hinders the interaction with mSec13p. Consistently, the binding of GTP-Rab11p to full-length rabphilin-11 enhances its interaction with mSec13p, suggesting that the GTP-Rab11p-binding region may be such a region and that the binding of GTP-Rab11p to this region may directly or indirectly unfold the mSec13p-binding region. However, the enhancement by GTP-Rab11p does not reach the level of interaction of the mSec13p-binding region of rabphilin-11 with mSec13p. It has previously been proposed that there is some factor that promotes the unmasking of the GTP-Rab11p-binding region of rabphilin-11 (8.Zeng J. Ren M. Gravotta D. Lemos-Chiarandini C.D. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Xu G. Shen T.H. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that a region(s) other than the GTP-Rab11p-binding region may also be involved in this masking and unfolding mechanism. We have previously shown that rabphilin-11 is associated with membrane structures, presumably vesicles, in a GTP-Rab11p-dependent manner (9.Mammoto A. Ohtsuka T. Hotta I. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25517-25524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The precise localization of mSec13p is not known, but by analogy with yeast Sec13p (10.Pryer N.K. Salama N.R. Schekman R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11.Salama N.R. Yeung T. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), mSec13p may also localize on vesicles. If this is the case, one possible mechanism of the GTP-Rab11p-rabphilin-11-full-mSec13p interaction on vesicles is that GTP-Rab11p first binds to rabphilin-11 to make the folding structure open, eventually leading to the association of the GTP-Rab11p-rabphilin-11-mSec13p complex on the vesicles. The prenyl moiety of GTP-Rab11p may also be involved in the association of the complex with the vesicles, but the specific binding of the GTP-Rab11p-rabphilin-11 complex may be determined by the interaction with mSec13p. It has been reported that yeast Sec13p participates in the formation of two different types of vesicles: the vesicles that bud from the late-Golgi complex (29.Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and COPII coated vesicles that bud from the ER (10.Pryer N.K. Salama N.R. Schekman R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11.Salama N.R. Yeung T. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12.Barlowe C.

Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In the former case, Sec13p may be involved in protein transport from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane (29.Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have shown here that mSec13p localizes in perinuclear regions, presumably the ER and the Golgi complex, where the GTP-Rab11p-rabphilin-11 complex colocalizes at the Golgi complex. In addition to these areas, the GTP-Rab11p-rabphilin-11 complex localizes to early endosomes, recycling endosomes, and secretory vesicles along microtubules oriented toward the plasma membrane (9.Mammoto A. Ohtsuka T. Hotta I. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25517-25524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results, together with earlier observations (9.Mammoto A. Ohtsuka T. Hotta I. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggest that the rabphilin-11-mSec13p interaction regulates the transport of the vesicles budded from the Golgi complex to the microtubules oriented toward the plasma membrane. Once the vesicles ride on the microtubules, mSec13p may dissociate from the vesicles and be reutilized. By analogy with yeast Sec13p, mSec13p may also be involved in the budding process, at least from the Golgi complex, and this process may be regulated by Arf small G proteins (30.Donaldson J.G.

Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Once the coated vesicles are produced from the Golgi complex, they are uncoated and transported to the plasma membrane along microtubules. Most Rab family members are involved in the targeting/docking/fusion processes of vesicles to the acceptor membranes (34.Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 35.Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 36.Takai Y. Sasaki T.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). If Rab11p is also be involved in these processes, the rabphilin-11-mSec13p interaction may functionally link two different types of small G proteins, Arf and Rab proteins. Further studies are necessary for our understanding of the mode of action of the rabphilin-11-mSec13p interaction in vesicle trafficking.

Due to lack of the identity box (I-box) and activation function 2 (AF-2) domain, zFF1B lacks transactivation function and fails to synergize with estrogen receptor (ER) in regulating promoters. It was speculated that the I-box might be involved in the zFF1A/ER interaction. In the present study, the function of the I-box was examined. In the absence of the I-box or with an altered heptad 9, the AF-2 of zFF1A was not functional, either in the presence or absence of ER. The GST pull-down assay showed that zFF1A and its mutants exerted similar physical contacts with ER-LBD, suggesting that the “dimerization” domain (I-box) is essential for the transcriptional activity of zFF1A. Moreover, nuclear receptor coactivator selectively activated zFF1 with the I-box but exerted no effect on zFF1B, indicating that the I-box is able to interact with the coactivators. By deletion study and analysis of the identified domains in GAL4-DNA binding domain, other regions of zFF1A critical for its AF were also delineated. Consistent with the mutation analysis, AF-2 was active only in the presence of the I-box. We also identified a novel AF domain (AF-3) located in the hinge region (amino acids 155–267), although the activity of AF-3 was inhibited by its flanking region. We suggest that the D and E regions of zFF1A possess both positive and negative transactivation functions, and interdomain “cross-talk” may confer the full transcriptional activity of the protein.

In general, they contain an amino-terminal ligand-independent activation domain (region A/B, or activation function 1 (AF-1)) that is not well conserved among nuclear receptors; an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain (DBD); a hinge region (region D); and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (region E or LBD). Region E integrates multiple functions. In addition to determining the ligand-binding properties of a particular receptor, this region also specifies its dimerization properties (homo-versus heterodimerization) and contains a ligand-dependent transactivation function (activation function 2 (AF-2)). The crystal structures of E regions of several hormone receptors reveal a similar fold in LBDs, which may be a common property of all NRs (2.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 3.Renaud J-P. Rocchel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This newly determined fold, termed the “antiparallel α-helical sandwich,” consists of 12 α-helices (H1–H12) packed in three layers, ultimately generating an internal hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity. The striking difference between the ligand-bound and unbound LBD is the position of H12 (AF-2 helix). In the absence of the ligand, the helix projects away from LBD but tightly folds toward the LBD when ligand is bound. It is proposed that this conformational change may yield an interacting surface for NR coactivators (5.Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).In addition to a weak dimerization surface defined in DBD, a 40-amino acid region has been mapped as a dimerization interface (identity box (I-box)) within the carboxyl portion of LBDs of RAR, TR, COUP, and RXR (6.Liu D. Le Dréan Y. Ekker M. Xiong F. Hew C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7.Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). Coincidentally, this region matches almost perfectly with a helical segment formed by H9 and H10, whereas a dimerization interface is localized mainly in H10 of the LBD crystal structures (2.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 4.Wurtz J-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2949-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Unlike many hormone nuclear receptors, mSF-1 binds to its DNA element as a monomer (23.Ueda H. Sun G-C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 24.Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In addition, transient expression study revealed that truncation of the entire LBD of mSF-1 resulted in a constitutive activator of the Mülerian inhibiting substance gene promoter (17.Shen W-H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of mSF-1 in transcription could be different from that of other dimeric nuclear receptors.Our laboratory previously identified the zebrafish Ftz-F1 homologue, zFF1A (zebrafish Ff1a or Nr5A2 (25.Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar)) and its naturally truncated variant, zFF1B. The lack of an I-box and AF-2 in zFF1B presumably abolishes its activity and its failure to act in synergy with ligand-bound ER on the salmon gonadotropin IIβ subunit gene (sGTHIIβ) promoter (6.Liu D. Le Dréan Y. Ekker M. Xiong F. Hew C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that deletion of the I-box or mutating it at heptad 9 drastically reduces the transcriptional activity of zFF1A, but such a reduction is less pronounced in the zFF1/ER synergy. Furthermore, wild-type zFF1A and its mutants all retained interaction with ER-LBD. To delineate the transactivation functions of zFF1A, we have defined a new activation function in the D domain (AF-3) and a negative region between AF-3 and the I-box. Our results suggest an unusual role of the “dimerization domain” in Ftz-F1 homologues and suggest that zFF1A transactivation is due to a coordination of multiple subdomains in the D and E regions.DISCUSSIONTo test the function of the zFF1A I-box, we have determined that heptad 9 of zFF1A is required for AF-2 activity, although earlier mutation studies indicated that several hydrophobic residues in heptad 9 of TR or RAR could determine their interaction with RXR (34.Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15766-15771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Sameuls H.H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have further shown that the I-box and AF-2 of zFF1 are sufficient to recruit SRC-1. We have also identified a novel activation function, AF-3, that spans most of the D region of zFF1A (residues 155–266), and we have delineated a region (residues 267–434) that may specifically inhibit AF-3 activity, although the nature of inhibition is still unclear. These results represent the first demonstration that both the heptad 9 and hinge region, in addition to AF-2, are involved in the transcriptional activity of a nuclear receptor with a monomeric DNA binding feature. Our data stresses the notion that interdomain communication (37.Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), mediated by three segments (AF-3, I-box, and AF-2) in the D/E region of zFF1A, confers the full transcriptional activity of a nuclear receptor.Our study of the I-box was prompted by the determination of the crystal structure of nuclear receptor LBDs and the evidence that mSF-1 interacts with ERs (Table I). Consistent with a dimerization interface found in H10 of the RXR LBD (2.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), the I-box has been mapped to the H9–H10 region in LBDs of RXR, RAR, TR, and COUP and mediates heterodimerization (7.Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the function of the I-box in the homodimerization of HNF4 was also determined, although there is only moderate conservation of the I-box between RXR and HNF4 (9.Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. Clifton-Bligh R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ER has been proposed as a common interaction partner for TR, RAR, RXR, and HNF4 via their LBDs (27.Lee S-K. Choi H-S. Song M-R. Lee M-O. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The loss of function of zFF1B in synergy, due to deletion of both AF-2 and the I-box, thus initially suggested that the I-box might contribute to the interaction of zFF1A and ER either directly or indirectly through other intermediary proteins. It now appears that rather than providing an ER-interacting interface, the I-box, especially heptad 9 of zFF1A, is directly related to AF-2 activity. Our GST pull-down assay further rules out the possibility that the physical contact between zFF1A and ER depends directly on the AF-2, I-box, or heptad 9. Further experimentation is needed to determine which domain of zFF1 mediates protein-protein interactions with ERα.Both SRC-1 and TRAM-1 (thyroid hormone receptor activator molecule (25.Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar,33.Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar)) can potentiate zFF1A activity, but they show no effect on zFF1B (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Furthermore, only A(ΔI-box) and mutation L474A,L475A failed to respond to the co-expression of SRC-1 (data not shown), arguing an important role of the I-box in mediating the activation of coactivators. From the cotransfection of SRC-1, zFF1 mutants, and ER, the role of the I box in coactivator recruitment becomes more evident. Although the ER should play a significant role in SRC-1 recruitment (32.Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar), the removal of the I-box in A(ΔI-box) and BORF appears to disrupt the coactivator/zFF1 interaction. Consequently, the combinatory effect of transcription factors and SRC-1 on the sGTHIIβ promoter is much higher only when the I-box is present (Fig.8). However, in the absence of exogenous SRC-1, the sGTHIIβ promoter activity is also higher when zFF1s with the I-box are employed (A(ΔI-box) versus A(ΔAF2), AORF, or A(ΔIR) in Fig. 8), suggesting the involvement of the endogenous SRC-1 or other coactivator(s). The SRC family represents a class of general coactivators that are able to modify chromatin structure, while the docking of specific coactivators to DNA-binding transcription factors recruits the general coactivators (38.Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Whether HeLa cells express Ftz-F1-specific coactivator(s) is currently unknown, but the endogenous SRC-1 may substitute for such factor(s) that are likely to be missing. The overproduction of SRC-1 in cells would exert a broad effect shown for many NRs, on zFF1s via ER, since ER and zFF1 are bound to each other (our GST pull-down result).In the elucidation of the nuclear receptor-coactivator complexes assembled in response to hormonal signals, several leucine-rich motifs (LXXLL) were found in the nuclear receptor interaction domains of SRC family members (39.Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 40.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). In SRC-1, three LXXLL motifs have been shown to mediate direct contact with ligand-bound steroid receptors. Because a leucine-rich motif in cyclin D1 is able to recruit the coactivator to ER in the absence of E2 (41.Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), it is possible that SRC-1 interacts with any such motifs on a given receptor. Since the heptad 9 is leucine-rich, highly hydrophobic, and conserved among Ftz-F1s (Fig. 1), it is not surprising that lack of this segment compromises the transcriptional activity of zFF1 even in the presence of exogenous SRC-1.A proximal activation function domain resides between residues 181 and 310 of xFF1rA (42.Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Glaser B. Dreyer C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 872-886PubMed Google Scholar), and a domain mapped upstream of AF-2 (residues 187–245) in mSF-1 was found to be essential for their transcriptional activity (43.Crawford P.A. Polish J.A. Ganpule G. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 44.Li L.A. Chiang E.F. Chen J.C. Hsu N.C. Chen Y.J. Chung B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1588-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These domains span parts of the D and E regions. According to a sequence alignment of the LBDs in all nuclear receptors, both domains overlap with the AF-2a domain of ERα and the τ2 region of GR in the LBDs (4.Wurtz J-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 45.Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 46.Pierrat B. Heery D.M. Chambon P. Losson R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proximal activation domains of xFF1rA and mSF-1 are capable of transactivation when fused to a heterologous DBD. The AF-2 of mSF-1, on the other hand, lacks any independent activity. It was concluded that AF-2 is necessary, but insufficient, for the transcriptional activity of the vertebrate Ftz-F1 homologues (42.Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Glaser B. Dreyer C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 872-886PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Crawford P.A. Polish J.A. Ganpule G. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Our current study indicates that when linked to its own or a heterologous DBD, the AF-3 (encompassing the entire D region), without any overlap with the N terminus of the E region, can serve as an activation domain. As expected, when tethered to GAL4-DBD, AF-2 alone is not active at all. Moreover, the I-box and AF-2 together can confer the major transactivation function of the E region. Our data further indicate that without the I-box (A(ΔI-box)), or with an altered heptad 9 (L474A,L475A), the AF-2 activity of zFF1A is barely detectable. The weaker activity of each AF and the greater transcriptional activity of the D/E region have led to a speculation that the full transcriptional activity of zFF1A requires all three segments (Figs. 5 and 6). By testing the synergistic interaction of zFF1A and ER using the C- and N-terminal deletions of zFF1A, both AF-2 and AF-3 of zFF1A were found to make significant contributions to transactivation. In fact, it appears that the D region not only harbors an activation domain but is also necessary for the interaction of both nuclear receptors (zFF1A and ER).It is intriguing to note that deletion of the IR region significantly reduces zFF1 transactivation but does not appear to function in coactivator recruitment. Therefore, the inability of zFF1B to respond to SRC-1 is not due to the inhibitory domain per se but rather the lack of both the I box and AF2. Alternatively, the IR segment could simply act as a linker to ensure a proper comformational change of the D/E region and communication between the AF-3 and I-box plus AF-2, because partially deleting the IR results in a more severe reduction. 2M.

Tel.: 416-978-6505; Fax: 416-978-8802; E-mail: [email protected] However, we cannot rule out that the corepressor recruitment and/or post-translational modification can be mediated by the IR. In fact, the modifications play an important role in mSF-1 transcriptional activity.No apparent ligand is needed for mSF-1 activity in many cellular settings (i.e. mSF-1 is functional in various cell lines). Since evidence that oxysterols can serve as a bona fideligand remains controversial (12.Lala D.S. Syke P.M. Lazarchik S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J. Parker K.L. Heyman R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13.Mellon S.H. Bair S.R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3026-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is thought that mSF-1 may be regulated by alternate mechanisms involving coactivators, corepressors, and signal transduction pathways.Such a notion recently received support, because a constitutive phosphorylation site (Ser203) in region 187–245, which can be modified by the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, has been demonstrated to maximize the mSF-1-mediated transcription (47.Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3 (516): 521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Like phosphoserines often found in the A/B regions of many hormone NRs, phosphorylation of the hinge region by mitogen-activated protein kinase results in ligand-independent activation and recruitment of NR cofactors (47.Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3 (516): 521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 48.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser203 in the proximal AF of mSF-1 increases the binding of corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor) but shows less effect on its coactivator association in vitro (47.Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3 (516): 521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).Interestingly, a serine/threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site PFVTSP (resembles the PX n(S/T)P consensus) is also found in region 155–267 of zFF1, but the location of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Ser/Pro consensus is quite different from that in mSF-1. Therefore, we suggest that the recruitment of NR corepressors by AF-3 is likely and should be important for the activity of zFF1B. Because NR corepressors can also directly interact with the E regions of many NRs (49.Jenster G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the possibility that the inhibitory region (residues 267–434) may be responsible for the corepressor recruitment to zFF1 is not excluded.The proximal AF and LBD of mSF-1 are required for the interaction with either SMRT or coactivators (43.Crawford P.A. Polish J.A. Ganpule G. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 47.Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3 (516): 521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, mSF-1 transactivation may be determined by both coactivators and corepressors in vivo. Whether the same mechanism applies to zFF1 requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the contribution of multiple subdomains in the D/E region, especially the I-box, to the zFF1A transactivation may represent a general mechanism of Ftz-F1 function. The nuclear receptor (NR)1 superfamily comprises a large set of ligand-regulated transcription factors, whose modular structures provide functional regions responsible for their activities (1.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6027) Google Scholar). In general, they contain an amino-terminal ligand-independent activation domain (region A/B, or activation function 1 (AF-1)) that is not well conserved among nuclear receptors; an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain (DBD); a hinge region (region D); and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (region E or LBD). Region E integrates multiple functions. In addition to determining the ligand-binding properties of a particular receptor, this region also specifies its dimerization properties (homo-versus heterodimerization) and contains a ligand-dependent transactivation function (activation function 2 (AF-2)). The crystal structures of E regions of several hormone receptors reveal a similar fold in LBDs, which may be a common property of all NRs (2.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 3.Renaud J-P. Rocchel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This newly determined fold, termed the “antiparallel α-helical sandwich,” consists of 12 α-helices (H1–H12) packed in three layers, ultimately generating an internal hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity. The striking difference between the ligand-bound and unbound LBD is the position of H12 (AF-2 helix). In the absence of the ligand, the helix projects away from LBD but tightly folds toward the LBD when ligand is bound. It is proposed that this conformational change may yield an interacting surface for NR coactivators (5.Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In addition to a weak dimerization surface defined in DBD, a 40-amino acid region has been mapped as a dimerization interface (identity box (I-box)) within the carboxyl portion of LBDs of RAR, TR, COUP, and RXR (6.Liu D. Le Dréan Y. Ekker M. Xiong F. Hew C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7.Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). Coincidentally, this region matches almost perfectly with a helical segment formed by H9 and H10, whereas a dimerization interface is localized mainly in H10 of the LBD crystal structures (2.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 4.Wurtz J-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). These experiments have revived interest in the ninth heptad, because it is one of the nine heptad repeats that were predicted to organize a leucine zipper-like structure mediating dimerization in RAR, VDR, and T3R (8.Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 9.Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. Clifton-Bligh R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Biol.

For a large number of orphan nuclear receptors, high affinity endogenous ligands have not been found, although many of them exert transcriptional activities. Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) belongs to this group (11.Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 12.Lala D.S. Syke P.M. Lazarchik S.B.

Thus, the identification and analysis of enhancers responsible for tissue-specific expression of extracellular matrix components are important not only to understand the regulation of their genes but also to clarify the genetic control of differentiation programs.Our group has undertaken the study of regulation of collagen VI in the mouse and has identified several sequences of the 5′-flanking region of the Col6a1 gene active in transcriptional control (7.Piccolo S.

In particular, analyses in transgenic mice have located three regions responsible for tissue-specific transcription at high frequency (8.Braghetta P. Fabbro C. Piccolo S. Marvulli D. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 0.6 kb1 just upstream of the transcription start site drives expression in the superficial and muscular aponeurotic system and in tendons. A second fragment, from −7.5 to −6.2 kb, induces transcription in joints, intervertebral disks, vibrissae, skeletal muscle, and meninges. Finally, the sequence between about −5.4 to −3.9 kb from the transcription start site contains information for expression in articular cartilage, intervertebral disks, nerves, vibrissae, and subepidermal mesenchyme. The strong activating capacity of the −5.4- to −3.9-kb sequence has been confirmed by experiments with transgenic mice, where promoter-CAT fusions including this region are expressed in several tissues over 100 times more efficiently than constructs lacking it (9.Braghetta P. Vitale P. Piccolo S. Bonaldo P. Fabbro C. Girotto D. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One interesting feature of the −5.4/−3.9 region is that information controlling transcription in cells with different embryological origin and function, including articular chondrocytes, Schwann cells, 2P. Vitale, P, Braghetta, D. Volpin, and G. M. Bressan, manuscript in preparation. 2P. Vitale, P, Braghetta, D. Volpin, and G. M. Bressan, manuscript in preparation. and fibroblasts, is enclosed in a relatively small DNA fragment, 1.5 kb, a size compatible with that of a single enhancer (11.Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The question therefore arises whether the −5.4/−3.9 region contains only one enhancer dictating different tissue specificities or multiple enhancers, each one responsible for transcriptional activation in only one tissue. Such enhancers are usually formed by multiple transcription factor binding elements, including positively acting factors that are spatially localized in the organism in addition to ubiquitous ones (12.Arnone M.I. Davidson E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1851-1864PubMed Google Scholar). Data accumulated so far on genes of the extracellular matrix conform to this condition. Studies on cis-acting sequences of collagen I genes have identified distinct enhancers for activation in cells of calcified tissues, skin, and fascial and interstitial fibroblasts. When characterized, as in bone, the active sequences have been found to bind tissue-specific nuclear factors (1.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Unexpectedly, the region neither contains a unique enhancer sequence for all five tissues nor several distinct enhancers for the different tissues; rather, sequences controlling transcription in different tissues overlap extensively but do not coincide. In addition, no cell type-specific nuclear factors could be identified. These criteria identify a novel class of enhancers responsible for tissue-specific transcription.RESULTSAnalysis of Activating Properties of −5.4/−3.9 Enhancer Region in VivoIn order to define sequences of the −5.4/−3.9 region responsible for transcriptional activation in different tissues, transgenic mice were produced with the constructs outlined in Fig.1 a. In these constructs thelacZ gene containing a nuclear localization signal is fused to the proximal 1.4-kb 5′-flanking sequence and to different deletions of the −5.4/−3.9 region of the Col6a1 gene. The sequence of the −5.4/−3.9 region and the position of the start and end points of the deletions are reported in Fig. 2. The region extends from the BamHI site at −5.4 kb (site A) to the EcoRI site at −3.9 (site P). Embryos were dissected usually at 15.5 days, whole mount-stained with X-gal, and the distribution of transgene-positive cells determined by histological examination of serial sections. As expected by the presence of the proximal 1.4-kb fragment, all expressing embryos exhibited staining in superficial and muscular aponeurotic system and tendons (8.Braghetta P. Fabbro C. Piccolo S. Marvulli D. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (data not shown), a condition that allowed easy identification of the number of expressing embryos. The results of the analysis of distribution of staining is summarized in Fig. 1 a for only those tissues that were previously shown to require the −5.4/−3.9 region for high level and high frequency expression of the transgene, i.e.articular cartilage, peripheral nervous system, intervertebral disks, vibrissae, and subepidermal mesenchyme (8.Braghetta P. Fabbro C. Piccolo S. Marvulli D. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to constructs with deletions of the −5.4/−3.9 region, the published data obtained with constructs containing the entire region (construct (A–P)lacZ) or lacking it completely (constructs with 1.4–3.9 kb of flanking sequences) are also reported for comparison in Fig. 1 a. Expression patterns from these two types of constructs constitute positive and negative controls, respectively, for the deletion constructs. The results are analyzed here separately for each tissue or group of tissues.Articular CartilageSequences driving expression in articular cartilage were detectable only in fragment E–P. A portion of this fragment, labeled E–L, exhibited the highest frequency (7/10). The 5′-half of the E–L (fragment E–I) was much less active (2/11). Likewise, the 3′-half of E–L (segments I–L and H–M, which is only a few base pairs longer) was expressed at lower frequency (3/10 and 0/5 respectively, overall 3/15). Among subfragments derived from E–L (E–I, I–L, F–H, H–M, and E–J), only E–J was expressed with a frequency comparable to E–L itself (5/6). One conclusion coming from these results is that the main sequence necessary for transcription in articular cartilage is included in segment E–J and that integrity of this fragment is required for high levels of expression. The data indicate that distinct elements are located within E–I and I–L and that neither element reaches high frequency expression in the absence of the other, suggesting synergism. Very weak but detectable inductive activity was also found in segment L–P (1/8) and could be narrowed down to N–O. However, a fragment containing both the E–L and the L–P segments (construct E–P) was not more active than E–L alone (3/5 and 7/10, respectively). As the expression frequency of the entire −5.4/−3.9 region in articular cartilage (construct A–P) was 100%, this suggests that full induction requires not only elements located in E–L but also elements comprised within L–P and A–E, which, when tested per se, are weakly or not inductive.Peripheral Nervous SystemExpression in this tissue at high frequency required the presence of the entire E–L region, as found for constructs (B–P)lacZ (5/5), (E–P)lacZ (4/5), and (E–L)lacZ (5/10). Constructs not containing any portion of the E–L region did not express in this tissue. Finally, constructs enclosing only portions of the E–L region ((A–G)lacZ, (A–K)lacZ, (I–P)lacZ, (E–I)lacZ, (I–L)lacZ, (E–J)lacZ, (F–H)lacZ, and (H–M)lacZ) expressed with very low frequency (only 3 over a total of 60 lines produced). Thus, the main regulatory region for PNS is E–L. However, as B–P is the only deletion with 100% expression frequency, full activation probably requires additional sequences comprised in either L–P and/or B–E.Intervertebral DisksThe E–L region was strongly inducing, whereas its subfragment E–J was less efficient, indicating that, at variance with articular cartilage, elements in the J–L sequence are necessary for high frequency activation in this tissue. Unlike articular cartilage, A–E had autonomous activity, although at low frequency (1/8), in intervertebral disks. Fragment N–O was also weakly inductive in this tissue.Vibrissae and Subepidermal MesenchymeThe distribution of activating regions for these two tissues was similar, although frequencies of expressing over total transgenic lines were not exactly coincident. The E–L region was strongly activating; however, the shorter E–J segment was equally effective, suggesting that sequences of the J–L region are not crucial for high frequency expression in these tissues. As for intervertebral disks, segment A–E induced β-galactosidase expression at low frequency (1/8 in the two tissues). A weak inducing region with slightly different activity in the two locations was contained in fragment N–O (3/15 and 1/15, respectively).The main conclusion that can be drawn from these experiments is that high level expression requires the simultaneous presence of elements contained within segment E–I and I–L and that these distinct elements act in a synergistic manner. This is true for all the five tissues examined, although at different extents. The effect is strong for the peripheral nervous system in which splitting of the E–L fragment abolishes transcription completely, whereas in the other tissues the individual halves of E–L maintain a low degree of activity. A second conclusion is that, in addition to E–L, sequences with weak or no inducing activity when tested in isolation are necessary to reach the maximal enhancer activity measured for the entire −5.4/−3.9 region. It is apparent that strongly and weakly activating sequences controlling transcription in the five tissues overlap, but do not coincide (Fig. 1 b), suggesting that transcriptional activation in the various tissues examined requires the cooperation of distinct but partially common sets of nuclear factor binding elements within the −5.4/−3.9 enhancer region.Linker-scanning Mutagenesis Analysis of the E–J RegionTo map the active sequences of the enhancer region better, a linker-scanning mutagenesis analysis of the E–J segment was carried out. The choice of E–J was dictated by the fact that this was the shortest segment exhibiting considerable inducing activity in vivo in four out of five tissues investigated (Fig. 1) and in transfected cell lines in vitro (Fig. 6). Although E–J was a very weak activator in the peripheral nervous system (only 1 expressing in 26 lines generated with sequences internal to the fragment, which include E–J, E–I, and F–H, Fig. 1), it contains a large portion (about 2/3) of E–L, the smallest fragment highly expressed in this tissue. The results of these experiments are reported in Fig. 3. Each one of the mutations introduced into E–J lowered significantly (at least 50%) transcription compared with either p1.4(E–J)CAT or p1.4(A–P)CAT, indicating that all sequences included elements or part of elements important for full activation. For constructs containing LS11, LS13, LS15, and LS16, CAT expression was similar to that of the enhancerless plasmid p1.4CAT, suggesting that these mutations abolished completely enhancer performance. Comparison of the corresponding sequences with those of transcription factor binding site data bases (28.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) identified a consensus sequence for AP1 in the fragment covered by LS11. No significant homologies with known binding sites for transcription factors were found in the sequence spanning LS13. As for LS15 and LS16, no potential sites were revealed when the individual corresponding sequences were compared; when the data base was probed with the merged sequences a C/EBP-binding site was identified at the boundary of the two segments. Thus, the loss of enhancer activity in both p1.4(LS15)CAT and p1.4(LS16)CAT might be accounted for by the mutation of a transcription factor binding site spanning part of the two mutations.Figure 3Analysis of E–J segment by linker-scanning mutations.

Lower panel, expression of mutated constructs in NIH3T3 cells. Plasmids p1.4(LS1)CAT to p1.4(LS16)CAT contain the corresponding mutations defined in the upper panel. Each of the 16 mutations lowered significantly expression of CAT activity compared with the wild type sequence contained in constructs p1.4(E–J)CAT and p1.4(A–P)CAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate further the activating properties of elements in the E–J region, CAT constructs, in which the proximal 1.4 kb were fused with three copies of oligonucleotides I to VIII marked in Fig. 2, were transfected into NIH3T3 fibroblasts and sternal chondroblasts, and CAT activity was determined. Addition of three copies of oligonucleotides to the 1.4-kb proximal sequence was usually activating, but only weakly (≤2-fold), compared with the addition of the E–J segment (≥5-fold) (data not shown). This was also the case of oligonucleotide VIII, which included the potential AP1-binding site mutated in LS11. These results favor the idea that the integrity of the entire E–J segment is necessary for full induction; they also suggest that the enhancer function is not dependent on one in particular but rather requires cooperation of different transcription factors.Complexity of Transcription Factors Binding to the E–J SegmentThe results of the linker-scanning mutagenesis analysis suggest that the E–J segment binds a considerable number of nuclear factors. To test this prediction, protein-DNA interaction assays were performed. DNase I footprinting assays of the E–J region produced weak protections, the major of which encompassed about 90 nucleotides of the E–I fragment (footprint 1 in Fig.4) including completely the LS4 to LS8 segments defined in linker-scanning experiments (see Fig. 3). Other protected regions were shorter and much weaker, and two examples are given in Fig. 4 (footprints 2 and 3). Although the DNase I footprinting experiments showed that a considerable portion of the E–J region binds nuclear factors, the weak intensity of the protections prevented further analysis of the complexity of the binding transcription factors. This aspect was therefore investigated by mobility shift assays using the 12 overlapping double-stranded oligonucleotides defined in Fig. 2, which together span the entire E–J region. A representative gel shift pattern generated with nuclear extracts from chick embryo sternal chondroblasts is given in Fig.5. Similar patterns were obtained with nuclear extracts from other cell types, and the data are summarized in Table I. Main features of the pattern of band distribution were the absence of retarded bands specific for only one of the cell types considered and the variation of the relative intensity of bands with different cell extracts. Moreover, some bands were common to different cell types but absent in one strain of the same cell type, thus increasing the variation among cell strains. One notable example is band Xc, which, in addition to other cell types, is found in RCS, but not in sternal chondroblasts, and in tendon, but not in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. To define better the complexity of nuclear factors binding to the E–J segment, the bands were classified on the basis of their sensitivity to EDTA and heat and of the pattern of oligonucleotides inhibiting their formation in electrophoretic mobility shift assay competition experiments (TableII). The number of bands differing for at least one of these classification criteria is 22, corresponding to an estimate of the minimum number of different types of transcription factors that can bind to the E–J fragment.Figure 5Representative pattern of shifted bands generated with oligonucleotides I–XII spanning the E–J sequence (defined in Fig. 2). The figure reports the results obtained with nuclear extracts from chick embryo sternal chondroblasts. Some of the band were weak with this nuclear extract; however, as summarized in Table I, they were stronger with other nuclear extracts and could therefore be unequivocally defined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IComparison of retarded bands obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with different oligonucleotides of the E–J fragment and nuclear extracts from various cell typesNuclear extractBandChick embryo sternal chondroblastsRCS (rat chondro- sarcoma)Chick embryo tendon fibroblastsNIH3T3 (fibroblasts)C2C12 (myoblasts)RN22 (rat Schwann cells)EL4 (T-lymphoma)Ia++++++++Ib++++++++++Ic+++++++Id+++++++IIa+++++++++++++++++++IIb±++±++++++IIc−±−−+−−IIIa++++++++++++++++++++++++IIIb+++++++++++++IIIc+++−−+−IIId−++±++±+IVa+−−−−±+IVb++±+±±−±IVc+++++++++++++−IVd++++++++++++++++++++Va−−−−±−+Vb+++++++++++Vc++++++++++++VIa++++++++++++++++++++VIb±±+±±−±VIc++++++++++++++++++++++VId−++±±+±VIIa±±±±++±±VIIb++++++++++VIIc+++++++±±+±VIId++++++±++++++++++++VIIIa++++++++VIIIb±++±±+±±VIIIc++++++++±±VIIId++++++±++VIIIe−−−−+++++++IXa±++±±+±−IXb++±±++++++IXc+−−±−−−IXd−+++++±IXe+++++++Xa+±−+++++Xb+++++++++++++Xc−++±−±+±XIa+++++++++++++XIb±+±+++++XIc−±±−±+−XIIa++++++++++++++++++++XIIb+++±−±++−XIIc+±+++±±XIId±++±+++++XIIe++++++±++++Oligonucleotides I–XII are defined in Fig. 2.

Open table in a new tab Chromatin DNase I Footprinting AssaysExpression of promoter constructs in vivo and the different intensity of gel shift bands in various cell types (Table I) stimulate to hypothesize that elements binding transcription factors in the E–J segment have distinct regulatory relevance in different cells. To confirm this hypothesis chromatin DNase I footprinting and in vitro promoter assays were performed. The first kind of assays were carried out with the rationale that distinct assemblies of protein complexes binding to the enhancer region would imply a different organization of chromatin in the various tissues. Mouse cells employed for this analysis comprised lines derived from tissues where the −5.4/−3.9 enhancer region is stimulatory such as NIH3T3 fibroblasts, MC615 chondroblasts, and the Schwann cell line SCT-1 (8, 9 and see below); all these lines expressed the α1(VI) collagen mRNA, which was particularly abundant in NIH3T3 and MC615 (Fig.6 a).
