https://openalex.org/W2418622137,"Placing a light emitter in an ultra-small optical cavity results in coupling between matter and light, generating new forms of emission that can be exploited in practical or fundamental applications; here, a system is described in which strong light–matter coupling occurs at room temperature and in ambient conditions by aligning single dye molecules in the optical cavities between gold nanoparticles and surfaces. When a light-emitter is placed in a high-quality optical cavity, where light remains confined for a long time, coupling between matter and light occurs. This coupling produces new forms of light that can be exploited in practical or fundamental applications such as low-power switches or quantum information networks. Jeremy Baumberg and colleagues demonstrate an unusual system, of interest for photochemistry studies, where the fully mixed, strong-coupling regime is reached for single dye molecules at room temperature and in ambient conditions. The system is assembled by aligning dye molecules using a host–guest chemistry approach in plasmonic gaps (the optical cavities) between gold nanoparticles and surfaces. The authors demonstrate strong statistical evidence for single-molecule strong coupling. This opens up the possibility of exploring the chemical structure of molecules with light-dressed states. Photon emitters placed in an optical cavity experience an environment that changes how they are coupled to the surrounding light field. In the weak-coupling regime, the extraction of light from the emitter is enhanced. But more profound effects emerge when single-emitter strong coupling occurs: mixed states are produced that are part light, part matter1,2, forming building blocks for quantum information systems and for ultralow-power switches and lasers3,4,5,6. Such cavity quantum electrodynamics has until now been the preserve of low temperatures and complicated fabrication methods, compromising its use5,7,8. Here, by scaling the cavity volume to less than 40 cubic nanometres and using host–guest chemistry to align one to ten protectively isolated methylene-blue molecules, we reach the strong-coupling regime at room temperature and in ambient conditions. Dispersion curves from more than 50 such plasmonic nanocavities display characteristic light–matter mixing, with Rabi frequencies of 300 millielectronvolts for ten methylene-blue molecules, decreasing to 90 millielectronvolts for single molecules—matching quantitative models. Statistical analysis of vibrational spectroscopy time series and dark-field scattering spectra provides evidence of single-molecule strong coupling. This dressing of molecules with light can modify photochemistry, opening up the exploration of complex natural processes such as photosynthesis9 and the possibility of manipulating chemical bonds10."

Naturally occurring metalloenzymes are promising alternatives to transition-metal catalysts and non-metal enzymes for the synthesis of chemicals and biologically active compounds, but they catalyse only a narrow range of reactions. One way of broadening that range is to replace the native catalytic metal with an abiological metal. John Hartwig and colleagues report the effect of substituting the iron atom in Fe-porphyrin IX (Fe-PIX) proteins. Myoglobin variants containing an Ir(Me) site catalyse the functionalization of C–H bonds to form C–C bonds and add carbenes to β-substituted vinylarenes and unactivated aliphatic α-olefins. Directed evolution of the Ir(Me)-myoglobin generates mutants that form either enantiomer of the products of C–H insertion and catalyse the enantio- and diastereoselective cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins. The rich chemistry of free metalloporphyrins and the ease of preparation and evolution of substituted haem proteins using the methods adopted here open the way to the creation of many artificial metalloenzymes. Enzymes that contain metal ions—that is, metalloenzymes—possess the reactivity of a transition metal centre and the potential of molecular evolution to modulate the reactivity and substrate-selectivity of the system1. By exploiting substrate promiscuity and protein engineering, the scope of reactions catalysed by native metalloenzymes has been expanded recently to include abiological transformations2,3. However, this strategy is limited by the inherent reactivity of metal centres in native metalloenzymes. To overcome this limitation, artificial metalloproteins have been created by incorporating complete, noble-metal complexes within proteins lacking native metal sites1,4,5. The interactions of the substrate with the protein in these systems are, however, distinct from those with the native protein because the metal complex occupies the substrate binding site. At the intersection of these approaches lies a third strategy, in which the native metal of a metalloenzyme is replaced with an abiological metal with reactivity different from that of the metal in a native protein6,7,8. This strategy could create artificial enzymes for abiological catalysis within the natural substrate binding site of an enzyme that can be subjected to directed evolution. Here we report the formal replacement of iron in Fe-porphyrin IX (Fe-PIX) proteins with abiological, noble metals to create enzymes that catalyse reactions not catalysed by native Fe-enzymes or other metalloenzymes9,10. In particular, we prepared modified myoglobins containing an Ir(Me) site that catalyse the functionalization of C–H bonds to form C–C bonds by carbene insertion and add carbenes to both β-substituted vinylarenes and unactivated aliphatic α-olefins. We conducted directed evolution of the Ir(Me)-myoglobin and generated mutants that form either enantiomer of the products of C–H insertion and catalyse the enantio- and diastereoselective cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins. The presented method of preparing artificial haem proteins containing abiological metal porphyrins sets the stage for the generation of artificial enzymes from innumerable combinations of PIX-protein scaffolds and unnatural metal cofactors to catalyse a wide range of abiological transformations."
https://openalex.org/W2419212857,"The stability of spontaneous electrical polarization in ferroelectrics is fundamental to many of their current applications, which range from the simple electric cigarette lighter to non-volatile random access memories. Research on nanoscale ferroelectrics reveals that their behaviour is profoundly different from that in bulk ferroelectrics, which could lead to new phenomena with potential for future devices. As ferroelectrics become thinner, maintaining a stable polarization becomes increasingly challenging. On the other hand, intentionally destabilizing this polarization can cause the effective electric permittivity of a ferroelectric to become negative, enabling it to behave as a negative capacitance when integrated in a heterostructure. Negative capacitance has been proposed as a way of overcoming fundamental limitations on the power consumption of field-effect transistors. However, experimental demonstrations of this phenomenon remain contentious. The prevalent interpretations based on homogeneous polarization models are difficult to reconcile with the expected strong tendency for domain formation, but the effect of domains on negative capacitance has received little attention. Here we report negative capacitance in a model system of multidomain ferroelectric-dielectric superlattices across a wide range of temperatures, in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. Using a phenomenological model, we show that domain-wall motion not only gives rise to negative permittivity, but can also enhance, rather than limit, its temperature range. Our first-principles-based atomistic simulations provide detailed microscopic insight into the origin of this phenomenon, identifying the dominant contribution of near-interface layers and paving the way for its future exploitation."
https://openalex.org/W2416429243,"Precise regulation of calcium homeostasis is essential for many physiological functions. The Ca(2+)-selective transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 play vital roles in calcium homeostasis as Ca(2+) uptake channels in epithelial tissues. Detailed structural bases for their assembly and Ca(2+) permeation remain obscure. Here we report the crystal structure of rat TRPV6 at 3.25 Å resolution. The overall architecture of TRPV6 reveals shared and unique features compared with other TRP channels. Intracellular domains engage in extensive interactions to form an intracellular 'skirt' involved in allosteric modulation. In the K(+) channel-like transmembrane domain, Ca(2+) selectivity is determined by direct coordination of Ca(2+) by a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter. On the basis of crystallographically identified cation-binding sites at the pore axis and extracellular vestibule, we propose a Ca(2+) permeation mechanism. Our results provide a structural foundation for understanding the regulation of epithelial Ca(2+) uptake and its role in pathophysiology."

https://openalex.org/W2425849839,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived lipid storage organelles uniquely encapsulated by phospholipid monolayers. LD membrane proteins are embedded into the monolayer in a monotopic hairpin topology and are therefore likely to have requirements for their biogenesis distinct from those inserting as bitopic and polytopic proteins into phospholipid bilayers. UBXD8 belongs to a subfamily of hairpin proteins that localize to both the ER and LDs, and are initially inserted into the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER bilayer before partitioning to the LD monolayer. The molecular machinery responsible for inserting hairpin proteins into membranes, however, is unknown. Here, we report that newly synthesized UBXD8 is post-translationally inserted into discrete ER subdomains by a mechanism requiring cytosolic PEX19 and membrane-integrated PEX3, proteins hitherto exclusively implicated in peroxisome biogenesis. Farnesylation of PEX19 uncouples ER/LD and peroxisome targeting, expanding the function of this peroxin to an ER-targeting pathway and suggesting a coordinated biogenesis of LDs and peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W2430738587,"Objective Although milder forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remain prevalent, a correlation to neuronal injury has not been established in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We examined the relationship between mild HAND and CSF neurofilament light protein (NFL), a biomarker of neuronal injury; and CSF neopterin, a biomarker of CNS immunoactivation, in virally suppressed patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We selected 99 subjects on suppressive ART followed longitudinally from the CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study. Based on standardized comprehensive neurocognitive performance (NP) testing, subjects were classified as neurocognitively normal (NCN; n = 29) or impaired (NCI; n = 70). The NCI group included subjects with asymptomatic (ANI; n = 37) or mild (MND; n = 33) HAND. CSF biomarkers were analyzed on two occasions. Geometric mean CSF neopterin was 25% higher in the NCI group (p = 0.04) and NFL and neopterin were significantly correlated within the NCI group (r = 0.30; p<0.001) but not in the NCN group (r = -0.13; p = 0.3). Additionally, a trend towards higher NFL was seen in the NCI group (p = 0.06). Mild HAND was associated with increased intrathecal immune activation, and the correlation between neopterin and NFL found in NCI subjects indicates an association between neurocognitive impairment, CNS inflammation and neuronal damage. Together these findings suggest that NCI despite ART may represent an active pathological process within the CNS that needs further characterization in prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W2432906270,"Skeletal muscle has been suggested as a site of nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) besides brown adipose tissue (BAT). Studies in birds, which do not contain BAT, have demonstrated the importance of skeletal muscle-based NST. However, muscle-based NST in mammals remains poorly characterized. We recently reported that sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ cycling and that its regulation by SLN can be the basis for muscle NST. Because of the dominant role of BAT-mediated thermogenesis in rodents, the role of muscle-based NST is less obvious. In this study, we investigated whether muscle will become an important site of NST when BAT function is conditionally minimized in mice. We surgically removed interscapular BAT (iBAT, which constitutes ∼70% of total BAT) and exposed the mice to prolonged cold (4 °C) for 9 days. The iBAT-ablated mice were able to maintain optimal body temperature (∼35–37 °C) during the entire period of cold exposure. After 4 days in the cold, both sham controls and iBAT-ablated mice stopped shivering and resumed routine physical activity, indicating that they are cold-adapted. The iBAT-ablated mice showed higher oxygen consumption and decreased body weight and fat mass, suggesting an increased energy cost of cold adaptation. The skeletal muscles in these mice underwent extensive remodeling of both the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, including alteration in the expression of key components of Ca2+ handling and mitochondrial metabolism. These changes, along with increased sarcolipin expression, provide evidence for the recruitment of NST in skeletal muscle.

Thermogenesis is one of the most important homeostatic mechanisms that play a key role in the evolutionary expansion of mammals and birds. Despite its importance for the survival of the organism, the mechanistic details of various thermogenic mechanisms in birds and mammals remain far from completely understood. Heat production through muscle shivering is well known as the first line of defense to acute cold exposure. However, it remains unclear whether muscle can produce heat through nonshivering thermogenesis (NST). 2The abbreviations used are: NSTnonshivering thermogenesisBATbrown adipose tissueSERsarco/endoplasmic reticulumSLNsarcolipinSERCAsarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPaseiBATinterscapular brown adipose tissueTccore body temperatureVO2oxygen consumptionCASQcalsequestrinPLBphospholambanCaMKIICa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIRyRryanodine receptorTAtibialis anteriorSDHsuccinate dehydrogenaseSRsarcoplasmic reticulumVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. It is well known that mammals rely on brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a site for NST. BAT plays a dominant role in thermogenesis especially in neonatal mammals and in rodent species. BAT cells express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) in the inner membrane of mitochondria which, upon activation, depletes the proton gradient (or uncouples oxidative phosphorylation) and generates heat rather than ATP (1Azzu V.

However, the predominant use of rodents as the experimental animal model defined BAT as the only site of NST but ignored the existence of other NST sites.

Furthermore, cold adaptation studies using neonatal mice firmly suggest that muscle serves as a site of thermogenesis beyond shivering (23Pant M. Bal N.C. Periasamy M.

Biol. 2015; 218: 2321-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The major objective of this study is to demonstrate that skeletal muscle-based thermogenesis can become prominent when BAT function is minimized. We hypothesized that the contribution of skeletal muscle to NST is masked in mice because of the dominant role of BAT-dependent thermogenesis in cold adaptation. In mice, a major depot of BAT is located between the two scapulae, called interscapular BAT (iBAT), and constitutes more than 70% of total BAT depots present. Therefore, in this study, we surgically removed iBAT and exposed the mice to cold (4 °C) for a period of 9 days. We demonstrate here that the iBAT-ablated mice were able to maintain body temperature but induced substantial remodeling of both SER and mitochondria in their skeletal muscles. We found significant changes in mitochondrial architecture and SER protein expression as evidence for the recruitment of NST in skeletal muscle. Our studies show that skeletal muscle can substitute for the loss of BAT function and can serve as an important site of NST. iBAT constitutes ≥70% of the total BAT depots in rodents. We surgically removed iBAT to minimize the contribution from BAT to reveal the importance of skeletal muscle NST (supplemental Movie 1). This method precludes compensatory changes that can be induced in the UCP 1-KO model. Following iBAT ablation, mice were allowed to recover for 2 days at thermoneutrality (29 ± 1.0 °C). iBAT ablation in mice did not affect food intake, body weight, core body temperature (Tc), routine behavior, or serum metabolite levels (data not shown) when housed individually at 29 ± 1.0 °C or 22 ± 1.0 °C. Next we challenged these mice to acute cold (4 °C) for a period of 9 days. The iBAT-ablated mice showed a greater drop in Tc (0.8 ± 0.3 °C lower) than sham-operated (+iBAT) mice during the first 4 h of the cold challenge (Fig. 1A). However, they were able to maintain Tc (∼35–37 °C) similar to sham controls and did not develop hypothermia during the 9-day period of cold challenge. The mice were quite active at temperatures between 29 ± 1.0 °C and 22 ± 1.0 °C (Fig. 1B). When switched to 4 °C, long-range activity (high bursts of movement) was significantly decreased in both groups. Interestingly, on the first day of the cold challenge, the iBAT-ablated group (487.0 ± 13.0) showed significantly higher (p = 0.0002) physical activity than the sham group (333.0 ± 14.0), which is mainly due to increased shivering and grooming behavior. The physical activity data show that high-intensity shivering was prominent during the first 48 h in both groups, but from day 4 onward, shivering was not evident. By day 4, both groups showed similar long-range physical activity, and by day 8 of cold adaptation, the difference in physical activity between the two groups became nonsignificant (547.4 ± 25.5 versus 508.4 ± 32.7, p = 0.383). These data indicate that, during prolonged cold challenge, NST mechanisms must be activated to maintain Tc in iBAT-ablated mice. Next we investigated the effect of iBAT ablation on whole body metabolism. Both the iBAT-ablated and sham groups showed similar oxygen consumption (VO2) rates at 29 ± 1.0 °C (p = 0.258) and 22 ± 1.0 °C (p = 0.078). When challenged to 4.0 °C, both groups up-regulated their VO2 significantly (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the iBAT-ablated mice showed higher VO2 during the whole period of cold exposure. Their mean VO2 was higher by 9.2% (5225 ± 30.5 versus 5705 ± 34.1, p < 0.0001) on the first day and 3.2% (5435 ± 34.5 versus 5620 ± 34.0, p = 0.011) on day 8 than that of the sham group. Both sham and iBAT-ablated mice consumed approximately three times as much food during the first day of cold exposure relative to housing at 22 ± 1.0 °C. The iBAT-ablated group consumed 24.3% more food (15.3 ± 0.73 g versus 12.3 ± 0.55 g, p < 0.001) on the first day in the cold (Fig. 2A), but on day 8, food intake (9.9 ± 0.54 g versus 10.5 ± 0.78 g) was similar to controls. There was no significant difference in body weight when housed at 29 ± 1.0 °C or 22 ± 1.0 °C, but cold challenge resulted in a significant loss of body weight in iBAT-ablated mice (Fig. 2B). The iBAT-ablated mice showed a greater decrease, from 27.0 ± 0.25 g to 23.7 ± 0.38 g compared with sham controls (27.1 ± 0.54 g to 25.4 ± 0.68 g). Next we measured the weight of the intraperitoneal fat pad, which is the major energy reserve during increased physiological demand such as prolonged cold adaptation. The sham group lost only 10% of intraperitoneal fat mass (3.2 ± 0.22 g versus 2.84 ± 0.2 g), but the iBAT-ablated group lost 33.4% (3.4 ± 0.2 g versus 2.7 ± 0.15 g, Fig. 2C) after 9 days in the cold. Serum metabolite measurement showed that glucose was higher whereas triglyceride was lower in cold-adapted iBAT-abated mice (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that cold adaptation in the absence of iBAT is energetically costly. We have shown recently that uncoupling of SERCA by sarcolipin plays an important role in muscle NST and that loss of SLN impairs Tc maintenance in mice (13Bal N.C. Maurya S.K. Sopariwala D.H.

Biol. 2015; 218: 2321-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that mice without iBAT would increasingly rely on muscle-based NST during prolonged cold adaptation. In this study, we compared the expression of Ca2+-handling proteins in skeletal muscle from cold-adapted sham controls and iBAT-ablated mice. Cold adaptation induced a switch in the SERCA isoforms in the fast-twitch gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 3, A and B). SERCA 1a expression was down-regulated, but the SERCA 2a isoform was up-regulated, whereas expression of either of calsequestrin (CASQ) isoforms was not altered. Interestingly, iBAT ablation caused a significant up-regulation in SLN expression compared with sham controls in the red portion of the gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 3, C and D), but phospholamban (PLB), another key regulator of SERCA, was not induced by cold. Furthermore, gastrocnemius muscles from cold-adapted mice showed increased SERCA-based ATP hydrolysis, and iBAT ablation led to a further increase, although it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3E). As we found alteration in Ca2+ cycling, we examined Ca2+ signaling pathways. Interestingly, we found that the phosphorylated form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) α at threonine 286 was increased in cold-adapted iBAT-ablated mice, although total CaMKIIα expression was unaffected (Fig. 4, A and B). CaMKII is a known mediator of ryanodine receptor (RyR) 2 phosphorylation at residue serine 2814 (26Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Reiken S.R. Marks A.R. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation regulates the cardiac ryanodine receptor.Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e61-e70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which corresponds to threonine 2848 in RyR 1 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we analyzed RyR 1 expression and its phosphorylation status at Thr2848 (Thr(P)2848-RyR 1). We found both an increase in RyR 1 expression (Fig. 4, D and E) and RyR 1 phosphorylation (Thr(P)2848-RyR 1) upon cold adaptation. These data suggest that significant changes in the SER Ca2+ handling machinery are important for increased recruitment of muscle-based NST.FIGURE 4.Cold adaptation increases RyR1 expression and phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. A, expression of total CaMKIIα and Thr(P)286-CaMKIIα was measured in skeletal muscles from the cold-adapted mice. B, the level of Thr(P)286-CaMKIIα was measured and normalized using values from total CaMKIIα.

The percentage of occurrence of residues is shown as probability in the y axis. Acidic residues are shown in red, and basic residues are shown in blue. PKA and CaMKII phosphorylation sites on RyR 2 (Ser2808 and Ser2014) are indicated with downward arrows. These residues correspond to Ser2844 and Thr2848, respectively, on RyR 1. D, cold adaptation leads to increased expression and phosphorylation (at Thr2848) of RyR 1. iBAT-ablated mice showed higher p-RyR 1-Thr2848 levels, indicating a higher SER Ca2+ leak. The Ponceau S (Pon S)-stained membrane is shown as a loading control. E, the density of total RyR1 and p-RyR 1-Thr2848 was quantified and plotted.

We hypothesized that this is due to increased reliance on muscle-based NST and therefore wanted to investigate whether iBAT ablation caused a substantial remodeling of mitochondrial architecture and metabolism in the skeletal muscles. Electron microscopic analyses of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle revealed that there was a higher abundance of intramyofibrilar mitochondria and lipid droplets surrounded by mitochondria in the iBAT-ablated group (Fig. 5A). At a higher magnification, the intramyofibrilar mitochondria showed more elaborate cristae in the iBAT-ablated mice (Fig. 5B), suggesting increased mitochondrial activity in the muscle. In addition, we found an increase in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity staining in fast-twitch muscle, indicating an increase in oxidative metabolism (Fig. 5C) in iBAT-ablated mice. This is further supported by the data showing higher mitochondrial respiration (O2 consumption) and ATP synthesis activity in response to different substrates (glutamate + malate, ADP, and succinate) in muscles from iBAT-ablated mice (Fig. 5D). Next we studied the expression levels of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins (Fig. 5E). The electron transport chain complex proteins (II, III, and IV) along with ATP synthase (complex V) were significantly up-regulated after cold adaptation, and iBAT-ablation led to up-regulation of complexes I, III, and V (Fig. 5F). These data suggest that the mitochondria are more active and that fatty acid metabolism is recruited to a greater extent in skeletal muscle in iBAT-ablated mice. We found up-regulation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β, an indicator of higher fatty acid utilization, in skeletal muscles from cold-adapted iBAT-ablated mice (Fig. 5, E and F). This was also supported by data showing that fatty acid transport proteins, lipoprotein lipase and CD36, were up-regulated in skeletal muscles in sham mice and were further up-regulated in iBAT-ablated mice (Fig. 5F). Interestingly, cold-adapted iBAT-ablated mice had lower serum triglyceride (Fig. 3D), suggesting greater fatty acid uptake and utilization in muscle. We next studied key proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, including fusion and fission in skeletal muscle. The expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins (mitofusin (Mfn) 1, Mfn 2, and optic atrophy (Opa) 1) were increased slightly in cold-exposed sham controls, but their expression was significantly up-regulated in iBAT-ablated mice (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating increased mitochondrial fusion in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, studies have shown that Mfn 2 also plays a role in in SR-mitochondrial membrane tethering. Therefore, the up-regulation of Mfn 2 in the iBAT-ablated mice (Fig. 6B) indicates increased SER-mitochondrial Ca2+ cross-talk. On the other hand, expression of mitochondrial fission proteins (fission (Fis) 1, dynamin-related protein (Drp) 1, and mitochondrial fission factor) was unaltered by cold exposure (Fig. 6, C and D). Interestingly, we found a significant up-regulation of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) 1 in the skeletal muscle upon cold adaptation (Fig. 6, E and F). VDAC 1 is known to facilitate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (27García-Pérez C. Schneider T.G. Hajnóczky G. Csordás G. Alignment of sarcoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial junctions with mitochondrial contact points.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2011; 301: H1907-H1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and thereby activate mitochondrial metabolism. We also found up-regulation in Tfam, which promotes mitochondrial DNA content necessary for increased fusion during cold adaptation, especially after iBAT ablation (Fig. 6, E and F). The adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) 1 level was also found to be higher in muscles from cold-treated iBAT-ablated mice, indicating enhanced mitochondrial ATP supply (Fig. 6, E and F). These data strongly suggest that there is increased mitochondrial fusion over fission during skeletal muscle adaptation to cold, which is important to meet the energy demand of elevated muscle-based NST. Despite the suggestion that skeletal muscle also plays a role in NST during cold adaptation (4Grav H.I. Blix A.S.

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, dynophores (i.e. a combination of static three-dimensional pharmacophores and molecular dynamics-based conformational sampling), ligand design, and receptor mutagenesis, we show that inactive agonist·receptor complexes can result from agonist binding to the allosteric vestibule alone, whereas the dualsteric binding mode produces active receptors. Each agonist forms a distinct ligand binding ensemble, and different agonist efficacies depend on the fraction of purely allosteric (i.e. inactive) versus dualsteric (i.e. active) binding modes.

https://openalex.org/W2438878101,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic hamartoma syndrome frequently associated with severe intractable epilepsy. In some TSC patients epilepsy surgery is a promising treatment option provided that the epileptogenic zone can be precisely delineated. TSC brain lesions (cortical tubers) contain dysmorphic neurons, brightly eosinophilic giant cells and white matter alterations in various proportions. However, a histological classification system has not been established for tubers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define distinct histological patterns within tubers based on semi-automated histological quantification and to find clinically significant correlations. In total, we studied 28 cortical tubers and seven samples of perituberal cortex from 28 TSC patients who had undergone epilepsy surgery. We assessed mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, the numbers of giant cells, dysmorphic neurons, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, and calcification, gliosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and myelin content. Three distinct histological profiles emerged based on the proportion of calcifications, dysmorphic neurons and giant cells designated types A, B, and C. In the latter two types we were able to subsequently associate them with specific features on presurgical MRI. Therefore, these histopathological patterns provide consistent criteria for improved definition of the clinico-pathological features of cortical tubers identified by MRI and provide a basis for further exploration of the functional and molecular features of cortical tubers in TSC."

However, almost nothing is known about its patterns of genetic variation and epidemiology on any of its host plant species. Here we analyzed 167 isolates of C. fructicola obtained from the leaves of tea-oil tree Camellia oleifera at 15 plantations in seven Chinese provinces. Multilocus sequence typing was conducted for all isolates based on DNA sequences at fragments of four genes: the internal transcribed spacers of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster (539 bp), calmodulin (633 bp), glutamine synthetase (711 bp), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (190 bp), yielding 3.52%, 0.63%, 8.44%, and 7.89% of single nucleotide polymorphic sites and resulting in 15, 5, 12 and 11 alleles respectively at the four gene fragments in the total sample. The combined allelic information from all four loci identified 53 multilocus genotypes with the most frequent represented by 21 isolates distributed in eight tea-oil plantations in three provinces, consistent with long-distance clonal dispersal. However, despite evidence for clonal dispersal, statistically significant genetic differentiation among geographic populations was detected. In addition, while no evidence of recombination was found within any of the four gene fragments, signatures of recombination were found among the four gene fragments in most geographic populations, consistent with sexual mating of this species in nature. Our study provides the first insights into the population genetics and epidemiology of the important plant fungal pathogen C. fructicola."

The purpose of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism(s) underlying ABCA1 epigenetic modification and determine its potential impact on ABCA1 expression in macrophage-derived foam cell formation and atherosclerosis development. DNA methylation induced foam cell formation from macrophages and promoted atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Bioinformatics analyses revealed a large CpG island (CGI) located in the promoter region of ABCA1. Histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) downregulated ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression in THP-1 and RAW264.7 macrophage-derived foam cells. Pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) with 5-Aza-dC or knockdown of DNMT1 prevented the downregulation of macrophage ABCA1 expression, suggesting a role of DNA methylation in ABCA1 expression. Polycomb protein EZH2 induced DNMT1 expression and methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MeCP2) recruitment, and stimulated the binding of DNMT1 and MeCP2 to ABCA1 promoter, thereby promoting ABCA1 gene DNA methylation and atherosclerosis. Knockdown of DNMT1 inhibited EZH2-induced downregulation of ABCA1 in macrophages. Conversely, EZH2 overexpression stimulated DNMT1-induced ABCA1 gene promoter methylation and atherosclerosis. EZH2-induced downregulation of ABCA1 gene expression promotes foam cell formation and the development of atherosclerosis by DNA methylation of ABCA1 gene promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2434967355,"β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are ubiquitously present in Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts, and function in a variety of biological processes. The mechanism by which the hydrophobic nascent β-barrel OMPs are transported through the hydrophilic periplasmic space in bacterial cells remains elusive. Here, mainly via unnatural amino acid-mediated in vivo photo-crosslinking studies, we revealed that the primary periplasmic chaperone SurA interacts with nascent β-barrel OMPs largely via its N-domain but with β-barrel assembly machine protein BamA mainly via its satellite P2 domain, and that the nascent β-barrel OMPs interact with SurA via their N- and C-terminal regions. Additionally, via dual in vivo photo-crosslinking, we demonstrated the formation of a ternary complex involving β-barrel OMP, SurA, and BamA in cells. More importantly, we found that a supercomplex spanning the inner and outer membranes and involving the BamA, BamB, SurA, PpiD, SecY, SecE, and SecA proteins appears to exist in living cells, as revealed by a combined analyses of sucrose-gradient ultra-centrifugation, Blue native PAGE and mass spectrometry.

Here, we used an amplicon sequencing approach based on high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the bacterial community associated with the production of three Apulian red wines, from grape to final product. The relationships among grape variety, the microbial community, and fermentation was investigated. Moreover, the winery microbiota was evaluated compared to the autochthonous species in vineyards that persist until the end of the winemaking process. The analysis highlighted the remarkable dynamics within the microbial communities during fermentation. A common microbial core shared among the examined wine varieties was observed, and the unique taxonomic signature of each wine appellation was revealed. New species belonging to the genus Halomonas were also reported. This study demonstrates the potential of this metagenomic approach, supported by optimized protocols, for identifying the biodiversity of the wine supply chain. The developed experimental pipeline offers new prospects for other research fields in which a comprehensive view of microbial community complexity and dynamics is desirable."
https://openalex.org/W2432030050,"VEGFR2 plays a fundamental role in blood vessel formation and in life threatening diseases, such as cancer angiogenesis and cardiovascular disorders. Although inactive growth factor receptors are mainly localized at the plasma membrane, VEGFR2 undergoes constitutive endocytosis (in the absence of ligand) and recycling. Intriguingly, the significance of these futile transport cycles of VEGFR2 remains unclear. Here we found that, unexpectedly, the function of constitutive endocytosis of VEGFR2 is to protect the receptor against plasma membrane cleavage (shedding), thereby preserving the functional state of the receptor until the time of activation by VEGF. Inhibition of constitutive endocytosis of VEGFR2, by interference with the function of clathrin, dynamin, or Rab5, increases dramatically the cleavage/shedding of VEGFR2. Shedding of VEGFR2 produces an N-terminal soluble fragment (100 kDa, s100), which is released in the extracellular space, and a residual C-terminal part (130 kDa, p130) that remains integrated at the plasma membrane. The released soluble fragment (s100) co-immunoprecipitates with VEGF, in line with the topology of the VEGF-binding domain at the N terminus of VEGFR2. Increased shedding of VEGFR2 (via inhibition of constitutive endocytosis) results in reduced response to VEGF, consistently with the loss of the VEGF-binding domain from the membrane remnant of VEGFR2. These data suggest that constitutive internalization of VEGFR2 protects the receptor against shedding and provides evidence for an unprecedented mechanism via which endocytosis can regulate the fate and activity of growth factor receptors.

Growth factor receptors are synthesized and processed in the ER/Golgi biosynthetic network. Subsequently, they are delivered to the plasma membrane to become available for binding to their extracellular cognate ligands. In principle, in the absence of ligand, quiescent receptors are preferentially localized at the plasma membrane, whereas only a small percentage of the surface molecules are constitutively internalized (1.Hopkins C.R.

Moss L. Jones M.C. Brunton V. Norman J.C. Mellor H. et al.VEGF regulates the mobilization of VEGFR2/KDR from an intracellular endothelial storage compartment.Blood. 2006; 108: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the significance of this atypical high percentage of internalization of unliganded VEGFR2 remains unexplored. Here we study the importance of the constitutive internalization of VEGFR2. Our findings suggest that constitutive internalization of quiescent VEGFR2 is critical in protecting the receptor against ectodomain cleavage (shedding). This protective role of endocytosis is surprising, because, one of the main functions of endocytosis is to direct molecules to lysosomes or to the proteasome for degradation, rather than to protect them from proteolytic cleavage. Thus, the present study reveals a novel mechanism via which endocytosis can regulate the fate and function of growth factor receptors. At first, we confirmed (25.Gampel A. Moss L. Jones M.C. Brunton V. Norman J.C. Mellor H. et al.VEGF regulates the mobilization of VEGFR2/KDR from an intracellular endothelial storage compartment.Blood. 2006; 108: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that as much as 40% of total cellular VEGFR2 is localized intracellularly (data not shown). Furthermore, to unambiguously study the importance of ligand-independent endocytosis of VEGFR2, we monitored internalization of the plasma membrane pools of VEGFR2, using an anti-VEGFR2 antibody uptake assay. Based on this approach, we found that the receptor internalizes efficiently in primary endothelial cells (HUVECs 2The abbreviations used are: HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellCMEclathrin-mediated endocytosisCHCclathrin heavy chainTIRF-Mtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopyPNGase Fpeptide N-glycosidase FEndo Hendoglycosidase HERendoplasmic reticulumEEA1early endosome antigen 1ANOVAanalysis of variance. under starvation) even in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1A), confirming that VEGFR2 is constitutively internalized. We then verified that the route responsible for constitutive internalization of VEGFR2 is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (13.Ewan L.C. Jopling H.M. Jia H. Mittar S. Bagherzadeh A. Howell G.J. Walker J.H. Zachary I.C.

Boucrot E. et al.Molecular mechanism and physiological functions of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Indeed, knockdown of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) resulted in a substantial decrease of VEGFR2 internalization (Fig. 1A). Because dynamin is a key regulator of CME (28.Schmid S.L.

De Camilli P. et al.Dynamin, a membrane-remodelling GTPase.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), we also tested whether inhibition of dynamin affects constitutive endocytosis of VEGFR2. To this end we used dynasore (30.Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. et al.Dynasore, a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), a commonly used inhibitor of dynamin (31.Ivanov A.I. et al.Pharmacological inhibitors of exocytosis and endocytosis: novel bullets for old targets.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1174: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unlike knocking down or overexpression approaches, the use of rapidly acting inhibitors avoids the induction of compensatory internalization routes, which is a possible side effect in experiments where endocytosis is blocked by long-term treatment approaches (32.Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. et al.Clathrin-independent pinocytosis is induced in cells overexpressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of dynamin.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Treatment with dynasore caused a substantial inhibition of constitutive internalization of VEGFR2, as assessed by the antibody uptake assay (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the data obtained by the knockdown of clathrin (Fig. 1A), or the overexpression approaches (shown in later experiments, FIGURE 2., FIGURE 3.). Additionally, we employed a surface biotinylation assay to assess biochemically the identity of the route of VEGFR2 internalization. Similarly to the immunofluorescence microscopy experiments, internalization of VEGFR2 was largely inhibited upon CHC knockdown (Fig. 1B), or by treatment with dynasore (Fig. 1C).

We also assessed constitutive internalization of VEGFR2 in live cells, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M). In control cells, there was a quick disappearance of VEGFR2 positive patches from the plasma membrane, followed by appearance of new spots (supplemental Movie S1), a process that is reminiscent of vesicular internalization and recycling. In the presence of dynasore, there was a substantial inhibition of the vesicular movement of VEGFR2 (supplemental Movie S1). Combined, the above data suggest that VEGFR2 internalizes constitutively via the clathrin- and dynamin-dependent route. Because the receptor internalizes constitutively (in the absence of VEGF), how are the surface levels of the receptor replenished to allow ligand binding and signal initiation? To study the efficiency of VEGFR2 recycling in endothelial cells, we employed a biochemical assay where the rate of receptor recycling is proportional to the rate of disappearance of an intracellular biotin-labeled VEGFR2 pool. We observed that the internalized receptor recycles effectively back to the plasma membrane (the amount of internalized VEGFR2 that undergoes recycling is ∼5% per min, Fig. 1D). We also confirmed recycling of VEGFR2 using a microscopy-based approach that relies on receptor/antibody internalization, recycling, and re-internalization of the receptor (Fig. 1E, vehicle). When cells were treated with dynasore, the signal of VEGFR2 was largely inhibited (Fig. 1E, dynasore), suggesting that prior to recycling, the receptor internalizes dynamin dependently. Thus, these data suggest that, in the absence of VEGF, VEGFR2 undergoes continuous futile cycles of clathrin- and dynamin-mediated internalization and recycling. To get insights into the role of constitutive endocytosis of VEGFFR2, we inhibited CME and tested the consequence on the fate of the receptor. Given that one of the main functions of endocytosis is to direct proteins to lysosomes or proteasomes for degradation (7.Ivanov A.I. et al.Exocytosis and endocytosis. Preface.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 440: v-viPubMed Google Scholar, 8.Di Fiore P.P. Gill G.N. et al.Endocytosis and mitogenic signaling.Curr. Opin.

Yet, surprisingly, inhibition of CME, either via lentiviral expression of a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin (K44A) (Fig. 2A) or via knockdown of CHC (Fig. 2B), resulted in a decrease of the levels of the mature form of VEGFR2 (230 kDa) and the production of a lower molecular mass (130 kDa) polypeptide. Knockdown of caveolin-1, which had no effect on receptor internalization (see Fig. 1B), had no substantial effect on VEGFR2 levels (Fig. 2B). To test whether the production of p130 is directly related to the decrease of the levels of full-length receptor, as well as to assess the kinetics of the production of p130, we determined the protein levels of VEGFR2 and p130 after acute inhibition of CME via dynasore, at increasing incubation times. The employment of a rapidly acting inhibitor (e.g. dynasore, which acts within about 20 min), rather than a knockdown or overexpression approach (which require 24 to 72 h of treatment), is critical for this type of experiment, because it allows almost immediate and direct assessment of the kinetics of the events altering the levels of VEGFR2 and p130, without the interference by new protein synthesis and/or protein degradation. Treatment of HUVECs with dynasore resulted in a time-dependent decrease of the levels of full-length VEGFR2 followed by a concomitant accumulation of p130 (Fig. 2C), which is in accordance with the results of K44A overexpression (Fig. 2A) or CHC knockdown (Fig. 2B) experiments. Importantly, the production of p130 was proportional to the decrease of the levels of full-length VEGFR2 (see diagram in Fig. 2C), indicating that the generation of p130 is directly linked to the decrease of the amount of mature VEGFR2. Notably, p130 was detectable, although at very low levels, even in the control/untreated cells (see the zero time point in the high exposure of the blot in Fig. 2C), whereas it became significantly induced upon inhibition of endocytosis (Fig. 2C). Together, the above data indicate that inhibition of constitutive endocytosis of VEGFR2 potentiates the generation of a lower molecular weight product of VEGFR2, the p130, at the expense of full-length VEGFR2. To further validate that the production of p130 is the result of the exposure of the receptor at the plasma membrane, we interfered with internalization of VEGFR2 via an independent approach, i.e. via modulation of the function of Rab5, which is a major regulator of the early endocytic pathway (5.Miaczynska M.

The developmental pathway of 10E8 might therefore serve as a promising template for vaccine design, but samples from time-of-infection—often used to infer the B cell record—are unavailable. In this study, we used crystallography, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and functional assessments to infer the 10E8 developmental pathway from a single time point. Mutational analysis indicated somatic hypermutation of the 2nd-heavy chain-complementarity determining region (CDR H2) to be critical for neutralization, and structures of 10E8 variants with V-gene regions reverted to genomic origin for heavy-and-light chains or heavy chain-only showed structural differences >2 Å relative to mature 10E8 in the CDR H2 and H3. To understand these developmental changes, we used bioinformatic sieving, maximum likelihood, and parsimony analyses of immunoglobulin transcripts to identify 10E8-lineage members, to infer the 10E8-unmutated common ancestor (UCA), and to calculate 10E8-developmental intermediates. We were assisted in this analysis by the preservation of a critical D-gene segment, which was unmutated in most 10E8-lineage sequences. UCA and early intermediates weakly bound a 26-residue-MPER peptide, whereas HIV-1 neutralization and epitope recognition in liposomes were only observed with late intermediates. Antibody 10E8 thus develops from a UCA with weak MPER affinity and substantial differences in CDR H2 and H3 from the mature 10E8; only after extensive somatic hypermutation do 10E8-lineage members gain recognition in the context of membrane and HIV-1 neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W2430410405,"It has become increasingly clear that proper cellular control of pluripotency and differentiation is related to the regulation of rRNA synthesis. To further our understanding of the role that the regulation of rRNA synthesis has in pluripotency we monitored rRNA synthesis during the directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We discovered that the rRNA synthesis rate is reduced ~50% within 6 hours of ACTIVIN A treatment. This precedes reductions in expression of specific stem cell markers and increases in expression of specific germ layer markers. The reduction in rRNA synthesis is concomitant with dissociation of the Pol I transcription factor, UBTF, from the rRNA gene promoter and precedes any increase to heterochromatin throughout the rRNA gene. To directly investigate the role of rRNA synthesis in pluripotency, hESCs were treated with the Pol I inhibitor, CX-5461. The direct reduction of rRNA synthesis by CX-5461 induces the expression of markers for all three germ layers, reduces the expression of pluripotency markers, and is overall similar to the ACTIVIN A induced changes. This work indicates that the dissociation of UBTF from the rRNA gene, and corresponding reduction in transcription, represent early regulatory events during the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells."

In order to reduce preventable CVD mortality and morbidity, LMIC health systems and health care providers need to improve the delivery and quality of CVD care.As part of the Disease Control Priorities Three (DCP3) Study efforts addressing quality improvement, we reviewed and summarized currently available evidence on interventions to improve quality of clinic-based CVD prevention and management in LMICs.We conducted a narrative review of published comparative clinical trials that evaluated efficacy or effectiveness of clinic-based CVD prevention and management quality improvement interventions in LMICs. Conditions selected a priori included hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, stroke, rheumatic heart disease, and congestive heart failure. MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were systematically searched. Studies were categorized as occurring at the system or patient/provider level and as treating the acute or chronic phase of CVD.From 847 articles identified in the electronic search, 49 met full inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Selected studies were performed in 19 different LMICs. There were 10 studies of system level quality improvement interventions, 38 studies of patient/provider interventions, and one study that fit both criteria. At the patient/provider level, regardless of the specific intervention, intensified, team-based care generally led to improved medication adherence and hypertension control. At the system level, studies provided evidence that introduction of universal health insurance coverage improved hypertension and diabetes control. Studies of system and patient/provider level acute coronary syndrome quality improvement interventions yielded inconclusive results. The duration of most studies was less than 12 months.The results of this review suggest that CVD care quality improvement can be successfully implemented in LMICs. Most studies focused on chronic CVD conditions; more acute CVD care quality improvement studies are needed. Longer term interventions and follow-up will be needed in order to assess the sustainability of quality improvement efforts in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W2424144111,"Background Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) are a major source of air pollution. Nasal fibroblasts are known to produce various cytokines and chemokines. The aim of this study was to evaluate DEP-induced cytokines and chemokines in nasal fibroblasts and to identify the signaling pathway involved. Methods A cytokine and chemokine array performed after stimulation of nasal fibroblasts with DEP revealed that levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were increased most significantly among various cytokines and chemokines. RT—PCR and ELISA were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8. Signaling pathways of p-38, Akt, and NF-κB were analyzed by western blotting, luciferase assay, and ELISA. Organ cultures of nasal interior turbinate were also developed to demonstrate the ex vivo effect of DEP on the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 and the associated signaling pathway. Results DEP increased the expressions of IL-6 and IL-8 in nasal fibroblasts at mRNA and protein levels. DEP induced phosphorylation of p38, Akt, and NF-κB, whereas inhibitors of p38, Akt, and NF-κB blocked these phophorylations and the expressions of IL-6 and IL-8. These findings were also observed in ex vivo organ culture of nasal inferior turbinate. Conclusions DEP induces expression of IL-6 and IL-8 via p38, Akt, and NF-κB signaling pathways in nasal fibroblasts. This finding suggests that air pollution might induce or aggravate allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinosinusitis."
https://openalex.org/W2432698752,"Thrombogenic and inflammatory mediators, such as thrombin, induce NF-κB-mediated endothelial cell (EC) activation and dysfunction, which contribute to pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis. The role of anti-inflammatory microRNA-181b (miR-181b) on thrombosis remains unknown. Our previous study demonstrated that miR-181b inhibits downstream NF-κB signaling in response to TNF-α. Here, we demonstrate that miR-181b uniquely inhibits upstream NF-κB signaling in response to thrombin. Overexpression of miR-181b inhibited thrombin-induced activation of NF-κB signaling, demonstrated by reduction of phospho-IKK-β, -IκB-α, and p65 nuclear translocation in ECs. MiR-181b also reduced expression of NF-κB target genes VCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and tissue factor. Mechanistically, miR-181b targets caspase recruitment domain family member 10 (Card10), an adaptor protein that participates in activation of the IKK complex in response to signals transduced from protease-activated receptor-1. miR-181b reduced expression of Card10 mRNA and protein, but not protease-activated receptor-1. 3'-Untranslated region reporter assays, argonaute-2 microribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation studies, and Card10 rescue studies revealed that Card10 is a bona fide direct miR-181b target. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Card10 expression phenocopied effects of miR-181b on NF-κB signaling and targets. Card10 deficiency did not affect TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB signaling, which suggested stimulus-specific regulation of NF-κB signaling and endothelial responses by miR-181b in ECs. Finally, in response to photochemical injury-induced arterial thrombosis, systemic delivery of miR-181b reduced thrombus formation by 73% in carotid arteries and prolonged time to occlusion by 1.6-fold, effects recapitulated by Card10 small interfering RNA. These data demonstrate that miR-181b and Card10 are important regulators of thrombin-induced EC activation and arterial thrombosis.

https://openalex.org/W2442188841,"Rictor upregulation and mTORC complex 2 (mTORC2) over-activation participate in glioma cell progression, yet the underling mechanisms are not known. We here identified microRNA-153 (miR-153) as a potential anti-Rictor miRNA, which was downregulated in multiple human glioma tissues and glioma cell lines (U87MG, T98G, U373MG and U251MG). miR-153 downregulation was correlated with Rictor (mRNA and protein) upregulation and p-Akt Ser473 (the mTORC2 indicator) over-activation in the glioma tissues and cells. Our in vitro evidences suggested that Rictor could be one primary target of miR-153 in glioma cells. Exogenous overexpression of miR-153 downregulated Rictor (mRNA and protein) and decreased p-Akt Ser473 in U87MG cells, leading to significant growth inhibition and apoptosis activation. Notably, U87MG cells with Rictor shRNA knockdown showed similar phenotypes of cells with miR-153 overexpression. More importantly, in Rictor-silenced U87MG cells, miR-153 expression failed to further affect cell growth nor apoptosis. In vivo, we showed that miR-153 overexpression dramatically inhibited U87MG tumor growth in nude mice. Together, these results suggest that miR-153 downregulation could be one important reason of Rictor upregulation and mTORC2 over-activation in glioma cells. Further, miR-153-induced anti-glioma cell activity is possibly via downregulating Rictor."

The hypertension is reversible by a low-sodium diet and by the CYP4A inhibitor HET0016. B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice display an 18% increase of plasma potassium (p < 0.02), but plasma aldosterone, angiotensin II (ANGII), and renin activities are unchanged. This phenotype resembles human genetic disorders with elevated activity of the sodium chloride co-transporter (NCC) and, accordingly, NCC abundance is increased by 50% in transgenic mice, and NCC levels are normalized by HET0016. ANGII is known to increase NCC abundance, and renal mRNA levels of its precursor angiotensinogen are increased 2-fold in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+, and blockade of the ANGII receptor type 1 with losartan normalizes BP. A pro-hypertensive role for 20-HETE was implicated by normalization of BP and reversal of renal angiotensin mRNA increases by administration of the 20-HETE antagonists 2-((6Z,15Z)-20-hydroxyicosa-6,15-dienamido)acetate or (S)-2-((6Z,15Z)-20-hydroxyicosa-6,15-dienamido)succinate. SGK1 expression is also increased in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice and paralleled increases seen for NCC. Losartan, HET0016, and 20-HETE antagonists each normalized SGK1 mRNA expression.

These lines were generated by incorporation of the complete CYP4A11 gene, including >45 kb of the upstream and >10 kb of downstream flanking inter-gene regions, from human BAC clone RP11-345m5 to ensure that native cis-acting regulatory elements of the human gene are retained and potential effects of the insertion site on expression of the transgene are reduced. Among many tissues examined, the liver and kidney were found to be the predominant sites of CYP4A11 transgene expression, which is consistent with tissue selectivity seen in humans.

As expression of the human CYP4A11 transgene in mice is likely to augment endogenous capacity to form 20-HETE in renal tubular epithelium, we determined the effect of the CYP4A11 transgene on BP. Here, we present data to support CYP4A11-dependent augmentation of 20-HETE production as well as gene dosage-dependent development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Elevated BP is associated with an increase of angiotensinogen, NCC, and SGK1 expression in kidney, whereas plasma ANGII, aldosterone, and renin activity were unchanged. The use of inhibitors of CYP ω-hydroxylases, ANGII receptor 1 (ATR1), or NCC and 20-HETE antagonists demonstrate the reversibility of these processes and implicate these renal pathways in the development of the salt-sensitive hypertensive phenotype seen in CYP4A11 transgenic mice. B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice are carriers of two haploid transgene copies and, as a result, this homozygous line has four copies of the CYP4A11 gene (Fig. 1A). In contrast, hemizygous transgenic line B and line F congenic 129/Sv mice carry two copies and one copy of the transgene, respectively. Amplification of the murine Cyp4a14 gene indicated that all three lines carried two copies of the endogenous gene, as expected. Statistically significant increases in BP were seen in the B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice, as indicated by systolic BP values of 143 ± 8 mm Hg for B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ females and 140 ± 7 mmHg for B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ males compared with 110 ± 6 in female and 115 ± 10 in male wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). Although diastolic BP was also elevated in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice, systolic BP values are reported throughout the article. BP did not differ significantly between sexes within each genotype. Interestingly, congenic male and female hemizygote line B 129/Sv mice carrying two CYP4A11 gene copies on one haploid chromosome (B−/+) displayed normal BP of 111 ± 6 mm Hg (n = 13), and the independent congenic hemizygous CYP4A11 transgenic line F 129/Sv male mice that carry only one copy of the CYP4A11 gene (F−/+) also exhibited normal BP (107 ± 11 mm Hg, n = 8). Treatment of hypertensive B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice with HET0016, a selective inhibitor of fatty acid ω-hydroxylases (including CYP4A11 (28.Miyata N. Taniguchi K. Seki T. Ishimoto T. Sato-Watanabe M.

Collectively, these results show that the presence of four copies of the CYP4A11 gene in the 129/Sv background increases systemic BP in mice; in addition, the hypertensive phenotype is reversible and is likely to reflect the catalytic activity of P450 4A11 because HET0016 normalized BP in the transgenics without significantly affecting the wild-type mice. As the hypertensive phenotype was only seen in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice, all subsequently reported results here were conducted in this line and wild-type 129/Sv control mice. B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ male and female mice exhibited 25 and 30% reduction of urine output, respectively, relative to wild-type mice (p < 0.0005 for females and males with n of at least 17 per group). The daily excretion of several electrolytes including potassium and chloride was lower in both sexes, whereas decreased sodium excretion was only statistically significant in male transgenic mice (Table 1). Interestingly, urinary calcium levels were also decreased, but total protein excretion was not affected (data not shown). Analysis of blood samples indicated that with the exception of potassium, which was elevated by about 18%, plasma concentrations of other electrolytes were normal. Plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values were in the normal range as were levels of biomarkers for tissue damage. The differences in electrolyte excretion suggested that circulating components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be affected. Nevertheless, measurements of plasma renin activity, ANGII, and aldosterone concentrations showed no significant differences between B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ and control mice (Table 2).TABLE 1Plasma and urine measurements4A11−/−4A11+/+Tg/Wt ratiop valueMean ± S.D.FemalesBody weight, g18.1 ± 0.718.93 ± 1.61.050.19Plasma BUN, mg/dl25.6 ± 2.727.6 ± 6.91.080.56Plasma creatinine, mg/dl0.2 ± 0.00.2 ± 0.01.000.17Plasma sodium, mm152 ± 4148 ± 20.980.10Plasma potassium, mm6.7 ± 0.67.9 ± 0.61.180.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Urinary excretionUrine, ml/mouse/day0.82 ± 0.150.51 ± 0.080.63<0.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Creatinine, mg/day0.27 ± 0.050.21 ± 0.060.780.05Sodium, mEq/day0.16 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.040.920.40Potassium, mEq/day0.24 ± 0.040.18 ± 0.050.750.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Chloride, mEq/day0.26 ± 0.030.21 ± 0.050.790.02aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Calcium, mg/day0.15 ± 0.040.08 ± 0.040.55<0.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.MalesBody weight, g23.7 ± 2.824.8 ± 0.61.050.45Plasma BUN, mg/dl23.2 ± 2.727.4 ± 1.71.110.10Plasma creatinine, mg/dl0.2 ± 0.00.2 ± 0.01.000.50Plasma sodium, mm157 ± 13158 ± 111.000.94Plasma potassium, mm6.36 ± 0.737.46 ± 0.431.170.02aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Urinary excretionUrine, ml/mouse/day0.60 ± 0.050.44 ± 0.030.73<0.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Creatinine, mg/day0.29 ± 0.030.23 ± 0.070.790.20Sodium, mEq/day0.15 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.010.66<0.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Potassium, mEq/day0.24 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.020.63<0.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Chloride, mEq/day0.25 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.020.59<0.01aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.Calcium, mg/day0.10 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.010.720.02aStatistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.a Statistically significant differences between genotypes are p values <0.05.

The BP of B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ was reduced to normal levels after 21 days on the low salt diet, whereas that of wild-type mice did not change significantly (Fig. 2). The responses were similar in males and females. Under these conditions, no significant differences in urine volumes, creatinine, and electrolyte excretion were evident between transgenic and wild-type strains (Table 3). The association of salt-sensitive hypertension with low plasma renin activity, low plasma aldosterone concentrations, low urine output, and elevated plasma potassium is similar to the phenotype exhibited by genetically engineered mice that express a mutant form of the With No Lysine Kinase (WNK4) protein (30.Yang S.S. Morimoto T. Rai T. Chiga M. Sohara E. Ohno M. Uchida K. Lin S.H. Moriguchi T. Shibuya H. Kondo Y. Sasaki S.

This mutation of WNK4 is associated with a familial human disorder pseudo-hyperaldosteronism type 2 that leads to increased accumulation of the thiazide-sensitive NCC, which increases sodium uptake in the distal convoluted tubule.TABLE 3Urine chemistry on low salt dietExperiment 1Experiment 24A11−/−4A11+/+4A11−/−4A11+/+FemalesUrine, ml/mouse/day0.480.550.400.43Creatinine, mg/day0.190.270.160.19Sodium, mEq/day0.020.020.010.02Potassium, mEq/day0.140.180.150.16Chloride, mEq/day0.070.080.060.07Calcium, mg/day0.070.140.050.02MalesUrine, ml/mouse/day0.550.530.600.63Creatinine, mg/day0.200.210.160.21Sodium, mEq/day0.050.040.020.02Potassium, mEq/day0.150.160.150.18Chloride, mEq/day0.070.070.080.07Calcium, mg/day0.090.080.020.07 Open table in a new tab To test whether hypertension in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice on a normal salt diet is related to increased NCC activity, we treated mice with the NCC inhibitor hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). HCTZ normalized BP in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice but did not affect BP in wild-type mice (Fig. 3A), suggesting that increased NCC activity contributes to the observed hypertension. In contrast, treatment of mice with amiloride, which targets the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), did not alter BP in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ or wild-type mice (Fig. 3B). Estimation of NCC protein levels by immunoblotting revealed an ∼1.5-fold elevation of protein in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ kidneys relative to controls (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain of NCC has been suggested as a mechanism of NCC activation, and elimination of phosphorylation sites Ser-71, Thr-58, and Thr-53 prevented a response of NCC to intracellular chloride depletion (31.Pacheco-Alvarez D. Cristóbal P.S. Meade P. Moreno E. Vazquez N. Muñoz E. Díaz A. Juárez M.E. Giménez I. Gamba G. et al.The Na+:Cl− cotransporter is activated and phosphorylated at the amino-terminal domain upon intracellular chloride depletion.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28755-28763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Additional studies reported that phosphorylation at the Thr-58 residue is absolutely necessary for NCC activity, whereas Thr-53 and Ser-71 phosphorylation are additionally required for its full activity (32.Glover M. Zuber A.M. O'Shaughnessy K.M. et al.Renal and brain isoforms of WNK3 have opposite effects on NCCT expression.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To compare NCC phosphorylation status in wild-type and transgenic mice, antibodies were used that specifically recognize phosphorylation at residues Thr-53, Thr-58, Ser-71, or Ser-89, respectively (33.Sorensen M.V. Grossmann S. Roesinger M. Gresko N. Todkar A.P. Barmettler G. Ziegler U. Odermatt A. Loffing-Cueni D. Loffing J. et al.Rapid dephosphorylation of the renal sodium chloride cotransporter in response to oral potassium intake in mice.Kidney Int. 2013; 83: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting showed that phosphorylation of NCC was increased at all four residues in kidneys from B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice compared with wild-type (Fig. 4). As the ratio of pNCC to NCC remains constant (Fig. 4C), phosphorylated NCC increases in parallel with the abundance of total NCC protein in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice. Furthermore, the use of P450 4A inhibitor HET0016 attenuated the increase of total and phosphorylated NCC in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ mice without affecting wild-type mice (Fig. 5), suggesting an association of P450 4A activity with the increase in abundance of normally phosphorylated NCC protein. This increase does not appear to reflect elevated transcription because NCC mRNA levels remained unchanged in B-129/Sv-4A11+/+ compared with wild-type (p = 0.68, n = 10). The accumulation of NCC protein in transgenic animals could potentially be a consequence of decelerated turnover, which is similar to the effects of constitutively active WNK4 variants, which reduce NCC turnover by suppressing its ubiquitination (30.Yang S.S. Morimoto T. Rai T. Chiga M. Sohara E. Ohno M. Uchida K. Lin S.H. Moriguchi T. Shibuya H. Kondo Y. Sasaki S.

The present study evaluated the cytoprotective effect of the phytochemical on beta cells exposed to acute cell stress.Synthetically prepared PPAG was administered orally in mice treated with a single dose of streptozotocin to acutely induce beta cell death and hyperglycemia. Its effect was assessed on beta cell mass, proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Its cytoprotective effect was also studied in vitro on INS-1E beta cells and on human pancreatic islet cells.Treatment with the phytochemical PPAG protected beta cells during the first days after the insult against apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by TUNEL staining, and prevented loss of expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 in vivo. In vitro, PPAG protected INS-1E beta cells from streptozotocin-induced apoptosis and necrosis in a BCL2-dependent and independent way, respectively, depending on glucose concentration. PPAG also protected human pancreatic islet cells against the cytotoxic action of the fatty acid palmitate.These findings show the potential use of PPAG as phytomedicine which protects the beta cell mass exposed to acute diabetogenic stress."

https://openalex.org/W2421679523,"Objective A small number of patients frequently using the emergency department (ED) account for a disproportionate amount of the total ED workload and are considered using this service inappropriately. The aim of this study was to identify prospectively personal characteristics and experience of organizational and relational dimensions of primary care that predict frequent use of ED. Methods This study was conducted among parallel cohorts of the general population and primary care patients (N = 1,769). The measures were at baseline (T1), 12 (T2) and 24 months (T3): self-administered questionnaire on current health, health behaviours and primary care experience in the previous year. Use of medical services was confirmed using administrative databases. Mixed effect logistic regression modeling identified characteristics predicting frequent ED utilization. Results A higher likelihood of frequent ED utilization was predicted by lower socioeconomic status, higher disease burden, lower perceived organizational accessibility, higher number of reported healthcare coordination problems and not having a complete annual check-up, above and beyond adjustment for all independent variables. Conclusions Personal characteristics such as low socioeconomic status and high disease burden as well as experience of organizational dimensions of primary care such as low accessibility, high healthcare coordination problems and low comprehensiveness of care are prospectively associated with frequent ED utilization. Interventions developed to prevent inappropriate ED visits, such as case management for example, should tailor low socioeconomic status and patients with high disease burden and should aim to improve experience of primary care regarding accessibility, coordination and comprehensiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2422586284,"Increased effectiveness and reduced side effects are general goals in drug research, especially important in cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to design a long-circulating, activatable cytostatic drug that is completely producible in E. coli. Crucial for this goal was the novel unstructured polypeptide XTEN, which acts like polyethylene glycol (PEG) but has many important advantages. Most importantly, it can be produced in E. coli, is less immunogenic, and is biodegradable. We tested constructs containing a fragment of Killin as cytostatic/cytotoxic element, a cell-penetrating peptide, an MMP-2 cleavage site for specific activation, and XTEN for long blood circulation and deactivation of Killin. One of three sequence variants was efficiently expressed in E. coli. As typical for XTEN, it allowed efficient purification of the E. coli lysate by a heat step (10 min 75°C) and subsequent anion exchange chromatography using XTEN as purification tag. After 24 h XTEN-Killin reduced the number of viable cells of HT-1080 tumor cell line to 3.8 ±2.0% (p<0.001) compared to untreated controls. In contrast, liver derived non-tumor cells (BRL3A) did not show significant changes in viability. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of completely producing a complex protease-activatable, potentially long-circulating cytostatic/cytotoxic prodrug in E. coli-a concept that could lead to efficient production of highly multifunctional drugs in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2425108258,"A series of batch cultures were conducted to investigate the effects of oleic acid (OA) on in vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (IVDMD), gas production, methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) production, and proportion of fatty acids. Rumen fluid was collected from fistulated goats, diluted with incubation buffer, and then incubated with 500 mg Leymus chinensis meal supplemented with different amounts of OA (0, 20, 40, and 60 mg for the CON, OA20, OA40 and OA60 groups, respectively). Incubation was carried out anaerobically at 39°C for 48 h, and the samples were taken at 12, 24 and 48 h and subjected to laboratory analysis. Supplementation of OA decreased IVDMD, the cumulative gas production, theoretical maximum of gas production and CH4 production, but increased H2 production. However, no effect was observed on any parameters of rumen fermentation (pH, ammonia, production of acetate, propionate and butyrate and total volatile fatty acid production). The concentrations of some beneficial fatty acids, such as cis monounsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) were higher (P < 0.05) from OA groups than those from the control group at 12 h incubation. In summary, these results suggest that the OA supplementation in diet can reduce methane production and increase the amount of some beneficial fatty acids in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2429319696,"One standard treatment option for advanced-stage cancer is surgical resection of malignant tumors following by adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be applied if required. During the time course of treatments, patients are generally followed by computed tomography (CT) surveillance, and by tumor marker diagnosis. However, currently, early evidence of recurrence and/or metastasis of tumors with a clinically relevant biomarker remains a major therapeutic challenge. In particular, there has been no validated biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes in therapeutic settings. Recently, we have looked at glycoforms of serum α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) by using a crossed affinoimmunoelectrophoresis with two lectins and an anti-AGP antibody. The primary glycan structures of AGP were also analyzed by a mass spectrometer and a novel software in a large number of patients with various cancers. Accordingly, the relative abundance of α1,3fucosylated glycans in AGP (FUCAGP) was found to be significantly high in cancer patients as compared with the healthy controls. Further, strikingly elevated levels of FUCAGP were found in patients with poor prognosis but not in patients with good prognosis. In the current study, levels of FUCAGP in serum samples from various cancer patients were analyzed and 17 patients including 13 who had undergone chemotherapy were followed for several years post operation. FUCAGP level determined diligently by using a mass spectrometer was found to change along with disease prognosis as well as with responses to treatments, in particular, to various chemotherapies. Therefore, FUCAGP levels measured during following-up of the patients after operation appeared to be clinically relevant biomarker of treatment intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2425932829,"The aims of this study were 1) To evaluate retinal nerve fiber layer (fRNFL) thickness and ganglion cell layer plus inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness at the fovea in eyes affected with traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) compared with contralateral normal eyes, 2) to further evaluate these thicknesses within 3 weeks following trauma (defined as “early TON”), and 3) to investigate the relationship between these retinal layer thicknesses and visual function in TON eyes. Twenty-nine patients with unilateral TON were included. Horizontal and vertical spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the fovea were taken in patients with unilateral TON. The main outcome measure was thickness of the entire retina, fRNFL, and GCIPL in eight areas. Thickness of each retinal layer was compared between affected and unaffected eyes. The correlation between the thickness of each retinal layer and visual function parameters, including best corrected visual acuity, color vision, P100 latency, and P100 amplitude in visual evoked potential (VEP), mean deviation (MD) and visual field index (VFI) in Humphrey visual field analysis in TON eyes was analyzed. Thicknesses of the entire retina, fRNFL, and GCIPL in SD-OCT were significantly thinner (3–36%) in all measurement areas of TON eyes compared to those in healthy eyes (all p<0.05). Whereas, only GCIPL in the outer nasal, superior, and inferior areas was significantly thinner (5–10%) in the early TON eyes than that in the control eyes (all p<0.01). A significant correlation was detected between retinal layer thicknesses and visual function parameters including color vision, P100 latency and P100 amplitude in VEP, MD, and VFI (particularly P100 latency, MD, and VFI) (r = -0.70 to 0.84). Among the retinal layers analyzed in this study, GCIPL (particularly in the superior and inferior areas) was most correlated with these five visual function parameters (r = -0.70 to 0.71). Therefore, evaluation of morphological change of each retinal layer using SD-OCT can help in understanding TON pathophysiology and indirectly assessing visual function. Moreover, evaluation of the morphological change of the GCIPL in TON eyes may be useful to assess visual function in patients with early TON."

Yet, no data is available on the HIV care cascade for this population. This study aimed to assess the HIV care cascade among MSM newly diagnosed through innovative testing strategies in Rio de Janeiro. Data from 793 MSM and travestites/transgender women (transwomen) tested for HIV at a non-governmental LGBT organization and a mobile testing unit located at a gay friendly venue were analyzed. A 12-month-after-HIV-diagnosis-censored cohort was established using CD4, viral load and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) longitudinal data from those diagnosed with HIV. A cross-sectional HIV care cascade was built using this data. The relative risks of achieving each cascade-stage were estimated using generalized linear models according to age, self-declared skin-color, education, history of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), drug use and prior HIV testing. From Jan-2013 to Jan-2014, 793 MSM and transwomen were tested, 131 (16.5%) were HIV-infected. As of January 2015, 95 (72.5%) were linked to HIV care, 90 (68.7%) were retained in HIV care, 80 (61.1%) were on cART, and 50 (38.2%) were virally suppressed one year after HIV diagnosis. Being non-white (Relative risk [lower bound; upper bound of 95% confidence interval] = 1.709 [1.145; 2.549]) and having a prior HIV-test (1.954 [1.278; 2.986]) were associated with an HIV-positive diagnosis. A higher linkage (2.603 [1.091; 6.211]) and retention in care (4.510 [1.880; 10.822]) were observed among those who were older than 30 years of age. Using community-based testing strategies, we were able to access a high-risk MSM population and a small sample of transwomen. Despite universal care coverage and the test-and-treat policy adopted in Brazil, the MSM cascade of care indicates that strategies to increase linkage to care and prompt cART initiation targeted to these populations are critically needed. Interventions targeting non-white and young MSM should be prioritized."
https://openalex.org/W2436651704,"Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a disabling neuromuscular disease with no causal treatment available. This disease is caused by expanded CTG trinucleotide repeats in the 3′ UTR of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase gene. On the RNA level, expanded (CUG)n repeats form hairpin structures that sequester splicing factors such as muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1). Lack of available MBNL1 leads to misregulated alternative splicing of many target pre-mRNAs, leading to the multisystemic symptoms in DM1. Many studies aiming to identify small molecules that target the (CUG)n-MBNL1 complex focused on synthetic molecules. In an effort to identify new small molecules that liberate sequestered MBNL1 from (CUG)n RNA, we focused specifically on small molecules of natural origin. Natural products remain an important source for drugs and play a significant role in providing novel leads and pharmacophores for medicinal chemistry. In a new DM1 mechanism-based biochemical assay, we screened a collection of isolated natural compounds and a library of over 2100 extracts from plants and fungal strains. HPLC-based activity profiling in combination with spectroscopic methods were used to identify the active principles in the extracts. The bioactivity of the identified compounds was investigated in a human cell model and in a mouse model of DM1. We identified several alkaloids, including the β-carboline harmine and the isoquinoline berberine, that ameliorated certain aspects of the DM1 pathology in these models. Alkaloids as a compound class may have potential for drug discovery in other RNA-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2438333084,"Background & Objectives Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death for patients on chronic dialysis. End stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis imposed to reduce phosphorus intake, which likely contributes to development of vegetarian diet behaviors. Vegetarian diets are often lower in protein content, in contradiction to the recommendation that a high protein diet is followed by patients undergoing dialysis. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of a vegetarian diet on the nutritional and cardiovascular status of dialysis patients. Design, Setting, Participants, Measurements A study of 21 vegetarian dialysis patients and 42 age- and sex-matched non-vegetarian dialysis patients selected as controls was conducted in the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and biochemistry data including total homocysteine levels, serum lipid profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, vitamin D levels, albumin, and normalized protein catabolic rate were measured. Results Compared with the non-vegetarian control group, vegetarian subjects had lower body weight, body mass index, serum phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, vitamin D, uric acid, albumin, and normalized protein catabolic rate (p < 0.05). The vegetarian group showed higher brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity than the non-vegetarian group (1926.95 ± 456.45 and 1684.82 ± 309.55 cm/sec, respectively, p < 0.05). After adjustment for age, albumin, pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure, and duration of dialysis, vegetarian diet remained an independent risk factor for brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. Conclusions The present study revealed that patients on dialysis who follow vegetarian diets may experience subclinical protein malnutrition and vitamin D deficiency that could offset the beneficial cardiovascular effects of vegetarianism."

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of mtDNA rearrangement events in AD brain tissue.Postmortem frozen human brain cerebral cortex samples were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program, Sun City, AZ. Mitochondria were isolated and direct sequence by using MiSeq®, and analyzed by relative software.Three types of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangements have been seen in post mortem human brain tissue from patients with AD and age matched control. These observed rearrangements include a deletion, F-type rearrangement, and R-type rearrangement. We detected a high level of mtDNA rearrangement in brain tissue from cognitively normal subjects, as well as the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rate of rearrangements was calculated by dividing the number of positive rearrangements by the coverage depth. The rearrangement rate was significantly higher in AD brain tissue than in control brain tissue (17.9%versus 6.7%; p = 0.0052). Of specific types of rearrangement, deletions were markedly increased in AD (9.2% versus 2.3%; p = 0.0005).Our data showed that failure of mitochondrial DNA in AD brain might be important etiology of AD pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2404728155,"Exotic predators are a major threat to native wildlife in many parts of the world. Developing and implementing effective strategies to mitigate their effects requires robust quantitative data so that management can be evidence-based, yet in many ecosystems this is missing. Birds in particular have been severely impacted by exotic mammalian predators, and a plethora of studies on islands record predation of bird eggs, fledglings and adults by exotic species such as rodents, stoats and cats. By comparison, few studies have examined nest predation around mainland urban centres which often act as dispersal hubs, especially for commensal species such as rodents. Here, we experimentally examine nest predation rates in habitat patches with varying black rat (Rattus rattus) densities in Sydney, Australia and test whether these exotic rats have the effects expected of exotic predators using effect size benchmarks. In the case where black rats have replaced native Rattus spp., we expected that black rats, being more arboreal than native Rattus spp., would be a significant source of predation on birds because they can readily access the arboreal niche where many birds nest. We tested this idea using above-ground artificial nests to represent those of typical small bird species such as the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). We found that fewer eggs were depredated by rodents on sites where we removed black rats compared to unmanipulated sites, and that the effect size calculated from the total number of eggs surviving beyond the typical incubation period was similar to that expected for an exotic predator. Our results suggest that, although Australian birds have co-evolved with native Rattus species, in the case where black rats have replaced native Rattus species, exotic black rats appear to pose an additive source of predation on birds in remnant habitats, most likely due to their ability to climb more efficiently than their native counterparts. Management of these commensal rodents may be necessary to retain urban birdlife."

We present evidence herein that cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of Caenorhabditis elegans glycyl-tRNA synthetase (CeGlyRS) are encoded by the same gene (CeGRS1) through alternative initiation of translation. The cytoplasmic form possessed an N-terminal WHEP domain, whereas its mitochondrial isoform possessed an extra N-terminal sequence consisting of an mitochondrial targeting signal and an appended domain. Cross-species complementation assays showed that CeGRS1 effectively rescued the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial defects of a yeast GRS1 knock-out strain. Although both forms of CeGlyRS efficiently charged the cytoplasmic tRNAsGly of C. elegans, the mitochondrial form was much more efficient than its cytoplasmic counterpart in charging the mitochondrial tRNAGly isoacceptor, which carries a defective TψC hairpin. Despite the WHEP domain per se lacking tRNA binding activity, deletion of this domain reduced the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Most interestingly, the deletion mutant possessed a higher thermal stability and a somewhat lower structural flexibility. Our study suggests a role for the WHEP domain as a regulator of the dynamic structure and activity of the enzyme.

The resultant aminoacyl-tRNAs are then delivered to ribosomes to decipher mRNA codons through base pairing with the anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNA (1.Carter Jr., C.W. et al.Cognition, mechanism, and evolutionary relationships in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Annu.

Because protein translation takes place in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria in eukaryotes, two distinct sets of aaRSs are required: one functioning in the cytoplasm and the other functioning in mitochondria (1.Carter Jr., C.W. et al.Cognition, mechanism, and evolutionary relationships in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Annu.

In most cases, the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of an aaRS are encoded by two different nuclear genes.

As a result, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of an aaRS, for example yeast glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), possess essentially the same polypeptide sequence, except for a cleavable mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) attached at the N terminus of the mitochondrial precursor form. aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase cycloheximide 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 5-fluoroorotic acid glycyl-tRNA synthetase mitochondrial appended domain mitochondrial targeting signal yeast extract peptone glycerol Charcot-Marie-Tooth. GlyRS is one of the most intriguing aaRSs because of its divergent quaternary structure and evolutionary origin. Two distinct oligomeric structures of GlyRS exist: one with an α2 structure and the other with an α2β2 structure (10.Mazauric M.H. Reinbolt J. Lorber B. Ebel C. Keith G. Giegé R.

Even so, they possess the same signature motifs and are thus assigned to the same class (class II). To date, α2β2 enzymes exist only in bacteria and chloroplasts, but α2 enzymes are spread over all three domains of life. The major identity elements of tRNAGly reside in the discriminator base (N73), the top three base pairs of the acceptor stem (1:72, 2:71, and 3:70), and C35/C36 in the anticodon loop (4.Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. et al.Universal rules and idiosyncratic features in tRNA identity.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Among these identity elements, the discriminator base is of particular interest. It is a U in bacteria and an A in eukaryotic cytoplasm. In general, U73-containing tRNAGly pairs with an α2β2-type GlyRS enzyme, whereas A73-containing tRNAGly pairs with an α2-type GlyRS enzyme (15.Mazauric M.H. Keith G. Logan D. Kreutzer R. Giegé R.

However, this once-tight rule was broken by the discovery that Thermus thermophilus possesses a U73/α2 pair (15.Mazauric M.H. Keith G. Logan D. Kreutzer R. Giegé R.

J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 744-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GlyRS has attracted enormous attention over the past decade because of its implication in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, one of the most common inherited neurological disorders (16.Krajewski K.M. Lewis R.A. Fuerst D.R. Turansky C. Hinderer S.R. Garbern J. Kamholz J. Shy M.E. et al.Neurological dysfunction and axonal degeneration in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A.Brain. 2000; 123: 1516-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To date, 13 missense mutations of human GlyRS were shown to cause a dominant axonal form of CMT, also known as CMT type 2D (17.Antonellis A. Ellsworth R.E. Sambuughin N. Puls I. Abel A. Lee-Lin S.Q.

However, there is no direct causal relationship between loss of the primary function of the enzyme and CMT disease, because not all CMT-causing mutants possess impaired aminoacylation activity (19.Nangle L.A. Zhang W. Xie W. Yang X.L. Schimmel P. et al.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-associated mutant tRNA synthetases linked to altered dimer interface and neurite distribution defect.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11239-11244Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested that GlyRS mutations also cause a CMT-like syndrome in other animals such as mice (20.Achilli F.

There is only one GlyRS gene in the nuclear genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, namely, CeGRS1. Because mitochondrial tRNAs in this organism typically possess a defective TψC hairpin, the question arose as to how enzyme(s) encoded by this gene can efficiently charge such a tRNA species. Our study shows that CeGlyRS acquired two functional domains, a mitochondrial appended domain (MAD) and a WHEP domain, during evolution. The MAD enabled the enzyme to charge its cognate tRNA (containing a defective TψC hairpin) with a higher efficiency, whereas the WHEP domain contributed to regulating the dynamic structure of the enzyme. As a result, deletion of the WHEP domain altered the thermal stability, structural flexibility, and catalytic rate of the enzyme. These results provide new insights into understanding the structure-function relationships of CeGlyRS and its homologues. Analysis of the ORF of CeGRS1 suggested that this gene is dual functional, with ATG1 and ATG65 being the respective initiator codons of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of CeGlyRS (Fig. 1A). The mitochondrial form of CeGlyRS (CeGlyRSm) possessed a 64-residue polypeptide extension with a mitochondrial matrix-processing peptidase cleavage site in between N-terminal residues 20 and 21. The sequence containing N-terminal residues 1–20 was rich in positively charged and hydroxylated residues and was devoid of acidic residues, a feature characteristic of an MTS, and the sequence containing N-terminal residues 21–64 was specific to the mitochondrial form; this sequence is herein referred to as the MAD. The MAD was absent from all other eukaryotic GlyRS homologues shown herein. In contrast, the N-terminal domain (containing residues 1–66) of the cytoplasmic form of CeGlyRS (CeGlyRSc) shared high sequence identity (57–70% identity) with the WHEP domains of GlyRSs of Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, and Homo sapiens (Fig. 1B). Because only one GlyRS gene exists in the genome of C. elegans, one would normally assume that the identity elements must be strictly conserved between its nuclear and mitochondrial encoded tRNAsGly (CetRNAnGly and CetRNAmGly, respectively) so that CeGlyRS can efficiently charge both tRNA isoacceptors. As expected, the discriminator base A73 and C35/C36 in the anticodon loop were conserved in yeast and C. elegans tRNAnGly and tRNAmGly (Fig. 1C). However, contrary to our anticipation, the first three base pairs in the acceptor stem highly diverged among these tRNA isoacceptors, suggesting that they are not critical for recognition in these two eukaryotic organisms. In addition to differences identified in the acceptor stem, CetRNAmGly possessed a defective TψC hairpin, which prompted us to ask how CeGlyRS can effectively charge this tRNA. To test the functional potential of CeGRS1, we cloned the ORF of this gene or its derivatives into pADH and tested the ability of the resultant construct to rescue the growth defects of a yeast grs1− strain. As shown in Fig. 2, CeGlyRSm conferred a positive growth phenotype to the null allele on both 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) and YPG, suggesting that this construct can functionally substitute for the yeast GRS1 gene (row 3 in Fig. 2, A and B). This result also implied that a minor portion of the CeGlyRSm protein was retained in the cytoplasm for functioning, a scenario often seen in yeast aaRS complementation (22.Chang C.P. Chang C.Y. Lee Y.H. Lin Y.S. Wang C.C. et al.Divergent alanyl-tRNA synthetase genes of Vanderwaltozyma polyspora descended from a common ancestor through whole-genome duplication followed by asymmetric evolution.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 2242-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Deletion of the MTS alone or both the MTS and MAD specifically impaired its mitochondrial rescue activity; MTS-deleted mutants restored the growth phenotype of the knock-out strain on 5-FOA but not YPG (rows 4 and 5). Thus, the MTS was required for mitochondrial targeting of CeGlyRSm, and the MAD was dispensable for efficient aminoacylation of yeast tRNAnGly by CeGlyRS. Further deletion of the WHEP domain impaired both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial rescue activities (rows 6 and 8). As expected, attaching a heterologous MTS to CeGlyRSc yielded a fusion construct that could restore the growth phenotype of the knock-out strain on YPG (row 7), lending further support to the observation that the MAD is not required for efficient aminoacylation of yeast tRNAmGly by CeGlyRS. A Western blot analysis using an anti-His6 tag antibody showed that except for MTS-ΔWHEP, which was poorly expressed, all other CeGlyRS constructs used for cross-species rescue assays were properly expressed in yeast (rows 3–8 in Fig. 2C). Thus, ΔWHEP was much more stable in the cytoplasm than in mitochondria. We also noted that the processed CeGlyRSm was somewhat larger in size than its cytoplasmic counterpart CeGlyRSc (rows 3–5), suggesting that the MAD was not cleaved away from CeGlyRSm following its import into mitochondria. To check whether deletion of the WHEP domain affects the half-life of CeGlyRSc, we performed a cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay in yeast as previously described (23.Liao C.C. Lin C.H. Chen S.J. Wang C.C. et al.Trans-kingdom rescue of Gln-tRNAGln synthesis in yeast cytoplasm and mitochondria.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 9171-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Genes encoding CeGlyRSc and ΔWHEP were respectively cloned into pGAL1, and the resultant constructs were transformed into a S. cerevisiae strain, INVSc1. Cultures of the transformants were induced with galactose for 4 h, followed by the addition of CHX to terminate protein synthesis. CHX-treated cells were harvested at various intervals (0∼16 h) following induction. Protein extracts were prepared for Western blot analyses using an anti-His6 tag antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, both proteins were fairly stable; less than 20% of the proteins were degraded throughout the time period tested. Thus, deletion of the WHEP domain did not impair the stability of the protein in vivo. To map the subcellular localization of CeGlyRS and its derivatives in yeast, we carried out a fluorescence microscopic analysis. A DNA sequence that encodes the GFP was amplified by a PCR and inserted in-frame into the 3′ end of CeGlyRSm, CeGlyRSm(ΔMTS), and CeGlyRSc. We then transformed these GFP fusion constructs into the yeast knock-out strain and examined their subcellular distributions via fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, CeGlyRSm was predominantly confined to mitochondria, whereas CeGlyRSc was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm. Deletion of the MTS from CeGlyRSm redirected the protein to the cytoplasm. Because of the imaging technology resolution constraints, we could not rule out the possibility that a minor portion of the GFP fusion proteins targeted other unintended cellular compartments. Because deletion of the WHEP domain impaired the cross-species rescue activity of CeGlyRSc (Fig. 2), we next investigated whether and to what extent this deletion alters the protein's thermal stability in vitro. Pursuant to this objective, genes encoding CeGlyRS variants were transformed into Escherichia coli, and His6-tagged CeGlyRS proteins were purified to homogeneity through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Fig. 4A). Purified CeGlyRSc and ΔWHEP proteins were then subjected to CD spectrometry at 200–250 nm. As shown in Fig. 4B, CeGlyRSc retained most of its secondary structure (with high molar ellipticity values at 222 and 208 nm) at temperatures below 40 °C but lost much of its secondary structure when the temperature reached 50 °C or higher. In contrast, ΔWHEP retained most of its secondary structure even when the temperature reached 50 °C. The deletion mutant did not lose much of its secondary structure until the temperature reached 60 °C or higher (Fig. 4B). As a result, CeGlyRSc and ΔWHEP. respectively. had melting temperatures of ∼60 and ∼68 °C (Fig. 4C). Thus, deletion of the WHEP domain increased the thermal stability of the protein. To further study the effect of the deletion on the structural flexibility of CeGlyRSc, limited proteolysis was carried out with CeGlyRSc/trypsin in a ratio of 100:1. Limited proteolysis is often used to probe the structure and dynamics of proteins. Exposed regions such as loops and other flexible regions are more susceptible to the prolific protease. As shown in Fig. 4D, ΔWHEP was somewhat more resistant to the protease than was the WT. Approximately 80% of the WT protein was hydrolyzed after 2 h of protease treatment, and only ∼10% protein remained after 4 h of treatment. In contrast, ∼40% of the ΔWHEP protein remained after 4 h of treatment. This result suggests that the WT protein possessed a slightly more-flexible structure than did the deletion mutant. As mentioned above, CeGlyRS possesses two distinctive domains at its N terminus: MAD and WHEP. We were prompted to ask whether these two domains are involved in tRNA aminoacylation. Aminoacylation reactions were carried out at ambient temperature with 20 or 200 nm of enzyme and 5 μm of in vitro transcribed tRNAGly. Note that purified CeGlyRSm represents a mature form of CeGlyRSm (without MTS). As shown in Fig. 5A, CeGlyRSm and CeGlyRSc charged CetRNAnGly with a similarly high efficiency, suggesting that the MAD is dispensable for aminoacylation of CetRNAnGly. On the other hand, deletion of the WHEP domain from CeGlyRSc reduced its glycylation activity ∼3-fold, suggesting that the WHEP domain is somehow involved in this reaction (Fig. 5A). Although in vitro transcribed CetRNAmGly (lacking the entire T-arm) was a very poor substrate for glycylation (presumably because of a lack of modification at position 9 with 1-methyladenosine) (24.Sakurai M. Ohtsuki T. Watanabe K. et al.Modification at position 9 with 1-methyladenosine is crucial for structure and function of nematode mitochondrial tRNAs lacking the entire T-arm.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), CeGlyRSm was more efficient (at least 5-fold) than CeGlyRSc (and ΔWHEP) in charging this T-armless tRNA (Fig. 5B). These results together suggest that the MAD enhances aminoacylation of CetRNAmGly by CeGlyRSm and that the WHEP domain contributes to aminoacylation of CetRNAnGly by CeGlyRSc. Relative aminoacylation activities of CeGlyRSc and ΔWHEP at various temperatures were determined and shown in Fig. 5C. To take a closer look at the role of the WHEP domain in tRNA aminoacylation, kinetic parameters for aminoacylation of CetRNAnGly by CeGlyRSc and ΔWHEP were determined. As shown in Table 1, CeGlyRSc had a Km value of 0.24 μm for CetRNAnGly and a kcat value of 1.73 s−1, whereas ΔWHEP had a Km value of 0.21 μm for CetRNAnGly and a kcat value of 0.62 s−1. Thus, deletion of the WHEP domain had almost no effect on the apparent affinity of the enzyme for CetRNAnGly but reduced its catalytic rate 2.8 times. That is, CeGlyRSc possessed a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) 2.4 times higher than that of ΔWHEP. Similar results were obtained using yeast tRNAnGly as the substrate (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for aminoacylation of tRNAnGly by C. elegans GlyRS variantsCeGlyRS varianttRNAKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1μm−1 s−1CeGlyRScCetRNAnGly0.24 ± 0.091.73 ± 0.617.2ΔWHEPCetRNAnGly0.21 ± 0.100.62 ± 0.283.0CeGlyRScSctRNAnGly0.39 ± 0.131.92 ± 0.754.9ΔWHEPSctRNAnGly0.37 ± 0.140.51 ± 0.201.4 Open table in a new tab To test whether the WHEP domain itself binds tRNA, a DNA sequence encoding the WHEP domain was cloned into pET21, and the resultant construct was transformed into an E. coli strain, BL21(DE3), for expression. The recombinant WHEP domain (with a C-terminal His6 tag) was purified through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, and an affinity co-electrophoresis assay was carried out using CetRNAnGly as the ligand. Affinity co-electrophoresis is particularly useful for determining weak protein-nucleic acid interactions. As shown in Fig. 5D, whereas CeGlyRSc effectively bound tRNAnGly (with a Kd value of ∼4 μm), the purified WHEP domain failed to bind the tRNA even at high protein concentrations (up to 64 μm). This result is in agreement with the findings of the kinetic study shown in Table 1. Because deletion of the WHEP domain only reduced the aminoacylation efficiency (kcat/Km) of CeGlyRS for yeast tRNAGly 3.5-fold (Table 1), we wondered whether the deletion mutant could be made a functional yeast enzyme in vivo by overexpression from a stronger promoter. To this end, a DNA sequence encoding ΔWHEP was cloned into pTEF1 (with a strong TEF1 promoter), and the ability of the resultant construct to rescue the growth defects of the yeast GRS1 knock-out strain was tested. As shown in Fig. 6A, ΔWHEP, overexpressed from a TEF1 promoter, successfully restored the growth phenotype of the knock-out strain on 5-FOA, but not on YPG (row 3). Attaching a heterologous MTS to ΔWHEP failed to yield a functional yeast mitochondrial enzyme (row 4). Western blotting results showed that MTS-ΔWHEP had an expression level much lower than that of its counterpart without an MTS, i.e. ΔWHEP, in yeast (Fig. 6B, left panel), regardless of the promoters used. This may have been the reason why MTS-ΔWHEP failed to provide sufficient glycylation activity in yeast mitochondria (Figs. 2, 6). We also found that the TEF1 promoter used was ∼12-fold stronger than the ADH promoter used (Fig. 6B, right panel). Based on the modular organization of aaRSs, it is widely accepted that modern aaRSs descended from successive additions of new domains to the catalytic core (25.Jakubowski H. et al.Quality control in tRNA charging.Wiley Interdiscip Rev. RNA. 2012; 3: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, primitive aaRSs possessed only a minimal core capable of activating amino acids. New domains were later recruited to the catalytic core, forming a larger aaRS capable of recognizing an ancient tRNA with a structure mimicking the existing tRNA acceptor stem. These early tRNA-aaRS pairs continued to grow through additions of the anticodon stem-loop structure and anticodon-binding domain to yield contemporary tRNAs and aaRSs. Other functional domains, such as the editing, protein-interacting, and auxiliary tRNA-binding domains, were later recruited by aaRSs to facilitate their translation efficiencies (25.Jakubowski H. et al.Quality control in tRNA charging.Wiley Interdiscip Rev. RNA. 2012; 3: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The MAD and WHEP domain of CeGlyRS are probably among such examples (Fig. 5). However, some domains recruited by aaRSs are unrelated to their primary functions. Such domains often confer noncanonical functions, such as transcriptional regulation, translational regulation, mitochondrial RNA splicing, and cytokine-like activity, to the aaRSs (26.Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. et al.Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases: a family of expanding functions.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to serving as an intracellular translation enzyme, human GlyRS also circulates in serum and acts as a component of the innate defense system against ERK-activated tumorigenesis (27.Park M.C. Kang T. Jin D. Han J.M. Kim S.B. Park Y.J. Cho K. Park Y.W. Guo M. He W. Yang X.L. Schimmel P.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: E640-E647Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in human GlyRS are known to cause an axonal form of CMT disease. A recent study further demonstrated that several CMT-associated GlyRS mutants can competitively block binding of the VEGF to its membrane receptor, Nrp1, leading to impaired motor neuron migration (28.He W.

WHEP domains exist as single domains in higher eukaryotic TrpRS, HisRS, GlyRS, and MetRS and as multiple repeated domains in Glu-ProRS, but they do not exist in any non-aaRS proteins (29.Ray P.S.

In contrast, the single WHEP domain of CeGlyRS appears to participate in regulating the dynamic structure of the enzyme, a feature somewhat similar to its human homologue (31.He W. Zhang H.M. Chong Y.E. Guo M. Marshall A.G. Yang X.L. et al.Dispersed disease-causing neomorphic mutations on a single protein promote the same localized conformational opening.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 12307-12312Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Deletion of this domain had no discernible effect on the tRNA binding of the enzyme (Table 1) but substantially affected its catalytic efficiency, thermal stability, and structural flexibility (FIGURE 4., FIGURE 5.). Because all WHEP-containing GlyRS enzymes possess a similar protein sequence and domain organization (Fig. 1), the WHEP domains may play a similar role in these homologues. Cloning of the CeGRS1 gene or its derivatives into pADH (a high copy number yeast shuttle vector with a constitutive ADH promoter), pTEF1 (a high copy number yeast shuttle vector with a constitutive TEF1 promoter), or pET21b (an E. coli expression vector with a T7 promoter) followed the protocol described earlier. Briefly, a cDNA sequence containing an ORF of CeGlyRSm (1–2226 bp) was amplified by RT-PCR as an EagI-NdeI fragment using a pair of gene-specific primers. The PCR-amplified fragment was digested with EagI and NdeI and then cloned into the EagI/NdeI sites of pADH. Cloning of genes encoding various truncated forms of CeGlyRSm followed a similar protocol. To fuse a heterologous MTS to CeGlyRSc (or its derivatives), a DNA sequence encoding amino acid residues 1–46 of the mitochondrial precursor form of yeast valyl-tRNA synthetase was amplified by a PCR as an EagI-EagI fragment and was inserted at the 5′ end of the ORF of CeGlyRSc. To fuse the GFP to CeGlyRSc (or its derivatives), a DNA sequence encoding the GFP was amplified by a PCR as an XhoI-XhoI fragment and then inserted at the 3′ end of the ORF of CeGlyRSc. The yeast GRS1 knock-out strain RJT3/II-1 was previously described (32.Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. et al.One of two genes encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides mitochondrial and cytoplasmic functions.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We carried out a complementation assay for cytoplasmic GlyRS activity by introducing a test plasmid carrying the target gene and a LEU2 marker into RJT3/II-1 and determining the ability of the transformants to grow in the presence of 5-FOA. Starting from a cell density of 1.0 A600, cell cultures were 3-fold serially diluted, and 10-μl aliquots of each dilution were spotted onto designated plates containing 5-FOA. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Transformants ejected the maintenance plasmid (which carried the WT ScGRS1 gene) with a URA3 marker in the presence of 5-FOA and thus could not grow on 5-FOA plates unless the test plasmid encoded a functional cytoplasmic GlyRS. The yeast GRS1 knock-out strain RJT3/II-1 was cotransformed with a test plasmid (which carried a LEU2 marker) and a second maintenance plasmid (which carried a TRP1 marker and only expressed the cytoplasmic form of ScGlyRS). In the presence of 5-FOA, the first maintenance plasmid (carrying a URA3 marker) was evicted from the cotransformants, and the second maintenance plasmid was retained. Thus, all cotransformants could survive 5-FOA selection because of the presence of the cytoplasmic ScGlyRS derived from the second maintenance plasmid. The mitochondrial phenotypes of the cotransformants were further tested on YPG plates at 30 °C, with results documented on day 3 following plating. Because a yeast cell cannot survive on glycerol (a nonfermentable carbon source) without functional mitochondria, the cotransformants did not grow on the YPG plates unless the test plasmid encoded a functional mitochondrial GlyRS. Yeast cells were grown to ∼0.6 A600 in SD/−Leu selective medium. We pretreated cells with DAPI (0.5 μg/ml) or MitoTracker (300 nm) for 30 min. Fluorescence microscopy (Axio observer.A1; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was then used to examine samples with a 100× objective at 25 °C, and images were captured with a CCD camera (Axiocam MRm; Carl Zeiss). Nuclear and mitochondrial tracks and merged images were generated with AxioVision Rel. 4.8 software and then subjected to two-dimensional deconvolution with AutoQuant X2. Aminoacylation reactions were carried out at ambient temperature in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μm tRNAGly, and 20 μm glycine (2 μm [3H]glycine; Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). The specific activity of [3H]glycine used was 35.0 Ci/mmol. The final concentration of the enzymes used in the reactions was 20 nm (unless otherwise indicated). The reactions were quenched by spotting 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture onto Whatman filters (Maidstone, Kent, UK) soaked in 5% TCA and 2 mm glycine. Filters were washed three times for 15 min each in ice-cold 5% TCA before liquid scintillation counting. The data were obtained from three independent experiments and averaged. Kinetic parameters for aminoacylation of tRNA by purified enzymes were determined by directly fitting the data points to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Initial rates of aminoacylation were determined at 25 °C with tRNAGly concentrations ranging 1–20 μm and enzyme concentrations ranging 10–200 nm. The data were obtained from three independent experiments and averaged. In vitro transcribed CetRNAnGly was labeled with 32P using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) after dephosphorylation with calf intestine phosphatase. The recombinant WHEP domain was 2-fold serially diluted and mixed with a 5% polyacrylamide solution, forming a mini gel matrix with a protein gradient of 1–64 μm. 32P-Labeled tRNA was loaded into each well at an estimated concentration of 1 nm in 2-μl aliquots. The gel was run in buffer containing 1× TBE (90 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA) and 50 mm NaCl at 20 °C at 50 V for 1 h. After electrophoresis, the gel was vacuum-dried and then exposed to x-ray film.

https://openalex.org/W2434833552,"Many genetic variants have been linked to familial or sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD), among which those identified in PARK16, BST1, SNCA, LRRK2, GBA and MAPT genes have been demonstrated to be the most common risk factors worldwide. Moreover, complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions have been highlighted in PD pathogenesis. Compared to studies focusing on the predisposing effects of genes, there is a relative lack of research investigating how these genes and their interactions influence the clinical profiles of PD. In a cohort consisting of 2,011 Chinese Han PD patients, we selected 9 representative variants from the 6 above-mentioned common PD genes to analyze their main and epistatic effects on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage of PD. With multiple linear regression models adjusting for medication status, disease duration, gender and age at onset, none of the variants displayed significant main effects on UPDRS or the H-Y scores. However, for gene-gene interaction analyses, 7 out of 37 pairs of variants showed significant or marginally significant associations with these scores. Among these, the GBA rs421016 (L444P)×LRRK2 rs33949390 (R1628P) interaction was consistently significant in relation to UPDRS III and UPDRS total (I+II+III), even after controlling for the family-wise error rate using False Discovery Rate (FDR-corrected p values are 0.0481 and 0.0070, respectively). Although the effects of the remaining pairs of variants did not survive the FDR correction, they showed marginally significant associations with either UPDRS or the H-Y stage (raw p<0.05). Our results highlight the importance of epistatic effects of multiple genes on the determination of PD clinical profiles and may have implications for molecular classification and personalized intervention of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2443677971,"Background and aims MELD allocation system has changed the clinical consequences on waiting list (WL) for LT, but its impact on mortality has been seldom studied. We aimed to assess the ability of MELD and other prognostic scores to predict mortality after LT. Methods 301 consecutive patients enlisted for LT were included, and prioritized within WL by using the MELD-score according to: hepatic insufficiency (HI), refractory ascites (RA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The analysis was performed to predict early mortality after LT (8 weeks). Results Patients were enlisted as HI (44.9%), RA (19.3%) and HCC (35.9%). The major aetiologies of liver disease were HCV (45.5%). Ninety-four patients (31.3%) were excluded from WL, with no differences among the three groups (p = 0.23). The remaining 207 patients (68.7%) underwent LT, being HI the most frequent indication (42.5%). HI patients had the shortest length within WL (113.6 days vs 215.8 and 308.9 respectively; p<0.001), but the highest early post-LT mortality rates (18.2% vs 6.8% and 6.7% respectively; p<0.001). The independent predictors of early post-LT mortality in the HI group were higher bilirubin (OR = 1.08; p = 0.038), increased iMELD (OR = 1.06; p = 0.046) and non-alcoholic cirrhosis (OR = 4.13; p = 0.017). Among the prognostic scores the iMELD had the best predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.66), which was strengthened in non-alcoholic cirrhosis (AUC = 0.77). Conclusion Patients enlisted due to HI had the highest early post-LT mortality rates despite of the shortest length within WL. The iMELD had the best accuracy to predict early post-LT mortality in patients with HI, and thus it may benefit the WL management."
https://openalex.org/W2441453377,"Recent epidemiological studies reported an association between maternal intake of acetaminophen (APAP) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in their children. However, none of these studies demonstrated causality. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to APAP during pregnancy result in hyperkinetic dysfunctions in offspring, using a murine model.Pregnant CD1 mice (N = 8/group) were allocated to receive by gavage either APAP (150 mg/kg/day, equivalent to the FDA-approved maximum human clinical dose), or 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (control group), starting on embryonic day 7 until delivery. Maternal serum APAP and alanine transaminase (ALT) concentrations were determined by ELISA and kinetic colorimetric assays, respectively. Open field locomotor activity (LMA) in the 30-day old mouse offspring was quantified using Photobeam Activity System. Mouse offspring were then sacrificed, whole brains processed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 11.7 Tesla magnet) and for neuronal quantification using Nissl stain. The association between APAP exposure and LMA in mouse offspring was analyzed using a mixed effects Poisson regression model that accounted for mouse offspring weight, gender, random selection, and testing time and day. We corrected for multiple comparisons and considered P<0.008 as statistically significant.Maternal serum APAP concentration peaked 30 minutes after gavage, reaching the expected mean of 117 μg/ml. Serum ALT concentrations were not different between groups. There were no significant differences in vertical (rearing), horizontal, or total locomotor activity between the two rodent offspring groups at the P level fixed to adjust for multiple testing. In addition, no differences were found in volumes of 29 brain areas of interest on MRI or in neuronal quantifications between the two groups.This study refutes that hypothesis that prenatal exposure to APAP causes hyperkinetic dysfunction in mouse offspring. Due to lack of accurate assessment of ADHD in murine models, our results should be taken with caution when compared to the reported clinical data."
https://openalex.org/W2428704200,"Introduction The World Health Organization has solicited rapid and minimally invasive techniques to facilitate scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). Study design Non-blinded randomized controlled field trial with 2:1 allocation ratio. Participants 75 adult male volunteers. Setting Outpatient primary care clinic. Intervention Open surgical circumcision under local anesthetic with suturing vs. Unicirc disposable instrument under topical anesthetic and wound sealing with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Primary Outcome Intraoperative duration. Secondary Outcomes Intraoperative and postoperative pain; adverse events; time to healing; patient satisfaction; cosmetic result. Results The intraoperative time was less with the Unicirc technique (median 12 vs. 25 min, p < 0.001). Wound healing and cosmetic results were superior in the Unicirc group. Adverse events were similar in both groups. Conclusions VMMC with Unicirc under topical anesthetic and wound sealing with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive is rapid, heals by primary intention with superior cosmetic results, and is potentially safer and more cost-effective than open surgical VMMC.

https://openalex.org/W2430786159,"Pupillary light reflex (PLR) is an important clinical tool to assess the integrity of visual pathways. The available evidence suggests that melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) mediate PLR—driven by the classical photoreceptors (rods and cones) at low irradiances and by melanopsin activation at high irradiances. However, genetic or pharmacological elimination of melanopsin does not completely abolish PLR at high irradiances, raising the possibility that classical photoreceptors may have a role even at high irradiances. Using an inducible mouse model of photoreceptor degeneration, we asked whether classical photoreceptors are responsible for PLR at all irradiances, and found that the PLR was severely attenuated at all irradiances. Using multiple approaches, we show that the residual PLR at high irradiances in this mouse was primarily from the remnant rods and cones, with a minor contribution from melanopsin activation. In contrast, in rd1 mouse where classical photoreceptor degeneration occurs during development, the PLR was absent at low irradiances but intact at high irradiances, as reported previously. Since mRGCs receive inputs from classical photoreceptors, we also asked whether developmental loss of classical photoreceptors as in rd1 mouse leads to compensatory takeover of the high-irradiance PLR by mRGCs. Specifically, we looked at a distinct subpopulation of mRGCs that express Brn3b transcription factor, which has been shown to mediate PLR. We found that rd1 mouse had a significantly higher proportion of Brn3b-expressing M1 type of mRGCs than in the inducible model. Interestingly, inducing classical photoreceptor degeneration during development also resulted in a higher proportion of Brn3b-expressing M1 cells and partially rescued PLR at high irradiances. These results suggest that classical photoreceptors are primarily responsible for PLR at all irradiances, while melanopsin activation makes a minor contribution at very high irradiances."

Urinary calculus formation is highly variable and while certain risk factors such as age, gender, seasonality, anatomic abnormality, and metabolic diseases have been identified, not much is known regarding the association of environmental factors such as lunar phases on renal colic. We conducted a retrospective study to test the hypothesis that full moon phase is an environmental factor associated for increased emergency department (ED) visits for renal colic due to ureteral calculus.We analyzed 559 renal colic diagnoses by the ED at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in a 24-month period and compared them with corresponding lunar phases as well as supermoon events. The lunar phases were defined as full moon ± two days, new moon ± two days, and the days in-between as normal days according to the lunar calendar. Supermoon event dates were obtained from NASA.90 cases (16.1%) were diagnosed during full moon phase, 89 cases (15.9%) were diagnosed during new moon phase, and 380 cases (68.0%) were diagnosed during normal days. The incidence of renal colic showed no statistically significant association with lunar phases or supermoon events.In this retrospective longitudinal study with adequate power, neither full moon phase nor supermoon event exhibited an association with increased renal colic diagnoses due to ureteral calculus by the ED at the University of Nebraska Medical Center."
https://openalex.org/W2421416263,"Purpose To determine whether and how the patterns of breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) changed along with time periods. Methods We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry to identify 228209 female patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1990 and 2000 (cohort 1 [C1], 112981) and between 2001 and 2005 (cohort 2 [C2], 115228). BCSM was compared in two cohorts using Cox proportional hazard regression models. We analysed the relative hazard ratios (HRs) and absolute BCSM rates by flexible parametric survival modelling. Results The patterns of BCSM were similar between the two cohorts, with the peak of mortality presenting in the first 2–3 years after diagnosis, and mortality rate significantly decreased in C2 in all cases. In C2, the annual BCSM rate of all cases was 9.64 (per 1000 persons per year) in year 10 with a peak rate of 23.34 in year 2. In ER-negative and high-risk patients, marked survival improvements were achieved mostly in the first 5 years, while in ER-positive and low-risk patients, survival improvements were less but constant up to 10 years. Conclusion There has been a significant improvement of BCSM with substantially decreased mortality within 5 years. The current pattern of BCSM and its changing feature differs according to ER status. Our findings have some clinical implications both for treatment decisions and adjuvant treatment trial design."
https://openalex.org/W2422618829,"Anthrax is a continuous threat in China, especially in rural regions. In July 2015, an anthrax outbreak occurred in Xifeng County, Liaoning Province. A total of 10 cutaneous anthrax cases were reported, with 210 people under medical observation. In this study, the general characteristics of human anthrax outbreak occurred in Liaoning Province were described, and all cases were caused by butchering and contacting sick animal. Meanwhile, the phylogenetic relationship between outbreak-related isolates/samples of the year 2015 and previous Bacillus anthracis strains was analyzed by means of canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms (canSNP), multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers and single-nucleotide repeats (SNR) analysis. There are two canSNP subgroups found in Liaoning, A.Br.001/002 and A.Br.Ames, and a total of six MLVA 15 genotypes and five SNR genotypes were observed. The strain collected from anthrax outbreak in Xifeng County in 2015 was classified as A.Br.001/002 subgroup and identified as MLVA15-29 genotype, with same SNR profile (CL10: 17, CL12: 15, CL33: 29, and CL35: 13). So we conclude that the same clone of B.anthracis caused the anthrax outbreak in Xifeng County in 2015, and this clone is different to previous isolates. Strengthening public health education in China is one of the most important measures to prevent and control anthrax."
https://openalex.org/W2434848989,"Lack of intra-operative haptic information during robotic surgery increases the risk for unintended tissue overload and damage. Knowledge about the acute and chronic fundamental relationship between force load and induced damage in healthy and diseased arteries is crucial to enable intra-operative haptic feedback or shared autonomy and improve patient safety.Arteries of wildtype and atherosclerotic mice were clamped in vivo for 2 minutes (0.0N, 0.6N or 1.27N). Histological analysis (Verhoeff's-Van Gieson, Osteopontin, CD45, CD105) was performed immediately, or after 6 hours, 2 weeks or 1 month. Endothelium-dependent and-independent vasodilatation was assessed immediately or 1 month after clamping.Endothelium dependent vasodilatation is worse after clamping of wildtype arteries, but is restored after one month. Clamping also results in flattening of the innermost elastic membrane of both genotypes, which is reversed over time for wildtype arteries but not for vessels from atherosclerotic mice. Higher osteopontin content in wildtype and LDLR-/- mice after 2 weeks suggests a phenotypic switch of the medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), an effect that is reversed after 1 month. While inflammation in the intima diminishes, medial CD45 content rises through time in both genotypes. CD105 staining shows that even manipulation without clamping results in endothelial cell loss in both LDLR+/+ and LDLR-/- mice.Arterial clamping induces different acute and long-term injury to the vessel wall of atherosclerotic and healthy arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2441032907,"Malaria infected erythrocytes show increased permeability to a number of solutes important for parasite growth as mediated by the Plasmodial Surface Anion Channel (PSAC). The P. falciparum clag3 genes have recently been identified as key determinants of PSAC, though exactly how they contribute to channel function and whether additional host/parasite proteins are required remain unknown. To begin to answer these questions, I have taken a biochemical approach. Here I have used an epitope-tagged CLAG3 parasite to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments using membrane fractions of infected erythrocytes. Native PAGE and mass spectrometry studies reveal that CLAG3 participate in at least three different high molecular weight complexes: a ~720kDa complex consisting of CLAG3, RHOPH2 and RHOPH3; a ~620kDa complex consisting of CLAG3 and RHOPH2; and a ~480kDa complex composed solely of CLAG3. Importantly, these complexes can be found throughout the parasite lifecycle but are absent in untransfected controls. Extracellular biotin labeling and protease susceptibility studies localize the 480kDa complex to the erythrocyte membrane. This complex, likely composed of a homo-oligomer of 160kDa CLAG3, may represent a functional subunit, possibly the pore, of PSAC."
https://openalex.org/W2439448719,"A network is considered observable if its current state can be determined in finite time from knowledge of the observed states. The observability transitions in networks based on random or degree-correlated sensor placement have recently been studied. However, these placement strategies are predominantly based on local information regarding the network. In this paper, to understand the phase transition process of network observability, we analyze the network observability transition for a betweenness-based sensor placement strategy, in which sensors are placed on nodes according to their betweenness. Using numerical simulations, we compute the size of the network's largest observable component (LOC) and compare the observability transitions for different sensor placements. We find that betweenness-based sensor placement can generate a larger LOC in the observability transition than the random or degree-based placement strategy in both model and real networks. This finding may help to understand the relationship between network observability and the topological properties of the network."
https://openalex.org/W2436096724,"With the increasing penetration of power electronic equipment in modern residential distribution systems, harmonics mitigation through the distributed generation (DG) interfacing converters has received significant attention. Among recently proposed methods, the so-called active resonance damper (ARD) and harmonic voltage compensator (HVC) based on voltage detection can effectively reduce the harmonic distortions in selected areas of distribution systems. However, it is found out that when traditional ARD algorithm is used to eliminate harmonic current injected by non-linear loads, its performance is constrained by stability problems and can at most eliminate half of the load harmonic currents. Thus, inspired by the duality between ARD and HVC, this paper presents a novel improved resistive active power filter (R-APF) algorithm based on integral-decoupling control. The design guideline for its parameters is then investigated through carefully analyzing the closed-loop poles' trajectory. Computer studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate the load harmonic currents and its performance is much better than traditional ARD based on proportional control."
https://openalex.org/W2444379541,"The usefulness and the utility of the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology are based on the assumption that the DNA or cDNA cleavage required to generate short sequence reads is random. Several previous reports suggest the existence of sequencing bias of NGS reads. To address this question in greater detail, we analyze NGS data from four organisms with different GC content, Plasmodium falciparum (19.39%), Arabidopsis thaliana (36.03%), Homo sapiens (40.91%) and Streptomyces coelicolor (72.00%). Using machine learning techniques, we recognize the pattern that the NGS read start is positioned in the local region where the nucleotide distribution is dissimilar from the global nucleotide distribution. We also demonstrate that the mono-nucleotide distribution underestimates sequencing bias, and the recognized pattern is explained largely by the distribution of multi-nucleotides (di-, tri-, and tetra- nucleotides) rather than mono-nucleotides. This implies that the correction of sequencing bias needs to be performed on the basis of the multi-nucleotide distribution. Providing companion software to quantify the effect of the recognized pattern on read positioning, we exemplify that the bias correction based on the mono-nucleotide distribution may not be sufficient to clean sequencing bias."
