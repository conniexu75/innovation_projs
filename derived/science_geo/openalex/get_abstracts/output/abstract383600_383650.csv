This species exhibits slow growth, low nutritional requirements, and hardiness in many habitats. It belongs to the taxonomic group of dairy propionibacteria, in contrast to the cutaneous species P. acnes. The genome of the type strain, P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii CIRM-BIA1 (CIP 103027T), was sequenced with an 11-fold coverage. Methodology/Principal Findings The circular chromosome of 2.7 Mb of the CIRM-BIA1 strain has a GC-content of 67% and contains 22 different insertion sequences (3.5% of the genome in base pairs). Using a proteomic approach, 490 of the 2439 predicted proteins were confirmed. The annotation revealed the genetic basis for the hardiness of P. freudenreichii, as the bacterium possesses a complete enzymatic arsenal for de novo biosynthesis of aminoacids and vitamins (except panthotenate and biotin) as well as sequences involved in metabolism of various carbon sources, immunity against phages, duplicated chaperone genes and, interestingly, genes involved in the management of polyphosphate, glycogen and trehalose storage. The complete biosynthesis pathway for a bifidogenic compound is described, as well as a high number of surface proteins involved in interactions with the host and present in other probiotic bacteria. By comparative genomics, no pathogenicity factors found in P. acnes or in other pathogenic microbial species were identified in P. freudenreichii, which is consistent with the Generally Recognized As Safe and Qualified Presumption of Safety status of P. freudenreichii. Various pathways for formation of cheese flavor compounds were identified: the Wood-Werkman cycle for propionic acid formation, amino acid degradation pathways resulting in the formation of volatile branched chain fatty acids, and esterases involved in the formation of free fatty acids and esters. Conclusions/Significance With the exception of its ability to degrade lactose, P. freudenreichii seems poorly adapted to dairy niches. This genome annotation opens up new prospects for the understanding of the P. freudenreichii probiotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2051216049,"The deletion of phenylalanine 508 in the first nucleotide binding domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is directly associated with >90% of cystic fibrosis cases. This mutant protein fails to traffic out of the endoplasmic reticulum and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome. The effects of this mutation may be partially reversed by the application of exogenous osmolytes, expression at low temperature, and the introduction of second site suppressor mutations. However, the specific steps of folding and assembly of full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) directly altered by the disease-causing mutation are unclear. To elucidate the effects of the ΔF508 mutation, on various steps in CFTR folding, a series of misfolding and suppressor mutations in the nucleotide binding and transmembrane domains were evaluated for effects on the folding and maturation of the protein. The results indicate that the isolated NBD1 responds to both the ΔF508 mutation and intradomain suppressors of this mutation. In addition, identification of a novel second site suppressor of the defect within the second transmembrane domain suggests that ΔF508 also effects interdomain interactions critical for later steps in the biosynthesis of CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W2131512287,"Single molecule observation in cells and tissue allows the analysis of physiological processes with molecular detail, but it still represents a major methodological challenge. Here we introduce a microscopic technique that combines light sheet optical sectioning microscopy and ultra sensitive high-speed imaging. By this approach it is possible to observe single fluorescent biomolecules in solution, living cells and even tissue with an unprecedented speed and signal-to-noise ratio deep within the sample. Thereby we could directly observe and track small and large tracer molecules in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility to visualize the dynamics of single tracer molecules and native messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in salivary gland cell nuclei of Chironomus tentans larvae up to 200 µm within the specimen with an excellent signal quality. Thus single molecule light sheet based fluorescence microscopy allows analyzing molecular diffusion and interactions in complex biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1975763568,"Fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are key pathways involved in cellular energetics. Reducing equivalents from FAO enter OXPHOS at the level of complexes I and III. Genetic disorders of FAO and OXPHOS are among the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism. Patients with deficiencies of either FAO or OXPHOS often show clinical and/or biochemical findings indicative of a disorder of the other pathway. In this study, the physical and functional interactions between these pathways were examined. Extracts of isolated rat liver mitochondria were subjected to blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BNGE) to separate OXPHOS complexes and supercomplexes followed by Western blotting using antisera to various FAO enzymes. Extracts were also subjected to sucrose density centrifugation and fractions analyzed by BNGE or enzymatic assays. Several FAO enzymes co-migrated with OXPHOS supercomplexes in different patterns in the gels. When palmitoyl-CoA was added to the sucrose gradient fractions containing OXPHOS supercomplexes in the presence of potassium cyanide, cytochrome c was reduced. Cytochrome c reduction was completely blocked by myxothiazol (a complex III inhibitor) and 3-mercaptopropionate (an inhibitor of the first step of FAO), but was only partially inhibited by rotenone (a complex I inhibitor). Although palmitoyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA provided reducing equivalents to OXPHOS-containing supercomplex fractions, no accumulation of their intermediates was detected. In contrast, short branched acyl-CoA substrates were not metabolized by OXPHOS-containing supercomplex fractions. These data provide evidence of a multifunctional FAO complex within mitochondria that is physically associated with OXPHOS supercomplexes and promotes metabolic channeling."

In this study, we showed that progranulin-deficient mice displayed increased depression- and disinhibition-like behavior, as well as deficits in social recognition from a relatively young age. These mice did not have any deficit in locomotion or exploration. Eighteen-month-old progranulin-deficient mice demonstrated impaired spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze. In addition to behavioral deficits, progranulin-deficient mice showed a progressive development of neuropathology from 12 mo of age, including enhanced activation of microglia and astrocytes and ubiquitination and cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43. Thus, progranulin deficiency induced FTD-like behavioral and neuropathological deficits. These mice may serve as an important tool for deciphering underlying mechanisms in frontotemporal dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2094788591,"Background Therapies directed at augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activities in vivo as a systemic treatment for autoimmune disorders and transplantation may be associated with significant off-target effects, including a generalized immunosuppression that may compromise beneficial immune responses to infections and cancer cells. Adoptive cellular therapies using purified expanded Tregs represents an attractive alternative to systemic treatments, with results from animal studies noting increased therapeutic potency of antigen-specific Tregs over polyclonal populations. However, current methodologies are limited in terms of the capacity to isolate and expand a sufficient quantity of endogenous antigen-specific Tregs for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, FOXP3+ Tregs fall largely within the CD4+ T cell subset and are thus routinely MHC class II-specific, whereas class I-specific Tregs may function optimally in vivo by facilitating direct tissue recognition. Methodology/Principal Findings To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel means for generating large numbers of antigen-specific Tregs involving lentiviral T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer into in vitro expanded polyclonal natural Treg populations. Tregs redirected with a high-avidity class I-specific TCR were capable of recognizing the melanoma antigen tyrosinase in the context of HLA-A*0201 and could be further enriched during the expansion process by antigen-specific reactivation with peptide loaded artificial antigen presenting cells. These in vitro expanded Tregs continued to express FOXP3 and functional TCRs, and maintained the capacity to suppress conventional T cell responses directed against tyrosinase, as well as bystander T cell responses. Using this methodology in a model tumor system, murine Tregs designed to express the tyrosinase TCR effectively blocked antigen-specific effector T cell (Teff) activity as determined by tumor cell growth and luciferase reporter-based imaging. Conclusions/Significance These results support the feasibility of class I-restricted TCR transfer as a promising strategy to redirect the functional properties of Tregs and provide for a more efficacious adoptive cell therapy."

These viroporin features render p7 an attractive target for antiviral drug development. In this study, p7 from strain HCV-J (genotype 1b) was chemically synthesized and purified for ion channel activity measurements and structure analyses. p7 forms cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers and at the single-channel level by the patch clamp technique. Ion channel activity was shown to be inhibited by hexamethylene amiloride but not by amantadine. Circular dichroism analyses revealed that the structure of p7 is mainly α-helical, irrespective of the membrane mimetic medium (e.g. lysolipids, detergents, or organic solvent/water mixtures). The secondary structure elements of the monomeric form of p7 were determined by 1H and 13C NMR in trifluoroethanol/water mixtures. Molecular dynamics simulations in a model membrane were combined synergistically with structural data obtained from NMR experiments. This approach allowed us to determine the secondary structure elements of p7, which significantly differ from predictions, and to propose a three-dimensional model of the monomeric form of p7 associated with the phospholipid bilayer. These studies revealed the presence of a turn connecting an unexpected N-terminal α-helix to the first transmembrane helix, TM1, and a long cytosolic loop bearing the dibasic motif and connecting TM1 to TM2. These results provide the first detailed experimental structural framework for a better understanding of p7 processing, oligomerization, and ion channel gating mechanism.

The HCV genome encodes a polyprotein precursor, NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH, of about 3,000 amino acids that is co- and post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases to yield 10 mature viral proteins. The latter include the structural proteins (C, E1, and E2) that constitute the viral particle; p7 and NS2, required for virus assembly; and NS3 to NS5B involved in HCV replication (reviewed in Ref. 5Moradpour D. Penin F. Rice C.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). p7 is often incompletely cleaved from E2 (6Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier C. Lorenzo L. Brulin B.

Bartenschlager R. Pietschmann T. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e103Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). p7 is found primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum as an integral membrane protein and displays a topology in which both N and C termini point toward the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (8Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, an alternative topology wherein the C terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm may be adopted (9Isherwood B.J. Patel A.H. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). p7 is not required for RNA replication in vitro but is essential for the late phase of assembly and the release of infectious HCV in vitro (7Steinmann E.

Preliminary solid-state NMR analyses of recombinant p7 reconstituted in a phospholipid environment confirmed that p7 contains helical segments, which are slightly tilted relative to the membrane bilayer (16Cook G.A. Opella S.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2010; 39: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). p7 belongs to the family of viroporins, which contains small virally encoded membrane proteins, including M2 of the influenza virus and vpu of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 (17Gonzalez M.E. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These polypeptides modify the membrane cell permeability to ions and small molecules. Isolated p7 reconstituted in artificial membranes has been reported to form oligomers and to possess cation channel activity, which is inhibited by long alkyl chain imino-sugar derivatives (18Pavlović D.

Nevertheless, the relationship between the ion channel activity and the role of p7 in assembly and release of infectious HCV particles in cell culture is not known. Electron microscopy studies revealed that p7 monomers could assemble into hexamers (20Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J.

Single-particle electron microscopy recently allowed the three-dimensional structure of the hexameric p7 ion channel to be determined at 16 Å resolution, revealing a flower-shaped protein architecture with six protruding petals oriented toward the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (23Luik P.

In the present study, we report the ion channel activity of chemically synthesized p7 reconstituted in artificial membranes. Moreover, we combined NMR analyses and molecular dynamics simulations in a palmitoyloleyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid bilayer to put forth the first detailed structure of the monomeric p7 embedded in a lipid membrane. Examination of this structure model in combination with analysis of conservation and variability of p7 amino acids among representative HCV genotypes allowed us to highlight the essential structural features of p7, which are determinants of the ion channel gating mechanism or may be associated with its role in facilitating HCV particle assembly and release from infected cells. The p7 monomer model reported here provides an experimental template for further investigations of the p7 ion channel gating mechanism and for the development of antiviral drugs.

Phosphatidylcholine from soy beans (asolectin from Sigma type IV S), dissolved in hexane (0.5%) was spread on the top of electrolyte solution (500 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) in both compartments. Bilayer formation was achieved by lowering down and raising up the level in one or both compartments and monitoring capacity responses. Voltage was applied through an Ag/AgCl electrode in the cis-side, and the trans-side was grounded. The purified peptides dissolved in 1% DM were added in the concentration range 5 × 10−9 to 5 × 10−8 m. The peptide-containing membranes were subjected to slow ramps of potential (10 mV/s), and transmembrane currents were fed into an amplifier (BBA-01, Eastern Scientific (Rockville, MD)). Current-voltage curves were stored on a computer and analyzed with the Scope software (Bio-logic, Claix, France). For ion selectivity measurements, zero current potentials were determined by establishing a 10-fold KCl gradient (500 mm/50 mm cis/trans) across the bilayer. The ion selectivity was characterized by the ratio Pc/Pa (i.e. the ratio of the permeability for cations and the permeability for anions) calculated according to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (33Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. J. Physiol. 1947; 106: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at room temperature, and the bath solution of the cis-side compartment was stirred during the measurements. The purified p7 dissolved in 90% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) was mixed with asolectin in chloroform/methanol (1:1) (protein/lipid ratio of 1:500–1:5000 (w/w)) or 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (10 μm p7 in 1% DM), dried under a nitrogen flux, and lyophilized to remove any trace of solvent and water. The lyophilized sample with asolectin was directly resuspended in 2 ml of 500 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and sonicated in a bath sonicator until clarity. The resulting vesicle suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C. The lyophilized p7 sample in DM (10 μm p7 in 1% DM) was incubated with asolectin vesicles at protein/lipid ratios of 1:2000–1:5000 for 30 min at room temperature before removal of detergent by the addition of polystyrene beads (Bio-Beads SM-2 from Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 80 mg of Bio-Beads/ml of protein solution in 1% DM. After 4 h, the Bio-Beads were discarded, and the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were suspended in 30 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and aliquots were subjected to a dehydratation/rehydratation procedure to obtain giant proteoliposomes (31Saint N. Montserret R. Chipot C. Penin F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 510: 125-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each experiment, 1–2 μl of the rehydrated suspension were placed in a 1-ml chamber containing the recording solution (500 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Membrane patches, obtained from unilamellar blisters from collapsing liposomes, were examined using the standard patch clamp technique (34Le Dain A.C. Saint N. Kloda A. Ghazi A. Martinac B. J. Biol.

The micropipettes used were borosilicate glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK) filled with the recording solution. The single-channel currents were visualized with the Visual Patch 500 amplifier (Bio-logic, Claix, France), and the recorded data were treated with Biotools software (Bio-logic). For the ion channel inhibition tests, we used hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) purchased from Sigma and two lots of amantadine from Sigma and Fluka. The samples were prepared from co-lyophilized p7 and C12E8 dissolved in a mixture of ∼51% D2O, 49% H2O of density 1.05655 g/ml (i.e. the density of the detergent (36Salvay A.G. Ebel C. Wondrey C.

The experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an AN-60 TI rotor (Beckman Coulter) in a 12-mm optical path length cell equipped with sapphire windows. Further details are provided in the legends of supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S2. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon CD6 spectrometer calibrated with (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. The measurements were carried out at room temperature in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette, with peptide concentrations ranging from 30 to 60 μm. The spectra were recorded in the 190–250-nm wavelength range with a 0.2-nm increment and a 2-s integration time. They were subsequently processed with the CD6 software, base line-corrected, and smoothed by using a third-order least-squares polynomial fit. The spectral units were expressed as a molar ellipticity/residue by using peptide concentrations determined from measurements of UV light absorbance of tyrosine and tryptophan at 280 nm (molar extinction coefficients of 1,536 and 5,600 m−1·cm−1, respectively). The secondary structure content was estimated with various deconvolution methods, employing the DICHROWEB server (37Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). The purified p7 and p7(35–63) peptides were dissolved either in 100 mm dodecylphosphocholine (DPC)-d38 (>98%) or SDS-d25 (>98%) or in mixtures of 50–90% TFE-d2 (>99%) in H2O (v/v) at a final concentration of about 1.3 mm. 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was added to the NMR samples as an internal 1H chemical shift reference. The spectra were acquired at temperatures of 20 and 25 °C. Multidimensional NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Unity-plus 500-MHz and a Varian Inova 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with triple-resonance 5-mm probes with a self-shielded z-gradient coil. NOESY (mixing times between 100 and 250 ms), clean TOCSY (isotropic mixing time of 80 ms), and 1H-13C HSQC experiments were performed with conventional optimized pulse sequences, as was detailed previously (see Refs. 38Penin F.

Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California San Francisco). The resonances of protons were ascribed by the conventional assignment method (41Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). In short, intraresidue backbone resonances and aliphatic side chains were identified from two-dimensional DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra, with the help of 1H-13C HSQC and HSQC-TOCSY spectra in natural 13C abundance at 20 and 25 °C to resolve the overlap of resonances (42Medvedeva S. Simorre J.P. Brutscher B. Guerlesquin F. Marion D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sequential assignments were determined by correlation of intraresidue assignments with interresidue cross-peaks observed in two-dimensional NOESY. NMR-derived 1H α and 13Cα chemical shifts are reported relative to the random coil chemical shifts in TFE (43Merutka G. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 44Thanabal V. Omecinsky D.O. Reily M.D. Cody W.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NOE intensities used as distances input for structure calculations were obtained from the NOESY spectrum recorded with a 150-ms mixing time. NOEs were partitioned into three categories of intensities, which were converted into distances ranging from a common lower limit of 1.8 Å to upper limits of 2.8, 3.9, and 5.0 Å, respectively. The cross-peak intensity of the Hδ-Hϵ protons of Tyr45 was used as the distance reference (2.45 Å). Protons without stereospecific assignments were treated as pseudoatoms, and the correction factors were added to the upper distance constraints (41Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Neither additional dihedral angle nor hydrogen bond restraints were introduced. The three-dimensional structures were generated from NOE distances by means of a dynamic simulated annealing protocol, using the XPLOR-NIH 2.0.7 program (45Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) and standard force field and default parameter sets. Sets of 50 structures were initially calculated to sample widely the conformational space, and the structures of low energy with no distance restraint violations (>0.5 Å) were retained. The selected structures were compared by pairwise root mean square deviation over the backbone atom coordinates (N, Cα, and C′). Statistical analyses, superimposition of structures, and structural analyses were performed with MOLMOL version 2.6 (46Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), AQUA version 3.2, and PROCHECK-NMR version 3.5.4 (47Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). On the basis of the structural information acquired from both CD experiments in membrane mimetics and NMR structures in TFE/water solutions, a model of the complete monomeric protein was built. Because the latter experiments only supply fragments of the complete structure of p7 (see “Results”), a number of assumptions should be made when the segments of known structure are combined with those of undefined structure. The p7 topology with both N and C termini pointing toward the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (8Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) indicates that the TM1 and TM2 α-helices probably form a hairpin motif that spans the entire hydrophobic core of the membrane. The construction of this motif, which implies the pairing of TM1 and TM2, was achieved by means of protein-protein molecular docking. Use was made of the GRAMM program (48Vakser I.A. Matar O.G. Lam C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8477-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to explore α-helix association through rigid body translation and rotation of the individual helical units. An optimized scoring function was employed, the target of which was membrane proteins. Exploration was restrained to the formation of anti-parallel α-helix bundles. Among the solutions proposed by GRAMM, only those corresponding to strictly anti-parallel helical segments facing each other were retained. Selection was further narrowed down by examination of the interhelical contacts and elimination of unphysical spatial arrangements. The two TM α-helices were subsequently bridged into a hairpin by means of a short, four-residue loop domain, by using the VMD program (49Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39887) Google Scholar). The N-terminal α-helix was then pasted to the TM1 segment, before attachment of the unstructured C-terminal fragment at the tail end of the TM2 α-helix, thus completing the model of the protein. Backbone dihedral angles were checked against rotamer libraries and corrected whenever necessary. A rapid energy minimization was then performed, with the NAMD molecular dynamics program (50Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K.

https://openalex.org/W2152285822,"Wnt/Frizzled signaling, essential for embryonic development, has also recently been implicated in the modulation of inflammatory processes. In the current study, we observed a reciprocal regulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway after aerosol infection of mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: whereas proinflammatory mediators were substantially increased, β-catenin signaling was significantly reduced. A systematic screen of Fzd homologs in infected mice identified Fzd1 mRNA to be significantly up-regulated during the course of infection. In vitro infection of murine macrophages led to a strong induction of Fzd1 that was dependent on TLRs, the myeloid differentiation response gene 88 (MyD88), and a functional NF-κB pathway. Flow cytometry demonstrated an elevated Fzdl expression on macrophages in response to M. tuberculosis that was synergistically enhanced in the presence of IFN-γ. Addition of the Fzd1 ligand Wnt3a induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling in murine macrophages that was inhibited in the presence of a soluble Fzd1/Fc fusion protein. Furthermore, Wnt3a reduced TNF release, suggesting that Wnt3a promotes anti-inflammatory functions in murine macrophages. The current data support the notion that evolutionarily conserved Wnt/Fzd signaling is involved in balancing the inflammatory response to microbial stimulation of innate immune cells of vertebrate origin.—Neumann, J., Schaale, K., Farhat, K., Endermann, T., Ulmer, A. J., Ehlers, S., Reiling, N. Frizzledl is a marker of inflammatory macrophages, and its ligand Wnt3a is involved in reprogramming Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W1993976172,"The post-translational methylation of alpha-amino groups was first discovered over 30 years ago on the bacterial ribosomal proteins L16 and L33 (refs 1, 2), but almost nothing is known about the function or enzymology of this modification. Several other bacterial and eukaryotic proteins have since been shown to be alpha-N-methylated. However, the Ran guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, RCC1, is the only protein for which any biological function of alpha-N-methylation has been identified. Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 have reduced affinity for DNA and cause mitotic defects, but further characterization of this modification has been hindered by ignorance of the responsible methyltransferase. All fungal and animal N-terminally methylated proteins contain a unique N-terminal motif, Met-(Ala/Pro/Ser)-Pro-Lys, indicating that they may be targets of the same, unknown enzyme. The initiating Met is cleaved, and the exposed alpha-amino group is mono-, di- or trimethylated. Here we report the discovery of the first alpha-N-methyltransferase, which we named N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase (NRMT). Substrate docking and mutational analysis of RCC1 defined the NRMT recognition sequence and enabled the identification of numerous new methylation targets, including SET (also known as TAF-I or PHAPII) and the retinoblastoma protein, RB. Knockdown of NRMT recapitulates the multi-spindle phenotype seen with methylation-defective RCC1 mutants, demonstrating the importance of alpha-N-methylation for normal bipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation."

Initial characterization of global sox2 cre-derived exon 3-deleted Ex3αERKO mice indicated no ERα protein in uterine tissue and recapitulation of previously described female phenotypes, confirming successful ablation of ERα. Body weights of Ex3αERKO female mice were 1.4-fold higher than wild-tupe (WT) females and comparable to WT males. Microarray indicated the Ex3αERKO uterus is free of residual estrogen responses. RT-PCR showed Nr4a1 is increased 41-fold by estrogen in WT and 7.4-fold in αERKO, and not increased in Ex3αERKO. Nr4a1, Cdkn1a, and c-fos transcripts were evaluated in WT and Ex3αERKO mice following estrogen, IGF1, or EGF injections. All 3 were increased by all treatments in WT. None were increased by estrogen in Ex3αERKO. Nr4a1 increased 24.5- and 14.7-fold, Cdkn1a increased 14.2- and 12.3-fold, and c-fos increased 20.9-fold and 16.2-fold after IGF1 and EGF treatments, respectively, in the Ex3αERKO mice, confirming that growth factor regulation is independent of ERα. Our Ex3α ERα model will be useful in studies of complete or selective ablation of ERα in target tissues."

Smad2 tKO mice showed normal numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in thymus, as well as similar maturation markers as compared with wild-type littermates (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, similar frequencies and total cell numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed in periphery, with a slight decrease in CD8+ T cell frequencies in spleens but not their total numbers (supplemental Fig. 2 and data not shown). Moreover, CD4+ T cells found in peripheral tissues contained more activated/memory cells as compared with wild-type counterparts (supplemental Fig. 4). Unlike Smad4 tKO or Smad3 KO mutant mice, mice lacking Smad2 in T cells exhibit enhanced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ nTreg cells in all the lymphoid tissues analyzed (Fig. 1A). This phenotype resembles the TGFβRI conditional KO mice, which also showed enhanced nTreg levels in thymus after 1 week of birth (18Liu Y. Zhang P. Li J. Kulkarni A.B. Perruche S. Chen W. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Peripheral Smad2-deficient nTreg cells showed a similar suppressive phenotype as wild-type (WT) nTreg cells in vitro (Fig. 1B). To analyze the role of Smad2 in Treg induction, FACS-sorted naive CD4+CD25−CD62LhiCD44lo T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of TGF-β, IL-2, and neutralizing antibodies against IFN-γ and IL-4. Under this polarizing condition, we found a reduction in Foxp3 expression in cells lacking Smad2 (Fig. 1C). Reduction in Foxp3 expression was detected also at the mRNA level (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that Smad2, as well as Smad3 and Smad4 (5Yang X.O. Nurieva R. Martinez G.J. Kang H.S. Chung Y. Pappu B.P. Shah B. Chang S.H. Schluns K.S. Watowich S.S. Feng X.H. Jetten A.M.

We next determined the requirement of Smad2 in the generation of Th17 cells. Naive T cells lacking Smad2 showed reduced IL-17-producing T cells as compared with WT counterparts when increasing TGF-β concentrations were utilized to drive Th17 cell differentiation (Fig. 2A). By real-time RT-PCR, we found that IL-17, IL-17F, and CCL20 mRNA expression was reduced in Smad2-deficient T cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, IL-21 or IL-22 levels were found to be similar or even slightly enhanced in Smad2-deficient T cells (Fig. 2B and data not shown), supporting that TGF-β does not regulate the expression of these cytokines. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in expression of Th17-specific transcription factors RORγt, RORα, AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4), BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like), and Iκbζ (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Expression of Th1 and Th2 transcription factors T-bet and GATA3, respectively, was also similar between Smad2 KO and WT Th17 cells (Fig. 2B and data not shown), suggesting that the defect in Th17 cell generation in Smad2-deficient cells is not due to enhanced differentiation toward alternative Th cell lineages. Reduced IL-17-producing cells were observed in the absence of Smad2 (supplemental Fig. 5) when Th17 cells were generated using a combination of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23 cytokines (9Chung Y. Chang S.H. Martinez G.J. Yang X.O. Nurieva R. Kang H.S. Ma L. Watowich S.S. Jetten A.M. Tian Q. Dong C. Immunity. 2009; 30: 576-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). To analyze the requirement for Smad2 in vivo, Smad2 tKO or WT littermate mice were first immunized with KLH emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Seven days after the immunization, spleen and draining lymph nodes were harvested, and cells were restimulated with KLH protein ex vivo to evaluate cytokine production. We found reduced frequencies and total cell numbers of IL-17-producing T cells from Smad2 tKO mice as compared with WT counterparts (supplemental Fig. 6A). Moreover, Smad2-deficient T cells produced significantly lower IL-17 and IL-17F cytokines upon ex vivo restimulation with increasing concentrations of KLH in splenocytes and draining lymph node cells, as measured by ELISA in the culture supernatants (supplemental Fig. 6B and data not shown). On the other hand, no significant differences in IL-22 or IFN-γ expression were observed between the two groups of mice, suggesting that Smad2 deficiency affects primarily IL-17 and IL-17F cytokines. Th17 cells have been shown to be important for mediating inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases (1Martinez G.J. Nurieva R.I. Yang X.O. Dong C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1143: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, to further understand the function of Smad2 in vivo, we utilized the EAE model. Both WT and Smad2 tKO mice showed similar disease onset and disease severity at an early stage (Fig. 3A). However, although Smad2 tKO mice started to recover by day 10, WT littermates showed sustained disease severity (Fig. 3A). At day 14 after the second immunization, we analyzed central nervous system infiltration and found significantly lower frequency of CD4+ T cells in inflamed tissue from Smad2 tKO mice as compared with WT counterparts (Fig. 3B). Moreover, a reduction in the total CD4+ T cell number was also observed (Fig. 3B). We further investigated the cytokine production of those CD4+ T cells infiltrating the central nervous system and found a significant reduction in frequencies and total cell numbers of both IL-17+ and IL-17+/IFN-γ+ cells (Fig. 3C). However, the frequencies of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells were not affected between the two groups (Fig. 3C), further demonstrating a specific role of Smad2 in Th17 cell generation in vivo. The diminished disease severity in Smad2 tKO mice was not due to enhanced regulatory T cells infiltrating the CNS (data not shown). Moreover, when restimulated ex vivo with MOG peptide, splenocytes showed decreased Th17 cytokine production, albeit similar proliferation (Fig. 3D). Thus, these results showed that Smad2 is required for appropriate Th17 immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Because Smad2-deficient T cells showed impaired Th17 cytokine expression but maintained normal levels of both RORα and RORγ transcription factors, we considered the possibility that Smad2 may not be required for ROR expression but is important for their function. Given that Smad3 can bind to RORγt (6Martinez G.J. Zhang Z. Chung Y. Reynolds J.M. Lin X. Jetten A.M. Feng X.H. Dong C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35283-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we next examined whether Smad2 can also associate with RORγt. Similar to Smad3, Smad2 but not Smad4 was able to bind RORγt when co-expressed in HEK 293T cells, and this binding was increased upon co-expression of a constitutively active form of rat TGFβRI (TGFβRI T202D) (Fig. 4A) (6Martinez G.J.

Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Because both Smad2 and Smad3 showed similar binding to RORγt, we next evaluated their affinity to RORγt by doing a competitive co-immunoprecipitation experiment. We found that Smad3 competed with Smad2 for binding to RORγt and actually inhibited the binding of Smad2 to RORγt, whereas Smad2 did not affect Smad3 binding. Thus, these results suggest that Smad3 might indirectly inhibit RORγt function by blocking Smad2 binding (supplemental Fig. 7). It has been recently suggested that PP2A differentially regulates Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation by directly dephosphorylating Smad3 under hypoxia conditions (20Heikkinen P.T. Nummela M. Leivonen S.K. Westermarck J. Hill C.S. Kähäri V.M. Jaakkola P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3740-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) which suggests that although TGFβR signaling might induce Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation similarly, other proteins might also regulate their phosphorylation status independently. Thus, this differential dephosphorylation of Smad2/3 might be the mechanism utilized in Th17 cells to favor Smad2 over Smad3 phosphorylation. Next, we investigated whether Smad2 regulates RORγt-dependent generation of Th17 cells. For that purpose, RORγt and/or constitutively activated Smad2 were overexpressed in T cells by retroviral transduction. Overexpression of RORγt but not Smad2 led to the generation of IL-17-producing cells and up-regulation of genes associated with Th17 phenotype (Fig. 4, B and C). Interestingly, overexpression of constitutively active Smad2 together with RORγt greatly enhanced the induction of IL-17-producing cells as compared with RORγt expression alone (Fig. 4B). In addition, Smad2 enhanced RORγt-dependent IL-17, IL-17F, and CCL20 mRNA expression (Fig. 4C). This effect appears to be unique to Smad2 as a constitutive form of Smad3 did not regulate IL-17 expression in the presence or absence of RORγt in the same system (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed an increase in endogenous RORγ expression itself when RORγt was overexpressed, and such induction was further enhanced by co-expression of Smad2 (Fig. 4C). However, no differences were observed in other Th17-specific transcription factors such as RORα, BATF, and IκBζ (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that Smad2 might act as a coactivator for RORγt, leading to enhanced Th17 cell generation. In summary, in the present study, we studied mice with deficiency of Smad2 in T cells. We found that Smad2, like Smad4 and Smad3, was partially required for induction of iTreg cells. However, unlike Smad3 or Smad4, Smad2 not only binds to but also synergizes with RORγt in the generation of Th17 cells. More importantly, Smad2-deficient T cells had reduced capability to differentiate into Th17 cells, and mice with deficiency of Smad2 in T cells showed reduced Th17 cell responses in vivo and amelioration of EAE disease symptoms. Our results provide a basis for understanding the reciprocal regulation of Th17 and regulatory T cells.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of microglial transplantation on focal cerebral ischemia model in rat. Methods Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats was induced by the intraluminal filament technique. HMO6 cells, human microglial cell line, were transplanted intravenously at 48 hours after MCAO. Functional tests were performed and the infarct volume was measured at 7 and 14 days after MCAO. Migration and cell survival of transplanted microglial cells and host glial reaction in the brain were studied by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression of neurotrophic factors, cytokines and chemokines in transplanted cells and host rat glial cells was determined by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and quantitative real time-PCR. Results HMO6 human microglial cells transplantion group demonstrated significant functional recovery compared with control group. At 7 and 14 days after MCAO, infarct volume was significantly reduced in the HMO group. In the HMO6 group, number of apoptotic cells was time-dependently reduced in the infarct core and penumbra. In addition, number of host rat microglia/macrophages and reactive astrocytes was significantly decreased at 7 and 14 days after MCAO in the penumbra. Gene expression of various neurotrophic factors (GDNF, BDNF, VEGF and BMP7) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL4 and IL5) was up-regulated in transplanted HMO6 cells of brain tissue compared with those in culture. The expression of GDNF and VEGF in astrocytes in penumbra was significantly up-regulated in the HMO6 group. Conclusions Our results indicate that transplantation of HMO6 human microglial cells reduces ischemic deficits and apoptotic events in stroke animals. The results were mediated by modulation of gliosis and neuroinflammation, and neuroprotection provided by neurotrophic factors of endogenous and transplanted cells-origin."

Acta. 1998; 1385: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TKT catalyzes the reversible transfer of two-carbon (1,2-dihydroxyethyl) units from ketose phosphates to the C1 position of aldose phosphates and thus provides, together with the Schiff base-forming transaldolase, a reversible link between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. This shunt permits cells a flexible adaptation to different metabolic needs as the pentose phosphate pathway supplies intermediates for other metabolic pathways; generates precursors for biosynthesis of nucleotides, aromatic amino acids, and vitamins; and further produces NADPH for sustaining the glutathione level and for reductive biosynthetic pathways of, for example, cholesterol and fatty acids. transketolase d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate d-erythrose 4-phosphate d-xylulose 5-phosphate d-ribose 5-phosphate d-fructose 6-phosphate d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate thiamine diphosphate 1,2-dihydroxyethyl-ThDP covalent adduct of X5P and ThDP covalent adduct of F6P and ThDP covalent adduct of S7P and ThDP. TKT acts on different ketose phosphate (donor) and aldose phosphate (acceptor) substrates of variable carbon chain length (3–7 carbons) in two major, essentially reversible reactions.X5P + R5P ⇔S7P + G3PX5P + E4P ⇔F6P + G3PREACTIONS 1 AND 2 A simplified reaction scheme for the TKT-catalyzed conversion of substrates X5P and R5P into products S7P and G3P is shown in Fig. 1. The reaction cycle can be subdivided into a donor half-reaction (donor ligation and cleavage) and an acceptor half-reaction (acceptor ligation and product liberation) (3Kluger R. Tittmann K. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1797-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After formation of the reactive ylide form of ThDP, the C2 carbanion of ThDP attacks the carbonyl of donor X5P in a nucleophilic manner to yield the covalent donor-ThDP adduct X5P-ThDP (step 1). Ionization of C3-OH and cleavage of the scissile C2–C3 bond of X5P-ThDP results in the formation of product G3P and of the 1,2-dihydroxylethyl-ThDP (DHE-ThDP) carbanion/enamine intermediate (step 2). This intermediate may then react with either G3P (reverse reaction of step 2) or R5P in competing equilibria. In the latter case, C2α of DHE-ThDP ligates to C1 of R5P (in the acyclic form), yielding the covalent S7P-ThDP adduct (step 3). Eventual liberation of product S7P completes the reaction cycle (step 4). TKTs from different species show a remarkably high degree of sequence similarity. Whereas the bacterial, yeast, and plant enzymes comprise about ∼45–50% identical amino acids, mammalian TKTs share less identity with TKTs from other organisms (4Schenk G. Layfield R. Candy J.M. Duggleby R.G. Nixon P.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 552-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Human TKT shows ∼27% sequence identity with TKT from yeast, Escherichia coli (tktA), and maize. Sequence analysis further revealed that ∼50 amino acids are invariant across all species, including many residues shown to be involved in cofactor and substrate binding, such as a cluster of histidine and arginine residues. However, there are approximately 2 dozen residues that differ between the mammalian sequences and those of all other species. Most intriguingly, an active center histidine (His481 in yeast TKT) that is invariant in all non-mammalian TKTs is substituted by glutamine in the mammalian enzymes, ruling out the possibility that this residue acts as an acid/base catalyst (4Schenk G. Layfield R. Candy J.M. Duggleby R.G. Nixon P.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 552-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Singleton C.K. Wang J.J. Shan L. Martin P.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15865-15869Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All TKTs characterized to date are homodimers related by a 2-fold rotational symmetry and consist of subunits of ∼70–75 kDa (2Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The V-shaped subunit consists of three α/β-type domains: the N-terminal PP domain, the middle PYR domain, and the C-terminal domain. Two identical active sites are formed at the dimer interface between the PP domain and the Pyr domain of the neighboring subunit. The biological function of the C-terminal domain is unknown. The high resolution structures of TKT from yeast, E. coli, maize, Thermus thermophilus, and several pathogenic bacteria were determined by x-ray crystallography (6Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Ermler U.

However, there is no structural information available for any mammalian TKT, including the human enzyme. Alterations in the activity of human TKT have been reported to cause and/or accompany different pathological disorders, including the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, Alzheimer disease, or diabetes (14Nixon P.F.

Furthermore, TKT was suggested to be a critical determinant for impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, lymphatic metastasis of hepatocarcinoma, fibromyalgia, tumor cell growth, resistance of colon cancer toward 5-fluoruracil, and female fertility (17Zhao Y.

Furthermore, cumulative evidence was mounted that the vast majority of nucleic acid ribose in cancer cells is provided by the non-oxidative part of PPP through activity of TKT and transaldolase. In view of the central role of TKT in normal and different disease states, human TKT appears to be a promising drug target.

Cascante M. Lee W.N. Brandes J.L. Bassilian S. Yusuf F.I. Williams R.D. Muscarella P. Melvin W.S. Schirmer W.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4242-4248PubMed Google Scholar). Besides TKT, the human genome encodes for two closely related proteins, which were termed TKTL1 and TKTL2 (transketolase-like proteins 1 and 2) (28Coy J.F. Dübel S. Kioschis P. Thomas K. Micklem G. Delius H. Poustka A. Genomics. 1996; 32: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Human TKT shares a high sequence identity with both TKTL1 (61%) and TKTL2 (66%). However, a marked difference between TKT and TKTL1 is a deletion of 38 amino acids in the N-terminal PP domain (residues 76–113 in TKT), including 4 residues (Tyr83, Gly90, His110, and Pro111) that are totally invariant among all transketolase sequences (4Schenk G. Layfield R. Candy J.M. Duggleby R.G. Nixon P.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 552-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that TKTL1 might play an important role for cancerogenesis, because numerous studies reported a direct correlation between the expression level of TKTL1 and invasion efficiency of cancer cells and the corresponding mortality of patients (29Xu X. Zur Hausen A. Coy J.F. Löchelt M. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 124: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The biological function of TKTL2 is unknown. Herein, we report on the newly determined crystal structure of human TKT as the first structure of a mammalian TKT. Structural differences between the human enzyme and its orthologs from yeast, bacteria, and plants are discussed. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic kinetics of human TKT are studied by different assays. Finally, we hypothesize about the functional relationship of TKT and the proteins TKTL1 and TKTL2. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Carl Roth & Co., Merck, and AppliChem. Yeast extract for fed batch fermentation was purchased from Deutsche Hefewerke GmbH & Co. (Hamburg, Germany). Restriction enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas. Thrombin cleavage kit, TKT substrates (X5P, R5P, and β-hydroxypyruvate), and auxiliary enzymes triose-phosphate isomerase and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase were from Sigma-Aldrich. Quartz double-distilled water was used throughout the experiments. The donor sugar S7P was chemoenzymatically synthesized, relying on the protocol given by Charmantray et al. (30Charmantray F. Helaine V. Legeret B. Hecquet L. J Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2009; 57: 6-9Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but using wild-type TKT from E. coli. In brief, TKT was reacted with artificial donor β-hydroxypyruvate and the physiological acceptor R5P, making the donor half-reaction irreversible. Correct synthesis and purity of S7P were confirmed by nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The cDNA encoding for human TKT was optimized for bacterial (E. coli) expression and synthesized by Geneart AG (Regensburg, Germany). The synthetic DNA was inserted into vector pET28a(+) using NcoI and XhoI restriction sites and transformed into E. coli strain Top 10. The plasmid DNA of the clones was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit. DNA sequence identity was confirmed by sequencing of the whole plasmid (Eurofins MWG Operon). The final expression vector comprises an additional sequence encoding for a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site followed by a hexahistidine tag: 5′-pET 28a-NcoI-human TKT-(thrombin cleavage site)-XhoI-hexa-His-3′. This tag extends human TKT by an additional 14 amino acids at the C terminus, TKT-(Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-Leu-Glu)-(His-His-His-His-His-His) and 4 residues after thrombin cleavage, TKT-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg. The pET28a(+) vector containing the tkt gene was transformed into E. coli BL21C+ (Invitrogen) cells by electroporation. BL21C+ cells containing the pET28a(+)-tkt plasmid were grown on LB plates containing 35 μg/ml kanamycin overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was then used to inoculate a 300-ml overnight culture (LB medium, 35 μg/ml kanamycin) for cell cultivation in a biofermenter (B. Braun Biotech) at 37 °C. The overnight culture was centrifuged (6000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 300 ml of LB medium containing 35 μg/ml kanamycin. This cell suspension was used to inoculate 6 liters of fermentation medium (300 g of yeast extract, 3 g of NH4Cl, 30 g of glucose, 4 g of MgSO4, 66 g of K2HPO4, 1 ml of antifoam) supplemented with 35 μg/ml kanamycin. The culture was stirred with 600–1500 rpm at a p(O2) of 100% at 37 °C. After depletion of the glucose, feeding was started using a glucose feeding solution (2 liters containing 600 g of yeast extract and 600 g of glucose). The air flow was gradually increased during feeding from 3 to 12 liters/min. A constant pH of 7 was maintained by automatic titration of 10% NaOH and 10% H3PO4. At an A600 of ∼50, the temperature was rapidly decreased to 20 °C, and thiamine hydrochloride (70 μm) was added to the fermentation medium. Gene expression was induced by the addition of 100 μm IPTG. After 3 h of expression (A600 ∼78), cells were pelleted by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C). The cells (wet weight of ∼1.1 kg) were stored at −70 °C until usage. For purification, ∼100 g of cells were thawed and resuspended on ice in 300 ml of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm ThDP. In addition, DNase (5 μg/ml), MgSO4 (1 mm), lysozyme (0.6 mg/ml), and PMSF (1 mm) were added. The suspension was then gently stirred on ice for 30 min. Cells were disrupted by three passages in a French press device. The cell debris was separated from the soluble fraction by ultracentrifugation (30,000 rpm, 45 min, 4 °C). The clear supernatant was then loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column previously equilibrated with 200 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm ThDP. Human TKT was eluted from the column using a linear gradient (0–100%) elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 1 mm CaCl2) over a volume of 200 ml. Fractions containing TKT were pooled and loaded onto a G-25 HighPrep desalting column previously equilibrated with 50 mm glycyl-glycine (either pH 7.6 for functional analysis or pH 7.9 for crystallization). TKT was finally adjusted to a concentration of 20–30 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using microconcentrators (VIVASPIN, molecular weight cut-off of 30,000, 4000 rpm, 4 °C). The C-terminal His6 tag of TKT was cleaved off using the THROMBIN CleanCleaveTM kit (Sigma-Aldrich). A volume of 1 ml of thrombin-agarose was applied per mg of TKT. Proteolytic digestion was carried out for 12 h at 20 °C. Afterward, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 20 °C. The supernatant containing processed TKT was separated from the agarose. The beads were washed again with 5 ml of 50 mm glycyl-glycine and recentrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 20 °C. The supernatant was added to that of the previous step and loaded onto a 1-ml Ni2+-NTA column. Although unprocessed protein and His tag-containing peptides bind to the column, processed TKT passes the column and was only detected in the flow-through as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. The enzymatic activity of human TKT (with and without His6 tag) for conversion of X5P and R5P into S7P and G3P (Reaction 1) was determined in a spectrophotometric steady-state assay using the auxiliary enzymes triose-phosphate isomerase and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase to detect formation of G3P, which derives from cleavage of X5P. The concomitant oxidation of NADH was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm in 50 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.6, at 30 °C. The assay further contained 0.22 mm NADH, 3.6 units of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase/triose-phosphate isomerase, 100 μm ThDP, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1–0.5 mg/ml human TKT, and variable concentrations of X5P and R5P. One unit is defined as the formation of 1 μmol of G3P/min. In order to determine the Km values for X5P and R5P, the concentration of one substrate was kept constant at 2 mm. The dependence of the initial rates on the substrate concentration was analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The TKT activity in the so-called one-substrate reaction was analyzed using the same assay and conditions but in the presence of X5P as sole substrate (i.e. devoid of acceptor R5P). It could be demonstrated for TKTs from other organisms that X5P is slowly converted to G3P and erythrulose (carboligation product of two glycolaldehyde molecules) in the absence of an acceptor (31Bykova I.A. Solovjeva O.N. Meshalkina L.E. Kovina M.V. Kochetov G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The donor half-reactions of human TKT with donor ketoses X5P, F6P, and S7P were analyzed by one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy after acid quench isolation of reaction intermediates (12Asztalos P.

This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the microscopic equilibria of the donor half-reaction comprising formation of (i) the substrate Michaelis complex (K1), (ii) the covalent donor-ThDP adduct (X5P-ThDP, F6P-ThDP, S7P-ThDP) (K2), and (iii) cleavage of the latter intermediate into DHE-ThDP and an aldose phosphate product (K3) as shown below.E-ThDP + donor (X5P/F6P/S7P)⇔K1E-ThDP ∗ donor (Michaelis complex)⇔K2covalent donor-ThDP adduct⇔K3E-DHE-ThDP + product (G3P/E4P/R5P)REACTIONS 3 The relative concentrations of the intermediates were estimated by 1H NMR spectroscopy using the C2-H signal of ThDP (9.70 ppm) and the C6′-H proton signals of chemically synthesized DHE-ThDP (7.31 ppm), and of chemoenzymatically synthesized X5P-ThDP (7.35 ppm) and F6P-ThDP (7.34 ppm) adducts as standards. As shown under “Results and Discussion,” the covalent S7P-ThDP intermediate could be detected and assigned for the first time in this study. In a typical experiment, 15 mg/ml holoenzyme (219 μm active sites) in 50 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.6, was mixed with 50 mm substrate solution (X5P, F6P, or S7P in the same buffer) in a 1 + 1 mixing ratio (200 μl each) for 30 s at 30 °C. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 200 μl of TCA/HCl as detailed (32Tittmann K. Golbik R. Uhlemann K. Khailova L. Schneider G. Patel M. Jordan F. Chipman D.M. Duggleby R.G. Hübner G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). NMR data acquisition and processing were performed as described previously (32Tittmann K. Golbik R. Uhlemann K.

Human transketolase bearing a C-terminal His6 tag was successfully crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Remarkably, all attempts to crystallize thrombin-processed TKT (devoid of His tag) failed. For initial crystallization trials, we relied on conditions established for crystallization of TKTs from E. coli and S. cerevisiae (8Littlechild J. Turner N. Hobbs G. Lilly M. Rawas A. Watson H. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1995; 51: 1074-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Schneider G. Sundström M. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21619-21620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quality of these initially obtained crystals was not sufficient for an x-ray structural analysis. In order to improve the crystal quality, several additive screens were tested. These optimization trials revealed a reservoir mixture of 13.5–15% (w/v) PEG 6000, 4% (v/v) PEG 400, and 2% (v/v) glycerol in 50 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.9, to be most suitable for a reproducible crystallization of single crystals of human TKT. To set up crystallization, 3 μl of protein solution (8–12 mg/ml, 0.6 mm ThDP, 5 mm CaCl2 in 50 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.9) were mixed with 3 μl of the reservoir solution. Droplets were allowed to equilibrate with 500 μl of mother liquor at 8 °C. Crystal growth occurred within 3–5 days. Single crystals of human TKT were mounted to nylon cryoloops (Hampton Research) and transferred to cryoprotectant solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 6000, 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 5 mm ThDP, 10 mm CaCl2 in 50 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.9. After an incubation time of ∼10 s, crystals were immediately flash-cooled by direct immersion into liquid nitrogen and transferred to the goniometer head. A data set of a single crystal was collected in house in a 100 K nitrogen cryostream (XSTREAM2000, Rigaku/MSC, Japan) using copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with an R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector (Rigaku/MSC, Japan) on a Rigaku MicroMax 007 rotating anode generator. The diffraction data extended to a resolution of 1.75 Å. Oscillation images were integrated, merged, and scaled using the XDS program package (34Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was carried out with Phaser using data from 20 to 1.75 Å and using a monomer of transketolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a search model (Protein Data Bank code 1TRK) (35Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Human transketolase crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit forming half of the biologically functional dimer. The structure was manually rebuilt and verified against 2Fo − Fc electron density maps using Coot (36Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out with Refmac5, applying overall anisotropic B-factor and bulk solvent correction (35Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Ligands and water molecules were added to the model at a late stage of refinement. The crystallographic R-factor was used to monitor the stage of refinement omitting 5% of the structure factors for calculation of Rfree. The final model consists of residues 3–618 (human TKT comprises 623 residues), 1 ThDP molecule, 1 Ca2+ ion, 1 Na+ ion, 10 1,2-ethanediol molecules, and 488 waters and was refined to Rwork and Rfree values of 0.169 and 0.205, respectively. The stereochemistry of the model was assessed by MolProbity (37Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S.

The surface-exposed epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium composed of several layers of keratinocytes, is most important for the barrier defense against these challenges. Recent discoveries have highlighted the balance of proteases and protease inhibitors as key players in both desquamation processes and epidermal barrier functions (1Meyer-Hoffert U. Arch. Immunol.

After treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) to exclude contamination with genomic DNA, 2 μg of DNA-free total RNA was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis for RACE using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 5′-RACE was performed with a gene-specific antisense primer (5′-AGG CAC ATT TAT TGC CAT ATG TCT GGC CAT C-3′), whereas 3′-RACE was done with a gene-specific sense primer (5′-GTG AGT TCC AGG ACC CCA AGG TCT ACT G-3′) essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR cycles were performed under the following conditions: 1 min at 95 °C, five cycles of 20 s at 95 °C and 3 min at 72 °C, 5 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C and 3 min at 70 °C, 25 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C and 3 min at 68 °C, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. Subsequently, the PCR product was diluted 50-fold into Milli-Q water and used as a template for a nested PCR with a nested primer (for 5′-nest, 5′-GCC ACA GTG TGG GTT AGA TTC CCG AGT G-3′; and for 3′-nest, 5′-CCA CAC TGT GGC TCT GAT GGC CAG A-3′) under the following conditions: 1 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C and 3 min at 70 °C, and a final extension of 10 min at 70 °C. The amplified fragment was gel-purified and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Mannheim), followed by full sequencing in both directions. Total RNA was isolated from cultured human foreskin-derived keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) and skin using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Other total RNAs from different tissues were obtained from Clontech. A total of 2 μg of total RNA from human tissues or culture was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT)18 primer and Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). One pair of gene-specific PCR primers (forward primer, 5′-ACC TCA GCT GGA CAA AGC AG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-TGG CAA GTC ACC AAG AAA CA-3′) was designed to amplify a 322-bp product and to span all three exon-intron boundaries. PCR was carried out with the Advantage 2 PCR polymerase (Clontech), and amplicons were analyzed by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. As an internal control of cDNA templates, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene was assessed with each cDNA in a separate PCR as described (14Meyer-Hoffert U. Wu Z. Schröder J.M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, an assay was carried out with the same primer pair as described above and the SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM kit (Takara Bio, Heidelberg) in a fluorescence thermocycler (LightCycler, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Hamburg) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Cycling conditions were as follows: 45 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 69 °C for 20 s (“touchdown” of −1 °C/cycle to 63 °C), and 72 °C for 20 s. To calculate the relative transcript amplification, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene was measured with each cDNA in a separate PCR. The data from triplicate samples were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 4. For absolute DNA quantification, reactions were carried out with different concentrations of linearized plasmid DNA containing the insert in parallel to the samples that should be quantified. The data from three independent observations were analyzed with the software and expressed as means ± S.D. of mRNA copies relative to 10 ng of total RNA. Protein and peptide mass determinations were performed by ESI-MS analyses using a quadrupole TOF hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-TofTM II, Waters Micromass, Milford, MA) equipped with an orthogonal electrospray source (Z-spray) operated in positive ionization mode. For MS analysis, aliquots (2–10 μl) of HPLC fractions containing the sample were diluted with 100 μl of carrier solvent (50:50 acetonitrile/water containing 0.2% formic acid or 60:40 methanol and 10 mm ammonium formate, pH 6.5) and infused into the electrospray source at a rate of 10–20 μl/min. Sodium iodide was used for mass calibration for a calibration range of m/z 100–2000. The capillary potential was set to 3.5 or 4 kV, and cone voltages between 25 and 75 V were chosen. The cone temperature was set to 80 °C; the desolvation temperature was 150 °C; and the ESI gas was nitrogen. The charge-to-mass ratio of ions was scanned in the range of 280 to 2000. Acquisition and data analysis were performed using the MassLynx 4 software package supplied by Waters Micromass. Mass spectra were averaged typically over 2–10 scans (2–20 s/scan). The multiply charged raw data of intact proteins were background-subtracted and deconvoluted using Maximum Entropy 1 (MaxEnt1) to obtain singly charged ion mass spectra to determine average molecular masses of intact proteins. The raw combined spectral data from small peptides or obtained after tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation of selected precursor ions were background-subtracted and subjected to Maximum Entropy 3 (MaxEnt3) deconvolution to determine monoisotopic molecular masses. Sample identity was determined by data base search analysis of peptide fragment mass patterns and/or after de novo sequencing of tryptic peptide fragments. All mass fingerprint and MS/MS data were searched against the human protein data base using the Mascot program (Matrix Science, Boston, Massachusetts). Peptide sequences were directly determined from MS/MS data using the software program PepSeq from the MassLynx 4 software package. PepSeq-derived peptide sequences were analyzed with the NCBI BLAST Protein Database search program. The recombinant expression of SPINK6 cDNA (rSPINK6; residues 25–80) in Escherichia coli was performed by molecular subcloning of SPINK6 cDNA into the prokaryotic expression vectors pET-32a (Novagen, North Ryde, Australia) and pET-SUMO (Invitrogen) as described previously (19Wu Z. Hansmann B. Meyer-Hoffert U. Glaser R. Schröder J.M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The SUMO-His-tagged fusion protein was digested with SUMO protease 1 (LifeSensors Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. To subclone into the expression vector pET-32a, PCR was performed with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). The inserts were gel-purified and inserted into the pET-SUMO vector. Specific primer pairs used in this study were as follows: p32-SPINK6-forward, ACT GAG ATC TGG GTA CCG ACG ACG ACG ACA AGC AGG TTG ACT GTG GTG AGT TC; p32-SPINK6-reverse, ATT TGC GGC CGC TCA GCA TTT TCC AGG ATG CTT; pSUMO-SPINK6-forward, GGA GGA CAG GTT GAC TGT G; and pSUMO-SPINK6-reverse, TCA GCA TTT TCC AGG ATG CTT. All positive clones were identified and verified by sequencing. The plasmids were introduced into the E. coli host strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Subsequently, these were grown at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth medium containing appropriate antibiotics. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, lysed by sonication, and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Recombinant proteins were trapped with Ni2+ prepared columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and Ni2+ affinity column-bound proteins were subjected to preparative reversed-phase HPLC with a column (SP250/10 Nucleosil 300-7 C8, Macherey-Nagel) that was previously equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) TFA in HPLC-grade water containing 10% acetonitrile. The polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins were eluted with a gradient of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA (flow rate, 3 ml/min). Fractions containing UV light (215 nm)-absorbing material were collected, lyophilized, and analyzed by ESI-quadrupole TOF-MS (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). Purified histidine-tagged SUMO fusion proteins were then digested with SUMO protease 1 according to the manufacturer's suggestion. The target peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC with a Jupiter 5μ-C4–300A HPLC column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) equilibrated with 0.1% TFA in 10% acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted with a gradient of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min). Fractions of each peak were collected. The purity of recombinant fusion proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE. Masses of fusion proteins and rSPINK6 peptides were analyzed by ESI-quadrupole TOF-MS. Concentrations of proteins present in HPLC fractions were estimated by ultraviolet absorbance integration at 215 nm using ubiquitin for calibration. Polyclonal antiserum against human rSPINK6 (residues 25–80) was generated in a goat as described previously (14Meyer-Hoffert U. Wu Z. Schröder J.M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, a total of 1.0 mg of fusion protein (pET-32a-SPINK6) was conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (1:1, w/w) and subsequently mixed with 500 μg of pET-32a-SPINK6 for use as immunogens. Antisera were affinity-purified by absorption first against protein G. Unspecific antibodies were eliminated by collecting the flow-through after applying the antibody to a pET-tag-coupled column. Finally, the antibody was affinity-purified against rSPINK6 that was covalently bound to a HiTrap NHS-activated HP 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Specificity was tested by Western blot analyses using rSPINK6, naturally isolated LEKTI-2 (data not shown), and SPINK6 as well as stratum corneum extracts. Pooled heel stratum corneum was extracted similarly as described (14Meyer-Hoffert U. Wu Z. Schröder J.M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After diafiltration (Amicon filters, 3-kDa cut-off) against 10 mm Tris citrate buffer, pH 8.0, extracts were applied to an anti-SPINK6 affinity column. Affinity-purified anti-human SPINK6 polyclonal antibodies were covalently bound to HiTrap NHS-activated HP 1-ml columns. Unspecific material that was weakly bound to the affinity column was first eluted with 2 m NaCl. Strongly bound material was eluted by pH shift using 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3. Material that was strongly bound to the affinity column was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Jupiter C18 column, Phenomenex). Each HPLC fraction was analyzed by ESI-MS. Lyophilized fractions were subjected to tributylphosphine/vinylpyridine gas-phase reduction and alkylation (20Hale J.E. Butler J.P. Gelfanova V. You J.S. Knierman M.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 333: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After dissolving samples in 20 μl of NH4HCO3 with 2 μl of acetonitrile, peptides were digested with 4.5 ng/μl trypsin at 37 °C for 2 h and then further analyzed by MS/MS. For Western blot analysis, stratum corneum extracts from healthy volunteers, rSPINK6, and HPLC fractions containing natural SPINK6 were loaded onto a 12% SDS/Tricine-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a Protran-nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience GmbH, Dassel, Germany), blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) BSA in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST)), and then incubated for 18 h at 4 °C in 3% (w/v) BSA in PBST containing affinity-purified anti-SPINK6 antibody (1 μg/ml). The membrane was washed with PBST six times for 5 min each and then incubated for 45 min in PBST containing a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (Dianova, Hamburg). After further washing, the membrane was incubated for 5 min with chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and visualized using a Diana III cooled CCD camera imaging system (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue was performed as described previously (21Wu Z. Meyer-Hoffert U. Reithmayer K. Paus R. Hansmann B. He Y. Bartels J. Gläser R. Harder J. Schröder J.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2009; 129: 1446-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using affinity-purified goat anti-SPINK6 polyclonal antibody (final concentration of 10 ng/μl) followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (1:100 dilution; DakoCytomation) and subsequently incubated with Vector Universal DAB kit. Counterstaining was done with hematoxylin. A specificity test of the anti-SPINK6 antibody was performed using rSPINK6 peptide to block the primary antibody. Negative controls were established using preimmune goat sera to stain sections. All protease assays were performed by measuring chromogenic substrate release by proteases in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer as described previously (14Meyer-Hoffert U. Wu Z. Schröder J.M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Specific concentrations of proteases, substrates, and inhibitors are indicated in Table 1. Recombinant human kallikreins were purchased from R&D Systems and activated according to the manufacturer's protocol. All enzymes were incubated with increasing concentrations of rSPINK6 for 5 min in 0.1 m Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0. After incubation, a solution of the substrate in the same buffer was added, resulting in a final concentration of 2 nm KLK, 1 mm tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg p-nitroanilide (KLK5, KLK8, and KLK14) or S-2586 (KLK7), and SPINK6 in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction progress was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm using a Tecan Sunrise microplate reader in kinetic mode. Initial reaction velocities for each tested inhibitor concentration were determined by linear regression and were subsequently plotted against inhibitor concentration. Data were further analyzed according to the Morrison tight-binding inhibition model. For determination of Km, enzymes were mixed with varying substrate concentrations. Mixtures contained 2 nm KLK and the respective substrate in a concentration range of 0.2–6 mm. Initial velocities were determined by linear regression and plotted against respective substrate concentrations. Collected data were analyzed by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the GraphPad Prism 5 built-in model.TABLE 1Protease inhibition by recombinant SPINK6ProteinaseSPINK6InhibitionSubstrate (0.33 mm)nm%Bovine trypsin (2 nm final concentration)4000N-(p-Tosyl)-Arg-Gly-Val 5-NACathepsin G (1 nm final concentration)6660N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe pNAChymase (2 nm final concentration)6660N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe pNAHuman chymotrypsin (2 nm final concentration)40003-MeO-Arg-Pro-Tyr pNAKLK14 (2 nm final concentration)40099.9N-(p-Tosyl)-Arg-Gly-Val 5-NAKLK5 (5.3 nm final concentration)40099.9N-(p-Tosyl)-Arg-Gly-Val 5-NAKLK7 (15.8 nm final concentration)40088.3MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr pNAHuman leukocyte elastase (2 nm final concentration)4000N-MeO-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val pNAHuman plasmin (2 nm final concentration)4000N-(p-Tosyl)-Gly-Pro-Lys 4-NAHuman thrombin (1 nm final concentration)4000N-(p-Tosyl)-Gly-Pro-Arg pNAMatriptase (0.5 nm final concentration)4000H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg pNAProstasin/Prss8 (3.5 nm final concentration)17503.3Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin Open table in a new tab The procedure of Lundström and Egelrud (22Lundström A. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 340-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was applied. Flakes (∼0.5 mm thick) of stratum corneum were cut parallel to the skin surface from the heels of healthy volunteers. After the tissue had been soaked in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.1% NaN3, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2, for 5 h at room temperature, loosely attached cells were scraped off with a scalpel. Stratum corneum cylinders with a defined surface area were prepared with a 3-mm biopsy punch. Cylinders were incubated in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% NaN3, pH 8.0, for 18 h at 37 °C. After Vortex agitation (30 s), the tissue pieces were removed from the incubation solution. The released cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted with 1 m NaOH. Solubilized protein was quantified using NanoDrop with bovine serum albumin treated with 1 m NaOH as a standard. To search for genes encoding putative functional domains homologous to atypical Kazal-like domains of LEKTI, the amino acid sequence of LEKTI domain 6 was used as a query to blast against the human genome (NCBI builder 34, 2003). A gene locus was identified and localized between the two known genes, SPINK5 (GenBankTM accession number NM_001127698) and SPINK7 (accession number NM_032566) (Fig. 1A). To identify the gene, RACE and RT-PCR were performed. Two full-length cDNA sequences were obtained from cultured foreskin-derived keratinocytes and were registered under GenBankTM accession numbers GQ504704 and GQ504705, respectively. Although this gene had been predicted and designated as SPINK6 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 6; GenBankTM accession number NM_205841), to the best of our knowledge, the identification of this gene has not been reported. Comparison between the cDNA and genomic sequences revealed that the SPINK6 gene contains four conserved exons, whereas it has two different transcription start sites at bp 1 and 64 but only one termination site (Fig. 1B). All of the splice donor and acceptor sites conform to the GT/AG rule. These two transcripts, SPINK6-v1 (947 bp) and SPINK6-v2 (883 bp), contain a common ORF of 243 bp and a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) situated 214 nucleotides 5′ of the polyadenylation tail (Fig. 1C). The deduced protein chain consists of 80 amino acids with a leader sequence containing a putative signal peptide (residues 1–23) and a typical Kazal domain with six cysteine residues (residues 28–80). Comparison of SPINK6 with LEKTI/SPINK5 domains and SPINK9 revealed that SPINK6 shows high homology to the atypical Kazal domains of LEKTI/SPINK5 especially in the putative reactive center residues P2 (Thr), P1 (Arg), and P1′ (Glu) (Fig. 2), whereas LEKTI-2/SPINK9 exhibits the highest degree of sequence homology to SPINK5 domain 2.FIGURE 2Amino acid sequence alignment of SPINK6 in comparison with LEKTI/SPINK5 domains and SPINK6. The alignment of the Kazal domains of SPINK6, LEKTI-2/SPINK9, and LEKTI/SPINK5 domains (d) was generated by ClustalW and displayed using GeneDoc. Identical residues are in black boxes, whereas gray boxes indicate partially conserved residues. The darker the shading, the more the amino acids are conserved among the family members. The different LEKTI/LEKTI-2 domains are ordered by their homology to SPINK6. The P1 and P1′ sites are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the fact that SPINK6 cDNA was cloned from cultured human keratinocytes, we tried to identify SPINK6 protein in the skin using an anti-SPINK6 polyclonal antibody affinity column to capture natural SPINK6 from human callus extracts. After affinity chromatography, the eluting fraction was further purified by C18 reversed-phase HPLC, resulting in two peaks (Fig. 3A) with masses of 6045.03 and 6062.57 Da, which fit well with a SPINK6 protein containing three disulfide bonds starting with Gln24 and its derivative starting with pyroglutamine 24 (Fig. 1C, underlined AA sequence). The identity of these peptides as SPINK6 was confirmed by MS/MS analyses (data not shown) and Western blot analyses (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analyses exhibited immunoreactivity of purified pyroglutamine 24 (lane 1), purified Gln24 SPINK6 (lane 2), and rSPINK6 (lane 3). To further investigate whether SPINK6 is expressed in other tissues and organs, RT-PCR analyses were performed. Low levels of SPINK6 mRNA were detected in all tissues and cells examined using R"
https://openalex.org/W2000655842,"Cholera toxin (CT) is an AB5 toxin that moves from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retrograde vesicular transport.

Hirst T.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Sánchez J. Holmgren J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is an AB-type protein toxin that contains separate catalytic and cell-binding subunits. The catalytic A subunit is initially synthesized as a 27 kDa protein, which undergoes proteolytic nicking to generate a disulfide-linked CTA1/CTA2 heterodimer. The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of CT resides in the 22 kDa CTA1 polypeptide, while the 5 kDa CTA2 polypeptide maintains numerous non-covalent interactions with the B subunit and thereby links the enzymatic A1 moiety to the cell-binding B moiety. The CTB subunit, built from 11 kDa monomers, is a homopentameric ring-like structure that binds to GM1 gangliosides on the plasma membrane of a target cell.CT travels as an intact holotoxin from the cell surface to the ER (3Wernick N.L.B. Chinnapen D.J.-F. Cho J.A. Lencer W.I. Toxins. 2010; 2: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Environmental conditions in the ER facilitate reduction of the CTA1/CTA2 disulfide bond and dissociation of CTA1 from CTA2/CTB5. This process occurs at the resident redox state of the ER and involves the action of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), an ER-localized oxidoreductase (4Lencer W.I. de Almeida J.B. Moe S. Stow J.L.

Unfolding of the dissociated CTA1 subunit allows it to move into the cytosol through one or more protein-conducting channels in the ER membrane (9Bernardi K.M. Forster M.L. Lencer W.I. Tsai B. Mol.

Cytosolic CTA1 then refolds into an active conformation and modifies its Gsα target.ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a host quality control mechanism, is responsible for the ER-to-cytosol dislocation of CTA1 (12Teter K.

A variety of ER-localized chaperones, lectins, and oxidoreductases function in ERAD (15Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 16Bar-Nun S. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 300: 95-125PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These proteins recognize features that are present in misfolded proteins such as surface-exposed hydrophobic residues or improper patterns of N-linked glycosylation. When a misfolded protein is identified by the ERAD system, it is exported to the cytosol through Sec61 and/or Derlin-1 protein-conducting channels. Dislocated ERAD substrates are usually appended with polyubiquitin chains that serve as a molecular tag for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. However, CTA1 avoids the standard ERAD route of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation because it has a paucity of lysine residues for ubiquitin conjugation (18Hazes B. Read R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11051-11054Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I.

Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 300: 95-125PubMed Google Scholar). However, p97 appears to play a minimal role in CTA1 dislocation (20Kothe M. Ye Y. Wagner J.S. De Luca H.E. Kern E. Rapoport T.A.

An alternative model has proposed a ratchet mechanism, which involves the spontaneous refolding of CTA1 as it enters the cytosol (19Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recent CTA1 structural studies do not support this model, as it has been shown that the isolated CTA1 subunit is a partially disordered, thermally unstable protein (22Pande A.H. Scaglione P.

Because CTA1 is in an unfolded conformation at 37 °C, an as yet unidentified host protein must provide the driving force for CTA1 extraction from the ER.In this report we demonstrate that Hsp90 is required for CTA1 dislocation to the cytosol. The loss of Hsp90 function did not prevent CT transport to the ER but did inhibit the ER-to-cytosol export of CTA1. This, in turn, blocked CT activity against both cultured cells and ileal loops. Hsp90 has been shown to maintain membrane-embedded ERAD substrates in a soluble state and to help determine the fate of misfolded proteins (25Youker R.T. Walsh P. Beilharz T. Lithgow T. Brodsky J.L.

This work establishes a new role for Hsp90 in the extraction of a soluble ERAD substrate from the ER.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHsp90 functions in toxin translocation across the endosomal membrane (28Ratts R.

To address this issue, SPR was used to determine whether Hsp90 could directly interact with the isolated CTA1 subunit at physiological temperature (Fig. 1A). Hsp90 binding to CTA1 occurred in an ATP-dependent manner that was blocked by GA. This demonstrated that Hsp90 could bind to CTA1 at 37 °C. Because CTA1 is in an unfolded conformation at 37 °C (22Pande A.H. Scaglione P. Taylor M. Nemec K.N. Tuthill S. Moe D. Holmes R.K. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. J. Mol.

Biol. 2009; 393: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this also suggested that Hsp90 recognizes an unfolded conformation of CTA1 during the dislocation event. The interaction between CTA1 and Hsp90-ATP was not substantially affected by NECA, a drug that inhibits GRP94 but not Hsp90. GRP94, an ER-localized Hsp90, also bound to CTA1 in an ATP-dependent process that was blocked by both GA and NECA (Fig. 1B). The interaction between Hsp90 and CTA1 was much stronger than the interaction between GRP94 and CTA1: Hsp90 bound to CTA1 with a KD of 7 nm, whereas GRP94 bound to CTA1 with a KD of 292 nm (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Consistent with the dimeric natures of Hsp90 and GRP94 (31Zuehlke A. Johnson J.L. Biopolymers. 2010; 93: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), both chaperones bound to CTA1 in a 2:1 ratio of chaperone:toxin (Fig. 2). The specific, high-affinity interaction between Hsp90-ATP and CTA1 indicated that Hsp90 could be involved with the CT intoxication process.FIGURE 2Binding of CTA1 to Hsp90 or GRP94. A, Hsp90 was perfused over a CTA1-coated SPR sensor slide at 100, 400, 800, 1,600, and 3,200 nm concentrations. The ligand was removed from the perfusion buffer after 115 s. B, GRP94 was perfused over a CTA1-coated SPR sensor slide at 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,600 nm concentrations. The ligand was removed from the perfusion buffer after 118 s. Note that the results for Hsp90 and GRP94 are plotted on different scales. For all conditions, ATP was present in the 37 °C perfusion buffer. Measurements collected from three independent experiments are shown. The orange lines represent best fit curves derived from the raw data using 1:2 (CTA1:Hsp90 or CTA1:GRP94) binding models.

The elevated levels of cAMP resulting from CT intoxication were strongly inhibited in GA-treated cells. Whereas CT activity against untreated control cells exhibited a half-maximal effective concentration at 4 ng CT/ml, GA-treated cells only produced 36% of the maximal cAMP response when exposed to 100 ng CT/ml. Thus, at least 25-fold higher concentrations of CT would be required to elicit the same degree of intoxication in GA-treated cells as compared with the untreated control cells. In contrast, NECA-treated cells exhibited the same level of sensitivity to CT as the untreated control cells (Fig. 3A). GA-induced toxin resistance could not, therefore, be attributed to the inactivation of GRP94. NECA-treated cells were resistant to ricin, another AB toxin that uses the ERAD system for A chain dislocation to the cytosol (Fig. 3B). This observation was consistent with published results (32Spooner R.A. Hart P.J. Cook J.P. Pietroni P. Rogon C. Höhfeld J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17408-17413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that NECA was functional at the concentration used in our CT assay. Additional control experiments demonstrated that GA did not block the cytopathic activity of a CTA1 construct that was expressed directly in the cytosol of cells transfected with a CTA1-encoding plasmid (27Teter K. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). The inhibitory effect of GA thus appeared to involve an event upstream of toxin-target interactions. Furthermore, GA did not inhibit the forskolin-induced elevation of intracellular cAMP: cells treated with GA and forskolin produced 100 ± 2% of the cAMP levels recorded for cells treated with forskolin alone (n = 3). Forskolin activates adenylate cyclase without the input of Gsα, so this observation demonstrated that GA did not directly inhibit the production of cAMP by adenylate cyclase.FIGURE 3GA but not NECA inhibits CT intoxication. A, CHO cells were incubated with varying concentrations of CT in the absence of additional treatment, in the presence of 0.1 μm GA, or in the presence of 0.1 μm NECA. After 2 h of continual toxin exposure, toxicity was assessed from the elevated levels of intracellular cAMP. The means ± S.E. of at least four independent experiments with triplicate samples are shown. B, CHO cells were incubated for 4 h with varying concentrations of ricin in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm NECA. Toxicity was then determined from the incorporation of [35S]methionine into newly synthesized proteins. The averages ± ranges of two independent experiments with triplicate samples are shown. C, surgically sealed sections of rat intestine were injected with 2 μg/ml of CT in the absence or presence of 15 μm GA. Two other loops were injected with only 15 μm GA or with PBS. Morphological examination (inset) and the calculation of fluid accumulation were performed 7 h post-injection. Results presented in the graph represent the averages ± S.D. of data obtained from 4 rats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GA also inhibited CT activity in the ileal loop model of intoxication (Fig. 3C). Surgically sealed sections of intestine were injected with 2 μg/ml of CT in the absence or presence of GA. Seven hours later, the CT-injected loop displayed the distended morphology indicative of water accumulation resulting from productive intoxication. In contrast, loops that were injected with both CT and 15 μm GA exhibited substantially attenuated fluid accumulation and intestinal distension. GA derivatives have been evaluated as anti-cancer agents in clinical trials (33Powers M.V. Workman P. Endocr. Relat.

The protective effect of GA in a physiological model of intoxication suggests that it could also be used as a therapeutic to prevent or possibly treat cholera.Toxin resistance can result from an inhibition of toxin dislocation from the ER to the cytosol (9Bernardi K.M.

Pande A.H. Taylor M. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine if GA blocked toxin export to the cytosol, we used an established dislocation assay (24Massey S. Banerjee T. Pande A.H. Taylor M. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Forster M.L. Sivick K. Park Y.N. Arvan P. Lencer W.I. Tsai B. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to monitor the appearance of CTA1 in the cytosol of intoxicated HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Like CHO cells, GA-treated HeLa cells were protected from CT as assessed by cAMP production (data not shown). After a 30 min exposure to CT at 4 °C, HeLa cells were chased for 2 h at 37 °C in the absence of additional toxin. Separate organelle and cytosol fractions were then collected from digitonin-permeabilized cells. Control experiments demonstrated the fidelity of our fractionation protocol: Western blot analysis detected the majority of Hsp90 in the supernatant (i.e. cytosolic) fraction, while PDI, a soluble ER protein, was found exclusively in the pellet fraction, which contained the intact ER and other membranes (Fig. 4A). After background subtraction, semi-quantitative analysis of the PDI Western blot detected a negligible amount of PDI (0.5%) in the supernatant fraction (n = 3). Additional Western blot analysis with non-reducing SDS-PAGE was performed in order to track the intracellular localization of CTA1 (Fig. 4B). The 21 kDa CTA1 subunit is initially synthesized as part of a larger, 26 kDa CTA precursor (1De Haan L. Hirst T.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Sánchez J. Holmgren J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Proteolytic nicking of CTA generates a disulfide-linked CTA1/CTA2 heterodimer, which is reductively cleaved in the ER; only the reduced CTA1 subunit enters the cytosol. Consistent with these observations, we detected both disulfide-linked CTA1/CTA2 and reduced CTA1 in the organelle fractions but only detected reduced CTA1 in the cytosol fractions. In comparison to the untreated control cells, the distribution of cytosolic CTA1 was unaffected by NECA treatment. However, GA-treated cells contained less cytosolic CTA1 than either untreated or NECA-treated cells. It thus appeared that Hsp90 function was required for efficient passage of CTA1 into the cytosol.FIGURE 4GA but not NECA inhibits CTA1 dislocation to the cytosol. HeLa cells were pulse-labeled at 4 °C for 30 min with 1 μg/ml of CT. The cells were then chased for 2 h at 37 °C in toxin-free medium containing no additions, 0.1 μm GA, 0.1 μm NECA, or 5 μg/ml of BfA. Permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin was used to partition cell extracts into separate organelle (pellet; P) and cytosolic (supernatant; S) fractions. A, both fractions from untreated cells were probed by Western blot to establish the distributions of cytosolic marker Hsp90 and ER marker PDI. B, both fractions from untreated (no treatment) or drug-treated cells were probed for the presence of CTA1 by Western blot analysis of non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels. The upper band represents the disulfide-linked CTA1/CTA2 heterodimer; the middle band results from nonspecific cross-reactivity; and the lower band represents reduced CTA1. C, an SPR sensor slide coated with an anti-CTA antibody was used to detect the cytosolic pool of CTA1 from untreated or drug-treated cells. D, media samples taken from cells at the end of the chase were perfused over an SPR sensor slide coated with an anti-CTA antibody. For both C and D, CTA standards were perfused over the sensor slide as positive controls. The cytosolic fraction and medium from unintoxicated cells were also perfused over the sensor slides as negative controls for panels C and D, respectively. At the end of each experiment, bound sample was stripped from the sensor slide. One of four representative experiments is shown for each SPR experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To strengthen our Western blot analysis with an alternative and quantitative detection method, we employed the technique of SPR. HeLa cells exposed to CT at 4 °C were again fractionated into membrane and cytosolic components after a 2 h chase at 37 °C. In this experiment, the cytosolic fractions were perfused over a SPR sensor slide that had been coated with an anti-CTA antibody (Fig. 4C). A negligible background signal was obtained from unintoxicated cells, whereas control cells intoxicated in the absence of drug treatment produced a signal that was comparable to the response obtained from the 0.1-ng CTA standard (n = 4). The low level of cytosolic CTA1 in control cells was consistent with the known inefficiency of CT trafficking from the cell surface to the ER dislocation site (4Lencer W.I. de Almeida J.B. Moe S. Stow J.L. Ausiello D.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2941-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Orlandi P.A. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. J. Biol.

NECA-treated cells produced an SPR signal similar to the response obtained from the untreated control cells. In contrast, GA-treated cells produced an SPR signal that was substantially less than the response obtained from the untreated control cells. Exposure of untreated or GA-treated cells to proteasome inhibitors did not alter these results, which indicated the data were not affected by potential toxin degradation in the cytosol (supplemental Fig. S2). The detection of a minor pool of cytosolic CTA1 in GA-treated cells by SPR but not by Western blot reflects the greater level of sensitivity provided by SPR-based assays. CTA1 was not detected in the cytosol of cells treated BfA, a drug that prevents CT transport from the cell surface to the ER dislocation site (4Lencer W.I. de Almeida J.B. Moe S. Stow J.L.

Chem. 2003; 377: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar), so we calculated the levels of cytosolic CTA1 from a plot of the ka values for the CTA standards. With this method, we estimated that 2.4-fold less CTA1 was in the cytosol of GA-treated cells than in the cytosol of untreated or NECA-treated cells (supplemental Table S1). A substantial inhibition of intoxication resulting from reduced, but not absent, levels of cytosolic CTA1 has previously been reported (13Teter K. Holmes R.K. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 6172-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Teter K. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Massey S. Banerjee T. Pande A.H. Taylor M. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The degree of intoxication appears to be influenced by numerous factors, including (i) the extent of CTA1 dislocation to the cytosol; (ii) the rate of CTA1 degradation in the cytosol; (iii) CTA1 activity against Gsα; and (iv) the de-activation of ADP-ribosylated Gsα by proteolysis or by the action of ADP-ribosyl(arginine)protein hydrolase (9Bernardi K.M.

Chem. 2010; 285: 6145-6152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The balance between these factors usually favors CTA1 activity against Gsα and, thus, productive intoxication. However, as shown here and in previous work, this balance can be shifted to protect cells from intoxication without completely eliminating the cytosolic pool of CTA1.To ensure that GA did not inhibit the intracellular trafficking of CT, we screened media samples from toxin-treated cells for the presence of free CTA1. The CT holotoxin travels by vesicle carriers from the cell surface to the ER (3Wernick N.L.B. Chinnapen D.J.-F. Cho J.A. Lencer W.I. Toxins. 2010; 2: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Reduction and chaperone-assisted dissociation of CTA1 from the rest of the toxin then allows the free A1 subunit to move from the ER to the cytosol. In addition, a fraction of dissociated CTA1 enters the secretory pathway and is released into the extracellular medium (24Massey S. Banerjee T. Pande A.H. Taylor M. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, our SPR assay detected the secretion of CTA1 from intoxicated HeLa cells (Fig. 4D). Nearly equivalent amounts of CTA1 were secreted into the medium of untreated cells and GA-treated cells. No signal was obtained from the medium of BfA-treated cells, thus demonstrating that toxin trafficking to the ER was a prerequisite for CTA1 secretion into the medium. The aforementioned results were obtained with a SPR sensor slide that had been coated with an anti-CTA antibody. When the media samples were perfused over an SPR sensor slide that had been coated with an antibody against the cell-binding CTB subunit, no positive signals were obtained (data not shown). Thus, the secreted toxin was free CTA1 and not the CT holotoxin. Because untreated and GA-treated cells released equivalent amounts of free CTA1, GA did not appear to block holotoxin trafficking to the ER, CTA1 dissociation from the rest of the toxin in the ER, or the secretion of free CTA1.To further demonstrate that GA inhibited the CTA1 dislocation event rather than an upstream CT trafficking step, we combined our dislocation assay with a plasmid-based system to express CTA1 directly in the ER of transfected CHO cells (12Teter K. Allyn R.L. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Teter K. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). With this system, CTA1 is co-translationally inserted into the ER and then dislocated back to the cytosol. Similar strategies have been used by other labs to monitor toxin dislocation (10Schmitz A. Herrgen H. Winkeler A. Herzog V. J.

https://openalex.org/W2088203826,"Background Modulation of infected host cells by intracellular pathogens is a prerequisite for successful establishment of infection. In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, potential candidates for erythrocyte remodelling include the apicomplexan-specific FIKK kinase family (20 members), several of which have been demonstrated to be transported into the erythrocyte cytoplasm via Maurer's clefts. Methodology In the current work, we have knocked out two members of this gene family (Pf fikk7.1 and Pf fikk12), whose products are localized at the inner face of the erythrocyte membrane. Both mutant parasite lines were viable and erythrocytes infected with these parasites showed no detectable alteration in their ability to adhere in vitro to endothelial receptors such as chondroitin sulfate A and CD36. However, we observed sizeable decreases in the rigidity of infected erythrocytes in both knockout lines. Mutant parasites were further analyzed using a phospho-proteomic approach, which revealed distinct phosphorylation profiles in ghost preparations of infected erythrocytes. Knockout parasites showed a significant reduction in the level of phosphorylation of a protein of approximately 80 kDa for FIKK12-KO in trophozoite stage and a large protein of about 300 kDa for FIKK7.1-KO in schizont stage. Conclusions Our results suggest that FIKK members phosphorylate different membrane skeleton proteins of the infected erythrocyte in a stage-specific manner, inducing alterations in the mechanical properties of the parasite-infected red blood cell. This suggests that these host cell modifications may contribute to the parasites' survival in the circulation of the human host."
https://openalex.org/W2089393518,"BLT2 is a low-affinity leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) receptor that is activated by 12(S)-hydroxyheptadeca-5Z,8E,10E-trienoic acid (12-HHT) and LTB(4). Despite the well-defined proinflammatory roles of BLT1, the in vivo functions of BLT2 remain elusive. To clarify the role of BLT receptors in intestinal inflammation, we assessed susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice lacking either BLT1 or BLT2. BLT2(-/-) mice exhibited increased sensitivity to DSS as compared to wild-type and BLT1(-/-) mice, with more severe body weight loss and inflammation. Expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, chemokines such as CXC chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) and C-C motif chemokine 19 (CCL19), and metalloproteinases was highly up-regulated in the colons of DSS-treated BLT2(-/-) mice, and there was an enhanced accumulation of activated macrophages. Phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was also markedly accelerated in the crypts of DSS-treated BLT2(-/-) mice. Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells transfected with BLT2 exhibited enhanced barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran leakage through MDCK monolayers. Thus, BLT2 is expressed in colon cryptic cells and appears to protect against DSS-induced colitis, possibly by enhancing barrier function in epithelial cells of the colon. These novel results suggest a direct anti-inflammatory role of BLT2 that is distinct from the proinflammatory roles of BLT1."
https://openalex.org/W2029745930,"The shikimate pathway, responsible for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, is required for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a potential drug target. The first reaction is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). Feedback regulation of DAH7PS activity by aromatic amino acids controls shikimate pathway flux. Whereas Mycobacterium tuberculosis DAH7PS (MtuDAH7PS) is not inhibited by the addition of Phe, Tyr, or Trp alone, combinations cause significant loss of enzyme activity. In the presence of 200 μm Phe, only 2.4 μm Trp is required to reduce enzymic activity to 50%. Reaction kinetics were analyzed in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of Trp/Phe or Trp/Tyr. In the absence of inhibitors, the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to substrate erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), whereas the addition of inhibitor combinations caused significant homotropic cooperativity with respect to E4P, with Hill coefficients of 3.3 (Trp/Phe) and 2.8 (Trp/Tyr). Structures of MtuDAH7PS/Trp/Phe, MtuDAH7PS/Trp, and MtuDAH7PS/Phe complexes were determined. The MtuDAH7PS/Trp/Phe homotetramer binds four Trp and six Phe molecules. Binding sites for both aromatic amino acids are formed by accessory elements to the core DAH7PS (β/α)(8) barrel that are unique to the type II DAH7PS family and contribute to the tight dimer and tetramer interfaces. A comparison of the liganded and unliganded MtuDAH7PS structures reveals changes in the interface areas associated with inhibitor binding and a small displacement of the E4P binding loop. These studies uncover a previously unrecognized mode of control for the branched pathways of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis involving synergistic inhibition by specific pairs of pathway end products."

ANGPTL4 protein was observed by immunofluorescence in osteoclasts and osteoblasts in vivo. Normoxic inducers of HIF (CoCl(2), desferrioxamine, and l-mimosine) and 100 ng/ml ANGPTL4 stimulated osteoclastic resorption 2- to 3-fold in assays of lacunar dentine resorption, without affecting osteoclast viability. Isoform-specific HIF-1α small interfering RNA ablated hypoxic induction of ANGPTL4 and of resorption, which was rescued by addition of exogenous ANGPTL4 (P<0.001). In the osteoblastic Saos2 cell line, ANGPTL4 caused a dose-dependent increase in proliferation (P<0.01, 100 ng/ml) and, at lower doses (1-25 ng/ml), mineralization. These results demonstrate that HIF is sufficient to enhance osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and that ANGPTL4 can compensate for HIF-1α deficiency with respect to stimulation of osteoclast activity and also augments osteoblast proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2141586391,"The membrane-spanning segments of integral membrane proteins often are flanked by aromatic or charged amino acid residues, which may ""anchor"" the transmembrane orientation. Single spanning transmembrane peptides such as those of the WALP family, acetyl-GWW(LA)(n)LWWA-amide, furthermore adopt a moderate average tilt within lipid bilayer membranes. To understand the anchor residue dependence of the tilt, we introduce Leu-Ala ""spacers"" between paired anchors and in some cases replace the outer tryptophans. The resulting peptides, acetyl-GX(2)ALW(LA)(6)LWLAX(22)A-amide, have Trp, Lys, Arg, or Gly in the two X positions. The apparent average orientations of the core helical sequences were determined in oriented phosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes of varying thickness using solid-state (2)H NMR spectroscopy. When X is Lys, Arg, or Gly, the direction of the tilt is essentially constant in different lipids and presumably is dictated by the tryptophans (Trp(5) and Trp(19)) that flank the inner helical core. The Leu-Ala spacers are no longer helical. The magnitude of the apparent helix tilt furthermore scales nicely with the bilayer thickness except when X is Trp. When X is Trp, the direction of tilt is less well defined in each phosphatidylcholine bilayer and varies up to 70° among 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer membranes. Indeed, the X = Trp case parallels earlier observations in which WALP family peptides having multiple Trp anchors show little dependence of the apparent tilt magnitude on bilayer thickness. The results shed new light on the interactions of arginine, lysine, tryptophan, and even glycine at lipid bilayer membrane interfaces."

https://openalex.org/W1974168501,"Adiponectin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in adipocytes, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that AMP, generated in activating fatty acids to their CoA derivatives, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetases, is involved in AMPK activation by adiponectin. Moreover, in adipocytes, insulin affects the subcellular localization of acyl-CoA synthetase FATP1. Thus, we also tested whether insulin activates AMPK in these cells and, if so, whether it activates through a similar mechanism. We examined these hypotheses by measuring the AMP/ATP ratio and AMPK activation on adiponectin and insulin stimulation and after knocking down acyl-CoA synthetases in adipocytes. We show that adiponectin activation of AMPK is accompanied by an ∼2-fold increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. Moreover, FATP1 and Acsll, the 2 major acyl-CoA synthetase isoforms in adipocytes, are essential for AMPK activation by adiponectin. We also show that after 40 min. insulin activated AMPK in adipocytes, which was coupled with a 5-fold increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. Knockdown studies show that FATP1 and Acsl1 are required for these processes, as well as for stimulation of long-chain fatty acid uptake by adiponection and insulin. These studies demonstrate that a change in cellular energy state is associated with AMPK activation by both adiponectin and insulin, which requires the activity of FATP1 and Acsll.—Liu, Q., Gauthier, M.-L., Sun, L., Ruderman, N., Lodish, H.

https://openalex.org/W2163879682,"Cellular hypoxia, if severe enough, results usually in injury or cell death. Our research in this area has focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxic tissue injury to explore strategies to prevent injury or enhance tolerance. The current experiments were designed to determine the genetic basis for adaptation to long term low O(2) environments.With long term experimental selection over many generations, we obtained a Drosophila melanogaster strain that can live perpetually in extremely low, normally lethal, O(2) condition (as low as 4% O(2)). This strain shows a dramatic phenotypic divergence from controls, including a decreased recovery time from anoxic stupor, a higher rate of O(2 )consumption in hypoxic conditions, and a decreased body size and mass due to decreased cell number and size. Expression arrays showed that about 4% of the Drosophila genome altered in expression and about half of the alteration was down-regulation. The contribution of some altered transcripts to hypoxia tolerance was examined by testing the survival of available corresponding P-element insertions (and their excisions) under extremely low O(2) conditions. We found that down-regulation of several candidate genes including Best1, broad, CG7102, dunce, lin19-like and sec6 conferred severe hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila.We have identified a number of genes that play an important role in the survival of a selected Drosophila strain in extremely low O(2) conditions, selected by decreasing O(2) availability over many generations. Because of conservation of pathways, we believe that such genes are critical in hypoxia adaptation in physiological or pathological conditions not only in Drosophila but also in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2095404780,"An integrative approach combining biophysical and microbiological methods was used to characterize the antibiotic translocation through the outer membrane of Providencia stuartii. Two novel members of the General Bacterial Porin family of Enterobacteriaceae, named OmpPst1 and OmpPst2, were identified in P. stuartii. In the presence of ertapenem (ERT), cefepime (FEP), and cefoxitin (FOX) in growth media, several resistant derivatives of P. stuartii ATCC 29914 showed OmpPst1-deficiency. These porin-deficient strains showed significant decrease of susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. OmpPst1 and OmpPst2 were purified to homogeneity and reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers to study their biophysical characteristics and their interactions with β-lactam molecules. Determination of β-lactam translocation through OmpPst1 and OmpPst2 indicated that the strength of interaction decreased in the order of ertapenem ≫ cefepime > cefoxitin. Moreover, the translocation of these antibiotics through OmpPst1 was more efficient than through OmpPst2. Heterologous expression of OmpPst1 in the porin-deficient E. coli strain BL21(DE3)omp8 was associated with a higher antibiotic susceptibility of the E. coli cells to β-lactams compared with expression of OmpPst2. All our data enlighten the involvement of porins in the resistance of P. stuartii to β-lactam antibiotics."

Astrocytes are equipped with a variety of plasmalemmal K+ uptake mechanisms, including Na+,K+-ATPase, ion transporters (e.g. Na+-K+-2Cl− co-transport), and voltage-activated K+ channels (e.g. inward rectifier (Kir), delayed rectifier (Kdr), and A-type (Ka) K+ channels). Astrocytes are also extensively coupled by gap junctions that aid in the spatial redistribution of K+ from areas of high [K+]o/i to those of low [K+]o/i (1Walz W. Neurochem.

This spatial buffering is achieved when a local increase in [K+]o causes the K+ equilibrium potential (EK) to become more positive than the membrane potential, allowing K+ influx into an astrocyte. Meanwhile, at more distant sites, where EK remains more negative than the membrane potential, K+ leaves the syncytium. Another mechanism that could limit potentially detrimental increases in astrocytic [K+]i that might otherwise occur during K+ uptake is transient sequestration into intracellular stores. Mitochondria in close association with the plasmalemmal membrane have been shown to play an important role in internal Ca2+ and Na+ sequestration in a variety of cell types (7Pivovarova N.B.

Several lines of evidence are consistent with a potential role for mitochondria in K+ sequestration. First, mitochondria are intimately associated with the plasma membrane (14Golovina V.A. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Kolikova J. Afzalov R. Giniatullina A. Surin A. Giniatullin R. Khiroug L. Brain Cell. Biol. 2006; 35: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), placing them in an appropriate location to sequester K+ that enters a cell across the plasma membrane. Second, the mitochondrial inner membrane is endowed with a variety of K+ channels and transporters that contribute to the regulation of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), matrix volume, and oxidative phosphorylation (16Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Third, mitochondria have a negative resting membrane potential, creating a driving force for K+ uptake (17Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Fourth, mitochondria maintain matrix [K+] at 150–180 mm (18Kowaltowski A.J. Cosso R.G. Campos C.B. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42802-42807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), a higher concentration than [K+]i (∼100 mm) (20Walz W. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 135: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, mitochondria in cardiomyocytes have been reported to act as sinks for K+o (21Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the role of mitochondria in the uptake of K+o by astrocytes. To avoid the difficulties and potential artifacts associated with isolated mitochondrial preparations (e.g. see Refs. 22Oliveira J.M. Jekabsons M.B. Chen S. Lin A. Rego A.C. Gonçalves J. Ellerby L.M.

Aspects Med. 2004; 25: 365-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) we assessed mitochondrial K+ uptake in intact astrocytes. We determined that mitochondrial KATP channels (mito-KATP) and potentially mitochondrial connexin43 (Cx43), a protein that is abundantly expressed in astrocytes and has recently been found to contribute to K+ uptake in isolated cardiac mitochondria (24Miro-Casas E. Ruiz-Meana M. Agullo E. Stahlhofen S. Rodríguez-Sinovas A. Cabestrero A. Jorge I. Torre I. Vazquez J. Boengler K. Schulz R. Heusch G. Garcia-Dorado D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 83: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), play a role in the temporary sequestration of K+ by astrocyte mitochondria. Cortical astrocytes from neonatal (1–2 days) CD-1 wild-type mice were cultured and plated, unless otherwise indicated, onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates and maintained as previously described (25Ozog M.A. Siushansian R. Naus C.C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Primary astrocytes were used between 7 and 28 days in vitro and the results obtained were not dependent on the length of time the astrocytes were maintained in culture. For a portion of the experiments, wild-type (Cx43+/+), heterozygous (Cx43+/−), and Cx43-null (Cx43−/−) astrocytes were obtained from CD57/Bl6 mice generated by crossing heterozygous mice with the Gja1 null mutation (26Reaume A.G. de Sousa P.A.

Tissue from each newborn pup was genotyped by PCR using primers specific for the wild-type Cx43 and the disrupted Cx43 gene, as previously described (27Naus C.C. Bechberger J.F. Zhang Y. Venance L. Yamasaki H. Juneja S.C. Kidder G.M. Giaume C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The standard perfusion medium contained (in mm): 136.5 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 NaH2PO4, 1.5 MgSO4, 10 d-glucose, 2 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES (titrated to pH 7.35 with 10 m NaOH). Bicarbonate-containing perfusion medium contained (in mm): 117.5 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 NaH2PO4, 1.5 MgSO4, 10 d-glucose, 2 CaCl2, and 29 NaHCO3, and was equilibrated with 5% CO2 in air (pHo 7.35). Medium containing high [K+] or the K+ channel blocking mixture (3 mm BaCl2, 5 mm 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and 1 mm TEA) were prepared by equimolar substitution for NaCl. In solutions containing BaCl2, NaH2PO4 was omitted and MgSO4 was replaced with MgCl2. Test compounds (bumetanide, carbenoxolone (CBX), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), diazoxide, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), furosemide, glyburide, 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), glycyrrhizic acid (GZA), 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD), oligomycin, omeprazole, ouabain, quinine, saponin, and timolol) were obtained from Sigma and applied by superfusion. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) unless otherwise indicated. Astrocytes were placed for 1 h at room temperature in standard HEPES-buffered medium containing 5 μm of the K+-sensitive fluorophore potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester (PBFI) and 0.05% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were then placed in fluorophore-free medium for 30 min to ensure de-esterification of the fluorophore and then mounted in a perfusion chamber on a Zeiss Axioskop2 FS Plus microscope (Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd., ON). Astrocytes were continuously superfused at ∼2 ml/min throughout the course of an experiment. Measurements of [K+]i with PBFI were performed using the dual excitation ratio method. Fluorescence emissions >505 nm were captured by a 12-bit digital cooled CCD camera (Retiga EXi, QImaging, Burnaby, BC) from regions of interest placed on individual astrocytes. Raw emission intensity data at each excitation wavelength (340 and 380 nm; Lambda DG-5, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) were collected every 6 s, corrected for background fluorescence, and background-subtracted ratio pairs (BI340/BI380) were analyzed off-line. In a cell-free system using the camera gain and exposure settings employed throughout the study, fluorescence signals were not detectable from any of the test compounds employed. In addition, a subset of experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 3A were performed in non-PBFI-loaded cells and no changes in 340 and 380 nm emission signals or 340/380 ratio values were detected upon exposure to CCCP or high [K+]o, indicating that endogenous fluorescence from molecules (e.g. NADH) is unlikely to contribute to the changes in the PBFI-derived ratio values measured in the study (data not shown). Furthermore, CCCP responses were nearly abolished in gramicidin-permeabilized PBFI-loaded astrocytes (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating it is unlikely that the effect of CCCP to increase the PBFI signal represents an artifact. To determine the sensitivity of PBFI to K+ in our preparation of cultured astrocytes, in situ calibration experiments were performed in which astrocytes were exposed sequentially to medium containing (in mm): 1.5 NaH2PO4, 1.5 MgSO4, 10 d-glucose, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, four different [K+] values (range 80–140 mm), LiCl (as appropriate to balance osmolarity), and 10 μm gramicidin (pH 7.35 with 1 m LiOH). Additionally, sensitivity to Na+ was assessed by performing calibrations in the presence of 65 mm NaCl. Sensitivity to pH was also assessed by adjusting the pH to either 6.5 or 8 with 1 m LiOH. PBFI sensitivity to 80, 100, and 140 mm K+o was also assessed in the presence of 10 μm CCCP. PBFI-derived BI340/BI380 ratio values were normalized to the BI340/BI380 ratio value obtained at [K+] = 100 mm, and the data points relating [K+] to the normalized, background-subtracted PBFI ratio values were fitted (r2 > 0.99) by a three-parameter hyperbolic equation (28Diarra A. Sheldon C. Church J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1623-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two paradigms were employed in this study. First, mitochondrial K+ was assessed using a protocol similar to that previously utilized in the examination of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering (23Duchen M.R. Mol. Aspects Med. 2004; 25: 365-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 29Murchison D. Griffith W.H. Brain Res. 2000; 854: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Murchison D. Zawieja D.C. Griffith W.H. Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial membrane uncoupler CCCP (10 μm) was applied for 2 min to reversibly collapse ΔΨm, which caused efflux of mitochondrial K+ that was detected by cytoplasmic PBFI (e.g. see Fig. 2A), giving a measure of mitochondrial K+ content. [K+]o was then increased (or decreased) for 5 min prior to the next 2-min application of CCCP (e.g. see Fig. 3, A and B). The difference in the magnitude of response reflected mitochondrial K+ sequestration. For analysis, BI340/BI380 values obtained under resting conditions at the start of an experiment were subtracted from the BI340/BI380 values measured during the entire experiment. Changes in [K+]i evoked by brief (2 min) exposures to CCCP were quantified as the percent difference between the peak CCCP-induced BI340/BI380 transient measured after exposure to altered [K+]o and the peak CCCP-induced BI340/BI380 transient measured in the same cells during perfusion with normal [K+]o (3 mm). In the second paradigm, 10 μm CCCP was applied for an extended period of time (∼15 min) to uncouple the mitochondrial membrane thereby inhibiting K+ sequestration. [K+]o was altered in the continued presence of CCCP and [K+]i was monitored by changes in cytoplasmic PBFI ratio values. This paradigm was used to reflect changes in K+ entry across the plasma membrane in the absence of mitochondrial sequestration. For analysis, changes in [K+]i observed during changes in [K+]o were quantified by subtracting the steady-state BI340/BI380 value measured prior to altering [K+]o from the average BI340/BI380 value obtained over the final minute of exposure to altered [K+]o (e.g. see Fig. 3, E and F). Measurements of [Na+]i in astrocytes exposed to CCCP were performed with sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, as detailed previously (28Diarra A. Sheldon C. Church J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1623-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sheldon C. Diarra A. Cheng Y.M. Church J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11057-11069Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Measurements of mitochondrial K+ were performed using a PBFI loading protocol that favors mitochondrial dye localization (24Miro-Casas E. Ruiz-Meana M. Agullo E. Stahlhofen S. Rodríguez-Sinovas A.

Science. 2002; 298: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In brief, astrocytes were placed for 1 h at 37 °C in standard HEPES-buffered medium containing 10 μm PBFI and 0.05% pluronic F-127. Cells were then placed in fluorophore-free medium for 30 min. To permeabilize the plasma membrane and release PBFI from the cytoplasmic compartment cells were treated with 50 μg/ml of saponin for 5 min (33Xu W. Liu Y. Wang S. McDonald T. Van Eyk J.E. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Science. 2002; 298: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) in a mitochondria medium containing (in mm) 250 sucrose, 25 Tris, 3 EGTA, 5 MgCl2, 5 succinate, and 5 glutamate (pH 7.3) (32Ljubkovic M. Marinovic J. Fuchs A. Bosnjak Z.J. Bienengraeber M. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Preparations used to assess mitochondrial K+ uptake (e.g. see Fig. 6) were additionally incubated in a medium containing (mm) 200 sucrose, 50 TEA, 25 Tris, 3 EGTA, 5 MgCl2, 5 succinate, and 5 glutamate (pH 7.3) for 20 min to deplete mitochondrial K+ (see Ref. 24Miro-Casas E. Ruiz-Meana M. Agullo E. Stahlhofen S. Rodríguez-Sinovas A. Cabestrero A. Jorge I. Torre I. Vazquez J. Boengler K. Schulz R. Heusch G. Garcia-Dorado D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 83: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from the permeabilized astrocytes were subsequently imaged in the mitochondria medium. K+ uptake into mitochondria was assessed by measuring the rate of change of PBFI-derived ratio values upon exposure to 25 mm K+ (solution containing (in mm) 200 sucrose, 25 KCl, 25 Tris, 3 EGTA, 5 MgCl2, 5 succinate, and 5 glutamate; pH 7.3) applied at a bath perfusion rate of 4.2 ml/min. At the camera settings utilized in this study, fluorescence signals were not discernable in PBFI-free saponin-treated astrocytes (data not shown). Astrocytes were placed in standard HEPES-buffered medium containing 5 μm rhodamine-123 (Molecular Probes Inc.) for 15 min and then washed in standard HEPES medium for 30 min. The dye was excited at 495 nm and emissions were collected at >505 nm. For analysis, ΔF/F was measured by dividing rhodamine-123-derived BI495 values measured during exposure to high [K+]o by the average of BI495 values obtained during the control portion of an experiment. Intracellular ATP content was determined by luciferin/luciferase luminescence using an ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes Inc.). Astrocytes grown in 6-well plates were rinsed with standard perfusion medium. Cultures were then treated with (a) standard perfusion medium, (b) 10 μm CCCP for 2 min followed by a 10-min wash with standard perfusion medium, or (c) 10 μm CCCP for 10 min. Cells were then lysed with 80 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Aliquots (10 μl) were then obtained and added to the luciferin/luciferase luminescence reaction mixture and sample luminescence was detected with a Berthold LB9507 Lumat luminometer (Fisher Scientific). ATP measurements were made in duplicate. Samples were also obtained for protein concentration determination using the BCA protein quantification kit (Pierce). Cellular ATP content was estimated by assuming an astrocyte volume of 4.8 liters/kg of protein (34Olson J.E. Sankar R. Holtzman D. James A. Fleischhacker D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whole cell fractions were obtained by lysing Cx43+/+ and Cx43−/− astrocytes grown on 100-mm culture dishes in radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing phosphatase (Sigma) and protease inhibitors (Roche). The cells were then scraped and the solution was drawn up with a 22-guage needle and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein quantification kit (Pierce). Mitochondria were obtained from sister cultures using a mitochondria isolation kit (Pierce). Both mitochondrial and whole cell fractions were boiled for 1 min in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. Whole cell fractions containing 10 μg of protein and 10 μg of samples of the mitochondrial fraction were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in parallel with molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Proteins were transferred and probed according to standard protocols (35Bates D.C. Sin W.C. Aftab Q. Naus C.C. Glia. 2007; 55: 1554-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies at the dilutions indicated were applied overnight at 4 °C: 1:8,000 anti-connexin43 produced in rabbit (Sigma, catalogue C6219), 1:1,500 anti-OxPhos Complex V subunit α produced in mouse (Molecular Probes Inc.), or 1:2,500 anti-N-cadherin produced in mouse (BD Transduction Laboratories). Horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody (Cedarlane Laboratories, ON) was applied for 1 h at a 1:20,000 dilution and subsequently detected with Super-Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The labeled blots were exposed to x-ray film to visualize antibody binding. As necessary, the blot was stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with a different primary antibody. To ensure equivalent loading of protein samples the blots were stripped and probed with 1:10,000 anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (Cedarlane Laboratories). Results are reported as mean ± S.E. with the accompanying n value referring to the number of cell populations (i.e. number of coverslips) analyzed under each experimental condition. In the imaging experiments, data were obtained simultaneously from 10 to 20 astrocytes per coverslip and averaged. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical comparisons were performed using Student's unpaired t test, with a 95% confidence limit. Determination of [K+]i with PBFI may be problematic because PBFI-free acid in aqueous solution exhibits a limited resolution for increases in [K+]i above the physiological range (36Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, incorporated inside cells, PBFI has successfully been employed to measure increases in [K+]i from high resting [K+]i values (e.g. Refs. 37Froschauer E. Nowikovsky K. Schweyen R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Liu D. Slevin J.R. Lu C. Chan S.L. Hansson M. Elmér E. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 966-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Kasner S.E. Ganz M.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1992; 262: F462-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), findings that suggest that the K+ affinity of PBFI may become reduced in a cellular context (as is known to be the case for the related dye sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, the KD of which for Na+ displays a marked increase in cells compared with the dye in free solution (40Levi A.J. Lee C.O. Brooksby P. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1994; 5: 241-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). To examine this possibility, we performed in situ calibration experiments to examine the sensitivity of PBFI for [K+] over a physiologically relevant range ([K+]i = 80 to 140 mm). As shown in Fig. 1, increasing [K+]i from 80 to 140 mm in 20 mm steps led to detectable increases in PBFI-derived ratio values, and the dye did not appear to saturate even at 140 mm [K+]. A second potential difficulty with the use of PBFI in the present experiments is its reported affinity for Na+ ions (36Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether changes in [Na+]i could contribute to changes in PBFI fluorescence signals under the present experimental conditions, in situ calibration experiments (see Ref. 28Diarra A. Sheldon C. Church J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1623-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed by exposing astrocytes to either 1.5 or 65 mm [Na+]i (the latter approximating the rise in [Na+]i following a 5-min exposure to CCCP; see supplemental Fig. S2). The calibration curves obtained at 1.5 and 65 mm Na+ did not differ (Fig. 1B; p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA), indicating that the sensitivity of PBFI to [Na+] is weak under our experimental conditions and is unlikely to affect our measurements of [K+]i. In agreement, Kasner and Ganz (39Kasner S.E. Ganz M.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1992; 262: F462-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that [Na+] failed to alter the fluorescent properties of PBFI loaded into mesangial cells until [Na+]i was >75 mm. As protonophores, such as CCCP, are known to cause small changes in pH (41Buckler K.J. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 819-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) we also performed calibration experiments at pH 6.5 and 8. Neither alteration caused a change in PBFI sensitivity for [K+] in comparison to the standard calibration curve obtained at pH 7.35 (Fig. 1B; p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). In addition, 10 μm CCCP did not alter the sensitivity of PBFI for [K+] (Fig. 1B; p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). Furthermore, PBFI is known to be insensitive to changes in [Ca2+], [Mg2+], and osmolarity within the ranges expected in the present study (e.g. Ref. 36Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see also Ref. 42Kubota T. Shindo Y. Tokuno K. Komatsu H. Ogawa H. Kudo S. Kitamura Y. Suzuki K. Oka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations support the use of PBFI in the present study to measure increases in [K+]i above the resting level in astrocytes. Nevertheless, as discussed by Kasner and Ganz (39Kasner S.E. Ganz M.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1992; 262: F462-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the hyperbolic form of the PBFI calibration curve underscores the difficulty of determining accurate absolute values for [K+]i, especially at high concentrations of K+. In the present study, therefore, changes in [K+]i are presented as changes in PBFI-derived BI340/BI380 ratio values. Finally, fluorescent [ion] indicators (e.g. fura-2, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate) loaded as acetoxymethyl esters can enter internal organelles as well as the cytoplasm. To examine the potential compartmentalization of PBFI in astrocytes under the standard (room temperature) loading conditions employed for the majority of the experiments reported here, astrocytes were treated wi"
https://openalex.org/W2068466916,"Background The flaviviruses causing tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) persist at low but consistent levels in tick populations, despite short infectious periods in their mammalian hosts and transmission periods constrained by distinctly seasonal tick life cycles. In addition to systemic and vertical transmission, cofeeding transmission has been proposed as an important route for the persistence of TBE-causing viruses. Because cofeeding transmission requires ticks to feed simultaneously, the timing of tick activity may be critical to pathogen persistence. Existing models of tick-borne diseases do not incorporate all transmission routes and tick seasonality. Our aim is to evaluate the influence of seasonality on the relative importance of different transmission routes by using a comprehensive mathematical model. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a stage-structured population model that includes tick seasonality and evaluated the relative importance of the transmission routes for pathogens with short infectious periods, in particular Powassan virus (POWV) and the related “deer tick virus,” emergent encephalitis-causing flaviviruses in North America. We used the next generation matrix method to calculate the basic reproductive ratio and performed elasticity analyses. We confirmed that cofeeding transmission is critically important for such pathogens to persist in seasonal tick populations over the reasonable range of parameter values. At higher but still plausible rates of vertical transmission, our model suggests that vertical transmission can strongly enhance pathogen prevalence when it operates in combination with cofeeding transmission. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that the consistent prevalence of POWV observed in tick populations could be maintained by a combination of low vertical, intermediate cofeeding and high systemic transmission rates. When vertical transmission is weak, nymphal ticks support integral parts of the transmission cycle that are critical for maintaining the pathogen. We also extended the model to pathogens that cause chronic infections in hosts and found that cofeeding transmission could contribute to elevating prevalence even in these systems. Therefore, the common assumption that cofeeding transmission is not relevant in models of chronic host infection, such as Lyme disease, could lead to underestimating pathogen prevalence."

Although its biological function is unclear, Vdh is capable of catalyzing the two-step hydroxylation of VD3, i.e. the conversion of VD3 to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)VD3) and then of 25(OH)VD3 to 1α,25(OH)2VD3, a hormonal form of VD3. Here we describe the crystal structures of wild-type Vdh (Vdh-WT) in the substrate-free form and of the highly active quadruple mutant (Vdh-K1) generated by directed evolution in the substrate-free, VD3-bound, and 25(OH)VD3-bound forms. Vdh-WT exhibits an open conformation with the distal heme pocket exposed to the solvent both in the presence and absence of a substrate, whereas Vdh-K1 exhibits a closed conformation in both the substrate-free and substrate-bound forms. The results suggest that the conformational equilibrium was largely shifted toward the closed conformation by four amino acid substitutions scattered throughout the molecule. The substrate-bound structure of Vdh-K1 accommodates both VD3 and 25(OH)VD3 but in an anti-parallel orientation. The occurrence of the two secosteroid binding modes accounts for the regioselective sequential VD3 hydroxylation activities. Moreover, these structures determined before and after directed evolution, together with biochemical and spectroscopic data, provide insights into how directed evolution has worked for significant enhancement of both the VD3 25-hydroxylase and 25(OH)VD3 1α-hydroxylase activities.

https://openalex.org/W2011253692,"During mammalian protein N-glycosylation, 20% of all dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (LLO) appear as free oligosaccharides (fOS) bearing the di-N-acetylchitobiose (fOSGN2), or a single N-acetylglucosamine (fOSGN), moiety at their reducing termini. After sequential trimming by cytosolic endo beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase) and Man2c1 mannosidase, cytosolic fOS are transported into lysosomes. Why mammalian cells generate such large quantities of fOS remains unexplored, but fOSGN2 could be liberated from LLO by oligosaccharyltransferase, or from glycoproteins by NGLY1-encoded Peptide-N-Glycanase (PNGase). Also, in addition to converting fOSGN2 to fOSGN, the ENGASE-encoded cytosolic ENGase of poorly defined function could potentially deglycosylate glycoproteins. Here, the roles of Ngly1p and Engase1p during fOS metabolism were investigated in HepG2 cells.During metabolic radiolabeling and chase incubations, RNAi-mediated Engase1p down regulation delays fOSGN2-to-fOSGN conversion, and it is shown that Engase1p and Man2c1p are necessary for efficient clearance of cytosolic fOS into lysosomes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not possess ENGase activity and expression of human Engase1p in the png1Delta deletion mutant, in which fOS are reduced by over 98%, partially restored fOS generation. In metabolically radiolabeled HepG2 cells evidence was obtained for a small but significant Engase1p-mediated generation of fOS in 1 h chase but not 30 min pulse incubations. Ngly1p down regulation revealed an Ngly1p-independent fOSGN2 pool comprising mainly Man(8)GlcNAc(2), corresponding to approximately 70% of total fOS, and an Ngly1p-dependent fOSGN2 pool enriched in Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) and Man(9)GlcNAc(2) that corresponds to approximately 30% of total fOS.As the generation of the bulk of fOS is unaffected by co-down regulation of Ngly1p and Engase1p, alternative quantitatively important mechanisms must underlie the liberation of these fOS from either LLO or glycoproteins during protein N-glycosylation. The fully mannosylated structures that occur in the Ngly1p-dependent fOSGN2 pool indicate an ERAD process that does not require N-glycan trimming."
https://openalex.org/W2054654312,"Pyruvate is located at a metabolic junction of assimilatory and dissimilatory pathways and represents a switch point between respiratory and fermentative metabolism. In Escherichia coli, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and pyruvate formate-lyase are considered the primary routes of pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA for aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation, respectively. During glucose fermentation, the in vivo activity of PDHC has been reported as either very low or undetectable, and the role of this enzyme remains unknown. In this study, a comprehensive characterization of wild-type E. coli MG1655 and a PDHC-deficient derivative (Pdh) led to the identification of the role of PDHC in the anaerobic fermentation of glucose. The metabolism of these strains was investigated by using a mixture of (13)C-labeled and -unlabeled glucose followed by the analysis of the labeling pattern in protein-bound amino acids via two-dimensional (13)C,(1)H NMR spectroscopy. Metabolite balancing, biosynthetic (13)C labeling of proteinogenic amino acids, and isotopomer balancing all indicated a large increase in the flux of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (ox-PPP) in response to the PDHC deficiency. Because both ox-PPP and PDHC generate CO(2) and the calculated CO(2) evolution rate was significantly reduced in Pdh, it was hypothesized that the role of PDHC is to provide CO(2) for cell growth. The similarly negative impact of either PDHC or ox-PPP deficiencies, and an even more pronounced impairment of cell growth in a strain lacking both ox-PPP and PDHC, provided further support for this hypothesis. The three strains exhibited similar phenotypes in the presence of an external source of CO(2), thus confirming the role of PDHC. Activation of formate hydrogen-lyase (which converts formate to CO(2) and H(2)) rendered the PDHC deficiency silent, but its negative impact reappeared in a strain lacking both PDHC and formate hydrogen-lyase. A stoichiometric analysis of CO(2) generation via PDHC and ox-PPP revealed that the PDHC route is more carbon- and energy-efficient, in agreement with its beneficial role in cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1987646632,"Human prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) is a lipocalin-type enzyme involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid and plays a key role in the regulation of sleep, allergy, pain sensation, and the development of male reproductive organs. Here, using a combination of crystallographic, biochemical, mutagenesis, and kinetic studies, we have gained insights into the mode of ligand binding by human L-PGDS and have identified residues involved in catalysis. Interestingly, structural evidence reveals that 2 molecules of fatty acids, one molecule each of oleic and palmitoleic acid, bind inside the β barrel. The oleic acid is buried and binds in a highly basic patch in proximity to the catalytically critical Cys65, mimicking the binding of prostaglandin H(2). The palmitoleic acid sits in a relatively neutral region with very few interactions with the protein. Mutating Met64, Leu79, Phe83, or Leu131 to alanine reduced the catalytic efficiency by almost 10-fold, while K59A and Y149A mutations enhanced the catalytic efficiency by >2-fold. Met64 seems to function as a kinetic clamp, pushing the thiol group of Cys65 close to the site of nucleophilic attack during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1966949599,"The membrane localization of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2) in polarized cells is determined by alternative splicing; the PMCA2w/b splice variant shows apical localization, whereas the PMCA2z/b and PMCA2x/b variants are mostly basolateral. We previously reported that PMCA2b interacts with the PDZ protein Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2), but the role of this interaction for the specific membrane localization of PMCA2 is not known. Here we show that co-expression of NHERF2 greatly enhanced the apical localization of GFP-tagged PMCA2w/b in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. GFP-PMCA2z/b was also redirected to the apical membrane by NHERF2, whereas GFP-PMCA2x/b remained exclusively basolateral. In the presence of NHERF2, GFP-PMCA2w/b co-localized with the actin-binding protein ezrin even after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D or latrunculin B. Surface biotinylation and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that NHERF2-mediated anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton reduced internalization and lateral mobility of the pump. Our results show that the specific interaction with NHERF2 enhances the apical concentration of PMCA2w/b by anchoring the pump to the apical membrane cytoskeleton. The data also suggest that the x/b splice form of PMCA2 contains a dominant lateral targeting signal, whereas the targeting and localization of the z/b form are more flexible and not fully determined by intrinsic sequence features."
https://openalex.org/W1973662685,"Protein misfolding with loss-of-function of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is the molecular basis of phenylketonuria in many individuals carrying missense mutations in the PAH gene. PAH is complexly regulated by its substrate L-Phenylalanine and its natural cofactor 6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). Sapropterin dihydrochloride, the synthetic form of BH(4), was recently approved as the first pharmacological chaperone to correct the loss-of-function phenotype. However, current knowledge about enzyme function and regulation in the therapeutic setting is scarce. This illustrates the need for comprehensive analyses of steady state kinetics and allostery beyond single residual enzyme activity determinations to retrace the structural impact of missense mutations on the phenylalanine hydroxylating system. Current standard PAH activity assays are either indirect (NADH) or discontinuous due to substrate and product separation before detection. We developed an automated fluorescence-based continuous real-time PAH activity assay that proved to be faster and more efficient but as precise and accurate as standard methods. Wild-type PAH kinetic analyses using the new assay revealed cooperativity of activated PAH toward BH(4), a previously unknown finding. Analyses of structurally preactivated variants substantiated BH(4)-dependent cooperativity of the activated enzyme that does not rely on the presence of l-Phenylalanine but is determined by activating conformational rearrangements. These findings may have implications for an individualized therapy, as they support the hypothesis that the patient's metabolic state has a more significant effect on the interplay of the drug and the conformation and function of the target protein than currently appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2034256208,"Although early studies of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) suggested that cIAP1 directly binds and inhibits caspases similarly to X-linked IAP (XIAP), a recent one found that micromolar concentrations of cIAP1 only weakly inhibit caspase-3, -7, or -9. Here, we show that cIAP1 specifically and cooperatively blocks the cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome in vitro. Hence, cIAP1 prevented the activation of procaspase-3 but had no effect on the processing of procaspase-9 or the activity of prior activated caspase-3. Like cIAP1, XIAP had no effect on procaspase-9 processing and was a more potent inhibitor of procaspase-3 activation than of already activated caspase-3 activity. Inhibition of procaspase-3 activation depended on BIR2 and BIR3 of cIAP1 and was independent of BIR1, RING, CARD, and UBA domains. Smac prevented cIAP1 from inhibiting procaspase-3 activation and reversed the inhibition by prior addition of cIAP1. A procaspase-9 mutant (D315A) that cannot produce the p12 subunit was resistant to inhibition by cIAP1. Therefore, the N-terminal Ala-Thr-Pro-Phe motif of the p12 subunit of the caspase-9 apoptosome facilitates apoptosome blockade. Consequently, cIAP1 cooperatively interacts with oligomerized processed caspase-9 in the apoptosome and blocks procaspase-3 activation. Although early studies of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) suggested that cIAP1 directly binds and inhibits caspases similarly to X-linked IAP (XIAP), a recent one found that micromolar concentrations of cIAP1 only weakly inhibit caspase-3, -7, or -9. Here, we show that cIAP1 specifically and cooperatively blocks the cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome in vitro. Hence, cIAP1 prevented the activation of procaspase-3 but had no effect on the processing of procaspase-9 or the activity of prior activated caspase-3. Like cIAP1, XIAP had no effect on procaspase-9 processing and was a more potent inhibitor of procaspase-3 activation than of already activated caspase-3 activity. Inhibition of procaspase-3 activation depended on BIR2 and BIR3 of cIAP1 and was independent of BIR1, RING, CARD, and UBA domains.

Consequently, cIAP1 cooperatively interacts with oligomerized processed caspase-9 in the apoptosome and blocks procaspase-3 activation.

Although IAPs have been thought of as primarily inhibitors of apoptosis, it is now known that they play important roles in mitotic chromosome segregation, cellular morphogenesis, copper homeostasis, and intracellular signal transduction (1Srinivasula S.M.

IAPs with three BIR domains (XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP)) can directly bind caspases via BIR2 and BIR3 and down-regulate caspase activity (3Deveraux Q.L.

Caspases are highly specific cysteinyl proteases that implement the cell death program by processing hundreds of different intracellular proteins after one or a few aspartyl residues (8Lüthi A.U.

Importantly, cIAPs are E3 ubiquitin ligases, which catalyze both trans- and autoubiquitination, as are four other IAPs (XIAP, melanoma IAP (also called Livin), ILP2 (also called testis-specific IAP), and Apollon (also called BRUCE)) (14Yang Y.

Interestingly, cIAPs can mediate either nondegradative Lys-63 polyubiquitination or degradative Lys-48 polyubiquitination of a protein target. For example, Lys-63 polyubiquitination of RIP1 mediates TNFα-evoked NFκB activation, whereas Lys-48 auto- or transubiquitination mediates proteasomal degradation of cIAPs or of a cIAP-binding protein such as a caspase or Smac/DIABLO (14Yang Y.

Hence, cIAPs may transubiquitinate caspases, which can trigger proteasomal degradation and/or down-regulation of proteolytic activity. Conversely, Smac can selectively reduce the levels of cIAP1 and cIAP2 but not XIAP (24Yang Q.H. Du C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16963-16970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Smac homodimer binds BIR domains via the N-terminal IAP-binding motif (IBM), which frees the caspase from the IAP. Here, we show that cIAP1 potently inhibits the processing and activation of procaspase-3 by the cytochrome c-dependent Apaf-1·caspase-9 apoptosome. The BIR domains of cIAP1 were sufficient for the inhibition of procaspase-3 activation, which was independent of the RING and CARD domains of cIAP1. Smac potently prevented and rapidly reversed blockade of the apoptosome by cIAP1. These findings support a model in which cIAP1 binds the apoptosome and sterically hinders access of procaspase-3 substrate to the catalytic center of the Apaf-1·caspase-9 complex. 911 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (50:50) containing 10% FBS (25Chen L. Smith L. Wang Z. Smith J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate as described (25Chen L. Smith L. Wang Z. Smith J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were plated (4 × 106/100-mm diameter tissue culture dish) and incubated for 6 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. After 16 h, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium. The cells were cultured for another 48 h before preparing lysates as described below. A full-length clone, Apaf-1XL (27Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), was subcloned from pcDNA3 into pcDNA3.1 by restriction digestion with BamHI and XhoI to produce Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor-1) with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag and hexahistidine tags. Empty vector transfections were done with the pcDNA3.1 vector lacking a cDNA insert. Cell lysates were prepared from 20 confluent 911 cultures (100-mm diameter) 3 days after seeding essentially as described (28Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Cultures were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cells were harvested by scraping and centrifugation. After resuspension in an equal volume of buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 (1 m Ultra; Fluka), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Pefabloc (Pierce), and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, the cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer (100 strokes with a tight-fitting pestle). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to produce the S100 fraction from nontransfected 911 cells. S64 was prepared from Apaf-1-transfected cells using the following modifications of the S100 method. 1) The PBS-rinsed cells were suspended with 0.5 ml of modified sucrose lysis buffer, which contained no EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2. 2) The cells were disrupted by five passes through an 18-gauge needle followed by five passes through a 26-gauge syringe needle. 3) The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, followed by a 45-min centrifugation at 30,000 rpm (64,000 × g × h). Protein concentrations of S64 and S100 fractions were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard and the Bio-Rad reagent. S64 has 2–3 times higher apoptosome activity than S100, which indicates that Apaf-1 is rate-limiting for apoptosome activity (data not shown). S100 or S64 (1–1.5 μg/μl) was incubated for the indicated interval (15–60 min) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 5 μm PS-341 (bortezomib), a proteasome inhibitor, in the presence and absence of the indicated concentration of bovine cytochrome c (Sigma) and 1 mm Na2ATP (Sigma) unless indicated otherwise. Following incubation with or without cytochrome c and ATP, a 4-μl sample was diluted with 36 μl of caspase assay buffer, which contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 0.25 mm Ac-DEVD-AMC (a fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate) (25Chen L. Smith L. Wang Z. Smith J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the caspase reaction was stopped by dilution with ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The fluorescence of freed AMC was measured at 440 nm (excitation at 380 nm) at room temperature by dilution of a 0.1-ml sample of each reaction with 1.9 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. Fluorescence units were converted to moles of AMC produced by constructing a standard curve, which was linear over the range of AMC measured (10–400 pmol). IC50 values, EC50 values, Hill coefficients, and statistical parameters were determined by nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism 5. Values were not corrected for minor differences in the purity of the IAPs. S100 or S64 proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunostained with antibody to caspase-9 (mouse monoclonal MAB8301, R&D Systems) or caspase-3 (rabbit monoclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3, 8G10, Cell Signaling Technology). Immunostaining was detected with the LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate of horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Exposed x-ray film (B-Plus blue, Medlink Imaging) was scanned with an Epson Precision 4870 photo scanner. Caspase-9 cDNA was excised from pCMV6. Plasmid caspase-9XL4 (Origene SC119362) was digested with HindIII and NotI and ligated into pcDNA3.1-V5-His (Invitrogen). D315A and D330A mutants of caspase-9 were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with the following primers: D315A, 5′-CTGGCAGTAACCCCGAGCCAGCTGCCACCCCGTTCCAG (forward) and 5′-CCTTCCTGGAACGGGGTGGCAGCTGGCTCGGGGTTACTGC (reverse); and D330A, 5′-GAGGACCTTCGACCAGCTGGCCGCCATATCTAGTTTGCCC (forward) and 5′-GTGTGGGCAAACTAGATATGGCGGCCAGCTGGTCGAAGG (reverse). In vitro transcription and translation were done with a rabbit reticulocyte master mixture (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. Plasmids containing IAP cDNA sequences were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. cIAP1 (IMAGE ID 4831062), the α-isoform of Livin (IMAGE ID 4859588), Survivin (IMAGE ID 2961114), and plasmid pcDNA3.1-XIAP-GeneStorm (Invitrogen) were used templates for cloning IAPs into pENTR-D-Topo (Invitrogen). The following gene-specific primers were used to PCR-amplify IAP inserts, which were cloned into pENTR-D-Topo according to the manufacturer's protocol: cIAP1, 5′-CACCATGCACAAAACTGCCTCCCAAAG (forward) and 5′-TCATTAAGAGAGAAATGTACGAACAG (reverse); Livin, 5′-CACCATGGGACCTAAAGACAGTGCC (forward) and 5′-TCACTAGGACAGGAAGGTGCGCACGCG (reverse); Survivin, 5′-CACCATGGGTGCCCCGACGTTGCCC (forward) and 5′-TCATCAATCCATGGCAGCCAGCTGCTC (reverse); and XIAP, 5′-CACCATGACTTTTAAGAGTTTTGAAG (forward) and 5′-TTATTAAGACATAAAAATTTTTTGCTTG (reverse). The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 25 cycles; and 72 °C for 5 min. pENTR-IAP plasmids were recombined with either pDEST15 encoding an N-terminal GST tag or pBAD-DEST49 encoding an N-terminal His-patch thioredoxin (HPT) and a C-terminal V5-His6 tag using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cIAP1-(339–618) and cIAP1-(453–618) were PCR-amplified using pENTR-cIAP1 as a template with the cIAP1 339Met forward primer (5′-CACATGAAAGGCCAAGAGTTTGTTG) and cIAP1 453Met forward primer (5′-CACCATGGCATCAGATGATTTGTC) and the previously mentioned cIAP1 reverse primer. PCR products were ligated into pENTR-D-Topo, followed by recombination with pDEST15 or pBAD-DEST49. pDEST15- or pBAD-DEST49-cIAP1-(1–450) and -cIAP1-(1–565), respectively, were produced converting the codon for amino acids 451 and 566 to stop codons by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. The following primers were used: cIAP1 451 stop, 5′-GAGGAGAAGGAAAAACAAGCTTAATAAATGGCATCAGATG (forward) and 5′-CATCTGATGCCATTTATTAAGCTTGTTTTTCCTTCTCCTC (reverse); and cIAP1 566 stop, 5′-GAACAATTGAGGAGGTTGCAATAATAACGAACTTGTAAAGTG (forward) and cIAP1 566 stop, 5′-CACTTTACAAGTTCGTTATTATTGCAACCTCCTCAATTGTTC(reverse). Escherichia coli strain BL21-AI transformed with pDEST15-XIAP (or wild-type cIAP1, a truncation mutant of cIAP1, Livin, or Survivin) was grown overnight in LB broth containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Two 100-ml cultures of LB broth containing 0.2 mg/ml carbenicillin and 50 μm ZnSO4 were inoculated with 2 ml of the overnight culture and grown to an absorbance of ∼0.6 at 600 nm. l-Arabinose was added to 0.2% (w/v) to induce GST-XIAP expression at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested after 8 h, frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Bacteria were suspended with 8 ml of lysis buffer, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm Na2EGTA (pH 7.5), 0.8 mm benzamidine, and 0.25 mm Pefabloc SC. Additionally, the lysis buffer contained the following protease inhibitors 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Recombinant lysozyme (2 μl, 30 kilounits/μl; Novagen) and Benzonase (4.8 μl, 25 units/μl; Novagen) were added, and the bacteria were rotated slowly for 25 min at room temperature. The bacteria were lysed by sonication, and lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with 10 mg of GSH-agarose for 3 h. The agarose was pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 5 min and washed twice with TED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm Na2EGTA (pH 7.5), and 1 mm DTT) containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with TED buffer. GST-XIAP was eluted with 0.2-ml samples of buffer 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 10 mm GSH, 0.1 mm Na2EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and BSA as a standard. Proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Each of the GST-IAPs was ∼65–90% pure based on densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. Recombinant human cIAP1 (amino acids 144–356) with a C-terminal 15-amino acid AviTag was obtained from Sino Biological Inc. His10-cIAP1 and Smac56-His6 were purchased from R&D Systems. Apoptosome activation in vitro was entirely dependent on the addition of cytochrome c and a nucleotide such as ATP (data not shown). Caspase-3 activation was assayed with the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC by diluting a sample of the incubation with cytochrome c 10-fold into caspase assay buffer. Activation of caspase-3 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, which showed that cytochrome c evoked accumulation of the large subunit (17 kDa), which is generated by processing of the 32-kDa procaspase-3 (see below). Caspase activity increased linearly following a 15–90-min incubation of the S100 fraction with cytochrome c (data not shown). The apoptosome reaction was initiated by the addition of the S100 fraction to buffer containing cytochrome c, ATP, and the indicated IAP. IAPs with an N-terminal GST tag were expressed and purified from E. coli. Only XIAP and cIAP1 potently blocked caspase activation by the cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The IC50 values of XIAP and cIAP1 were 17 and 46 nm, respectively (Table 1). Micromolar concentrations of GST itself (≤7 μm) or of GST-Survivin (≤6 μm) had no effect on cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome activation. It appears that XIAP and cIAP1 may be sufficiently potent to regulate apoptosome activation intracellularly. Livin was ∼17 times less potent than cIAP1, which suggests that Livin (α-isoform) is unlikely to down-regulate apoptosome activation intracellularly (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of the inhibition of cytochrome c-dependent caspase-3 activation by IAPsIAPIC5095% confidence limit of IC50Hill coefficientNo. of experimentsnmnmGST-XIAP1715–193.80 ± 0.513GST-cIAP14644–493.91 ± 0.323BIR2-BIR3 cIAP12825–313.45 ± 0.363GST-Livin771549–10810.92 ± 0.133His10-cIAP1180168–1932.68 ± 0.193HPT-cIAP110495–1154.73 ± 0.885HPT-cIAP1-(1–450)7565–863.97 ± 0.894 Open table in a new tab Although early and current studies of IAPs have used GST-tagged IAPs, some have suggested that the GST tag can affect of the potency of the IAP by >100-fold (13Eckelman B.P.

EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Table 1 shows that the IC50 values of HPT-cIAP1 and the truncation mutant HPT-cIAP1-(1–450) were 104 and 75 nm, respectively. Additionally, BIR2 and BIR3 of cIAP1 had an IC50 of 28 nm. Hence, the GST tag has little, if any, effect on the potency of GST-cIAP1. Additionally, commercially prepared cIAP1 with an N-terminal decahistidine tag was found to be less potent (IC50 = 180 nm) than either GST- or HPT-tagged cIAP1 (Table 1). Differences in the purification of cIAP1 probably contribute to differences in the potency of the various preparations. Note that cIAP1 inhibited cytochrome c- and apoptosome-dependent processing of procaspase-3 in a cooperative manner. The Hill coefficients of the various preparations of cIAP1 ranged from 2.68 to 4.73 (Table 1). The positive cooperativity of the inhibition suggests that the inhibition is caused by binding of more than one cIAP1 to the oligomerized apoptosome, i.e. the Apaf-1·caspase-9 holoenzyme. By contrast to cIAP1, blockade of the apoptosome by Livin was not cooperative (Table 1). Livin has a single BIR domain, whereas cIAP1 has three. The BIR2-BIR3 segment of cIAP1 may be required for cooperativity because truncated cIAP1 that contained only the BIR2-BIR3 segment cooperatively blocked apoptosome activation of procaspase-3 (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Importantly, XIAP and cIAP1 were much less potent inhibitors of active caspase-3 than of the activation of procaspase-3 by the apoptosome. Thus, 0.27 μm cIAP1 had no effect on the caspase activity of processed caspase-3, and 0.14 μm XIAP inhibited the activity of processed caspase-3 by ∼75% (Fig. 1C). Survivin and Livin at 1.8 and 0.8 μm had no effect on the activity of already activated caspase-3 (Fig. 1C). Truncation mutants of cIAP1 that lacked the RING domain (GST-cIAP1–565) or both the RING and the CARD domains (GST-cIAP1–450 or HPT-cIAP1–450) were essentially as potent as full-length GST-cIAP1 (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1) (data not shown). Moreover, a truncation mutant consisting of BIR2-BIR3 (amino acids 144–356) was as potent as wild-type cIAP1 (Fig. 1B and Table 1). By contrast, 1.4 μm GST-cIAP1-(339–618) or 0.8 μm GST-cIAP1-(453–618) had no effect on apoptosome activation of procaspase-3 (data not shown). Thus, BIR2, BIR3, and the short segment between them was sufficient to potently and cooperatively prevented the caspase-9 apoptosome from activating caspase-3-like activity. cIAP1 had no effect on the processing of procaspase-9 to the 35-kDa large subunit, which was evoked by cytochrome c plus ATP (Fig. 2A). Similarly, XIAP had no effect on the production of the large subunit of caspase-9 (Fig. 2A). By contrast to the lack of effect of cIAP1 and XIAP on the processing of procaspase-9, each of these IAPs essentially abolished the processing of procaspase-3 to the 20- and 17-kDa forms of the large subunit (Fig. 2A). The processing of procaspase-9 to p35 was confirmed by the addition of 35S-labeled procaspase-9 or an 35S-labeled procaspase-9 mutant (D315A or D330A) to the S64 fraction from Apaf-1-transfected cells, which has 2–3 times greater apoptosome activity (Fig. 3B). Although 35S-labeled procaspase-9 D315A was processed at Asp-330 in response to cytochrome c plus ATP, 35S-labeled wild-type procaspase-9 was predominantly processed at Asp-315 (Figs. 2B and 3B). Under conditions that essentially abolished procaspase-3 activation, GST-cIAP1 had no effect on the processing of 35S-labeled wild-type procaspase-9 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, GST-cIAP1 had no effect on the processing of either the D315A or D330A mutant of 35S-labeled procaspase-9 (data not shown).FIGURE 3The procaspase-9 D315A mutant, but not the D330A mutant, reverses the inhibition of the cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome by cIAP1. A, schematic of human procaspase-9 and the positions of the autocatalytic cleavage site (Asp-315) and the caspase-3 cleavage site (Asp-330) within the linker region (LR) between the large and small subunits of mature caspase-9. B, autoradiogram showing the processing of 35S-labeled p47 procaspase-9 mutants (D315A and D330A) by the apoptosome. The experiment was done as described in the Fig. 2B legend except the 35S-labeled procaspase-9 used was wild-type or the indicated point mutant. C, the procaspase-9 D315A mutant, but not the D330A mutant, prevents cIAP1 inhibition of the apoptosome. The cytochrome c (Cc)-dependent apoptosome activation of procaspase-3 was assayed as described for B in the presence (▲, ■, and ●) or (○) absence of 500 nm GST-cIAP1. The indicated D315A or D330A mutant of procaspase-9 (cas-9; 4 μl of TnT reaction/20 μl of apoptosome reaction) was added to the apoptosome reaction. Samples (4 μl) of the apoptosome reaction were removed after the indicated intervals, diluted 10 times with caspase assay buffer, and assayed for caspase-3-like activity with Ac-DEVD-AMC as substrate. Values are means ± S.E. (n = 3) for AMC produced (nmol/mg of S64 protein).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Importantly, the addition of the procaspase-9 D315A mutant to the S64 fraction completely overcame the inhibition of the apoptosome by GST-cIAP1 and moderately increased caspase activation compared with the “no cIAP1 or caspase-9” control (Fig. 3C). By contrast, the procaspase-9 D330A mutant failed to overcome apoptosome inhibition by GST-cIAP1 (Fig. 3C). The D315A mutant likely is transprocessed by activated caspase-3 at Asp-330, which produces a p10 subunit that begins with Ala-Ile-Ser-Ser, whereas autoprocessing at Asp-315 produces the p12 subunit, which begins with Ala-Thr-Pro-Phe. The proline at the third position is known to be critical for high affinity binding of BIR3 (30Eckelman B.P. Drag M. Snipas S.J. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the N-terminal Ala-Thr-Pro-Phe motif of the p12 subunit of the caspase-9 apoptosome facilitates apoptosome blockade. Mature Smac56 (amino acids 56–239) potently prevented cIAP1 from inhibiting apoptosome activation of procaspase-3 (Fig. 4A). The EC50 of bacterially expressed mature Smac with a hexahistidine tag was 30 nm (Fig. 4A). The EC50 of Smac-GST expressed in 911 cells was similar to that of recombinant Smac from bacteria (data not shown). Mature Smac prevented the inhibition of the caspase-9 apoptosome by each of the cIAP1 constructs indicated in Table 1 (data not shown). Thus, each of the purified cIAP1 proteins specifically inhibited the apoptosome by a mechanism that was potently prevented by mature Smac. Smac is an exceptionally stable dimeric protein that antagonizes XIAP with a stoichiometry of two Smac protomers/XIAP (31Gonçalves R.B. Sanches D. Souza T.L. Silva J.L. Oliveira A.C.

Hence, the potency of the Smac dimer is similar to that of cIAP1 (30 compared with 46 nm) (Fig. 4A and Table 1). The addition of Smac to the cIAP1-inhibited apoptosome rapidly and fully reversed apoptosome activation (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that the mechanism of cIAP1 was fully reversible whether Smac was added 5 or 15 min after the start of the incubation of S100 with cytochrome c, ATP, and cIAP1 (Fig. 4B). Here, we have shown that cIAP1 potently inhibited the processing and activation of procaspase-3 by the cytochrome c-dependent Apa"

While looking for potential calcium binding residues in EcFtsZ, we found a mutation (E93R) that strongly promoted the assembly of EcFtsZ. The mutation increased the stability and bundling of the FtsZ protofilaments and produced a dominating effect on the assembly of the wild type FtsZ (WT-FtsZ). Although E93R-FtsZ was found to bind to GTP similarly to the WT-FtsZ, it displayed lower GTPase activity than the WT-FtsZ. E93R-FtsZ complemented for its wild type counterpart as observed by a complementation test using JKD7-1/pKD3 cells. However, the bacterial cells became elongated upon overexpression of the mutant allele. We modeled the structure of E93R-FtsZ using the structures of MtbFtsZ/Methanococcus jannaschi FtsZ (MjFtsZ) dimers as templates. The MtbFtsZ-based structure suggests that the Arg(93)-Glu(138) salt bridge provides the additional stability, whereas the effect of mutation appears to be indirect (allosteric) if the EcFtsZ dimer is similar to that of MjFtsZ. The data presented in this study suggest that an increase in the stability of the FtsZ protofilaments is detrimental for the bacterial cytokinesis."

Here, we describe the properties of a variant of α1-antitrypsin with a critical hydrophobic section of the RCL substituted with aspartic acid (P8–P6). In contrast to the control, the variant was unable to polymerize when incubated with small peptides or when cleaved in the middle of the RCL (accepted models of loop-sheet polymerization). However, when induced by guanidine HCl or heat, the variant polymerized in a manner indistinguishable from the control. Importantly, the Asp mutations did not affect the ability of the Z or Siiyama α1-antitrypsin variants to polymerize in COS-7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1989930451,"The cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) of the oral pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cell types. Western analysis, pharmacological inhibition and siRNA silencing were performed in human immortalized gingival keratinocytes (HIGK) to dissect the functional role of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway in the signal transduction steps triggered by the CDT. Infection of HIGK was associated with a time-dependent induction of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. However, in the absence of CDT, infected HIGK underwent reversible DNA strand breaks but not apoptosis, while caspase 3 activity, p21 levels, and HIGK viability were unaffected. Caspase 9 activity was attenuated in the CDT mutant-infected HIGK compared to wild-type infected cells. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-silencing of the ATM downstream effector, the protein kinase checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), significantly impacted CDT-mediated apoptosis. Together, these findings provide insight on the specificity of the ATM-Chk2 pathway in response to the CDT of A. actinomycetemcomitans in oral epithelial cells, which ultimately leads to apoptosis. We further propose the existence of an unidentified factor that is distinct from the CDT, and involved with a reversible DNA fragmentation that does not trigger terminal apoptosis in oral epithelial cells. This model potentially explains conflicting reports on the biological activity of the A. actinomycetemcomitans CDT."

The genome sequence data of Mediterranean populations will offer unique insights into human evolution and early human migration. The potent combination of highly consanguineous populations in the Mediterranean's southern and eastern rims and regional medical and scientific expertise could lead to the identification and characterization of many genes responsible for human disease.

https://openalex.org/W2019289220,"Background RNA-binding proteins accompany all steps in the life of mRNAs and provide dynamic gene regulatory functions for rapid adjustment to changing extra- or intracellular conditions. The association of RNA-binding proteins with their targets is regulated through changing subcellular distribution, post-translational modification or association with other proteins. Methodology We demonstrate that the dsRNA binding protein 76 (DRBP76), synonymous with nuclear factor 90, displays inherently distinct tissue type-specific subcellular distribution in the normal human central nervous system and in malignant brain tumors of glial origin. Altered subcellular localization and isoform distribution in malignant glioma indicate that tumor-specific changes in DRBP76-related gene products and their regulatory functions may contribute to the formation and/or maintenance of these tumors. To identify endogenous mRNA targets of DRBP76, we performed RNA-immunoprecipitation and genome-wide microarray analyses in HEK293 cells, and identified specific classes of transcripts encoding critical functions in cellular metabolism. Significance Our data suggest that physiologic DRBP76 expression, isoform distribution and subcellular localization are profoundly altered upon malignant transformation. Thus, the functional role of DRBP76 in co- or post-transcriptional gene regulation may contribute to the neoplastic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2043743064,"Background Polymorphism of the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) is associated with susceptibility to and the severity of Plasmodium vivax malaria in humans. P. vivax uses DARC to invade erythrocytes. Individuals lacking DARC are ‘resistant’ to P. vivax erythrocytic infection. However, susceptibility to P. vivax in DARC+ individuals is reported to vary between specific DARC genotypes. We hypothesized that the natural acquisition of antibodies to P. vivax blood stages may vary with the host genotype and the level of DARC expression. Furthermore, high parasitemia has been reported to effect the acquisition of immunity against pre-erythrocytic parasites. We investigated the correlation between host DARC genotypes and the frequency and magnitude of antibodies against P. vivax erythrocytic stage antigens. Methodology/Findings We assessed the frequencies and magnitudes of antibody responses against P. vivax and P. falciparum sporozoite and erythrocytic antigens in Colombian donors from malaria-endemic regions. The frequency and level of naturally-acquired antibodies against the P. vivax erythrocytic antigens merozoite surface protein 1 (PvMSP1) and Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) varied with the host DARC genotypes. Donors with one negative allele (FY*B/FY*Bnull and FY*A/FY*Bnull) were more likely to have anti-PvMSP1 and anti-PvDBP antibodies than those with two positive alleles (FY*B/FY*B and FY*A/FY*B). The lower IgG3 and IgG1 components of the total IgG response may account for the decreased responses to P. vivax erythrocytic antigens with FY*A/FY*B and FY*B/FY*B genotypes. No such association was detected with P. falciparum erythrocytic antigens, which does not use DARC for erythrocyte invasion. Conclusion/Significance Individuals with higher DARC expression, which is associated with higher susceptibility to P. vivax infection, exhibited low frequencies and magnitudes of P. vivax blood-stage specific antibody responses. This may indicate that one of the primary mechanisms by which P. vivax evades host immunity is through DARC indirectly down-regulating humoral responses against erythrocytic invasion and development."
https://openalex.org/W1975772929,"Rtt109p, a histone acetyltransferase, associates with active genes and acetylates lysine 56 on histone H3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the functional role of Rtt109p or H3 Lys(56) acetylation in chromatin assembly/disassembly (and hence gene expression) immediately switching transcription on or off has not been clearly elucidated in vivo. Here, we show that Rtt109p promotes the eviction of histone H3 from a fast inducible yeast gene, GAL1, following transcriptional initiation via histone H3 Lys(56) acetylation. Conversely, the deposition of histone H3 to GAL1 is significantly decreased in the presence of Rtt109p following transcriptional termination. Intriguingly, we also find that the deposition of histone H2B on preexisting non-acetylated histone H3 Lys(56) at GAL1 in Δrtt109 is significantly increased independently of histone H3 deposition immediately following transcriptional termination subsequent to a short induction. Consistently, histone H2B is not efficiently evicted from GAL1 in the absence of Rtt109p immediately following transcriptional induction. Furthermore, we show that the stimulated eviction or reduced deposition of histones by Rtt109p promotes the association of RNA polymerase II with GAL1 and hence the synthesis of GAL1 mRNA. These results, taken together, support the fact that Rtt109p regulates the deposition/eviction of histone H2B in addition to its role in stimulating histone H3 eviction, thus providing insight into chromatin assembly/disassembly and hence gene expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2063138582,"Background The AIDS epidemic in Brazil remains concentrated in populations with high vulnerability to HIV infection, and the development of an HIV vaccine could make an important contribution to prevention. This study modeled the HIV epidemic and estimated the potential impact of an HIV vaccine on the number of new infections, deaths due to AIDS and the number of people receiving ARV treatment, under various scenarios. Methods and Findings The historical HIV prevalence was modeled using Spectrum and projections were made from 2010 to 2050 to study the impact of an HIV vaccine with 40% to 70% efficacy, and 80% coverage of adult population, specific groups such as MSM, IDU, commercial sex workers and their partners, and 15 year olds. The possibility of disinhibition after vaccination, neglecting medium- and high-risk groups, and a disease-modifying vaccine were also considered. The number of new infections and deaths were reduced by 73% and 30%, respectively, by 2050, when 80% of adult population aged 15–49 was vaccinated with a 40% efficacy vaccine. Vaccinating medium- and high-risk groups reduced new infections by 52% and deaths by 21%. A vaccine with 70% efficacy produced a great decline in new infections and deaths. Neglecting medium- and high-risk population groups as well as disinhibition of vaccinated population reduced the impact or even increased the number of new infections. Disease-modifying vaccine also contributed to reducing AIDS deaths, the need for ART and new HIV infections. Conclusions Even in a country with a concentrated epidemic and high levels of ARV coverage, such as Brazil, moderate efficacy vaccines as part of a comprehensive package of treatment and prevention could have a major impact on preventing new HIV infections and AIDS deaths, as well as reducing the number of people on ARV. Targeted vaccination strategies may be highly effective and cost-beneficial."

Similarly, anti-Lex phages were screened from the same library with lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII; Lex)-dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Of five phage clones isolated, two scFv genes were constructed to express scFv-Fc proteins in NS0 cells. As was experienced with anti-Man3 scFv-Fc clones, only one anti-LNFPIII clone, 1F12, was successfully produced and purified as an scFv-Fc protein. Although anti-LNFPIII 1F12 and anti-Man3 5A3 scFv-Fc proteins were secreted into media, a decline in scFv-Fc production was observed with both stable clones during early passages.

Since the human genome project was completed, our understanding of structure-function relationships among proteins has made significant advances. In contrast, elucidating the role of carbohydrate modification on the functions of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and peptide glycans remains elusive. The project that was to produce a variety of carbohydrate-specific antibodies by the phage display technology was thus launched in 2003 with the hope that the resulting antibodies could not only provide tools for carbohydrate research but also be applied to diagnostic or therapeutic uses. In vitro production of anti-carbohydrate antibodies is seemingly a logical strategy because carbohydrate moieties are self-antigens by nature.

For example, three independent scFv genes, 1A4, 1G4, and 5A3, were isolated from the human scFv-displaying phage library with Man3-DPPE as an antigen with amino acid sequences and initial characterization as were described previously (7Sakai K. Shimizu Y. Chiba T. Matsumoto-Takasaki A. Kusada Y. Zhang W. Nakata M. Kojima N. Toma K. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Stable 1A4 and 1G4 scFv-Fc clones from these genes were never established in CHO or NS0 cells (8Zhang W. Matsumoto-Takasaki A. Kusada Y. Sakaue H. Sakai K. Nakata M. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stable clones were established from 5A3 scFv-Fc gene-transfected NS0 cells, which were subsequently used for purification and characterization of the scFv gene product as the first anti-Man3 antibody (8Zhang W. Matsumoto-Takasaki A. Kusada Y. Sakaue H. Sakai K. Nakata M. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As later became apparent, however, such 5A3 clones stably expressing scFv-Fc no longer had the ability to produce anti-Man3 antibody during early passages, as described in this current study. During the aforementioned work, anti-Lex (lacto-N-fucopentaose III, LNFPIII) phage antibodies were also isolated using the same phage library and another neoglycolipid, LNFPIII-DPPE, as an antigen for panning and screening. The first in vitro portion of isolation and initial characterization of isolated phage antibodies was performed without serious problems, which resulted in isolation of three anti-LNFPIII (Lex) scFv genes with differing scFv DNA sequences. The second part of the production, purification, and characterization of anti-LNFPIII (Lex) scFv-Fc proteins was, however, extremely problematic. Similar to the case of anti-Man3 scFv-Fc clones, scFv-Fc proteins were successfully produced and purified from one of two anti-LNFPIII scFv (Lex) genes isolated from the phage library. Although this 1F12 scFv-Fc protein was secreted into the media, production of 3F1 scFv-Fc proteins in NS0 cells was never accomplished. Furthermore, the decline in 1F12 scFv-Fc production was observed during early passages. These results suggested the possibility that expression of anti-Man3 and other anti-carbohydrate antibodies in mammalian cells is disadvantageous for these cells and could lead to eventual cell death. This study describes not only the isolation and characterization of anti-LNFPIII (Lex) scFv genes and the purification of anti-LNFPIII (Lex) scFv gene products as scFv-Fc forms expressed in stable and transient expression systems, but it also describes the extracellular or intracellular localization of two anti-LNFPIII (Lex) and three anti-Man3 scFv-Fc proteins transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. This study thus provides insights into the pros and cons for use of phage display technology to produce anti-carbohydrate antibodies. Escherichia coli strains, the suppressor strain TG1, and the nonsuppressor strain TOP10F′, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, high glucose), Lipofectamine 2000, and BODIPY FL C5-ceramide were purchased from Invitrogen.

The EndFree plasmid maxi kit (catalog no. 12362) was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Anti-PDI antibody (catalog no. MA3-019) was purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Neoglycolipids were synthesized from carbohydrates (Man3, lacto-N-tetraose, lacto-N-neotetraose, LNFPI, LNFPII, or LNFPIII) and DPPE by reductive amination and purified by HPLC with a silica gel column as described previously (9Stoll M.S.

The Keio phage display libraries representing over 1011 independent human scFvs, prepared as described previously (7Sakai K. Shimizu Y. Chiba T. Matsumoto-Takasaki A. Kusada Y. Zhang W. Nakata M.

Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), were subjected to four rounds of panning similar to the procedures described for anti-Man3 scFvs (7Sakai K. Shimizu Y. Chiba T. Matsumoto-Takasaki A. Kusada Y. Zhang W. Nakata M. Kojima N. Toma K. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except that LNFPIII-DPPE was used as an antigen. Briefly, coating of wells with LNFPIII-DPPE was achieved by applying 50 μl of LNFPIII-DPPE (40 μg/ml methanol) and drying the solvent at 37 °C, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 150 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl (TBS) and 3% BSA (blocking buffer). Wells were rinsed twice with 50 μl of 0.2% Tween 20/TBS (TBS-T) and once with 200 μl of TBS. Fifty μl of phage suspension in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1.4% BSA were added to the wells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min under continuous rotation. After wells were washed three times with 200 μl of TBS-T and twice with 200 μl of TBS, bound phages were eluted by addition of 50 μl of 100 mm triethylamine and incubation at 25 °C for 10 min and then neutralized by adding 100 μl of neutralizing solution (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3% BSA/TBS = 2:1, v/v) to wells of the control plate, which had been treated with the blocking buffer. Bound phages were further eluted by addition of 50 μl of 100 mm triethylamine and incubation at 25 °C for 20 min and were recovered in the neutralization solution as described above. Eluted phages were used to infect 100 μl of logarithmically growing E. coli TG1 at 37 °C for 1 h. Infected bacteria, grown on LB agar plates (inner diameter = 10 cm) containing 1 mm NaOH, 0.1% glucose, and carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 16 h, were scraped from the plates using a spreader after addition of 2 ml of LB-10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (SBS), per plate. An aliquot of this suspension was inoculated into 40 ml of SBS containing carbenicillin and grown at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking. Phages were rescued after addition of 40 μl containing 3.5 × 109 plaque-forming units of helper phages M13KO07 and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h without shaking, followed by addition of kanamycin (25 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) and incubation at 25 °C for 40 h with rotation. Phage particles were concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and dissolved in 400 μl of TBS, 400 μl of 3% BSA/TBS, and 40 μl of 10% Tween 20/TBS by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, 800 μl of phage suspension were recovered and used for the 2nd panning. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pannings were carried out similar to the 1st panning except for washing conditions. Bacteria collected from single colonies after four rounds of panning were grown in 50 μl of SBS/carbenicillin in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 1 h with rotation, to which 50 μl of helper phages were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with rotation. After an SBS/kanamycin/chloramphenicol mixture (50 μl/well) was added, phage suspensions were obtained by incubation at 25 °C for 16 h with rotation followed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of the supernatants were added to wells containing 100 μl of 3% BSA/TBS, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and kept at 4 °C. ELISA analysis of phage binding to LNFPIII-DPPE was performed on bacterial supernatants containing phages. Wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 1 μg of LNFPIII-DPPE/well as described above and blocked by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 150 μl of 3% BSA/TBS. Control plates were prepared as above without the antigen. Seventy five μl of phage suspensions were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells were washed five times with 200 μl of TBS-T. Bound phage antibodies were detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody at 37 °C for 1 h, after which they were washed 10 times with 200 μl of TBS-T and once with 200 μl of TBS. Peroxidase activity was detected by reaction with ABTS/H2O2 for 30 min and termination with 1% oxalic acid. Absorbance was measured at 415 nm with a Bio-Rad Microplate Reader model 680 (Bio-Rad). scFv genes were amplified from respective E. coli TG1 colonies infected with phages by PCR with a primer set (forward primer Cm, 5′-TGTGATGGCTTCCATGTCGGCAGAATGCT-3′, and reverse primer g3, 5′-GCTAAACAACTTTCAACAGTCTATGCGGCAC-3′). After preheating at 94 °C for 2 min, PCR was carried out in 35 cycles under conditions of denaturing at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 53 °C for 20 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. After purification and confirmation with 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, the resulting scFv genes were subjected to DNA sequencing. DNA sequences of scFvs were determined using a 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). Two mammalian systems, GS/NS0 and neo/COS-7, were used for stable and transient expression, respectively, of scFv conjugated with the human IgG1 Fc domain. The construct included a consensus ribosome-binding sequence and the signal peptide from a murine κ light chain previously used for high level mammalian antibody secretion (12Neumaier M. Shively L.

Odom-Maryon T. Wong J.Y. Shively J.E. Immunotechnology. 1996; 2: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The signal peptide was followed by scFv and the human IgG1 Fc domain (see under “Materials”). To establish stable expression of scFv-Fc proteins in NS0 cells, the 1F12 and 3F1 scFv genes were inserted into a template plasmid signal human Fc-pEE12.4 (SFpEE), as described previously (8Zhang W. Matsumoto-Takasaki A. Kusada Y. Sakaue H. Sakai K. Nakata M. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the gene encoding 1F12, 3F1, 5A3, 1A4, or 1G4 scFv with the signal peptide sequence and human Fc domain was assembled by splice-overlap extension PCR and subcloned into the pCI-neo plasmid, as described previously (8Zhang W. Matsumoto-Takasaki A. Kusada Y. Sakaue H. Sakai K. Nakata M. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), resulting in pCI-neo/signal scFv (1F12, 3F1, 5A3, 1A4, or 1G4)-Fc. For controls, expression vectors encoding 1H7 scFv-Fc, which has specificity for the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (14Li S.L. Liang S.J. Guo N. Wu A.M. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2000; 49: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and Fc only were similarly prepared. All plasmids used for electroporation or lipofection into mammalian cells were purified with the EndFree plasmid maxi kit. The murine myeloma NS0 cell line was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm glutamine. Selective medium for human Fc-expressing NS0 cells consisted of glutamine-free DMEM, dialyzed FBS, and glutamine synthase supplement (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Forty μg of linearized 1F12 or 3F1/SFpEE DNA in sterile water was electroporated into 1 × 107 NS0 cells at conditions of 0.25 kV and 400 microfarad capacitance. Cells at 1.6 × 105 cells/ml were plated at 50 μl/well in 96-well plates and cultured in nonselective media. Twenty four hours after electroporation, 150 μl of selective medium were added to each well, and cells were allowed to recover and grow undisturbed for about 3 weeks until discrete surviving colonies appeared. Supernatants of transformed cells that were able to grow under selective conditions were screened for scFv-Fc protein secretion by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, goat anti-human IgG (Fc fragment-specific, Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml was coated in wells of 96-well plates by adding 100 μl/well and incubating overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, cell culture supernatants from different clones were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (Invitrogen) diluted to 1:1,000 was added to the wells. The wells were washed with PBS and then incubated with ABTS. The color that developed in the wells of the plates was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 415 nm with the Bio-Rad Microplate Reader. COS-7 cells (African green monkey SV40-transfected kidney fibroblast cell) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). For transient expression of 1F12 scFv-Fc gene, COS-7 cells grown to confluence in a 75-cm2 flask were cultured in 15 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 2 h and then further cultured in the presence of 20 μg of pCI-neo/signal-1F12 scFv-Fc DNA and 70 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Cells were cultured in fresh DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS for 72 h. Media (105 and 350 ml) were collected for purification of 1F12 scFv-Fc proteins. The best clone (14F8 in Fig. 1) for 1F12 scFv-Fc, i.e. the one with the highest expression of antibody, was cultured on a large scale in a T175 flask (Corning) in selective medium. After culturing for 24–48 h, cell culture supernatants were collected and dialyzed against 1.5 m glycine-NaOH, pH 8.9, and then passed through a protein A column (5 ml). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 1.5 m glycine-NaOH, pH 8.9, containing 3 m NaCl. Contaminating bovine IgG was eluted from the column with 100 mm citric acid buffer, pH 4.5. scFv-Fc proteins were then eluted from the column with 100 mm citric acid buffer, pH 3.0, and collected in 1.5-ml conical tubes containing 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Alternatively, the 1F12 scFv-Fc protein was purified by protein A affinity chromatography with the following modifications. After culture supernatants were placed on the column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the column was washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer. After contaminating bovine IgG was eluted from the column with 15 column volumes of 50 mm citric acid buffer, pH 5.0, scFv-Fc proteins were eluted from the column with 10 column volumes of 50 mm citric acid buffer, pH 3.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. The eluted scFv-Fc proteins were immediately neutralized by adding 0.17 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The eluates were concentrated and dialyzed against PBS using Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analyses, samples were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare), and the scFv-Fc protein was visualized by reaction with rabbit anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with peroxidase using the DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) detection kit. Protein concentration was measured according to the procedures used by Bradford with BSA as a standard. ELISA was used to evaluate the antigen binding activity of the purified 1F12 scFv-Fc protein. Briefly, 50 μl of the antigen, LNFPIII-BSA, in 0.05 m bicarbonate coating buffer, pH 9.6, (10 μg/ml) were added in wells of 96-well ELISA plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 3% BSA/PBS, a series of diluted samples of 1F12 scFv-Fc was added in triplicate. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the bound scFv-Fc was detected with rabbit peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (1:7,000 dilution) using ABTS as a substrate. After incubation for 30 min in the dark, the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 2% oxalic acid solution. Absorbance at 415 nm was measured using a plate reader. A group of different carbohydrate antigens conjugated with BSA (0.5 μg/well) was coated onto the ELISA plates to analyze the specificity of 1F12 scFv-Fc as described above. Seventy six hours after lipofection of COS-7 cells with scFv-Fc genes encoding 3F1, 1F12, 5A3, 1A4, 1G4, or 1H7, the Fc gene only, and the vector (mock), expression of various scFv-Fc and control Fc proteins in media was examined by sandwich ELISA using anti-human IgG (Fc fragment-specific) antibody as described above. To measure intracellular levels of scFv-Fc proteins, COS-7 cells 76 h after lipofection with genes encoding 3F1, 1F12, 5A3, 1A4, 1G4, or 1H7 scFv-Fc, Fc, and the vector (mock) were washed twice with PBS and treated with 5 ml of Cell Dissociation solution (Sigma) in a 75-cm2 flask. Cells were suspended by pipetting and recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min. Cells were suspended in PBS (1 × 106/1 ml PBS) with protease inhibitor mixture P8340 (Sigma) and sonicated on ice three times for 5 s. Clear supernatants were subjected to sandwich ELISA to quantify scFv-Fc protein expression levels as described above. The scFv-Fc or Fc concentrations of both secreted and intracellular fractions were quantified by using human Fc fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as a standard. The concentrations estimated were then calculated as micrograms of scFv-Fc or Fc/106 cells to readily compare secreted and intracellular amounts of scFv-Fc or Fc. COS-7 cells were grown to 70% confluence in wells of the Lab-Tek Chamber Slide System (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and subjected to lipofection with scFv-Fc genes encoding 3F1, 1F12, 5A3, 1A4, or 1G4, Fc, and the vector (mock) by adding"
https://openalex.org/W2144799747,"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; kininase II) levels in humans are genetically determined. ACE levels have been linked to risk of myocardial infarction, but the association has been inconsistent, and the causality underlying it remains undocumented. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in ACE levels influences myocardial tolerance to ischemia. We studied ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice bearing 1 (ACE1c), 2 (ACE2c, wild type), or 3 (ACE3c) functional copies of the ACE gene and displaying an ACE level range similar to humans. Infarct size in ACE1c was 29% lower than in ACE2c (P<0.05). Pretreatment with a kinin B2 receptor antagonist suppressed this reduction. In ACE3c, infarct size was the same as in ACE2c. But ischemic preconditioning, which reduced infarct size in ACE2c (-63%, P<0.001) and ACE1c (-52%, P<0.05), was not efficient in ACE3c (-2%, NS, P<0.01 vs. ACE2c). In ACE3c, ischemic preconditioning did not decrease myocardial inflammation or cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Pretreatment with a renin inhibitor had no cardioprotective effect in ACE2c, but in ACE3c partially restored (38%) the cardioprotection of ischemic preconditioning. Thus, a modest genetic increase in ACE impairs myocardial tolerance to ischemia. ACE level plays a critical role in cardiac ischemia, through both kinin and angiotensin mediated mechanisms."

This discovery has led to the search for small molecule inhibitors that target Jak2. Using structure-based virtual screening, our group recently identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of Jak2 named G6. Here, we identified a structure-function correlation of this compound. Specifically, five derivative compounds of G6 having structural similarity to the original lead compound were obtained and analyzed for their ability to (i) inhibit Jak2-V617F-mediated cell growth, (ii) inhibit the levels of phospho-Jak2, phospho-STAT3, and phospho-STAT5; (iii) induce apoptosis in human erythroleukemia cells; and (iv) suppress pathologic cell growth of Jak2-V617F-expressing human bone marrow cells ex vivo. Additionally, we computationally examined the interactions of these compounds with the ATP-binding pocket of the Jak2 kinase domain. We found that the stilbenoid core-containing derivatives of G6 significantly inhibited Jak2-V617F-mediated cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. They also inhibited phosphorylation of Jak2, STAT3, and STAT5 proteins within cells, resulting in higher levels of apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Finally, the stilbenoid derivatives inhibited the pathologic growth of Jak2-V617F-expressing human bone marrow cells ex vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2078058865,"To prevent progression to AIDS, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) must remain on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) indefinitely since this modality does not eradicate the virus. The mechanisms involved in viral persistence during HAART are poorly understood, but an animal model of HAART could help elucidate these mechanisms and enable studies of HIV-1 eradication strategies. Due to the specificity of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) for HIV-1, we have used RT-SHIV, a chimeric virus of simian immunodeficiency virus with RT from HIV-1. This virus is susceptible to NNRTIs and causes an AIDS-like disease in rhesus macaques. In this study, two groups of HAART-treated, RT-SHIV-infected macaques were analyzed to determine viral decay kinetics. In the first group, viral loads were monitored with a standard TaqMan RT-PCR assay with a limit of detection of 50 viral RNA copies per mL. Upon initiation of HAART, viremia decayed in a bi-phasic manner with half-lives of 1.7 and 8.5 days, respectively. A third phase was observed with little further decay. In the second group, the macaques were followed longitudinally with a more sensitive assay utilizing ultracentrifugation to concentrate virus from plasma. Bi-phasic decay of viral RNA was also observed in these animals with half-lives of 1.8 and 5.8 days. Viral loads in these animals during a third phase ranged from 2-58 RNA copies/mL, with little decay over time. The viral decay kinetics observed in these macaques are similar to those reported for HIV-1 infected humans. These results demonstrate that low-level viremia persists in RT-SHIV-infected macaques despite a HAART regimen commonly used in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2063855493,"The yeast pheromone response pathway is a canonical three-step mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade which requires a scaffold protein for proper signal transduction. Recent experimental studies into the role the scaffold plays in modulating the character of the transduced signal, show that the presence of the scaffold increases the biphasic nature of the signal response. This runs contrary to prior theoretical investigations into how scaffolds function. We describe a mathematical model of the yeast MAPK cascade specifically designed to capture the experimental conditions and results of these empirical studies. We demonstrate how the system can exhibit either graded or ultrasensitive (biphasic) response dynamics based on the binding kinetics of enzymes to the scaffold. At the basis of our theory is an analytical result that weak interactions make the response biphasic while tight interactions lead to a graded response. We then show via an analysis of the kinetic binding rate constants how the results of experimental manipulations, modeled as changes to certain of these binding constants, lead to predictions of pathway output consistent with experimental observations. We demonstrate how the results of these experimental manipulations are consistent within the framework of our theoretical treatment of this scaffold-dependent MAPK cascades, and how future efforts in this style of systems biology can be used to interpret the results of other signal transduction observations."
https://openalex.org/W2064861557,"The chemokine CX3CL1 is expressed as a membrane protein that forms a potent adhesive pair with its unique receptor CX3CR1. This receptor has 3 natural variants, V249-T280 (VT), I249-T280 (IT), and I249-M280 (IM), whose relative frequencies are significantly associated with the incidence of various inflammatory diseases. To assess the adhesive potency of CX3CR1 and the molecular diversity of its variants, we assayed their clustering status and their possible structural differences by fluorescence/bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET or BRET) techniques. FRET assays by flow cytometry showed that the CX3CR1 variants cluster, in comparison with appropriate controls. BRET assays showed low nonspecific signals for VT and IT variants and high specific signals for IM, and thus pointed out a structural difference in this variant. We used molecular modeling to show how natural point mutations of CX3CR1 affect the packing of the 6th and 7th helices of this G-protein coupled receptor. Moreover, we found that the BRET technique is sensitive enough to detect these tiny changes. Consistently with our previous finding that CX3CL1 aggregates, our data here indicate that CX3CR1 clustering may contribute to the adhesiveness of the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 pair and may thus represent a new target for anti-inflammatory therapies.—Darbandi-Tehrani, K., Hermand, P., Carvalho, S., Dorgham, K., Couvineau, A., Lacapère, J.-J., Combadière, C., Deterre, P.
