https://openalex.org/W2110918588,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the founder cells of the adult haematopoietic system, and thus knowledge of the molecular program directing their generation during development is important for regenerative haematopoietic strategies. Runx1 is a pivotal transcription factor required for HSC generation in the vascular regions of the mouse conceptus-the aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, yolk sac and placenta. It is thought that HSCs emerge from vascular endothelial cells through the formation of intra-arterial clusters and that Runx1 functions during the transition from 'haemogenic endothelium' to HSCs. Here we show by conditional deletion that Runx1 activity in vascular-endothelial-cadherin-positive endothelial cells is indeed essential for intra-arterial cluster, haematopoietic progenitor and HSC formation in mice. In contrast, Runx1 is not required in cells expressing Vav1, one of the first pan-haematopoietic genes expressed in HSCs. Collectively these data show that Runx1 function is essential in endothelial cells for haematopoietic progenitor and HSC formation from the vasculature, but its requirement ends once or before Vav is expressed."

This 'Casimir–Lifshitz' force can cause static friction or 'stiction' in nanomachines, which must be strongly reduced. Until now only attractive interactions have been reported but in theory, if vacuum is replaced by certain media, Casimir–Lifshitz forces should become repulsive. This has now been confirmed experimentally. Repulsion, weaker than the attractive force, was measured in a carefully chosen system of interacting materials immersed in fluid. The magnitude of both forces increases as separation decreases. The repulsive forces could conceivably allow quantum levitation of objects in a fluid and lead to new types of switchable nanoscale devices with ultra-low static friction. Levitation depends only on the dielectric properties of the various materials. The cover illustrates repulsion between a tiny gold sphere and a silica substrate (left). Replace the silica with gold (right), and the force becomes attractive. In a vacuum, the Casimir–Lifshitz force causes friction effects that either hinder or may be exploited in nanomechanical device applications. So far, only attractive interactions have been measured, but theory predicts that when vacuum is replaced with certain media, the Casimir–Lifshitz force can also be repulsive. This effect is now experimentally confirmed in this study, which carefully chooses a system of interacting materials immersed in a fluid. The measured repulsive interaction is found to be weaker than the attractive force whereas in both cases the magnitude of the force increases with decreasing surface separation. Quantum fluctuations create intermolecular forces that pervade macroscopic bodies1,2,3. At molecular separations of a few nanometres or less, these interactions are the familiar van der Waals forces4. However, as recognized in the theories of Casimir, Polder and Lifshitz5,6,7, at larger distances and between macroscopic condensed media they reveal retardation effects associated with the finite speed of light. Although these long-range forces exist within all matter, only attractive interactions have so far been measured between material bodies8,9,10,11. Here we show experimentally that, in accord with theoretical prediction12, the sign of the force can be changed from attractive to repulsive by suitable choice of interacting materials immersed in a fluid. The measured repulsive interaction is found to be weaker than the attractive. However, in both cases the magnitude of the force increases with decreasing surface separation. Repulsive Casimir–Lifshitz forces could allow quantum levitation of objects in a fluid and lead to a new class of switchable nanoscale devices with ultra-low static friction13,14,15."

Aromatase inhibitors therefore constitute a frontline therapy for oestrogen-dependent breast cancer. In a three-step process, each step requiring 1 mol of O(2), 1 mol of NADPH, and coupling with its redox partner cytochrome P450 reductase, aromatase converts androstenedione, testosterone and 16alpha-hydroxytestosterone to oestrone, 17beta-oestradiol and 17beta,16alpha-oestriol, respectively. The first two steps are C19-methyl hydroxylation steps, and the third involves the aromatization of the steroid A-ring, unique to aromatase. Whereas most P450s are not highly substrate selective, it is the hallmark androgenic specificity that sets aromatase apart. The structure of this enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane has remained unknown for decades, hindering elucidation of the biochemical mechanism. Here we present the crystal structure of human placental aromatase, the only natural mammalian, full-length P450 and P450 in hormone biosynthetic pathways to be crystallized so far. Unlike the active sites of many microsomal P450s that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, aromatase has an androgen-specific cleft that binds the androstenedione molecule snugly. Hydrophobic and polar residues exquisitely complement the steroid backbone. The locations of catalytically important residues shed light on the reaction mechanism. The relative juxtaposition of the hydrophobic amino-terminal region and the opening to the catalytic cleft shows why membrane anchoring is necessary for the lipophilic substrates to gain access to the active site. The molecular basis for the enzyme's androgenic specificity and unique catalytic mechanism can be used for developing next-generation aromatase inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2018719587,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of loss of central vision in the elderly. The formation of drusen, an extracellular, amorphous deposit of material on Bruch's membrane in the macula of the retina, occurs early in the course of the disease. Although some of the molecular components of drusen are known, there is no understanding of the cell biology that leads to the formation of drusen. We have previously demonstrated increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and decreased DNA repair enzyme capabilities in the rodent RPE/choroid with age. In this study, we found that drusen in AMD donor eyes contain markers for autophagy and exosomes. Furthermore, these markers are also found in the region of Bruch's membrane in old mice. By in vitro modeling increased mtDNA damage induced by rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, in the RPE, we found that the phagocytic activity was not altered but that there were: 1) increased autophagic markers, 2) decreased lysosomal activity, 3) increased exocytotic activity and 4) release of chemoattractants. Exosomes released by the stressed RPE are coated with complement and can bind complement factor H, mutations of which are associated with AMD. We speculate that increased autophagy and the release of intracellular proteins via exosomes by the aged RPE may contribute to the formation of drusen. Molecular and cellular changes in the old RPE may underlie susceptibility to genetic mutations that are found in AMD patients and may be associated with the pathogenesis of AMD in the elderly."

https://openalex.org/W2125053230,"Homomeric ring ATPases perform many vital and varied tasks in the cell, ranging from chromosome segregation to protein degradation. Here we report the direct observation of the intersubunit coordination and step size of such a ring ATPase, the double-stranded-DNA packaging motor in the bacteriophage phi29. Using high-resolution optical tweezers, we find that packaging occurs in increments of 10 base pairs (bp). Statistical analysis of the preceding dwell times reveals that multiple ATPs bind during each dwell, and application of high force reveals that these 10-bp increments are composed of four 2.5-bp steps. These results indicate that the hydrolysis cycles of the individual subunits are highly coordinated by means of a mechanism novel for ring ATPases. Furthermore, a step size that is a non-integer number of base pairs demands new models for motor-DNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1977966865,"Cellular stress such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypoxia, and viral infection activates an integrated stress response, which includes the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) to inhibit overall protein synthesis. Paradoxically, this leads to translation of a subset of mRNAs, like transcription factor ATF4, which in turn induces transcription of downstream stress-induced genes such as growth arrest DNA-inducible gene 34 (GADD34). GADD34 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2α, resulting in a negative feedback loop to recover protein synthesis and allow translation of stress-induced transcripts. Here, we show that GADD34 is not only transcriptionally induced but also translationally regulated to ensure maximal expression during eIF2α phosphorylation. GADD34 mRNAs are preferentially associated with polysomes during eIF2α phosphorylation, which is mediated by its 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR). The human GADD34 5′UTR contains two non-overlapping upstream open reading frames (uORFs), whereas the mouse version contains two overlapping and out of frame uORFs. Using 5′UTR GADD34 reporter constructs, we show that the downstream uORF mediates repression of basal translation and directs translation during eIF2α phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the upstream uORF is poorly translated and that a proportion of scanning ribosomes bypasses the upstream uORF to recognize the downstream uORF. These findings suggest that GADD34 translation is regulated by a unique 5′UTR uORF mechanism to ensure proper GADD34 expression during eIF2α phosphorylation. This mechanism may serve as a model for understanding how other 5′UTR uORF-containing mRNAs are regulated during cellular stress.

Phosphorylation of Ser51 in eIF2α is a key cellular response to environmental stresses such as hypoxia, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PERK, protein kinase R-like ER kinase; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α; ORF, open reading frame; uORF, upstream ORF; UTR, untranslated region; UPR, unfolded protein response; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein; GADD34, growth arrest DNA-inducible gene 34. stress and viral infection. The stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α represses general protein synthesis, which induces the expression of specific genes involved in the stress response (1Ron D. Harding H.P. Mathews M.B.

Reprogramming of gene expression is vital for cellular survival and can trigger apoptosis, if the stress is severe and prolonged. In mammals, four distinct eIF2α kinases have been identified (2Dever T.E. Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 319-344Google Scholar). These include protein kinase R, which is activated upon binding to double-stranded RNAs or through the antiviral interferon response (3Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the heme-regulated inhibitor, which senses heme availability and responds to oxidative stress (4Han A.P. Yu C. Lu L. Fujiwara Y.

Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Although protein kinase R, heme-regulated inhibitor, general control nonderepressible-2, and PERK can all catalyze the phosphorylation of eIF2α to halt protein synthesis, they do so in response to distinct environmental cues. For instance, the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates PERK to repress translation to ease the load of unfolded proteins in the ER, whereas translational repression during amino acid depletion is achieved through general control nonderepressible-2 activation, which provides cells sufficient time for recovery from nutrient starvation. The biological importance of each eIF2α kinase signaling pathway is reflected in their association with several diseases such as diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infections, including hepatitis C virus and cytomegalovirus infections (8Tardif K.D.

The ternary complex, composed of initiator Met-tRNAi, GTP, and the heterotrimeric initiation factor eIF2, mediates recognition of the AUG codon by scanning 40 S ribosomal subunits (2Dever T.E.

Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 87-128Google Scholar). Upon correct basepairing of the codon-anticodon of the Met-tRNAi, eIF2-GTP is hydrolyzed to eIF2-GDP and subsequently released. Free eIF2-GDP is recycled to the green fluorescent protein-bound form by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2α on Ser51 prevents the exchange of GDP for GTP by sequestering eIF2B, thus lowering the available pool of eIF2-GTP and repressing protein synthesis (14Proud C.G.

Although general protein synthesis is repressed when eIF2α is phosphorylated, a subset of mRNAs remains actively translated under these conditions. Such mRNAs include mammalian ATF4, ATF5, and yeast GCN4 mRNAs (6Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G.

A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Translation of ATF4, a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors responsible for inducing transcription of downstream stress-inducible genes, is governed by two uORFs within its 5′UTR (17Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 20Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Following translation of the upstream uORF, under basal conditions, ribosomes resume scanning and reinitiate translation at the downstream uORF, which leads to ribosome disassembly and prevents ATF4 translation. In contrast, under conditions where eIF2α is phosphorylated, reinitiating ribosomes have a higher probability of recruiting another eIF2 ternary complex downstream after the AUG codon of the downstream uORF and thereby initiate translation at the ATF4 ORF. This mechanism is reminiscent of the classic model of reinitiation exemplified by the translational regulation of the yeast GCN4 transcription factor (21Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. Poyry T.A.A. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 197-224Google Scholar). The expression of ATF5, another bZIP family member, is also regulated at the translational level through a similar mechanism involving uORFs in its 5′UTR, indicating that such a mechanism is conserved and likely important for regulating many mRNAs (18Zhou D.

The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates a multitude of intracellular signaling pathways, collectively referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (22Kenzelmann M. Maertens S.

A. 2007; 1046164Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One arm of the UPR switches on the ER-resident unfolded protein sensor, PERK, to repress global protein synthesis via eIF2α phosphorylation, which in turn induces ATF4 translation (16Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). ATF4 activates the transcription of downstream stress-induced genes, including CHOP and GADD34 (23Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R.

GADD34 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2α, which relieves the inhibition of translation (24Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H. Ron D. J.

Although it is clear that GADD34 transcriptional induction is important, the mechanism by which the GADD34 transcript is translated during eIF2α phosphorylation remains obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that translation of the human and mouse GADD34 mRNAs are governed through an uORF within its 5′UTR, which is responsible for translational repression during unstressed conditions and directs translation of GADD34 during eIF2α phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the human and mouse 5′UTRs use a distinct mechanism to ensure GADD34 expression during cellular stresses that induce eIF2α phosphorylation. 5′RACE and Plasmid Construction-The human 5′UTR GADD34-YFP, mouse 5′UTR GADD34-YFP, and human 5′UTR ATF4-YFP reporter plasmids were engineered using a two-part ligation strategy in the pcDNA3 vector. The human GADD34 5′UTR cDNA was synthesized by 5′RACE from total HepG2 RNA using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE system (Ambion) and PCR-amplified using a gene-specific primer, PrEJ18, and the 5′RACE-nested inner primer. The PCR product was TA-cloned (Invitrogen) and sequence-verified. The human GADD34 5′UTR fragment was digested with EcoRI and NcoI. The mouse GADD34 5′UTR cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers, PrEJ481 and PrEJ482, which contain a 5′ EcoRI anda3′ NcoI site. The human ATF4 5′UTR was PCR-amplified using primers, PrEJ279 and PrEJ420RR, and subsequently TA-cloned. ATF4 5′UTR was digested with a 5′ EcoRI and a 3′ BbsI site, which contains complementary ends with NcoI. The reporter enhanced YFP, eYFP (Clontech), was PCR-amplified using primers containing a 5′ NcoI and a 3′ XbaI site. The digested 5′UTR and amplified eYFP were cloned into EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3, resulting in fusion of the 5′UTR with YFP via an NcoI site. The NcoI site contains the AUG codon of eYFP. These ligations yielded the human GADD34 5′UTR-YFP (hGADD34-YFP), the mouse GADD34 5′UTR-YFP (mGADD34-YFP), and the human ATF4-YFP (hATF4-YFP) constructs. All mutant 5′UTRs, including mutations that either knocked out the AUG codon of each uORF, inserted codons between the start codon and stop codon of the mouse uORFs, or fused each uORF with the YFP ORF, were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were sequenced and verified. The sequence of the mGADD34 uORFs overlap is 5′-..cgacAUGAacc..-3′. The AUG start codon of uORF2 overlaps with the UGA of uORF1. To create the 1 and 2 codon insertion mutants, a codon (underlined) was inserted to produce 5′-... cgacAUGUUGAacc... -3′ (1cod) and 5′-... cgacAUGUUGUUGAacc...-3′ (2cod). Cell Culture and Stable Cell Lines-Mouse Hepa (1–6C) cells were generously provided by Maria Hatzoglou (Case Western University, Cleveland). HepG2 and Hepa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin. Plasmid transfections in HepG2 cells were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) at 60% confluency. Stable cell lines were selected using Geneticin, and cells were passaged as pooled cell lines. Cells were treated either with 1 μm thapsigargin (Sigma), 2 mm DTT, or 100 μg/ml arsenite (Riedel de Haen) to activate eIF2α kinases and induce eIF2α phosphorylation. Western Blot Analysis-Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were freeze-thawed three times and centrifuged to clear cell debris and nuclei. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P or Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore). Total eIF2α was detected using a polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of eIF2α (Cell Signaling, #9722), and phosphorylated eIF2α was detected with an epitope-specific antiserum (Cell Signaling, #9721). Immunoblots were probed with GADD34 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-193), CHOP (Affinity Bioreagents MAI-250), ATF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-200), and green fluorescent protein (Roche Applied Science) antibodies. The anti-green fluorescent protein antibody cross-reacts with the YFP reporter protein. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation and Polysome Analysis-Sucrose gradient centrifugation and polysome analysis was prepared as described (28Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Briefly, prior to drug treatment and cell lysis, fresh media was added to cells 4–6 h earlier. Cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3 min at 37 °C, washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested directly on the plate using lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mg/ml heparin). Nuclei and cell debris were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 10–50% (w/v) sucrose gradient composed of the lysis buffer minus the Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h in an SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the top using an ISCO fraction collector and a Brandel syringe pump system. To collect RNA, 3 ml of 8 m guanidine-HCl and 5 ml of EtOH were added to each fraction, precipitated, and resuspended in water. Equal volumes of fractionated RNA were subjected to Northern blot analysis. Radiolabel Incorporation and Immunoprecipitation of Newly Synthesized Proteins-To examine newly synthesized proteins, cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium minus methionine and cysteine supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 25 min and metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine-cysteine for 20 min. To induce stress, 1 μm thapsigargin, 2 mm DTT, or 100 μg/ml arsenite were incubated at the same time when cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium minus methionine and cysteine. Radiolabeled cells were washed two times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Equal amounts of proteins, determined by Bradford reagent, were incubated with anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (Roche Applied Science) and agarose-protein G beads according to the protocol recommended by Roche Applied Science. Proteins attached to the agarose-beads were recovered by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, subjected to PhosphorImager analysis, and quantified by ImageQuant (Storm, Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis-Total RNA (TRIzol, Invitrogen) or RNA purified from sucrose gradient centrifugation fractions were separated on a denaturing agarose gel and transferred to Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). Radiolabeled DNA hybridization probes were generated using the Radprime kit (Invitrogen). The amount of radiolabeled probe was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Storm, Amersham Biosciences). Oligonucleotide Sequences-The sequences were PrEJ18 (5′-CTACCCATGGGTCTGGGCGGCTGGGGGC-3′), PrEJ279 (5′-TTTCTACTTTGCCCGCCCACAG-3′), PrEJ420 (RR-5′-CTAGGAAGACCCCATGGTTTCTTCAGCCCC-3′), PrEJ481 (5′-CTAGGAATTCGCTCTGAGTTTGTGGAAGATT-3′), and PrEJ482 (5′-CTAGCCATGGGTCTGGGCGGCGGGCTGCAC-3′). Translational Control during ER Stress in Liver Cells-To investigate the mechanisms of translational control during ER stress, human hepatoma HepG2 cells and mouse hepatoma Hepa cells were treated with UPR-inducing agents, thapsigargin or DTT. These cells were chosen because they are highly secretory and are sensitive to drugs that accumulate unfolded proteins in the ER. Protein synthesis was measured by pulsed labeling with [35S]methionine for the indicated times followed by quantitation of the total radioactive incorporation into newly synthesized polypeptides. Both thapsigargin and DTT treatment inhibited general protein synthesis as early as 15 min after incubation and was sustained for 30 min (Fig. 1, A and B). Notably, inhibition correlated with increased phosphorylation of eIF2α observed at both time points (Fig. 1, A and B). A partial recovery in protein synthesis was observed upon prolonged incubation with thapsigargin or DTT (60 min), which correlated with reduced phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 1A). Incubation with thapsigargin or DTT for extended periods also elicited an increase in GADD34 protein levels, consistent with the fact that increased GADD34 protein levels mediate eIF2α dephosphorylation (Fig. 2C) (26Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 221180Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2GADD34 expression in HepG2 cells during thapsigargin and actinomycin D treatment.

Quantitation of the amount of radioactivity within each fraction is shown in supplemental Fig. S1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the translation of specific and total RNAs during ER stress, lysates of cells untreated or treated with thapsigargin were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In untreated cells, the majority of ribosomes sedimented to heavier molecular weight polysomes, indicating that most ribosomes are actively engaged in translation (Fig. 1C, left panel). In contrast, treatment of cells with thapsigargin resulted in dissociation of ribosomes from mRNAs and an increase in free 40 S and 60 S subunits (Fig. 1C, right panel). The loss of polysomes is in agreement with the significant decrease in protein synthesis during thapsigargin treatment. Polysome Association of GADD34 in Human and Mouse Liver Cells during ER Stress-We next asked whether GADD34 mRNAs are associated with polysomes during ER stress. To monitor the association of specific mRNAs with ribosomes, individual mRNAs within the sucrose gradient fractions were probed by Northern blot analysis. In untreated human HepG2 and mouse Hepa cells, actin and GAPDH mRNAs sedimented primarily to heavy molecular weight fractions 9 and 10, indicating that these mRNAs associated with many ribosomes and are actively translated (Fig. 1, D–G). Thapsigargin and DTT treatment resulted in a dramatic shift of actin and GAPDH mRNAs to lower molecular weight polysomes, consistent with these mRNAs being translationally repressed relative to those in untreated cells (Fig. 1, D–G). Conversely, ATF4 mRNA remained associated with polysomes during thapsigargin and DTT treatment in both cell lines as reported previously (Fig. 1, D and E) (16Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 17Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, ATF4 mRNA sedimented primarily with more ribosomes (fractions 7–9) under ER stress than under untreated conditions (fractions 6–8), indicating that this mRNA is translationally induced during eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Similar to ATF4, human and mouse GADD34 mRNAs shifted to higher molecular weight fractions during thapsigargin and DTT treatments compared with those during unstressed conditions (Fig. 1, D–G). Therefore, like ATF4, both human and mouse GADD34 mRNAs possess mechanisms to direct translation during ER stress when eIF2α is phosphorylated. GADD34 Is Regulated at the Transcriptional and Translational Level during ER Stress-Given that the GADD34 mRNA was associated with more ribosomes (Fig. 1) and that GADD34 has been shown to be transcriptionally up-regulated during ER stress (24Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 25Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), the increase in GADD34 protein expression is likely due to increases in both transcription and translation rates. To determine the contribution of translational control of GADD34 during eIF2α phosphorylation, we treated cells with the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, and thapsigargin. Incubation with actinomycin D inhibited the thapsigargin-induced transcription of GADD34, ATF4, and CHOP, consistent with previous reports that these genes are transcriptionally induced during ER stress (Fig. 2, A and B) (16Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 24Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with thapsigargin alone or a combination of thapsigargin and actinomycin D induced a small but reproducible increase in GADD34 protein levels, indicating that GADD34 is translationally up-regulated (Fig. 2, C and D). Treatment with actinomycin D alone did not induce GADD34 expression. Similarly, ATF4 protein expression was increased during thapsigargin and thapsigargin/actinomycin D treatments, whereas CHOP expression was only induced during thapsigargin treatment, in agreement that transcriptional induction is required for CHOP expression during ER stress (16Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar).

However, there are limited longitudinal data on the reproductive intentions and outcomes among women on ART in Africa. Methodology /Principal Findings Using a prospective cohort design, we analyzed trends in desire for children and predictors of pregnancy among a cohort of 733 HIV-infected women in rural Uganda who initiated ART between May 2003 and May 2004 and were followed up in their homes until June 2006. Women answered in-depth social and behavioral questionnaires administered every quarter in year 1 after initiating ART, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Use of family planning methods was assessed at 18 and 24 months after starting ART. We tested for non-constant pregnancy incidence by using a shape parameter test from the Weibull distribution. We modeled repeated measurements of all variables related to the women's desire for children over time using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) extension to the logistic regression model. Risk factors for pregnancy were examined using Cox proportional hazards model. 711 women eligible for the study were followed-up for a median time of 2.4 years after starting ART. During this time, less than 7% of women reported wanting more children at any time point yet 120 (16.9%) women experienced 140 pregnancies and pregnancy incidence increased from 3.46 per 100 women-years (WY) in the first quarter to 9.5 per 100 WY at 24 months (p<0.0001). This was paralleled by an increase in the proportion of women reporting sexual activity in the past 3 months, from 24.4% at baseline to 32.5% over 24 months of follow-up (p = 0.001). Only 14% of women used permanent or semi-permanent family planning methods by their second year on ART. In the multivariate model, younger age (HR = 2.71 per 10-year decrease, 95% CI: 2.95–3.78), having a BMI>18.5 (HR = 1.09, CI: 1.01–1.18) and not having used condoms consistently in the last 3 months (HR = 1.79, CI: 1.02–3.13) were independently associated with pregnancy. Conclusion/Significance Women on ART and their partners should be consistently counseled on the effects of ART in restoring fertility, and offered regularly free and comprehensive family planning services as part of their standard package of care."
https://openalex.org/W2008407032,"Ribosome is responsible for protein synthesis in all organisms and ribosomal proteins (RPs) play important roles in the formation of a functional ribosome. L11 was recently shown to regulate p53 activity through a direct binding with MDM2 and abrogating the MDM2-induced p53 degradation in response to ribosomal stress. However, the studies were performed in cell lines and the significance of this tumor suppressor function of L11 has yet to be explored in animal models. To investigate the effects of the deletion of L11 and its physiological relevance to p53 activity, we knocked down the rpl11 gene in zebrafish and analyzed the p53 response. Contrary to the cell line-based results, our data indicate that an L11 deficiency in a model organism activates the p53 pathway. The L11-deficient embryos (morphants) displayed developmental abnormalities primarily in the brain, leading to embryonic lethality within 6-7 days post fertilization. Extensive apoptosis was observed in the head region of the morphants, thus correlating the morphological defects with apparent cell death. A decrease in total abundance of genes involved in neural patterning of the brain was observed in the morphants, suggesting a reduction in neural progenitor cells. Upregulation of the genes involved in the p53 pathway were observed in the morphants. Simultaneous knockdown of the p53 gene rescued the developmental defects and apoptosis in the morphants. These results suggest that ribosomal dysfunction due to the loss of L11 activates a p53-dependent checkpoint response to prevent improper embryonic development."

These include many proteins that play critical roles in the virulence of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens such that sortases are attractive targets for development of novel antimicrobial agents.

These new insights into sortase structure and function could have important consequences for inhibitor design. Cell wall-anchored proteins play critical roles in the virulence of most Gram-positive bacterial pathogens by acting as adhesins or invasins and/or interfering with various arms of the host innate or specific immune defenses. The vast majority of these virulence proteins are retained at the bacterial surface after secretion by a mechanism that involves the covalent linkage of target proteins to the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. This linkage is catalyzed by membrane-associated transpeptidases called sortases (1Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The sortase-mediated transpeptidation reaction is also being increasingly used in a variety of biotechnology applications (5Popp M.W. Antos J.M. Grotenbreg G.M. Spooner E. Ploegh H.L. Nat. Chem.

The sorting signal that targets proteins for cell surface attachment is located at the C terminus of substrates and comprises a pentapeptide motif, typically LPXTG (where X is any amino acid), followed by a hydrophobic region and a tail of positively charged residues that locates the substrate to the cell surface following secretion (2Paterson G.K.

In one current model of sortase-dependent transpeptidation, the LPXTG motif is specifically recognized by the enzyme (10Bentley M.L. Gaweska H. Kielec J.M. McCafferty D.G. J. Biol.

Two additional absolutely conserved residues are located in the active site, a His and an Arg (12Zong Y. Bice T.W. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Narayana S.V. J. Biol.

The His may act as a general acid to protonate the tetrahedral intermediate, thus facilitating collapse of the transition state and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Meanwhile, the Arg is thought to either stabilize the short-lived oxyanion-transition state (14Frankel B.A. Tong Y. Bentley M.L. Fitzgerald M.C. McCafferty D.G.

Lam A.C. Antonio M. Dunbar K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 97-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although genes encoding SrtA and its substrate proteins do not appear to be closely linked in bacterial genomes, genes encoding functionally related but distinct sortases tend to be clustered with their substrate proteins and can have divergent sorting motifs (30Mazmanian S.K.

The serotype M1, SF370 strain of the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes expresses two distinct sortases, SrtA (Spy1154) and SrtC2 (Spy0129). S. pyogenes SrtA (Sp-SrtA) is the general housekeeping sortase and is responsible for anchoring all proteins containing the LPXTG sorting signal to the cell wall, including various key virulence proteins, such as the M-protein, protein G-related αz M-binding protein (GRAB), and ScpA (31Barnett T.C. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2181-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Smith W.D. Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences. Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK2004Google Scholar). The second sortase (SrtC2) catalyzes the polymerization of cell surface pili that mediate specific S. pyogenes adhesion to clinically relevant human tonsil and skin cells (34Abbot E.L. Smith W.D. Siou G.P. Chiriboga C. Smith R.J. Wilson J.A. Hirst B.H. Kehoe M.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1822-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 35Mora M. Bensi G. Capo S. Falugi F. Zingaretti C.

Kehoe, unpublished data. have shown that Sp-SrtA is responsible for anchoring these pili in the cell wall. This appears to be equivalent to reports that in Coryne-bacterium diphtheriae two sortases mediate pilus assembly (36Swaminathan A. Mandlik A. Swierczynski A. Gaspar A. Das A. Ton-That H. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and suggests the role of sortases in the mechanism of pili assembly may be conserved in all Gram-positive bacteria. To further understand structure/function relationships and the in vivo role of these enzymes, the three-dimensional structure of sortase A from the serotype M1, SF370 strain of S. pyogenes has been determined, and its transpeptidase activity with functionally relevant substrates has been demonstrated. The structure has been determined in two states, one in which the active site Cys is reduced and one where it is oxidized to its sulfenic acid derivative. A long cleft in the structure, with the catalytic Cys at its center, forms the binding site for the sorting signal and, likely, the branched side chain cell-wall precursor that acts to resolve the acyl-enzyme intermediate. Furthermore, the conformation of the loops surrounding the active site are all well defined in the structure (including the β6/β7 loop) providing for the first time a complete atomic description of the active site and substrate binding regions in a SrtA enzyme. These results form a basis for further studies to probe the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of this important family of enzymes. Gene Cloning-The DNA sequence encoding SrtA residues Val-82-Thr-249 (SrtAΔ81) was amplified from serotype M1 S. pyogenes strain SF370 genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CTTAGGATCCGTCTTGCAAGCACAAATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGTTCTCGAGCTAGGTAGATACTTGGTTATAAGA-3′ (reverse). This construct removes the predicted secretion signal sequence (residues Met-1-Ala-43), other predicted disordered regions at the N terminus, and also introduces appropriate restriction sites for subsequent cloning (BamH1 and Xho1 sites, underlined). The PCR product was digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned directly into a modified version of pET28a (cut with the same enzymes, vector originally from Novagen) in which the nucleotides between the Nde1 and BamH1 restriction sites are removed. The resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. Protein Expression and Purification-Cultures of BL21 (DE3) harboring the Sp-SrtAΔ81·pET28a vector were grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani (LB) media supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 between 0.4 and 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were grown for a further 3–4 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, supplemented with 5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to two pre-equilibrated 5-ml Hi-Trap chelating columns (loaded with nickel, GE Healthcare) joined sequentially. Sp-SrtAΔ81 was eluted with an imidazole gradient (10–500 mm) over 15 column volumes. Fractions containing Sp-SrtAΔ81 (as identified by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and concentrated. The protein was then injected onto a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 75 column pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Eluted fractions containing Sp-SrtAΔ81 were pooled and subjected to a repeat metal chelation purification step (as above), which was necessary to remove traces of contaminating protein. Pure Sp-SrtAΔ81 was then exchanged into 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated to 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration before further study. Transpeptidation Activity-Sp-SrtAΔ81 activity was determined using an HPLC-based assay previously developed for Sa-SrtA (14Frankel B.A. Tong Y. Bentley M.L. Fitzgerald M.C. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7269-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Kruger R.G. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For initial activity determination, Sp-SrtAΔ81 was incubated with 1.0 mm Abz-LPETGG-Dap(Dnp)-NH2 and 2.0 mm NH2-Ala2-OH in assay buffer (300 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5). Dialanine is the simplest form of cross-bridge between subunits in the peptidoglycan layer of S. pyogenes, equivalent to pentaglycine in S. aureus (37Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C (total volume 100 μl) and quenched by removal into a half-volume of 1.2 m HCl (final HCl concentration = 0.4 m). Samples were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using an analytical C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 3 μm, Vydac, Inc.) mounted on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system equipped with a fraction collector. 64 μl of the quenched reaction was injected onto the column, and the reaction products were separated using a linear gradient from 0 to 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 25 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Dnp- and Abz-containing peaks were detected using UV absorption (355 nm) and fluorescence (excitation = 318 nm, emission = 420 nm), respectively. Putative reaction products eluted at retention times of ∼14.3 min (detected by UV at 355 nm), ∼17.3 min (detected by fluorescence), ∼18.3 min (detected by fluorescence), and ∼24.3 min (detected by UV and fluorescence) and were collected using a fraction collector. The measured area under the both the substrate (Abz-LPETGG-Dap(Dnp)-NH2) and product (GG-Dap(Dnp)-NH2) peaks was used to determine the concentration of product. Linearity of activity was established out to 2.5 h. To determine steady-state kinetic parameters, assay length and enzyme concentration were chosen to yield product conversions of 1–10%. 5 μm Sp-SrtAΔ81 was incubated with 2 mm NH2-Ala2-OH, whereas the concentration of Abz-LPETGG-Dap(Dnp)-NH2 was varied from 62.5 μm to 8 mm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. After incubation for 150 min at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched and analyzed by HPLC as described above. All data points were collected in triplicate, and the overall assay was run in duplicate. To determine the effects of Ca2+ on the reaction, the assay was repeated in assay buffer as above but with Ca2+ omitted. Raw data were fitted to a modified version of the Michaelis-Menten equation incorporating substrate inhibition (Equation 1) using GraFit Version 4.03 (Erithacus Software), where Vmax is the apparent maximal enzymatic velocity, Km is the apparent Michaelis constant, and Ki is the apparent inhibitor dissociation constant for unproductive substrate binding. The data fit this equation with a χ2 value of 2.89 × 10-7 (5 mm Ca2+) and 1.27 × 10-6 (no Ca2+).νo=Vmax·[S]KM+[S]1+[S]KiEq. 1 The identity of the transpeptidation product was determined by electrospray mass ionization-mass spectrometry using an Agilent 1100 MSD Trap SL mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. The nebulizer pressure was set at 20.0 p.s.i., dry gas at 7 liters/min, and dry temperature set to 325 °C. The mass range was set between 120–1200 m/z, with a target mass of 750. Samples were infused at 20 ml/h. Data were collected for 2 min and then averaged to provide the total signal. Alkylation of Cys-208-The haloalkylating reagent 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (badan) reacts with free thiols (and preferentially with ionized thiolate anions) forming a stable covalent thioether bond (38Lewin A. Crow A. Oubrie A. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35467-35477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction generates a significant increase in fluorescence intensity on binding. To determine whether Sp-SrtAΔ81 contains a reactive thiol group, the protein was incubated with badan for 1 h at pH 7.0. The change in fluorescence intensity at 525 nm (excitation at 380 nm) over this time was monitored. To map the location of any modifications, the intact mass of the resulting sample was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry followed by peptide mass-fingerprinting, cleaving the protein with trypsin (Proteomics facility, John Innes Centre). Crystallization-Conditions supporting the growth of Sp-SrtAΔ81 crystals were initially identified using the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion at 20 °C and commercially available crystallization screens. 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of precipitant solution. Diffraction quality Sp-SrtAΔ81 crystals were grown using 100 mm Tris, pH 6–7, 20–30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 200 mm sodium acetate. Crystals grew to their maximum dimensions in 4–5 days. Data Collection and Structure Determination-For data collection, crystals were cryo-preserved by transferring into 100 mm Tris (pH 6–7), 35% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 200 mm sodium acetate before plunging into liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected using either a Home-Lab system (R-AXIS IV++ detector with X-rays from a Rigaku Micromax007 generator focused with Osmic optics) or at the Diamond Light Source, UK (station I03 equipped with an ADSC Q315 3 × 3 CCD detector) as shown in Table 1. Crystals were maintained at cryogenic temperatures during data collection. Data were processed with MOSFLM (39Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (Ref. 40Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar, as implemented within the CCP4 suite (41Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar)). 5% of the data were set aside for the calculation of Rfree. The initial structure of S. pyogenes sortase A was determined in space group P21212 by molecular replacement using PHASER (Ref. 42McCoy A.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, as implemented in the CCP4 suite), with the Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-ox dataset (the first dataset collected, see Table 1); this structure contains one molecule per asymmetric unit. The search model comprised a monomer of the crystal structure of Sa-SrtA (PDB entry 1T2P (12Zong Y. Bice T.W. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Narayana S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31383-31389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)), pruned to Cγ atoms in non-conserved regions using CHAINSAW (43Schwarzenbacher R. Godzik A. Grzechnik S.K. Jaroszewski L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The structure was manually rebuilt and refined with iterative cycles of COOT (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (45Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) to produce a final model (subsequently called Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-ox). In this structure Cys-208 was found to be oxidized to a sulfenic acid form. To produce unmodified (reduced) Sp-SrtA, crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol overnight before freezing in liquid nitrogen. The resulting dataset from this crystal (Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-red, see Table 1) was also in P21212. Finally, a single crystal was further soaked in fresh reducing cryoprotectant solution containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mm Leu-Pro-Ser-Thr-Gly peptide (Peptide Specialty Laboratories GmbH) for 24 h. The resulting dataset revealed a different crystal form (called Sp-SrtAΔ81, in spacegroup P21; see Table 1). The Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-ox structure was used to solve the Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-red and Sp-SrtAΔ81 datasets (again using PHASER), and repeated cycles of COOT and REFMAC5 generated final models (subsequently referred to as Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-red and Sp-SrtAΔ81). During the final stages of refinement, anisotropic B-factors were refined for Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-red and Sp-SrtAΔ81; an isotropic B-factor model was used for Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-ox. The final model of Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-ox comprises residues 82–211 and 214–249 of the native sequence and 159 water molecules (residues 73–81 in the structure are derived from the vector used for expression); Sp-SrtAΔ81·Cys-red comprises residues 82–210 and 214–249 of the native sequence and 108 water molecules (residues 73–81 in the structure are derived from the vector used for expression); Sp-SrtAΔ81 comprises residues 89–249 in one molecule, 87–249 in the second molecule of the asymmetric unit, 1 molecule of HEPES, and 351 water molecules. Final refinement statistics are given in Table 1. For analysis, MOLPROBITY (46Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J.

Polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles are thus useful for intracellular protein delivery in vitro and have potential as carriers of therapeutic proteins for treatment of neuronal disorders in vivo. Many neurodegenerative diseases involve accumulation of intracellular aggregates of misfolded protein, implying that defects in protein processing may be linked to their development and pathogenesis (1Soto C. Estrada L.D. Arch. Neurol. 2008; 65: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Windisch M. Wolf H. Hutter-Paier B. Wronski R. Neurodegener. Dis. 2008; 5: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Molecular genetic studies have identified a number of intracellular proteins involved in these processes, and these may ultimately prove useful as targets for therapeutic drug development (3Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Haass C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Engineered proteins themselves could be useful as treatments or experimental reagents (4Windisch M. Hutter-Paier B. Schreiner E. Wronski R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Zhou C. Emadi S. Sierks M.R. Messer A. Mol. Ther. 2004; 10: 1023-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A major barrier, however, is delivery of such proteins across the membrane of neuronal cells. Traditional means of transfection, protein transduction, and macromolecular delivery have proven difficult in neurons due to their terminally differentiated state (6Berges B.K. Wolfe J.H. Fraser N.W. Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 20-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A number of commercially available methods rely on use of liposomes or other charged lipid formulations, which have limited complex stability in serum and often high toxicity over time (7Whittlesey K.J. Shea L.D. Biomaterials. 2006; 27: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Electroporation-based techniques often yield higher rates of transfection but are only effective when performed during a specific window of development in young, healthy, and undifferentiated cells, with eventual loss of expression or bioactivity over time (8Gartner A. Collin L. Lalli G. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 374-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Viral-based vectors and fusions have demonstrated only limited efficacy in humans and animals while raising a number of concerns regarding safety, and typically require invasive procedures such as direct injection into the brain to achieve targeted delivery (9Luo D. Saltzman W.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Here we describe an approach for protein delivery into neurons using polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) 2The abbreviations used are: PBCA, polybutylcyanoacrylate; BBB, blood-brain barrier; β-gal, β-galactosidase; DAPI, 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GLB1, acid β-galactosidase 1; LDL, low density lipoprotein; NGF, nerve growth factor; NP, nanoparticle; PVA-DABCO, polyvinyl alcohol-1;4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; DIV, days in vitro; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; C12FDG, 5-dodecanoylaminofluoroscein di-β-d-galactopyranoside. nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers. These particles have been shown to mediate significant transport of chemotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in live animals (10Alyautdin R. N Gothier D. Petrov V. Kharkevich D.A. Kreuter J. Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 1995; 41: 44-48Google Scholar, 11Gulyaev A.E. Gelperina S.E. Skidan I.N. Antropov A.S. Kivman G.Y. Kreuter J. Pharm. Res. 1999; 16: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that they absorb multiple proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E, onto their surfaces following injection into the bloodstream and that artificial coating of the particles with apolipoprotein E improves their uptake across the BBB, it was suggested that these NPs may be taken up via lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis through mimicry of endogenous low density lipoproteins (LDLs) (12Kreuter J. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 47: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein transport across the BBB is crucial for the delivery of essential lipids to brain cells, and direct evidence has been provided for the existence of a LDL receptor in vivo on the BBB (13Meresse S. Delbart C. Fruchart J.C. Cecchelli R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). LDLs have further been shown to undergo transcytosis across the brain capillary endothelium without apparent degradation by endothelial cells, and they may therefore gain entry into other tissues following passage across the BBB (14Dehouck B. Fenart L. Dehouck M.P. Pierce A. Torpier G. Cecchelli R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, whether NPs actually gain entry into neuronal cells has not been demonstrated. We hypothesized that neurons, which are known to express a number of lipoprotein-binding receptors on their surface, would be capable of NP uptake. Here, we report that PBCA NPs are taken up by primary hippocampal cultures, and that this uptake is dependent on the LDL receptor. The particles are capable of delivering intact, functional proteins into neurons and other mammalian cells. These particles may represent a new and significantly improved approach over existing, often invasive methods of drug transport. Preparation of PBCA NPs-Nanoparticles were synthesized as previously described by Kreuter et al. (15Kreuter J. Alyautdin R.N. Kharkevich D.A. Ivanov A.A. Brain Res. 1995; 674: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1% (v/v) PBCA (GluStitch, Point Roberts, WA) was slowly added to an acidic polymerization medium consisting of 1% dextran 70,000 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.01 n HCl and stirred for 4 h with a magnetic stirrer. For production of 3H-labeled and FITC-nanoparticles, tritiated dextran 70,000 (250 mCi/mg, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) or anionic, lysine fixable fluorescein (FITC) dextran 70,000 (excitation = 494 nm, emission = 521 nm, Invitrogen) were utilized as stabilizers instead. Polymerization was terminated by neutralization with 0.1 n NaOH, and the suspension was filtered through a glass fiber filter of pore size 0.45 μm (Millipore, Billerica, MA). 3% (w/v) mannitol was added as a cryoprotectant, and the solution was lyophilized using a Savant Novalyphe NL500 freeze-dryer (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). For preparation of protein-loaded NPs, 5 mg of lyophilized NPs was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 5 mg of protein and 0.08% Polysorbate 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min with stirring. Proteins utilized were Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (β-gal, Sigma-Aldrich), purified recombinant rhoG, and the mouse anti-α-synuclein monoclonal antibody H3C (16George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The solution was then stirred for 1 h and filtered once more through a glass fiber filter of pore size 0.45 μm. The total amount of protein absorbed onto the particles was calculated by filtering the suspension through a hydrophilic, 0.1-μm pore polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter (Millipore) and measuring the amount of free protein in the filtrate via UV spectroscopy (DU 640 spectrophotometer, Beckman Coulter Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Protein loading was determined to be ∼0.7–0.8 μg of protein per μg of NPs. Mean particle size was determined to be 200–250 nm by dynamic light scattering using a Brookhaven Instruments BI-200 SM goniometer (Holtsville, NY), and by scanning electron microscopy using an Hitachi S-4700 SE microscope (Schaumburg, IL). Culture and Treatment of Cells-E18 rat hippocampi (Brain-Bits Inc., Springfield, IL) were dissociated and seeded at a density of 1.6 × 104 cells per cm2 onto poly-d-lysine-coated labware. When grown in Neurobasal supplemented with B27, cultures contained 95 ± 2%. Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal/B-27 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5 mm glutamine and 25 μm glutamate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Half the volume of medium (plus glutamine, but no glutamate) was replaced every 3–4 days. Experiments were performed on neurons at age 14 DIV. PC12 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μm streptomycin, and 200 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For neurite outgrowth experiments, some cells were treated with 2.5 S mouse natural nerve growth factor (NGF, Fisher Scientific) at a concentration of 50 ng/ml. Neurite outgrowth was quantified as the percentage of cells in each field exhibiting one or more projections at least twice the length of the cell body. A minimum of 50 fields per sample was examined and counted double-blind. Fluorescence and Light Microscopy Studies-Nanoparticles were added directly to the cell medium at a final concentration of 250 μg/ml.

Anti-EGF receptor antibody 151-8AE4 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) was utilized at a concentration of 250 μg/ml (19Chandler L.P. Chandler C.E. Hosang M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3360-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as above. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature using 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Cells were then blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C, incubated with Anti-NeuN (Millipore) in 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse (Invitrogen). Cells were mounted with 2% PVA-DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to visualization. Some cultures were incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen) following fixation, to allow fluorescence visualization of cell nuclei. Primary neurons treated with β-gal-loaded NPs were washed three times with PBS to remove surface-bound particles and enzyme, then incubated with 33 μm ImaGene Green C12FDG substrate (Invitrogen) in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Live/Dead™ Red fluorescent dye (Invitrogen), washed twice with PBS, and visualized as above. For samples stained with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside), cells were washed and fixed as before, then incubated with 2 ml of β-Galactosidase Staining Kit Complete Staining Solution (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) per well for 2 h at 37 °C. For measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), H3C or a non-synuclein antibody control (mouse anti-Myc, Invitrogen) were delivered via nanoparticles (250 μg/ml) and indirectly labeled with a secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse, Invitrogen) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (excitation = 488–500 nm, emission = 519–550 nm). The N terminus of synuclein was labeled with the SC-7012 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by a secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat, Chemicon) conjugated to Cy3 (excitation = 532–555 nm, emission = 570–600 nm). Endogenous galactosidase (GLB1, EC 3.2.1.23) and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) were detected using mouse anti-GLB1 (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) or mouse anti-hsp70 (Affinity BioReagents, Inc., Golden, CO), respectively, and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse (Invitrogen). Goat IgG purified from normal, non-immunized animal serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was detected with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat as an additional negative control. Fixed and stained cells were visualized using a Leica DM IRE2 fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor 488 (the “donor”) was measured using OpenLab™ software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA) before and after photobleaching of Cy3 (the “acceptor”). Energy transfer was calculated as the ratio of D (donor fluorescence after photobleach) to DA (donor fluorescence in the presence of the acceptor, before photobleach); a value greater than 1.0 represents a positive FRET signal. A minimum of 20 measurements was made per sample. Measurements of FITC- and 3H-Nanoparticle Uptake and Turnover-For measurements of temperature dependence, cells were grown in black 96-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and treated with FITC-labeled NPs (final concentration of 250 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Before and after washing with PBS, fluorescence intensity (excitation = 494 nm, emission = 521 nm) was measured on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Background fluorescence was subtracted from each sample, and fluorescence incorporation was calculated as a percentage of the total dose of nanoparticles. For measurements of 3H-nanoparticle uptake, cells were grown on 12- to 13-mm round coverslips with NPs (final concentration of 250 μg/ml) for the indicated time, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and transferred to scintillation vials filled with 10 ml of ScintiVerse BD mixture (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ), and counted on a Beckman LS-1701 counter. Background counts were subtracted from each sample, and 3H incorporation was calculated as a percentage of the total dose of nanoparticles. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis of Cell Lysates-Cells grown in 25-cm2 flasks were incubated with β-gal-loaded or empty nanoparticles or β-gal plous 0.08% Polysorbate 80 alone (final concentration of 250 μg/ml) for 2 h then washed once with PBS prior to detachment with trypsin-EDTA (Cambrex Bioproducts, East Rutherford, NJ). The cells were pelleted and lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold non-denaturing lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide) plus 1 μl of Sigma Protease Inhibitor Mixture P-8340, incubated on ice for 30 and at 4 °C for 15 min at 16,000 × g.20 μl of supernatant from each sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with rabbit anti-β-gal-horseradish peroxidase (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-β-actin (Abcam), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation of cell lysates treated with H3C-loaded or empty NPs, samples were treated as above except that, prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, 500 μl of supernatant from each sample was incubated with 50 μl of Protein G beads (Sigma) that had been pre-washed two times with non-denaturing lysis buffer. Samples were then incubated on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C for 2 h, and washed four times with 1 ml of non-denaturing lysis buffer and one time with ice-cold PBS. 20 μl of each immunoprecipitate and 20 μl of each total cell lysate were then analyzed via SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using goat anti-synuclein (SC7012) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit and sheep antibodies against goat and mouse Ig, respectively (as above). Affinity purification of active (GTP-bound) rho from PC12 cells was performed using the E-Z Detect™ Rho Activation Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed and incubated with GTPγS to activate rho. GST fused to the binding domain of rhotekin (GST-rhotekin-RBD), which specifically binds GTP-bound rho, was immobilized on a glutathione resin and incubated with cell lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then washed, eluted in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GTP-bound rho was subsequently detected via Western blot using an anti-rho mouse monoclonal antibody (Pierce). Whole lysates were also probed with mouse anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) and mouse anti-β-actin (Abcam) as a loading control. Measurement of β-gal Activity-Cells were incubated with 250 μg/ml β-gal nanoparticles for 2 h then washed with PBS and switched to non-particle-containing medium. The neurons were then harvested at the time points given by scraping into 1 ml of PBS and analyzed using the Invitrogen β-Galactosidase Assay Kit (catalogue no. K1455-01). Hydrolysis of ortho-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside was then measured as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The β-gal activity was quantitated by measuring absorbance at 420 nm using a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The enzyme activity (after background subtraction) observed immediately after the 2-h treatment was set as 100%, and all subsequent activity observed after this period at specific assayed time points was divided by this amount to determine the “percent activity” remaining over time. Purification of Myc-Tagged rhoG-mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS containing the coding sequence for Myc-tagged human rhoG was kindly provided by M. Negishi (Kyoto University, Japan). HEK-293 cells were cultured in 150-cm2 flasks containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μm streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Each flask was transfected with 50 μg of plasmid using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed using M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce). Myc-rhoG was then purified from the lysates using the μMACS Anti-c-Myc Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Neuronal Uptake of PBCA Nanoparticles by Endocytosis-To assess the uptake of PBCA NPs into cultured neurons, fluorescent PBCA NPs were synthesized utilizing dextran coupled to FITC. Primary E18 rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with 250 μg/ml NP for 2 h at either 15° or 37 °C, then fixed and stained with a mouse antibody against NeuN (20Mullen R.J. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a protein specifically expressed in neuronal cell nuclei (Fig. 1A). At 37 °C, extensive green fluorescence was observed in 74 ± 6% of NeuN-positive cells, indicating uptake of FITC-NPs. The percentage of NeuN-positive cells in our cultures at 14 DIV was 95 ± 2%. Images depicting a larger fraction of non-neuronal cells (i.e. NeuN-negative, DAPI-positive) are shown to demonstrate that FITC-NPs localize mainly to neurons and not other cell types (Fig. 1A). When cells were incubated with FITC-NPs for 2 h at 15 °C, little to no uptake was detected, indicating that NP uptake was likely via endocytosis rather than diffusion or non-specific adhesion. Staining was restored when cells incubated at 15 °C were brought back to physiological temperature (data not shown). Fluorescence intensity was also measured over a period of 6 h in live primary neurons incubated with 250 μg/ml nanoparticles at 37 °C versus 15 °C (Fig. 1B). Maximum incorporation was noted in both samples at 2 h post-treatment but was substantially reduced in cells incubated at 15 °C (p < 0.0001). Nanoparticle Uptake Is Mediated by LDL Receptor-It was previously hypothesized that transport of PBCA NPs across vascular endothelial cells might be mediated by the LDL receptor (12Kreuter J. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 47: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). We tested whether uptake into cultured neurons might require LDL receptor by blocking the receptor prior to treatment with nanoparticles and examining the effects on FITC-NP uptake. Pre-treatment of primary neuron cultures with a monoclonal blocking antibody against LDL receptor (17Kosaka S. Takahashi S. Masamura K. Kanehara H. Sakai J. Tohda G. Okada E. Oida K. Iwasaki T. Hattori H. Kodama T. Yamamoto T. Miyamori I. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Takahashi M. Ikeda U. Takahashi S. Hattori H. Iwasaki T. Ishihara M. Egashira T. Honma S. Asano Y. Shimada K. Clin. Genet. 2001; 59: 290-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) inhibited incorporation of fluorescence, whereas treatment with a blocking antibody against the EGF receptor, which is also known to be specifically endocytosed (21Fallon L. Belanger C.M. Corera A.T. Kontogiannea M. Regan-Klapisz E. Moreau F. Voortman J. Haber M. Rouleau G. Thorarinsdottir T. Brice A. van Bergen En Henegouwen P.M. Fon E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Almeida C.G. Takahashi R.H. Gouras G.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4277-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), resulted in no change (Fig. 2A). This effect of anti-LDL receptor antibodies on NP uptake was quantitated in cultures treated with 3H-labeled NP (Fig. 2B). As with FITC-NPs, maximum incorporation of label was achieved at ∼2 h for 3H-labeled NPs, and pre-treatment of the cultures with anti-EGF receptor antibody did not affect the time course of incorporation. However, pretreatment with anti-LDL receptor resulted in a nearly complete blockade of nanoparticle uptake. Similar data were obtained when measuring fluorescence intensity in live FITC-NP-treated neurons over time (not shown). As further confirmation of the role of LDL receptors in NP uptake, we analyzed CHO LDL-A7 cells, one of a limited number of viable mammalian cell lines lacking functional LDL receptors (23Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Normal CHO cells demonstrated efficient nanoparticle uptake that was blocked by anti-LDL receptor antibody, but CHO LDL-A7 cells exhibited impaired uptake of both 3H- and FITC-NPs as compared with normal controls (supplemental Fig. S1). Our data are thus consistent with the hypothesis that LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis is the primary mechanism of neuronal uptake for PBCA NPs. Kinetics of Nanoparticle Uptake and Turnover-The time course of nanoparticle delivery was analyzed over a range of doses from 50 to 500 μg/ml. FITC incorporation (which reflects both particle uptake and turnover) was strongly dose-dependent at the lower particle concentrations, but began to saturate beyond ∼300 μg/ml (supplemental Fig. S2). Turnover of 3H-nanoparticles was also assessed, and the half-life of the particles was estimated to be ∼27 min (supplemental Fig. S3). Neuronal viability was measured for a range of nanoparticle doses; NPs were well tolerated at concentrations up to 500 μg/ml (supplemental Fig. S4). We selected 250 μg/ml as the standard dose for subsequent experiments. PBCA Nanoparticles Deliver Proteins into Primary Neuronal Cells-We next utilized the particles for delivery of an exogenous and otherwise membrane-impermeant protein, E. coli β-gal, into primary neuronal cultures (Fig. 3). β-Galactosidase has well known activity that is readily detectable in mammalian cells and is used extensively as a marker of gene and protein expression. NP-mediated delivery of β-gal into neurons produces readily visible enzymatic activity throughout the cell body and neurites, detectable using the fluorescent substrate C12FDG in live cells, or the colorimetric substrate X-gal in fixed samples (Fig. 3A). Positive staining was observed in 69 ± 7% of neurons. Cells incubated with only β-gal plus Polysorbate 80 (which is used as a surfactant coating for nanoparticles) demonstrated no green fluorescence after treatment with C12FDG and were negative for staining with X-gal (Fig. 3A). The live neurons were also counterstained with Live/Dead™ Red to demonstrate viability of β-gal-positive cells. The percentage of dead cells (i.e. positively stained with Live/Dead™ Red) was determined to be 19 ± 8%, which is similar to the toxicity we measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test (supplemental Fig. S4). Of the C12FDG-positive cells, however, only 4 ± 3% were also positive for Live/Dead™ Red. Following NP-mediated delivery into neuronal cells, β-gal activity persists for several hours after treatment. Enzyme activity was measured by ortho-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside assay, and the half-life was estimated to be 122 min by exponential curve fit (R2 = 0.957), as compared with 27 min for the NPs themselves, indicating that the β-gal cargo was degraded independently of the carrier NPs (Fig. 3B). Extracts of β-gal-treated cells were also assessed at 2 h by immunoblot, with β-actin as a loading control. The β-gal immunoreactivity was detected in cells treated with β-gal nanoparticles, but not in cells pretreated with anti-LDL receptor blocking antibodies or with β-gal alone (Fig. 3B, inset). Nanoparticle-mediated Delivery of rhoG Produces Neurite Outgrowth and Differentiation in PC12 Cells-We next investigated whether we could deliver a protein with overt functional and morphological activity into neurons. For this purpose we selected rhoG, a small GTPase which, when genetically expressed in PC12 cells, causes terminal differentiation into catecholaminergic cells with neuronal morphology (24Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Purified Myc-tagged rhoG was loaded onto the nanoparticles, and cells were treated with the NPs daily for up to 10 days. Beginning at 2–5 days post-treatment, cells began sprouting neurite-like projections (Fig. 4E), similar to cells treated with nerve growth factor (Fig. 4D). After 10 days treatment, 43 ± 14% of PC12 cells treated with rhoG-loaded nanoparticles exhibited outgrowth of neurites as compared with 36 ± 10% of rhoG-transfected cells and 62 ± 5% of cells treated with NGF alone (Fig. 4G). Significant differences were observed among cells treated with rhoG-NPs versus empty particles (p < 0.0001) and rhoG protein alone (p < 0.0001). Transfected cells began extending processes ∼4 days after treatment as opposed to only 2 days for cells administered NGF or rhoG protein-loaded NPs. To verify that the exogenously delivered rhoG protein was capable of interacting with a downstream effector, GTP-bound rho was affinity-purified from lysates using GST-tagged rhotekin, a specific target of members of the rho small GTPase family. The results indicate increased levels of active rho only in the cultures that were treated with rhoG NPs or directly transfected with rhoG (Fig. 4G, top row). Purified (not shown) and whole lysates were also probed with anti-Myc to specifically detect NP-delivered or transfected Myc-rhoG (Fig. 4G, center row), with β-actin as a loading control (Fig. 4G, bottom row).

https://openalex.org/W2015814034,"Compared to the emerging embryonic stem cell (ESC) gene network, little is known about the dynamic gene network that directs reprogramming in the early embryo. We hypothesized that Oct4, an ESC pluripotency regulator that is also highly expressed at the 1- to 2-cell stages in embryos, may be a critical regulator of the earliest gene network in the embryo.Using antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO)-mediated gene knockdown, we show that Oct4 is required for development prior to the blastocyst stage. Specifically, Oct4 has a novel and critical role in regulating genes that encode transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators as early as the 2-cell stage. Our data suggest that the key function of Oct4 may be to switch the developmental program from one that is predominantly regulated by post-transcriptional control to one that depends on the transcriptional network. Further, we propose to rank candidate genes quantitatively based on the inter-embryo variation in their differential expression in response to Oct4 knockdown. Of over 30 genes analyzed according to this proposed paradigm, Rest and Mta2, both of which have established pluripotency functions in ESCs, were found to be the most tightly regulated by Oct4 at the 2-cell stage.We show that the Oct4-regulated gene set at the 1- to 2-cell stages of early embryo development is large and distinct from its established network in ESCs. Further, our experimental approach can be applied to dissect the gene regulatory network of Oct4 and other pluripotency regulators to deconstruct the dynamic developmental program in the early embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2090953848,"The bacterial helicase-nuclease complex AddAB converts double-stranded DNA breaks into substrates for RecA-dependent recombinational repair. Here we show that the AddB subunit contains a novel class of nuclease domain distinguished by the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster. The cluster is coordinated by an unusual arrangement of cysteine residues that originate from both sides of the AddB nuclease, forming an ""iron staple"" that is required for the local structural integrity of this domain. Disruption of the iron-sulfur cluster by mutagenesis eliminates the ability of AddAB to bind to duplex DNA ends without affecting the single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Sequence analysis suggests that a related iron staple nuclease domain is present in the eukaryotic DNA replication/repair factor Dna2, where it is also associated with a DNA helicase motor."
https://openalex.org/W2026090120,"We previously demonstrated that salicylic acid-binding protein 2 (SABP2) of tobacco is an integral component of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SABP2 is a methyl salicylate (MeSA) esterase that has high affinity for SA, which feedback inhibits its esterase activity. MeSA esterase activity is required in distal, healthy tissue of pathogen-infected plants to hydrolyze MeSA, which functions as a long-distance, phloem-mobile SAR signal; this hydrolysis releases the biologically active defense hormone SA. In this study, we examined the inhibitory interaction of SA with SABP2, and identified a synthetic SA analog, 2,2,2,2′-tetra-f luoroacetophenone (tetraFA) that, like SA, competitively inhibits the activity of SABP2 and targets esterases, which utilize MeSA as a substrate. However, in contrast to SA, tetraFA does not induce downstream defense responses and, therefore, is effective in planta at blocking SAR development in tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-infected tobacco and Pseudomonas syringae-infected Arabidopsis. These results confirm the importance of SABP2 and MeSA for SAR development in tobacco and establish similar roles for MeSA and the orthologs of SABP2 in Arabidopsis. Moreover, they demonstrate that tetraFA can be used to determine whether MeSA and its corresponding esterase(s) play a role in SAR signaling in other plant species. In planta analyses using tetraFA, in conjunction with leaf detachment assays and MeSA quantification, were used to assess the kinetics with which MeSA is generated in pathogen-infected leaves, transmitted through the phloem, and processed in the distal healthy leaves. In TMV-infected tobacco, these studies revealed that critical amounts of MeSA are generated, transmitted, and processed between 48 and 72 h post primary infection.

Dong X. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). In many aspects, SAR resembles the immune response in animals, which is composed of both innate and adaptive components (2Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The immediate, innate response is nonspecific and mediated by humoral, chemical, and cellular barriers, whereas the adaptive immune system involves the recognition of specific “non-self” antigens in the presence of “self”; this allows the development of immunological memory (3Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). However, plants lack mobile defender cells and instead rely on the innate immunity of each cell, which can be activated in uninfected tissues by systemic signal(s) originating from the site of infection (4Jones J.D. Dangl J.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8139) Google Scholar). A number of studies have provided important insights into the immune response occurring in infected plant cells (4Jones J.D. Dangl J.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8139) Google Scholar, 5Ausubel F.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 6DeYoung B.J. Innes R.W. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Plants have evolved several layers of immunity that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pathogen effector molecules (or their altered host targets) through receptors, such as receptor kinases containing a leucine-rich repeat domain or resistance proteins containing a nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeats. This alarm system activates pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (non-host/basal resistance) or effector-triggered immunity (resistance gene-mediated resistance), respectively. Both forms of resistance are associated with physiological changes in the infected cells, such as a rapid increase in reactive oxygen species, ion fluxes, the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), the synthesis of anti-microbial phytoalexins and the induction of defense-associated genes, including several families of pathogenesis-related genes. These immune responses also are often associated with programmed cell death at the sites of pathogen entry, which leads to the formation of necrotic lesions; this phenomenon is known as the hypersensitive response. In addition, the uninfected portions of the plant frequently develop SAR, which is accompanied by increases in SA levels and heightened pathogenesis-related gene expression. A number of studies have demonstrated that SA plays a critical role in the resistance signaling pathway(s) (1Durrant W.E. Dong X. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar, 7Dempsey D.A. Shah J. Klessig D.F. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 547-575Crossref Google Scholar). Exogenously supplied SA enhances disease resistance and induces pathogenesis-related gene expression in a wide variety of plant species. Confirmation of SA as a critical resistance signal came from analyses of transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis expressing the bacterial nahG gene, which encodes the SA-degrading enzyme salicylate hydroxylase. These plants failed to accumulate SA after pathogen infection, displayed reduced resistance to avirulent and virulent pathogens, and did not develop SAR or express pathogenesis-related genes in their distal leaves (8Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Morse A. Reist R. Kolditz-Jawhar R. Ward E. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 9Delaney T.P. Uknes S. Vernooij B.

Vernooij B. Negrotto D. Nye G. Uknes S. Ward E. Kessmann H. Ryals L. Science. 1993; 261: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed in tobacco deficient for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, a key enzyme for SA biosynthesis (11Pallas J.A. Paiva N.L. Lamb C. Dixon R.A. Plant J. 1996; 10: 281-293Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and in the sid1 and sid2/eds5 Arabidopsis mutants, which are impaired in SA biosynthesis (12Nawrath C. Métraux J.P. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1393-1404PubMed Google Scholar). However, results from grafting experiments argued that SA was not the critical long-distance signal for SAR; tobacco leaves expressing the nahG transgene were able to transmit an SAR signal following infection by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), despite suppressed SA levels (8Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Morse A. Reist R. Kolditz-Jawhar R. Ward E. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Rather, a recent study demonstrated that a key signal for SAR in tobacco is methyl salicylate (MeSA), a methyl ester of SA that moves from the infected tissue through the phloem to the distal, systemic tissue (13Park S.-W. Kaimoyo E. Kumar D. Mosher S. Klessig D.F. Science. 2007; 318: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism through which SA signals disease resistance, several potential effector proteins have been identified in tobacco. These SA-binding proteins (SABPs) include catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, the chloroplastic carbonic anhydrase (SABP3) and SABP2 (14Chen Z. Silva H. Klessig D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 1883-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 15Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17Slaymaker D.H. Navarre D.A. Clark D. del Poza O. Martin G.B. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11640-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Silencing of SABP2 in tobacco resulted in the loss of SAR and suppression of local defense responses, indicating that SABP2 is integral for plant innate immunity (18Kumar D. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16101-16106Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Grafting studies using SABP2-silenced rootstocks or scions further revealed that SABP2 is required for SAR signal perception in the distal tissue, but not for SAR signal production in the 1° infected leaves (13Park S.-W. Kaimoyo E. Kumar D. Mosher S. Klessig D.F. Science. 2007; 318: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of SABP2, alone or in complex with SA, indicated that it belongs to the α/β-fold hydrolases superfamily and that it binds SA in its active-site pocket (19Forouhar F. Yang Y. Kumar D. Chen Y. Fridman E. Park S.-W. Chiang Y. Acton T.B. Montelione G.T. Pichersky E. Klessig D.F. Tong L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1773-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that its preferred substrate is MeSA, which it cleaves to release SA. SA competes with MeSA for binding in the active-site pocket of SABP2, which consists of catalytic triad residues Ser81, Asp210, and His238. During hydrolysis of MeSA, the hydroxyl group of Ser81 is perfectly positioned over the carboxyl carbon of MeSA to initiate nucleophilic attack, whereas the side chains of Ser81 and Asp210 form hydrogen bonds with His238 to complete the catalytic triad. In contrast, SA forms hydrogen bonds with Ala13 and His238, which disrupts hydrogen bond formation between the catalytic triad residues. Because the active-site pocket is too small to accommodate both the MeSA substrate and the SA product, SA is a potent inhibitor of the esterase activity of SABP2 (19Forouhar F. Yang Y. Kumar D. Chen Y. Fridman E. Park S.-W. Chiang Y. Acton T.B. Montelione G.T. Pichersky E. Klessig D.F. Tong L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1773-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To determine whether an SABP2-like esterase activity is required for SAR in general, we identified and characterized several synthetic SA analogs that inhibit the MeSA esterase activity of SABP2. This approach was chosen as it circumvented purifying the enzyme, cloning its gene, and/or silencing its expression. Note that although SA itself is an effective inhibitor for SABP2, it cannot be used for inhibitory studies because it triggers the defense signaling pathway downstream of SABP2 (7Dempsey D.A. Shah J. Klessig D.F. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 547-575Crossref Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that 2,2,2,2′-tetrafluoroacetophenone (tetraFA) rather specifically and competitively binds SABP2 and inhibits its esterase activity. In planta analyses demonstrated that tetraFA can be used on a variety of plant species to assess the involvement of MeSA in SAR. In addition, tetraFA was used to determine the time during which the MeSA signal moves to the distal tissue after the 1° infection. Reagents-Synthetic ketones, 2,2,2,2′-tetraFA (tetraFA, ≥99.0% pure [GC], Chemical Abstract Service Registry Number 124004-75-7) and 2′-methoxy-2,2,2-triFA (methoxytriFA, ≥99.0% [GC], CASRN. 26944-43-4) were obtained from Rieke Metals, Inc. (Lincoln, NE), and 2,2,2-triFA (triFA, ≥99.0% [GC], CASRN. 434-45-7) was obtained from Sigma. SA (≥99.0%, CASRN. 54-21-7) and MeSA (≥99.0% [GC], CASRN. 119-36-8) were obtained from Sigma. Plant Material, Growth, and Pathogen Infection-Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) cv. Xanthi-nc (NN) was grown and inoculated with TMV as described by Guo et al. (20Guo A. Salih G. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 2000; 21: 409-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Colombia-0 (Col-0) was grown in a 14-h photo period (140 μE m-2 s-1) at 22 °C in 60% relative humidity. The inoculation of bacteria was carried out by syringe infiltration as described by Maldonado et al. (21Maldonado A.M. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C.J. Cameron R.K. Nature. 2002; 419: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). See “In Planta TetraFA Assay” for more details. Enzyme and Inhibition Assays-The MeSA esterase activity was determined as described by Forouhar et al. (19Forouhar F. Yang Y. Kumar D. Chen Y. Fridman E. Park S.-W. Chiang Y. Acton T.B. Montelione G.T. Pichersky E. Klessig D.F. Tong L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1773-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Briefly, a standard reaction mixture of 50 μl consisted of 0.1 mm MeSA in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was initiated by adding esterase and incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature. After the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min, SA, the product, was coupled with radioactive [14C]S-adenosylmethionine by using a recombinant Clarkia breweri SA carboxylmethyltransferase (SAMT). Radiolabeled [14C]MeSA was then extracted with ethyl acetate, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by an initial velocity experiment. Measurements of the kcat and Km(app) values for MeSA (5-250 μm) were made at 2.5 nmol of [14C]MeSA and 10 μg of C. breweri SAMT. Kinetic parameters were calculated to fit untransformed data to v = kcat[S]/(Km + [S]) using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc.). For inhibitory activity of SA or FA to MeSA esterases, initial velocities were determined using the standard assay system. Enzyme activities were determined after addition of SA (1-50 μm) or FA (0.01-1 mm) to assay solution containing various MeSA concentrations (5-250 μm). Global fitting analysis was used to simultaneously fit all data to the equation for competitive inhibition, v = Vmax ([S]/Km (1 + [I]/Ki) + Vmax using SigmaPlot. The esterase and lipase activities were determined colorimetrically by measuring the liberation of para-nitrophenol (pNP) from pNP-butyrate (C4) and pNP-myristate (C14) as described in Kumar and Klessig (18Kumar D. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16101-16106Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, the standard 1-ml reaction mixture consisted of 1 mm substrate in 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 0.05% Triton X-100. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 24 °C, and the amount of pNP was measured at 410 nm. Inhibition assays were performed by adding various concentrations of SA or FA to the standard reaction system. Values from control reactions without SABP2 were subtracted from each reaction. Structural Modeling of SABP2-An atomic model with suitable conformation for tri- and tetraFA was obtained using The Dundee PRODRG2 Server (davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/prodrg). Using the XtalView program (22McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar), each inhibitor was modeled into the active site of the SABP2 crystal structure in complex with SA (PDB accession code 1Y7I), using the position and orientation of SA as the reference. However, to obtain the most favored model for each inhibitor, several orientations of each were considered and subject to two cycles of rigorous rigid-body refinement using the Crystallography and NMR System (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). In Planta TetraFA Assay-To address the utility of tetraFA in planta, we examined if it could inhibit SAR development by blocking SABP2, or its orthologous proteins, in TMV-infected tobacco and/or Pseudomonas-infected Arabidopsis. Before or after the 1° infection (-24, 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post 1° infection (hp1°i)), which was carried out by inoculating TMV in the three lower leaves of 6-week old plants, upper-uninfected leaves were treated with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) in the presence or absence of 1 mm tetraFA. The treatment of tobacco with tetraFA was performed by syringe infiltration. Six days after the 1° TMV infection, those tetraFA- or buffer-treated (control) leaves were challenged by TMV inoculation (2° infection). The establishment of SAR was then determined by measuring and comparing the lesion sizes of TMV-infected leaves with a vernier caliper at 5 days after the infection. Arabidopsis was treated with tetraFA by using a fine glass chromatography sprayer. SAR was induced in 2-3-week-old Arabidopsis plants by infection of 2-3 leaves per plant with coronatine-deficient Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) carrying AvrRpt2 at a concentration of 1 × 106 colony forming units per ml in 10 mm MgCl2. Mock inoculation was performed using 10 mm MgCl2. Ten mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) with or without tetraFA (2, 10, or 20 mm) was applied to distal leaves by repeated spraying at 3, 24, and 48 hp1°i. The 2° challenge was then performed in tetraFA- or buffer-treated leaves with 1 × 105 colony forming units/ml of P. syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 at 3 days after a 1° infection. In planta bacterial titers were determined by shaking leaf dics, 4 mm in diameter, from 2° infected leaves in 10 mm MgCl2 supplemented with 0.1 m sucrose at 12 °C for 4 h. The resulting bacterial suspensions were serially diluted and spots of 10 μl per dilution were grown on KB medium and counted. Leaf Detachment Assay-After induction of SAR in 6-week-old tobacco plants by the inoculation of the three lower leaves per plant with TMV, these infected leaves were excised from plants at various time points after a 1° infection (0-120 hp1°i). Mock inoculation was performed using 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). Six days after SAR induction, three distal leaves, located directly above the 1° infected ones, were challenged with TMV. To determine SAR development, lesion sizes formed in 2° challenged leaves were measured with a vernier caliper at 5 days after 2° infection. Collection of Phloem Exudates and MeSA Quantification-Petiole/phloem exudates were collected in 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.0) for 24 h and MeSA levels were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CP-3800/Quadrupode-1200L system, Varian) as described previously (13Park S.-W. Kaimoyo E. Kumar D. Mosher S. Klessig D.F. Science. 2007; 318: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). SA Competitively Inhibits the MeSA Esterase Activity of SABP2-Inhibition studies are often used to assess the physiological role and/or functional involvement of catalytic proteins. Previously, SA was shown to be an endogenous inhibitor of the MeSA esterase SABP2; SA binds in the active-site pocket of SABP2 (Kd = 90 nm), which results in the inhibition of the catalytic activity of SABP2 (15Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Forouhar F. Yang Y. Kumar D. Chen Y. Fridman E. Park S.-W. Chiang Y. Acton T.B. Montelione G.T. Pichersky E. Klessig D.F. Tong L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1773-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To further understand this interaction, we determined the effect of increasing SA levels on the MeSA esterase activity of SABP2 (Fig. 1). The steady-state kinetic parameters (kcat and Km(app)) of SABP2 for MeSA were 0.16 s-1 and 21.5 μm, respectively. SA competitively inhibited this activity with a Ki value of 16.4 μm. Because this Ki value falls within the range of reported SA levels in tobacco leaves after 1° infection by TMV (∼20-100 μm; 8, 10, and 24), it is likely that the MeSA esterase activity of SABP2 is increasingly inhibited as infection proceeds and SA levels rise. Indeed, the MeSA esterase activity of SABP2 in the infected leaves is predicted to be completely inhibited by 72 hp1°i, based on a calculation performed by integrating the kinetic parameters with the level kinetics of MeSA and SA, where vi = [S]·Vmax/{((Km(1 + [I]/Ki)) + [S]}, v0 = [S]·Vmax/(Km + [S]), i% = 100 (1 - (vi/v0)). Identification of Synthetic SA Analogs and Their Inhibitory Activity on SABP2-Although SA is an effective inhibitor of SABP2, it cannot be used for in planta studies because it triggers defense responses downstream of SABP2 (for review see Ref. 7Dempsey D.A. Shah J. Klessig D.F. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 547-575Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, we utilized the data base from PubChem. Substance to identify candidate compounds that could inhibit SABP2 esterase activity without activating defense responses. Candidate synthetic molecules were similar in structure to SA and benzoic acid, except that their hydroxyl groups were replaced with fluorine (fluoroacetophenone; FA). Due to the small atomic radius and extreme electronegativity of fluorine, it was anticipated that fluorine replacement for the hydroxyl groups might enhance binding in the active-site pocket of SABP2 (25Gillespie R.J. Robinson E.A. Inor. Chem. 1992; 31: 1960-1963Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Among candidate compounds, three synthetic compounds were chosen for further analyses based on commercial availability. These were 2′-methoxy-2,2,2-triFA (methoxy-triFA), 2,2,2,2′-tetraFA (tetraFA), and 2,2,2-triFA (triFA) (Fig. 2A). As a first step to examine the potential inhibitory activities of the FAs, various concentrations of the FAs and SA (0.05-2.0 mm) were added to an SABP2 enzymatic assay using the synthetic substrate pNP-butyrate (C4). As shown in Fig. 2B, the three FAs inhibited the esterase activity of SABP2 in a concentration-dependent manner, and this inhibition was more effective than that mediated by SA. Unexpectedly, the FAs were less efficient than SA at inhibiting the esterase activity of SABP2 when MeSA was the substrate (Fig. 2C). The inhibitory kinetics of tetraFA and triFA, which were stronger inhibitors than methoxy-triFA, were further analyzed in the presence of MeSA (Fig. 2, D and E). TetraFA and triFA displayed the same inhibitory mechanism as SA, with all three competitively inhibiting the esterase activity of SABP2. The Ki values for tetraFA and triFA were 131.2 and 303.1 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, D and E). Although these values are >8-fold higher than that of SA (16.4 μm), they raised the possibility that the FAs, particularly tetraFA, might block the esterase activity in planta of SABP2. Given that SABP2 is only required in uninfected distal tissues for SAR development and MeSA levels in these tissues peak at ∼1.5 μm between 48 and 72 hp1oi (13Park S.-W. Kaimoyo E. Kumar D. Mosher S. Klessig D.F. Science. 2007; 318: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), 0.5 mm tetraFA should inhibit ∼75% of the esterase activity of SABP2 in uninfected distal tissues, whereas 1.0 mm tetraFA should inhibit ∼90%. The application of 1.0 mm tetraFA to tobacco leaves did not have any detectable toxic effect (Figs. 5 and 7C), but higher concentrations (>5.0 mm) caused cell death at the infiltrated site within 72 h (data not shown).FIGURE 7The MeSA esterase activity of SABP2 is required in distal leaves between 48 and 72 hp1°i for SAR development. A, schematic design for the time course of tetraFA (1 mm) application. Control leaf (con.) received a buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) treatment without tetraFA at 48 hp1°i. B, determination of lesion sizes in millimeters on the distal leaves at 5 days post 2° infection. Uninduced plants were mock inoculated on the three lower leaves, whereas induced plants received TMV inoculation on three lower leaves 6 days prior to 2° TMV infection. % red., percent reduction in the size of 2° TMV lesions formed on induced versus uninduced plants. C, photographs of TMV-induced lesions on distal leaves described in B at 5 days post 2° infection. Note induced plants without tetraFA treatment were used as a positive control for SAR (right column). D, RNA-blot analysis of TMV coat protein (CP) transcripts in the distal leaves, at 0 and 4 days post 2° infection, of plants received tetraFA treatment at various times after 1° infection. Five μg of total RNA were loaded per lane and ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Structural Modeling of SABP2 with TetraFA and TriFA-To investigate how tetraFA and triFA inhibit the activity of SABP2, we used the three-dimensional structure of SABP2 complexed with SA to model these inhibitors in the active-site pocket of SABP2 (Fig. 3). Both tetraFA and triFA can be accommodated readily in the active site and require few conformational changes in the enzyme. However, one difference in their predicted interaction with SABP2 is that they are flipped 180° in comparison to SA. The modeling suggests that the trifluoro group of the FAs interacts with both Ser81 and His238 of the catalytic triad, whereas SA hydrogen bonds with Ala13 and His238. His238 makes two hydrogen bonds with tetraFA, but only one hydrogen bond with triFA; this difference may account for the different Ki values for these inhibitors. Despite the possible interactions of the tri-fluoro group with both Ser81 and His238, its bulkiness likely compromises binding, and thus explains why these inhibitors exhibit higher Ki values than SA. TetraFA Inhibits Esterases with Strong Preference for MeSA as a Substrate-SABP2 belongs to a superfamily of α/β-fold hydrolases that share both a similar mode of catalysis and overall three-dimensional structure (26Holmquist M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, before the SA analogs could be used for in planta studies, their specificity for SABP2 inhibition needed to be established. To assess specificity, the effect of tetraFA on the activities of other α/β-fold hydrolases within the same subgroup of lipases/esterases, which differ only in their substrate preferences, was determined (Fig. 4, A-D). These hydrolases included a lipase from Phixomucor miehei and three Arabidopsis methyl esterases (AtMES3 (At2g23610), AtMES10 (At3g50440), and AtMES16 (At4g16690)). The AtMESs (numbers 1-18) were initially identified based on their high sequence homology to SABP2; several members were characterized biochemically and genetically as potential orthologs of SABP2 (27Vlot A.C. Liu P.-P. Cameron R.A. Park S.-W. Yang Y. Kumar D. Zhou F. Padukkavidana T. Gustagsson C. Pichersky E. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 2008; 56: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). AtMES3, AtMES10, and AtMES16, however, showed no catalytic activity with MeSA; rather they preferentially de-methylated methyl indole acetic acid or methyl jasmonate (28Yang Y. Xu R. Ma C.J. Vlot A.A. Klessig D.F. Pichersky E. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1034-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). pNP-myristate (C14) and pNP-butyrate (C4) were utilized as substrates for the P. meihei lipase and the three methyl esterases, respectively. Neither tetraFA nor SA affected their enzymatic activities. In contrast, AtMES9 (At4g37150), an SABP2 ortholog that displays SA-inhibitable MeSA esterase activity (27Vlot A.C. Liu P.-P. Cameron R.A. Park S.-W. Yang Y. Kumar D. Zhou F. Padukkavidana T. Gustagsson C. Pichersky E. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 2008; 56: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), was inhibited by tetraFA (IC50 = 19 μm; Fig. 4E). Arabidopsis contains four additional MeSA esterases, which are inhibitable by SA (27Vlot A.C. Liu P.-P. Camer"
https://openalex.org/W1978564594,"Marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as conservation and fishery management tools. It is argued that they can protect ecosystems and also benefit fisheries via density-dependent spillover of adults and enhanced larval dispersal into fishing areas. However, while evidence has shown that marine reserves can meet conservation targets, their effects on fisheries are less understood. In particular, the basic question of if and over what temporal and spatial scales reserves can benefit fished populations via larval dispersal remains unanswered. We tested predictions of a larval transport model for a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico, via field oceanography and repeated density counts of recently settled juvenile commercial mollusks before and after reserve establishment. We show that local retention of larvae within a reserve network can take place with enhanced, but spatially-explicit, recruitment to local fisheries. Enhancement occurred rapidly (2 yrs), with up to a three-fold increase in density of juveniles found in fished areas at the downstream edge of the reserve network, but other fishing areas within the network were unaffected. These findings were consistent with our model predictions. Our findings underscore the potential benefits of protecting larval sources and show that enhancement in recruitment can be manifested rapidly. However, benefits can be markedly variable within a local seascape. Hence, effects of marine reserve networks, positive or negative, may be overlooked when only focusing on overall responses and not considering finer spatially-explicit responses within a reserve network and its adjacent fishing grounds. Our results therefore call for future research on marine reserves that addresses this variability in order to help frame appropriate scenarios for the spatial management scales of interest."

In most invertebrates melanin synthesis is achieved by the prophenoloxidase-activating system, a proteolytic cascade similar to vertebrate complement. Even though melanin formation is necessary for host defense in crustaceans and insects, the process needs to be tightly regulated because of the hazard to the animal of unwanted production of quinone intermediates and melanization in places where it is not suitable. In the present study we have identified a new melanization inhibition protein (MIP) from the hemolymph of the crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. Crayfish MIP has a similar function as the insect MIP molecule we recently discovered in the beetle Tenebrio molitor but interestingly has a completely different sequence. Crayfish MIP as well as Tenebrio MIP do not affect phenoloxidase activity in itself but instead interfere with the melanization reaction from quinone compounds to melanin. Importantly, crayfish MIP in contrast to Tenebrio MIP contains a fibrinogen-like domain, most similar to the substrate recognition domain of vertebrate l-ficolins. Surprisingly, an Asp-rich region similar to that found in ficolins that is likely to be involved in Ca2+ binding is present in crayfish MIP. However, crayfish MIP did not show any hemagglutinating activity as is common for the vertebrate ficolins. A mutant form of MIP with a deletion lacking four Asp amino acids from the Asp-rich region lost most of its activity, implicating that this part of the protein is involved in regulating the prophenoloxidase activating cascade.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 5Cerenius L. Lee B.L. Söderhäll K. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Active PO oxidizes o-diphenols into quinones that are toxic to microorganisms and melanin pigments are formed that also restrict the spreading of microorganisms within the host (4Söderhäll K.

In Tenebrio a complex of the peptidoglycan recognition protein Tm PGRP-SA and peptidoglycan fragments lead to the activation of proPO-activating factors, one of which (proPO-activating factor I) in its active form is mediating cleavage of proPO into an active enzyme (6Kan H.

A similar mechanism of proPO activation is implicated also by research done on M. sexta (9Gorman M.J. Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 16: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In crustaceans the proPO-activating system is studied in detail at the cellular and molecular level (5Cerenius L. Lee B.L. Söderhäll K. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). In crayfish the proPO-activating system is produced in hemocytes and stored in secretory granules similar to the clotting system of horseshoe crabs (1Theopold U. Schmidt O. Söderhäll K. Dushay M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Upon challenge with microorganisms, the system is released into the hemolymph. Crayfish proPO is cleaved by the proPO-activating enzyme, a serine proteinase that is activated by another serine proteinase (4Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Although melanin formation is essential for host defense in crustaceans and insects, the process needs to be tightly regulated because of the danger to the animal of unwanted production of quinone intermediates and melanization in places where it is not appropriate (10Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, New York1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 11Gillespie J. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Several proteinase inhibitors, such as serpins, have been described as responsible for preventing improper activation of the proPO system (for details see Ref. 4Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Pacifastin is a high molecular weight inhibitor consisting of one light chain containing the protease inhibitors and a heavy chain that contains three transferrin lobes (12Liang Z.C. Sottrup-Jensen L. Aspan A. Hall M. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6682-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Pacifastin is highly efficient in inhibiting the crayfish proPO-activating enzyme (12Liang Z.C. Sottrup-Jensen L. Aspan A. Hall M. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6682-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), as is Drosophila serpin 27 in inhibiting the Drospohila proPO system and its proPO-activating enzyme (13Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Ji C. Leclerc V. Duvic B. Belvin M. Jiang H. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6330-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibitors of the proPO system, activation of a number of endogenous factors acting as competitive inhibitors of PO activity has been described (5Cerenius L. Lee B.L. Söderhäll K. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). For example the so-called phenoloxidase inhibitors have been found in Musca domestica, and homologous basic lysine-rich peptides were also detected in mosquitoes and M. sexta (14Shi L. Li B. Paskewitz S.M. Insect Mol. Biol. 2006; 15: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Lu Z.Q. Jiang B. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 37: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered a novel 43-kDa protein from the hemolymph of the beetle T. molitor (Tenebrio MIP) acting as a negative regulator of melanin synthesis (16Zhao M. Söderhäll I. Park J.W. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Ha N.C. Wu C.F. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24744-24751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This protein, the target of which is presently unknown, is consumed during melanization. Interestingly, no similarity was found between Tenebrio MIP and any other known protein (16Zhao M. Söderhäll I. Park J.W. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Ha N.C. Wu C.F. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24744-24751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we now report the presence of a hemolymph protein with an apparently similar function as Tenebrio MIP in the crustacean Pacifastacus leniusculus. Interestingly, this protein has no sequence similarity to Tenebrio MIP. Instead, it is similar to vertebrate ficolin and horseshoe crab Tachylectin 5 (17Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K.

The crayfish MIP is very efficient in inhibiting activation of the proPO system and thus functions as an important regulatory molecule to prevent unwanted proPO activation. Animals, Collection of Plasma, and Microbial Organisms- Freshwater crayfish, P. leniusculus were purchased from Torsäng (Lake Vättern, Sweden) and kept in aquaria in aerated tap water at 10 °C. Only intermolt animals were used. Hemolymph was collected by bleeding from the abdominal hemocoel through a needle (0.8 mm) into sterile tubes on ice and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the hemocytes. The Gram-negative bacterium Hafnia alvei has earlier been isolated from P. leniusculus hemolymph 4I. Söderhäll, unpublished observation. and was cultured in LB broth. For fresh cultures the bacteria were grown with shaking at 260 rpm overnight at 37 °C and then diluted 1:100 and further cultured until the density reached OD600 of ≈0.5. Bacteria H. alvei were injected into the base of the fourth walking leg as earlier described (19Liu H.P. Jiravanichpaisal P. Cerenius L. Lee B.L. Söderhäll I. Söderhäll K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33593-33598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Hemocyte Lysate Supernatant-Hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS) was prepared by collecting hemolymph from 8 crayfishes in bleeding buffer (10 mm sodium cacodylate, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.0). The hemocytes were spun down by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then homogenized in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0. The homogenate was centrifuged at 25 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was adjusted to a protein content of ∼1 mg/ml, kept on ice, and used as HLS within 1 h. Induction of proPO Activation and Assay of PO Activity-To confirm the involvement of crayfish MIP in the proPO system, 25 μl of HLS (1 mg/ml) was preincubated with 25 μl of MIP (wild type or MIP(-D4), a mutant protein lacking the tetraaspartic acid stretch, at 0.5–1 μg) or buffer for the control for 10 min at 20 °C. These mixtures were incubated with 25 μg of LPS-PGN (Sigma L3129 from Escherichia coli 0127:B8) and 25 μl of 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA, 3 mg/ml) for 5–20 min at 20 °C. For analysis of the effect of MIP on PO activity, HLS was preincubated with LPS-PGN for 25 min at 20 °C to fully activate proPO prior to the addition of MIP. Phenoloxidase activity was measured as the oxidation of l-DOPA at 490 nm and presented as the means ± standard deviation from four independent experiments. In some experiments the phenoloxidase inhibitor phenylthiourea (PTU) was preincubated with HLS for 5 min at 20 °C. Measurement of Proteinase Activity-To determine whether any activating proteinase was affected by MIP, LPS-PGN-activated amidase activity of HLS was assayed as the hydrolyzing activity toward the chromogenic peptide S-2222 (Suc-Ile-Gly (γPip) Gly-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix). Briefly, 25 μl of HLS was incubated with 25 μg of LPS-PGN and 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25 μl of 2 mm S-2222 at 30 °C for 30 min, and then the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 50% acetic acid, and the absorbance at 405 nm was determined. The effect of MIP was determined by preincubation of MIP (0.5–1 μg) or buffer for the controls for 10 min at 20 °C prior to the addition of LPS. Detection of Crayfish MIP in Plasma and Determination of the Amino Acid Sequence-The proteins in plasma were precipitated with acetone and subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. First-dimensional separation was performed according to pI, and second-dimensional separation was done according to molecular weight. The IPG strips (7 cm length, pI range between 3 and 11, nonlinear; GE Healthcare) were rehydrated with rehydration solution including 80 μg of protein extracted before, for 12 h or overnight at 20 °C. Using the IPGphor system (GE Healthcare), isoelectric focusing was performed at a total of 45.5 kVh at 20 °C. The cysteine sulfhydryls were reduced and carbamidomethylated, whereas the proteins were equilibrated in the two-dimensional loading buffer (glycerol, SDS, urea) supplemented with 1% dithiothreitol for 15 min at 20 °C, followed by 2.5% iodoacetamide in fresh equilibration buffer for an additional 15 min at 20 °C. After equilibration, the IPG strips were applied onto a 7-cm acrylamide gel (12.5%). SDS-PAGE was performed at 30 mA/gel for 50–60 min at 20 °C. All of the electrophoretic procedures were performed at room temperature. One two-dimensional gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the other gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot. An affinity-purified antibody against Tenebrio MIP (16Zhao M. Söderhäll I. Park J.W. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Ha N.C. Wu C.F. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24744-24751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used for Western blot analysis. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked by immersion in 5% skimmed milk solution for 1 h. The membrane was then transferred to TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl) containing the affinity-purified Tenebrio MIP antibody (50 ng/ml) and 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated at 20 °C for 1 h. After washing in T-TBS (TBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 × 10 min, the ECL anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-linked species-specific whole antibody from donkey (GE Healthcare) diluted 1:10000 with TBS + 1% bovine serum albumin was incubated for 1 h and washed with T-TBS for 3 × 10 min. For detection, the ECL Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After comparing with the result of Western blot, selected spots from gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 were excised and cleaved with trypsin by in-gel digestion. The peptides were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Ltd.) using Masslynx software. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot-The proteins in plasma were precipitated with acetone and subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To examine what happened to MIP during PO-induced melanization, we induced PO activity as described above. When melanin pigments were generated, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 28,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. To confirm whether the disappeared bands on SDS-PAGE were specifically related to melanin synthesis, the inhibitor PTU was added to the same reaction mixture under the same conditions. After incubation, the proteins of the supernatant were precipitated with acetone and analyzed by Western blot after SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as described above. cDNA Cloning and Nucleotide Sequencing of 43-kDa Crayfish MIP- Hepatopancreas total RNAs were extracted using GenElute™ mammalian total RNA miniprep kit (Sigma) and followed by RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) treatment. cDNA was synthesized with ThermoScript (Invitrogen). Several sets of gene-degenerate primers based on the MS sequence results (VVMEDFDANK) were designed for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE. 5′-RACE was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Oligo(dT) was used to synthesize first strand cDNA. After poly(C) tail were assembled, PCR amplification was performed using the MIP-5R1 (5′-TTIGCRTCRAARTCYTCCAT-3′) and abridged anchor primer followed by nest PCR amplification with MIP-5R2 (5′-TCRAARTCYTCCATIACIAC-3′) and abridged universal amplification primer (AUAP) using the recommended conditions. For 3′ RACE, oligo(dT)-adapter was used to synthesize first strand cDNA. An initial amplification by PCR was carried out with primer MIP-3R1 (5′-GCGAGTACCAGGAAGGCTTT-3′) and oligo(dT) adapter. The nested PCR was performed with primer MIP-3R2 (5′-GCGTTCTCACCAGCTGAGAGT-3′). Amplified fragments were cloned into PCR 2.1-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Determination of MIP mRNA Localization-Total RNA extraction from different tissues (hepatopancreas, eyestalk, hemocytes, nerve tissue, heart, muscle, intestine, and hematopoietic tissue cells) was performed using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen), followed by chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation of the aqueous phase. Total RNA was treated by RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) treatment. cDNA was synthesized with ThermoScript (Invitrogen) followed by PCR using primers specific for MIP (GenBank™ accession number EX571686). Crayfish 40 S ribosomal (R40s; GenBank™ accession number CF542417) primers were used in all PCR experiments as control. The primers used were as follows: MIP 217+, 5′-CCACTCACCTCAGCCGACAC-3′; 698-, 5′-TCTTCCATGACGACTCTCAGCT-3′; crayfish 40 S ribosomal protein gene 5+, 5′-CCAGGACCCCCAAACTTCTTAG-3′; and 364-, 5′-GAAAACTGCCACAGCC-3′. For detection of MIP in the RNA interference experiment MIP 1+, 5′-TACCAGGTACACTCTCATCTACC-3′; 701-, 5′-GTCCTCCATTACGACTCTCA-3′ were used. The PCR program was as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s for the MIP gene and 28 cycles for the R40s. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Crayfish MIP- The construction of the recombinant baculovirus vector and the expression of the recombinant MIP (rMIP) were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding the mature MIP was subcloned into pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) using BamHI and SalI enzyme sites. The recombinant virus for MIP expression was generated according to the manufacturer’s instruction manual (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system; Invitrogen). The recombinant virus was amplified using Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9; Invitrogen) cells in SF-900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. To produce the protein, Sf9 cells were grown in Sf-900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) in a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask. The cells were infected with a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and were incubated for 3–4 days. The supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 500 × g for 10 min. After discarding the pellets, the supernatant containing MIP protein was desalted by using a PD-10 desalting column (code 17-0851-01; Amersham Biosciences) and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap Q HP column (0.7 × 2.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) column, pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and then this column was washed with the same buffer until no material appeared in the effluent and then gradient eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.0 (100 ml, 0–50%) at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. The purified protein was subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to determine the purity by Western blot. Site-directed Mutagenesis-The cDNA encoding the mature crayfish MIP was subcloned into pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen), and this plasmid was used for mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutants were obtained by deleting the four aspartic acids in the Asp-rich region in the cDNA clone: MIP(-D4) -858+:5′-GTTTTCTACCTACGACAAGAACAAAGATGGTAACTGCTC-3′; and MIP(-D4) -858-: 5′-GAGCAGTTACATCTTTGTTCTTGTCGTAGGTAGAAAAC-3′. The PCR was done as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, and 18 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, final extension at 68 °C, 6 min. The nicked vector DNA containing the desired mutations was then transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells, and then mutant MIP(-D4) plasmids were purified and sequenced to verify the mutated sequence. The generation of the recombinant virus for crayfish MIP(-D4) expression and the purification of recombinant crayfish MIP(-D4) are similar to the methods used for crayfish MIP. Hemagglutinating Activity Assay-Hemagglutinating activity toward human erythrocytes type A, B or O of rMIP was determined in assay buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 as described in Ref. 20Okino N.

RNA Interference Experiments-Oligonucleotide primers including T7 promoter sequences (italics) at the 5′ end were designed to amplify a 776-bp region of the P. leniusculus MIP gene: 217+, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCACTCACCTCAGCCGACAC-3′; 993-, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCAGGCCGCCATACTCGTTA-3′. Control 657-bp templates were generated by PCR using primers specific for the green fluorescent protein gene from the pd2EGFP-1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as follows: 63+, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGACGTAAACGGCCACAAGT-3′; 719-, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTTAGGGTTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′. To generate dsRNA, the PCR products purified by gel extraction (Qiagen) were used as templates for in vitro transcription using the MegaScript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and dsRNA was purified with the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) method. Small intermolt crayfish (20 ± 2 g, fresh weight) were used for in vivo RNA interference experiments. Briefly, 150 μg of MIP or green fluorescent protein control dsRNA dissolved in crayfish saline (0.2 m NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, pH 6.8) (200 μl) was injected via the base of the fourth walking leg. The injection was repeated 24 h after the first dsRNA injection. The presence of MIP protein in the hemolymph of dsRNA-treated crayfish was analyzed by Western blot as described above. Homology Modeling-A homology model of Pacifastacus MIP protein was built using the structure of lectin called l-ficolin (pdbid 2J61) (18Garlatti V. Belloy N. Martin L. Lacroix M. Matsushita M.

An alignment of these two proteins was carried out using the PROBCONS web service (21Do C.B. Mahabhashyam M.S. Brudno M. Batzoglou S.

The quality of the final model was checked using the ProCheck (23Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystalogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WhatCheck programs (24Rodriguez R. Chinea G. Lopez N. Pons T. Vriend G. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Tenebrio MIP Antibody Recognizes a Protein in Crayfish Plasma-We have earlier reported about the existence of MIP, a 43-kDa protein with no significant similarity to other reported proteins, acting as a negative regulator of melanization in the mealworm larvae. One characteristic of Tm MIP is the Asp-rich region including 11 adjacent Asp residues in its central part. To determine whether the freshwater crayfish P. leniusculus expresses a similar MIP protein, we used antibodies raised against Tm MIP in a Western blot experiment of crayfish hemocytes and plasma. As shown in Fig. 1A, a clear band was detected by the antibodies at a molecular mass of ∼43 kDa. To characterize further the protein that reacted with the MIP antibody, we performed a two-dimensional analysis of crayfish plasma, followed by Western blot. Two clear spots (and another two very weak) appeared at ∼43 kDa after immunoblotting of the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1, B and C), and these spots were all subjected to amino acid analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. The only peptide sequence that could be identified from these spots by tandem MS was VVMEDFDANK, showing no match with Tenebrio MIP or any other known protein. Thus we assumed that this crayfish protein might represent a new protein of unknown function. Cloning and Characterization of the cDNA for This Crayfish Protein-To determine the amino acid sequence of this crayfish protein, we designed degenerate primers to the peptide VVMED-FDANK and performed 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE using cDNA synthesized from hepatopancreas RNA. When we used hemocyte cDNA no transcript could be detected. However, we obtained a cDNA of 1764 base pairs from hepatopancreas, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame of this cDNA is shown in Fig. 2A. This cDNA encodes a protein consisting of 326 amino acid residues with a signal"
https://openalex.org/W2035906476,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes four genes with homology to the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). At least one of these viral IRFs, vIRF-3, is expressed in latently Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells and is essential for the survival of PEL cells. We now report that vIRF-3 interacts with cellular IRF-5, thereby inhibiting binding of IRF-5 to interferon-responsive promoter elements. Consequently, vIRF-3 blocked IRF-5-mediated promoter activation. A central double helix motif present in vIRF-3 was sufficient to abrogate both DNA binding and transcriptional transactivation by IRF-5. Upon DNA damage or activation of the interferon or Toll-like receptor pathways, cytoplasmic IRF-5 has been reported to be translocated to the nucleus, which results in induction of both p53-independent apoptosis and p21-mediated cell cycle arrest. We report here that IRF-5 is present in the nuclei of PEL cells without interferon stimulation. Silencing of vIRF-3 expression in PEL cells was accompanied by increased sensitivity to interferon-mediated apoptosis and up-regulation of IRF-5 target genes. In addition, vIRF-3 antagonized IRF-5-mediated activation of the p21 promoter. The data presented here indicate that vIRF-3 contributes to immune evasion and sustained proliferation of PEL cells by releasing IRF-5 from transcription complexes.

Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (4979) Google Scholar). It is now clear that KSHV is invariably found in all epidemiological forms of KS (for reviews, see Refs. 2Hengge U.R.

In addition, persistent KSHV infection is associated with two malignant lymphoproliferative disorders: primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) (4Cesarman E. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Said J.W. Knowles D.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar) and certain forms of multi-centric Castleman disease (5Soulier J. Grollet L. Oksenhendler E. Cacoub P. Cazals Hatem D. Babinet P. d’Agay M.F. Clauvel J.P. Raphael M. Degos L. et al.Blood. 1995; 86: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B-lymphoid cell lines established from PEL can be continuously propagated in culture. Even upon prolonged passage of PEL cells in culture, the latent genome is not lost from the cells, pointing to an essential role of KSHV genes for the continuous proliferation of these cells. There is a surprisingly long list of KSHV genes thought to be involved in lymphomagenesis. Among them are K1 (6Lee H. Veazey R. Williams K. Li M. Guo J. Neipel F. Fleckenstein B. Lackner A.

Recently, we were able to show that knockdown of vIRF-3 by RNA interference results in reduced proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cultured PEL cells (15Wies E. Mori Y. Hahn A. Kremmer E. Sturzl M. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Blood. 2008; 111: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). vIRF-3, also termed latency-associated nuclear antigen 2 (LANA2) or K10.5, is one of four KSHV genes with homology to the family of interferon regulatory factors. Notably, vIRF-3 is among the few viral genes expressed in essentially all latently infected PEL cells (9Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 15Wies E. Mori Y. Hahn A. Kremmer E. Sturzl M. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Blood. 2008; 111: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). IRFs constitute a family of related transcription factors initially identified as mediators of the interferon response. The interferon (IFN) system is an early and important defense system of the cell against viral infections. Manipulation of this effective antiviral mechanism by encoding antagonistic viral IRFs is thus obviously of benefit for KSHV and likely to contribute to pathogenesis. It has been shown in the past that vIRF-3 is able to counteract the interferon response by interfering with cellular IRF-7 and -3 (16Zimring J.C. Goodbourn S. Offermann M.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 701-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Joo C.H. Shin Y.C. Gack M. Wu L. Levy D. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8282-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as well as PKR (18Esteban M. Garcia M.A. Domingo-Gil E. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Rivas C. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although inhibition of the interferon response is certainly important for pathogenesis, it is most likely not sufficient to explain the dependence of cultured PEL cells on vIRF-3, since class I interferons are not produced by these cells at detectable quantities. 4E. Wies, A. S. Hahn, K. Schmidt, C. Viebahn, N. Rohland, A. Lux, T. Schellhorn, A. Holzer, and F. Neipel, unpublished observation. Like certain cellular IRFs (reviewed in Refs. 19Takaoka A. Tamura T. Taniguchi T. Cancer Sci. 2008; Google Scholar and 20Harada H. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), vIRF-3 is most likely not only involved in the innate immune response; it is also involved in pathways of apoptosis and cell growth regulation, which are not directly linked to the interferon response. An example is IRF-4, which is required for proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes (21Mittrücker H.-W. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T.M. Potter J. Shahinian A. Wakeham A. Patterson B. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Science. 1997; 275: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this hypothesis, several functions not directly associated with the interferon system have been described for vIRF-3. These include the repression of p53 (9Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) (22Seo T. Park J. Lim C. Choe J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6146-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, vIRF-3 has been shown to stimulate Myc-dependent transcription (23Lubyova B. Kellum M.J. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31944-31953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify cellular binding partners of vIRF-3 and thus pathways potentially deregulated by vIRF-3. We report here that vIRF-3 interacts with cellular IRF-5. Co-expression of vIRF-3 inhibited binding of IRF-5 to DNA and thereby the activation of IRF-5-regulated promoters. A central putative double α-helix motif in vIRF-3 was sufficient for this interaction. As shown previously, IRF-5 is not only a central mediator of the TLR-7 (Toll-like receptor-7) signaling pathway (24Schoenemeyer A. Barnes B.J. Mancl M. Latz E. Goutagny N. Pitha P.M. Fitzgerald K.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17005-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and a main stimulatory transcription factor for both IFNα (25Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and IFNβ (26Barnes B.J. Richards J. Mancl M. Hanash S. Beretta L. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45194-45207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) expression. Apart from its interferon-regulatory function, IRF-5 has also been described as a proapoptotic protein with tumor suppressor properties (27Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hu G. Mancl M.E. Barnes B.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7403-7412Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Mori T. Anazawa Y. Iiizumi M. Fukuda S. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2914-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we report here that 1) vIRF-3 was able to inhibit IRF-5-dependent p21 promoter activation, 2) knockdown of vIRF-3 rendered PEL cells more sensitive to interferon treatment, and 3) release of IRF-5 from vIRF-3-mediated repression led to an enhanced transcription of anti-proliferative IRF-5 target genes. Thus, inhibition of IRF-5 DNA-binding and activity by vIRF-3 is likely to be a mechanism contributing to the continuous proliferation of PEL cells. Cell Culture-KSHV-positive B-cells BC-3 (30Arvanitakis L. Mesri E.A. Nador R.G. Said J.W. Asch A.S. Knowles D.M. Cesarman E. Blood. 1996; 88: 2648-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), JSC-1 (31Cannon J.S. Ciufo D. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Borowitz M.J. Hayward G.S. Ambinder R.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10187-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and KSHV-negative B-cells (Akata, BJAB) were maintained as described previously (15Wies E. Mori Y. Hahn A. Kremmer E. Sturzl M. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Blood. 2008; 111: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An EBV-negative variant of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Akata was used (T. Grimm, Arndt Kieser; GSF, Munich). HEK 293T and p53-negative H1299 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids and Cloning-To construct IRF-5 expression plasmids, the IRF-5 coding sequence was amplified from cDNA of unstimulated or IFNβ-stimulated (1000 units/ml; 12 h) BC-3 cells using oligonucleotides IRF-5-EcoRI (ATAGAATTCCTGCCATGAACCAGTCCATCCCAG) and IRF-5-XbaI (ATATCTAGATTGCATGCCAGCTGGGTGCATAGG). The PCR product was ligated into pcDNA4-Myc-his (Invitrogen). Clones were verified by DNA sequencing, and protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. The clones for IRF5 variant 1 displayed one silent point mutation at position 549 compared with the reference sequence gi38683857 (GenBank™). IRF5 variant 2 showed one silent point mutation at position 1473 (reference sequence: gi38114631). The cloned variants 3 and 4 turned out to be identical with the sequences published in GenBank™ (gi40792575 and gi40792578, respectively). Relative to its GenBank™ entry (gi51890957), variant 5 displayed three mutations at positions 213 (silent), 549 (silent), and 899 (resulting in a mutation from glutamate to glycine). Construction of V5-tagged and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged vIRF-3 constructs has been described elsewhere (17Joo C.H. Shin Y.C. Gack M. Wu L. Levy D. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8282-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, amino acids 220–290 were deleted in vIRF-3ddV5. Aspartic acids and glutamic acids in both helix motifs of vIRF-3HmBV5 were replaced with asparagines and glutamines, respectively. Whereas plasmid vIRF-3wtGST expressed full-length vIRF-3 fused to GST, only the putative double helix motif corresponding to amino acids 240–280 of vIRF-3 is expressed in fusion with GST from plasmid vIRF-3DH40GST (17Joo C.H. Shin Y.C. Gack M. Wu L. Levy D. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8282-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ISRE-luciferase reporter plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The IFNβ-luciferase promoter construct was provided by Prof. Jae Jung. Plasmid pcK10.5 was used for expression of vIRF-3 in mammalian cells. Briefly, the cDNA encoding vIRF-3 was amplified from BCBL-1 cells using oligonucleotides K10.1Bam (GATCGGATCCAACATGGCGGGACGCAGGCTTACCTGGATTTC) and K10.1-XbaR (GATCTCTAGATTAGTCATCACATGTAACTGAAC). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1+ via BamHI and XbaI restriction sites (in italic type). The expression construct for transglutaminase 2 was a kind gift from Detlef Schuppan (Universitätsklinikum Erlangen). The p21-luciferase promoter reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr. R. Wessely (Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich) (32Wessely R. Hengst L. Jaschke B. Wegener F. Richter T. Lupetti R. Paschalidis M. Schomig A. Brandl R. Neumann F.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening-Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the Matchmaker library construction and screening kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Since vIRF-3 amino acids 242–279 constitute a strong transcriptional transactivation domain, a vIRF-3 mutant lacking the corresponding nucleotide stretch (nucleotides 727–837) was cloned into vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) via BamHI and NotI restriction sites and used as bait. A cDNA library obtained from EBV-transformed B-lymphoblasts (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) and ligated into pGADT7Rec (Clontech) served as prey. Transformation into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains AH109 (library) or Y187 (bait) was carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions. Mating experiments were carried out by picking one colony of each selective yeast strain and incubation in YAPD medium overnight at 30 °C. Aliquots were spread on appropriate minimal medium plates the next day. Separation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Proteins, Western Blot Analyses, and Antibodies-Extraction of nuclear proteins was carried out using a nuclear extraction kit (Biovision Inc., Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were loaded on polyacrylamide gels and checked for purity by Western blot with anti-tubulin and anti-SP1 antibody. Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (34Birkmann A. Mahr K. Ensser A. Titgemeyer F. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11583-11593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were obtained from Serotec (V5 antibody), Acris (IRF-5 antibody), Sigma (tubulin antibody), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (SP1 antibody), and Biozol (GST antibody). Rat monoclonal vIRF-3 antibody was produced in cooperation with E. Kremmer as described previously (15Wies E. Mori Y. Hahn A. Kremmer E. Sturzl M. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Blood. 2008; 111: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Myc antibody was purified by protein A affinity chromatography from supernatant of 9E10 mouse hybridoma (ATCC) cells. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were obtained from DAKO (Dako Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Peroxidase activity was detected by electrochemiluminescence using an ImageReader LAS-1000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) CCD camera and software. Pull-down Experiments-For pull-down experiments, “bait” proteins tagged with either an epitope (Myc or V5) or GST were recombinantly expressed in transfected HEK 293T cells and adsorbed to either antibody-loaded protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), respectively. For this purpose, five 10-cm cell culture dishes were transfected with 10 μg of DNA of different expression plasmids. vIRF-3 proteins were either Myc-, V5-, or GST-tagged. Constructs expressing IRF-5 or transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) encoded Myc-tagged proteins. Cells were harvested after 2 days and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES with 2.5 mm EDTA/EGTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (high salt lysis buffer). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 20,000 × g and then incubated for 4 h with either antibodies (anti-Myc or anti-V5, 10 μg in 10 μl) immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads or glutathione-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed twice with high salt lysis buffer and once with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm EDTA/EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins coupled to Sepharose beads via either antibodies or glutathione where then used for the second round of pull-down. For this purpose, either HEK 293T cells or JSC-1 PEL cells were lysed in lysis buffer, followed by removal of insoluble components by centrifugation for 1 h at 20,000 × g. One ml of the lysate (corresponding to ∼30 million cells) was then incubated overnight with either one of the previously precipitated proteins (vIRF-3 (Myc-, V5-, or GST-tagged), Myc-tagged IRF-5 or Myc-tagged TGM2 as a control) or the respective antibody only. The precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-10-cm cell culture dishes (∼20 million cells) of HEK 293T cells were transfected with Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with 8 μgof expression plasmid for IRF-5 (variant 1, c-terminal Myc epitope), vIRF-3 (no epitope tag), or both. Empty vector was used to make up for equal DNA amounts. Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed with 9 ml of 1% formaldehyde in cell culture medium for 30 min directly in the culture dishes at room temperature. Formaldehyde was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 1 m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed for 20 min on ice in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA/EGTA, 25 mm HEPES). The cells were then washed once in hypotonic lysis buffer, and the resulting nuclear pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of ChIP lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium desoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA/EGTA, 25 mm HEPES). The nuclear lysates were then sonified in a Branson cup sonifier at maximum output and 80% duty cycle for 20 min, resulting in DNA fragments of an average length of ∼2000 bp. 10 μgof pcDNA4a plasmid DNA was added to each lysate to block nonspecific binding. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 20,000 × g. Input samples were taken aside, and 500 μl of the supernatants were incubated overnight with 10 μg of 9E10 anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody or 10 μgof anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody as a control. The antibodies were precipitated for 30 min with salmon sperm blocked protein G beads (Millipore). Washing of the precipitates was performed once with ChIP lysis buffer, once with hypotonic lysis buffer, and twice with ChIP lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were then eluted by two rounds of incubation with 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3) for 10 min at 65 °C. Salt concentration was adjusted to 200 mm NaCl, and proteinase K was added at 50 μg/ml. The eluates and equally treated input samples were digested and decross-linked at 65 °C overnight. All samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, ethanol-precipitated with the addition of 30 μg of glycogen and 0.3 m NaOAc, dried, and reconstituted in 200 μl of TE buffer. The samples were then analyzed by standard semiquantitative PCR with primer pairs specific for the promoter regions of IFNβ (IFNβ-P-forward, TCAGGTCGTTTGCTTTGC; IFNβ-P-reverse, GAGGAATTTCCTTCTC), of JunB (JunB-P-forward, CCCTCCCGATTACAGTGCTT; JunB-P-reverse, AATACCAGGACCTGGTACGCAG), of IFIT1 (IFIT1-P-forward, GACAGTGTCCATGATGGAGCAA; IFIT1-P-reverse, CGGAAATAAGCAACCAATCTGG), and of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH-P-forward, CCCAACTTTCCCGCCTCTC; GAPDH-P-reverse, CAGCCGCCTGGTTCAACTG). Semiquantitative RT-PCR-RNA isolation of ∼1 million PEL cells was carried out using the Nucleospin RNAII RNA isolation kit (Machery & Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed by a two-step protocol. After cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase Superscript II and random hexamers (Bioline GmBH) as primers, amplification of target genes was achieved using oligonucleotide pairs for IFIT1 (IFIT1-forward, CGGCTGCCTAATTTACAGCAAC; IFIT1-reverse, GGCATTTCATCGTCATCAATGG), for JunB (JunB-forward, GTGCACTAAAATGGAACAGCCC; JunB-reverse, CAGGCTCGGTTTCAGGAGTTT), and for β-actin (β-actin-forward, CCATCTACGAGGGGTATCGC; β-actin-reverse, CGTGGCCATCTCTTGCTC). For each primer pair, the number of cycles required for optimal amplification in the linear range was used. After an initial denaturation step (95 °C, 2 min), the PCR was performed using denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s. Immunofluorescence-Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (15Wies E. Mori Y. Hahn A. Kremmer E. Sturzl M. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Blood. 2008; 111: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As first antibodies, rat monoclonal antibody 3G7 directed against vIRF-3 and goat polyclonal anti-IRF-5 or rabbit polyclonal anti-IRF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. For detection of primary antibodies, cells were then incubated with an anti-rat Alexa-fluor-488 conjugate (Invitrogen) and an anti-goat (IRF-5) or anti-rabbit (IRF-1) Alexa-fluor-555 antibody (Invitrogen). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with fluorescent lamp (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Göttingen, Germany). The objective lens magnification was ×40 with total final magnification of ×400. Images were taken using a Spot Diagnostic Imaging camera and software (Diagnostic Instruments, Burroughs, MI). Laser scanning images were taken on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Westlar, Germany). Co-localization was quantified with the Leica software co-localization tool. Luciferase Reporter Assay-HEK 293T cells were seeded 12–16 h prior to transfection onto 12-well cell culture plates. The cells were transfected at 70% density with luciferase reporter constructs and the respective expression plasmids using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were normalized for DNA content with empty vector control. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in luciferase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.5 m dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol). Luciferase activity was determined in duplicates with a microplate luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Luciferase counts were normalized to total protein content of the sample as measured with the Bio-Rad assay. siRNA Transfection and Apoptosis Assay-siRNA transfection of BC-3 cells was carried out as described previously (15Wies E. Mori Y. Hahn A. Kremmer E. Sturzl M. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Blood. 2008; 111: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For knockdown of vIRF-3, a synthetic siRNA targeting the sequence AAGGCCAUUUGUGGGUGAAAA was used. A “nonsense” siRNA targeted at the sequence AAGACUACCGUUGUAUAGUAG, which does not occur in KSHV or any sequence currently present in GenBank™, served as negative control. For simultaneous determination of caspase 3 and caspase 7 activities in the cells, the Caspase-GloTM 3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells treated with 10 μm etoposide (Sigma) were used as positive control for caspase activation. Promoter Pull-down-For promoter pull-down assays, 1 μg of vIRF-3 expression plasmid or 1 μg of IRF-5 expression plasmid or both were transfected into HEK 293T cells. pcDNA3.1 was co-transfected to make up for equal amounts of DNA. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and adjusted to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml by the addition of nuclear extraction buffer. Biotinylated probes for the IFNβ promoter were generated by PCR using either IFNβ reporter plasmid or pcDNA4 (Invitrogen) as template and biotinylated oligonucleotides IFNβ-forward (TCAGGTCGTTTGCTTTCCTTTGC) and IFNβ-reverse (GAGGAATTTCCCACTTTCACTTCTC) or control-oligo-forward (TATTGCAGCTTATAATGGTTACAAATAAAGC) and control-oligo-reverse (CCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGG), respectively. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Biomers.net GmbH (Ulm, Germany). ISRE probes were generated by annealing 5′-biotin-labeled oligonucleotides ISRE-for (TAGTTTCACTTTCCC) and ISRE-rev (GGGAAAGTGAAACTA) or ISREmut-for (TGTATCTATCTCTCC) and ISREmut-rev (GGAGAGATAGATACA), respectively, at 50 μm each. 20 μl(5 μl for ISRE pull-down) corresponding to 40 μg (10 μg for ISRE pull-down) of nuclear extract were incubated for 30 min on ice with 160 ng of biotinylated IFNβ promoter or control probe in a total volume of 200 μl. For ISRE pull-down, 50 pmol of the probe and 500 pmol of unlabeled competitor probe were used. Reaction conditions were adjusted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, supplemented with 50 μg/ml oligo(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chelfont, UK) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 20 μl of the protein solution were then taken aside as input control, and 500 μl of band shift buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) was added to the reaction. The whole sample was then transferred to a fresh tube containing streptavidin-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of band shift buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. For promoter pull-down from knockdown PEL cells, an equal number of cells was harvested and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA/EGTA, 25 mm HEPES with 2 min of sonification to release nuclear proteins. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 50 μl (corresponding to 4 million cells) were incubated for 1 h in a total volume of 500 μl with 250 pmol of biotinylated probe in band shift buffer. 200 μl of band shift buffer with streptavidin-agarose was added, and the reaction was precipitated for 1 h with agitation. Detection was carried out as above. For each experiment, the amount of IRF-5 input and the amount precipitated by ISRE-biotin was quantified densitometrically, and the ratio (precipitate/input) was calculated for siNonsense and sivIRF-3 samples. The value for siNonsense was set to 100% in each experiment.

The O-antigen polysaccharide of the LPS molecule provides protection from host defenses, and the length of O-antigen chains plays a pivotal role. In the Wzy-dependent O-antigen biosynthesis pathway, the integral inner membrane protein Wzz determines the O-antigen chain length. How these proteins function is currently unknown, but the hypothesis includes activities such as a ""molecular ruler"" or a ""molecular stopwatch,"" and other possibilities may exist. Wzz homologs are membrane proteins with two transmembrane helices that flank a large periplasmic domain. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the periplasmic portions of Wzz proteins found multiple oligomeric forms, with quaternary structures favoring the ""molecular ruler"" interpretation. Here, we have studied full-length Wzz proteins with the transmembrane portions embedded in lipid membranes. Using electron microscopy and image analysis we find a unique hexameric state rather than differing oligomeric forms. The data suggest that in vivo Wzz proteins determine O-antigen chain length via subtle structure-function relationships at the level of primary, secondary, or tertiary structure within the context of a hexameric complex."

But reducing love to its component parts helps us to understand human sexuality, and may lead to drugs that enhance or diminish our love for another, says Larry J. Young. A seemingly very 'human' emotion, love is more often the province of poetic fancy than of scientific analysis. But now the animal studies that demystified emotions such as fear and anxiety are beginning to illuminate the mental states associated with love. This has implications for the nature of human sexuality — and could even lead to drugs to enhance or diminish our love for another.

Isolation of the complexes has been performed by tandem affinity purification from human cells in culture. To understand the rules of assembly of this particle, expression of the three nonsynthetase components of MARS, p18, p38, and p43, was blocked by stable small interfering RNA silencing.

The finding that components of MARS may oscillate between various functional states led to the suggestion that MARS is a depot for releasable regulatory proteins (22Ray P.S. Arif A. Fox P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 158-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of the spatio-temporal organization of MARS is a key factor for the regulation of the activity of its components. A detailed knowledge of the assembly scheme of this complex is required to understand how association of its components may be regulated by posttranslational modifications.The deciphering of the structural organization of MARS has been hampered by the high stability of this particle that could only be partly dissociated under nondenaturing conditions. Only partial disassembly of the complex was achieved during hydrophobic interaction chromatography (23Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J.

Some clues concerning the assembly of its components have been obtained by reconstitution of subcomplexes starting from recombinant proteins individually expressed in Escherichia coli or in yeast (13Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Affinity purification is a method of choice to isolate macromolecular complexes directly from cell extracts. To further appraise the structural organization of the complexes, these assemblies can be perturbed in vivo after silencing of key components. In order to understand the structural rules that govern in vivo the assembly of the 11 components of MARS, complexes were isolated by combining tandem affinity purification (TAP) with stable translational silencing of the p18, p38, or p43 component by siRNA. The characterization of the various subcomplexes that may form in cellulo was used to construct a physical map of the complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Stable Cell Lines Expressing TAP-tagged Proteins-The TAP-tag sequences were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pSG5. The TAP tag cassette of pZome-1-C was excised by EcoRI digestion, Klenow treatment, and BamHI digestion and inserted into pSG5 digested with BglII, treated with Klenow, and digested with BamHI, to create pSG5-CTAP. To create pSG5-NTAP, the TAP tag cassette, recovered from pZome-1-N after digestion with BamHI and SalI and treatment with Klenow, was introduced into pSG5 digested with EcoRI and treated with Klenow. The cDNAs encoding the proteins of interest were introduced into the EcoRI or BamHI sites of pSG5-CTAP or into the EcoRI or BamHI sites of pSG5-NTAP to create fusion proteins carrying a TAP tag appended to the carboxyl-terminal or amino-terminal extremity of the protein, respectively. The cDNAs encoding human p18 (GGGGGATCCATAATGGCGGCGGCCGCAGAG and GGGGGATCCGTGGGAATTAGTATATAG), p38 (GGGGGATCCATAATGCCGATGTACCAGGTA and GGGGGATCCCTTAAGGAGCTTGAGGG), p43 (GGGGGATCCATAATGGCAAATAATGATGCTGTT and GGGGGATCCTTTGATTCCACTGTTGCTCA), N-p43 (GGGGGATCCATAATGGCAAATAATGATGCTGTT and GGGGGATCCTACGGTTGTTACTGCTGTAG), p43(ARF) (GGGGGATCCATAATGGCTGGTACCAAAGAACAGATAA and GGGGGATCCTTTGATTCCACTGTTGCTCA), and MetRS (GGGGAATTCATAATGAGACTGTTCGTGAGTGATGG and GGGGAGATCTTTTTGCCTGGCCCCCTCCAAAG) were amplified by PCR with the two oligonucleotides indicated and cloned into pSG5-CTAP. The cDNA encoding human p38 (CCCCAATTGATGCCGATGTACCAGGTA and CCCCAATTGTCACTTAAGGAGCTTGAGGG) was also amplified by PCR with the two oligonucleotides indicated and cloned into pSG5-NTAP. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). Stable transformants were isolated by selection with G418.Isolation of Complexes-Cells (3 billion) grown in 100 dishes of 140 mm diameter were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested at 4 °C by mechanical detachment with a cell lifter, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 mm benzamidine). Purification of the TAP-tagged proteins was conducted essentially as described previously (27Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and 200 μl of IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) were added to the supernatant. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the suspension was applied to a Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and the packed beads were washed five times with 10 ml of buffer A and once with 10 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Sepharose beads (200 μl) were incubated overnight, at 4 °C, in 200 μl of buffer A containing 0.5 mm EDTA and the TEV protease at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The eluate (200 μl) was recovered, and beads were washed with 200 μl of buffer A containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The combined eluates (400 μl) were diluted by the addition of 3 volumes of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm immidazole-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C after the addition of 200 μl of calmodulin-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm. Beads were then washed five times with 10 ml of buffer B, and protein complexes were eluted after a 5-min incubation in 200 μl of buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm immidazole-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 3 mm EGTA). Elution was repeated five times, the various eluates were pooled, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of 0.25 volumes of a solution containing 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, washed four times with 500 μl of diethyl ether, air-dried, and resuspended in the loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R250.Identification of Polypeptides by Mass Spectrometry-In-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were performed essentially as described (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7768) Google Scholar). Briefly, bands were excised and distained by several incubations in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, containing 50% acetonitrile. Then proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol, and cysteines were carbamidomethylated. Tryptic digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm NH4HCO3 with 150 ng of trypsin. The supernatants were removed, and peptides were extracted with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and then with 60% acetonitrile containing 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The combined extracts were then reduced to ∼5–10 μl under vacuum. 1.5 μl of tryptic samples was mixed with 1.5 μl of saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1.5 μl of this premix were then deposited onto the sample plate and allowed to dry at room temperature. Spectra were acquired on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser, in positive ion reflector mode with delayed extraction. External calibration was applied, based on a mixture of six reference peptides covering the m/z 900–3700 Da range. Proteins were identified using the search program Mascot (available on the World Wide Web), reducing the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL and NCBI data bases to the Homo sapiens species. Two missed cleavage sites, possible oxidation of methionine, and modification of cysteines by iodoacetamide were considered in searches.Construction of Knockdown Strains for the p18, p38, and p43 Components of MARS-Oligonucleotides encoding human siRNA for p18 (GATCCCCACAATGGTCCAAGTCTAACTTCAAGAGAGTTAGACTTGGACCATTGTTTTTTGGAAC and TCGAGTTCCAAAAAACAATGGTCCAAGTCTAACTCTCTTGAAGTTAGACTTGGACCATTGTGGG), p38 (GATCCCCGAATGTGCCGAAGACGCAGTTCAAGAGACTGCGTCTTCGGCACATTCTTTTTGGAAC and TCGAGTTCCAAAAAGAATGTGCCGAAGACGCAGTCTCTTGAACTGCGTCTTCGGCACATTCGGG), and p43 (GATCCCCTGGTCATGTGTGCTAGTTCTTCAAGAGAGAACTAGCACACATGACCATTTTTGGAAC and TCGAGTTCCAAAAATGGTCATGTGTGCTAGTTCTCTCTTGAAGAACTAGCACACATGACCAGGG) were annealed and introduced into the BglII and SalI sites of pLTRH1 (29Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The target sequences (underlined above) are localized at positions 107–125 from p18 cDNA, 570–588 from p38 cDNA, and 677–695 from p43 cDNA. The recombinant plasmids were used to transfect with Effectene (Qiagen) the packaging cell line GP2-293, and viruses were recovered as described (29Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Target cells (HeLa, HeLa/MetRS-CTAP, HeLa/p43-CTAP, HeLa/p38-CTAP, and HeLa/p18-CTAP) were infected by viruses as described (29Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and clones that stably expressed the corresponding siRNAs (p18si, p38si, and p43si) were selected. The knockdown of the corresponding component of MARS was checked by Western blot analysis with anti-p18, anti-p38, or anti-p43 antibodies.Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis-Polyclonal anti-p38, anti-p43, anti-GluProRS, anti-GlnRS, anti-MetRS, and anti-AspRS antibodies have been described previously (8Mirande M. Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11056-11063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-p18 antibodies were a gift from Dr. Sunghoon Kim (Seoul National University, Korea). Western blot analyses were conducted with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Chemicon) and the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSComposition of Affinity-purified MARS-Conventional methods for purification of the MARS complex from animal tissues involve chromatographic steps on ion exchange resins. These protocols result in highly purified complexes but require exposure to high salt concentrations and dilution of the protein samples during salt gradient elution. In order to appraise as much as possible the native state and composition of this complex, we wanted to isolate MARS from human cells using a strategy that would not imply exposure to high salt and to dilution. For this purpose, we appended a tag made of protein A and calmodulin-binding peptide, containing a TEV cleavage site just in between, to various subunits of MARS. This TAP strategy is especially designed to isolate multiprotein complexes under close-to-physiological conditions (30Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The TAP tag was introduced at the C terminus of the p18, p43, and MetRS components of MARS, since previous studies have suggested that the N-terminal domains of these components are involved in complex assembly but that their C-terminal domains are exposed on the outside of the particle (9Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14309-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Concerning p38, the scaffold component of MARS (9Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), two fusions were generated, with insertion of the TAP tag either at the N or C terminus of the protein. Each individually tagged protein was expressed in HeLa cells after stable integration of the DNA constructs. To avoid overexpression of the TAP-tagged protein as compared with its protein partners, HeLa strains expressing the fusion proteins at nearly physiological levels as compared with the endogenous proteins were selected (result not shown). This resulted in the isolation of homogeneous populations of complexes (see below).First, we purified MARS using the MetRS-CTAP fusion protein, a component known to be present as a single copy within the complex (34Mirande M. Kellermann O. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11049-11055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tandem affinity purification was conducted starting from 2–3 billion cells. Fusion protein was captured on immobilized IgGs, released by TEV protease digestion, adsorbed on a calmodulin column in the presence of Ca2+, and eluted by the addition of EGTA. The polypeptides copurified with MetRS-CTAP were identified by mass spectrometry following in-gel digestion with trypsin. The polypeptide composition of the complex isolated from human cells with MetRS-CTAP was very similar to the composition of the rabbit complex purified according to standard procedures (Fig. 1).The finding that similar MARS complexes, always containing the same 11 major polypeptides, were obtained when purification was conducted using other TAP-tagged components also argues that MARS is a structurally well defined particle. The complexes obtained using p18-CTAP or p43-CTAP contained the same polypeptides as previously observed with MetRS-CTAP (Fig. 1). Because p18 and p43 are dimers and the fusion proteins were expressed to close-to-endogenous levels, the purified complexes contained a mixture of the native endogenous protein and of the recombinant fusion proteins containing the calmodulin-binding peptide (white and black arrowheads in Fig. 1, respectively). We suggested previously that the p38 protein is the scaffold for the assembly of MARS (9Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). One of the possible models for the association of the 10 other components to p38 considered that p38 constitutes the core of this assembly that could form a compact structure around its scaffold protein. We were concerned about the possibility that introduction of a TAP tag, an appended domain of 20 kDa, to the N or C terminus of p38 might destabilize the association of some of the components of the complex. Thus, we performed the purification of complexes using p38-CTAP or p38-NTAP (Fig. 1). The complexes isolated with these two constructs contained the same 11 polypeptide components. The yield of complex recovery was lower with p38-NTAP, as compared with p38-CTAP (Fig. 1), suggesting a limited accessibility within the complex of the TAP tag appended to the N terminus of p38 for binding to the affinity columns.The finding that no additional polypeptide is copurified in stoichiometric amounts with the various TAP-tagged proteins used in this study clearly shows that MetRS, p18, p38, and p43 are associated within the same particle in the cellular environment, in the physiological context of exponential cell growth.Translational Silencing of the Auxiliary Components of MARS-To investigate the consequence of knockdown expression of the auxiliary components of MARS on the viability of human cells in culture and on the assembly of MARS in cellulo, we searched for siRNA capable of inhibiting the expression of p18, p38, or p43 to a steady-state level that could not be detected by Western blotting. The MARS complex displays a high stability in cellulo, with a cellular half-life of about 48 h corresponding to three cell division times (results not shown). To create mutant cell lines in which silencing would be stable over time, we expressed siRNA with retroviral vectors that integrate into the genome (29Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Six constructs carrying different 21-nucleotide-long target sequences/gene were tested for their ability to stably and specifically inhibit the expression of the corresponding gene products. Then the construct leading to the more potent inhibition was selected for further studies.First, we noticed that silencing of p18 (p18si), p38 (p38si), or p43 (p43si) in HeLa cells to a cellular level that could not be detected with antibodies directed to these components of MARS (Fig. 2) was not lethal for the cell. No strong phenotypic effect was observed. Only a growth retardation phenotype could be observed. Whereas wild-type HeLa cells displayed a doubling time of 18 h at 37 °C, HeLa/p18si-, HeLa/p38si-, and HeLa/p43si-stable cell lines showed doubling times of 24, 24, and 23 h, respectively, corresponding to a 30% decrease in growth rate.FIGURE 2Effect of siRNA on the cellular levels of the MARS components. Purified MARS rabbit complex (MARS) and cellular extracts from wild-type HeLa cells (HeLa) or from HeLa cells stably expressing siRNAs targeting p18 (HeLa/p18si), p38 (HeLa/p38si), or p43 (HeLa/p43si) were probed by Western blot analysis with antibodies directed to p18, p38, p43, GluProRS (EPRS), GlnRS (QRS), MetRS (MRS), and AspRS (DRS). Immunoblots were quantitatively analyzed with a FUJI LAS-3000 chemiluminescence imaging system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The steady-state level of the components of MARS in HeLa cells subjected to p18, p38, or p43 silencing was compared with normal cells (Fig. 2). The first noticeable feature is that the knockdown of one of the auxiliary components of the complex did not dramatically disturb the steady-state level of the other components. The most discernible side effects were observed on the steady-state level of p43 and AspRS in HeLa/p38si cells (Fig. 2). This is most certainly related to the weaker cellular stability of these components when, in the absence of the scaffold protein p38, they are no more associated within MARS (see below).Mapping the Assembly of MARS in Vivo-Each siRNA was expressed in the HeLa cell lines described above that had stably integrated the DNA constructs that express the fusion protein MetRS-CTAP, p43-CTAP, p38-CTAP, or p18-CTAP, and stable cell lines were selected. The in vivo assembly of the MARS complex in the absence of its p18, p38, or p43 component was explored by isolating the various TAP-tagged components in combination with the expression of the three siRNAs. In total, nine distinct TAP purifications were performed and at least two purifications per combination of TAP tag and siRNA species.To explore the putative structural role of p18 in the assembly of MARS, we isolated subcomplexes with MetRS-CTAP, p43-CTAP, or p38-CTAP (Fig. 3A) in a p18si background. MetRS was the only polypeptide recovered from HeLa/MetRS-CTAP/p18si (Fig. 3A), and MetRS and p18 were the only polypeptides that were absent in the complexes recovered from HeLa/p43-CTAP/p18si or HeLa/p38-CTAP/p18si (Fig. 3A). Thus, p18 serves to anchor MetRS to the other components of MARS. When p18-CTAP or MetRS-CTAP was used to purify complexes in a p43si background, the same subcomplexes containing GluProRS, IleRS, LeuRS, LysRS, AspRS, and p38, in addition to p18 and MetRS, were isolated (Fig. 3A). In a p38si background, only GluProRS, IleRS, and LeuRS were recovered in a complex containing p18 and MetRS (Fig. 3A), showing that LysRS and AspRS require p38 to associate with these components. Conversely, in this p38si background, another su"

We report the cloning of a bull using cells retrieved from testicles that had been taken from a dead animal and frozen without cryoprotectant in a -80 degrees C freezer for 10 years. We obtained live cells from defrosted pieces of the spermatic cords of frozen testicles. The cells proliferated actively in culture and were apparently normal. We transferred 16 SCNT embryos from these cells into 16 synchronized recipient animals. We obtained five pregnancies and four cloned calves developed to term. Our results indicate that complete genome sets are maintained in mammalian organs even after long-term frozen-storage without cryoprotectant, and that live clones can be produced from the recovered cells."

https://openalex.org/W2046356778,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mus81.Mms4 protein complex, a DNA structure-specific endonuclease, helps preserve genomic integrity by resolving pathological DNA structures that arise from damaged or aborted replication forks and may also play a role in the resolution of DNA intermediates arising through homologous recombination. Previous yeast two-hybrid studies have found an interaction of the Mus81 protein with Rad54, a Swi2/Snf2-like factor that serves multiple roles in homologous recombination processes. However, the functional significance of this novel interaction remains unknown. Here, using highly purified S. cerevisiae proteins, we show that Rad54 strongly stimulates the Mus81.Mms4 nuclease activity on a broad range of DNA substrates. This nuclease enhancement does not require ATP binding nor its hydrolysis by Rad54. We present evidence that Rad54 acts by targeting the Mus81.Mms4 complex to its DNA substrates. In addition, we demonstrate that the Rad54-mediated enhancement of the Mus81.Mms4 (Eme1) nuclease function is evolutionarily conserved. We propose that Mus81.Mms4 together with Rad54 efficiently process perturbed replication forks to promote recovery and may constitute an alternative mechanism to the resolution/dissolution of the recombination intermediates by Sgs1.Top3. These findings provide functional insights into the biological importance of the higher order complex of Mus81.Mms4 or its orthologue with Rad54."

We previously demonstrated that two basic helix-loop-helix proteins, Yas1p and Yas2p, activate the transcription of ALK1 in an alkane-dependent manner by forming a heterocomplex and binding to alkane-responsive element 1 (ARE1), a cis-acting element in the ALK1 promoter. Here we identified an Opi1 family transcription factor, Yas3p, involved in the alkane-dependent transcription regulation of ALK genes. Deletion of YAS3 caused a significant increase in ALK1 mRNA in cells grown on glucose, glycerol, and n-alkanes. The YAS3 deletion also resulted in a marked elevation of reporter gene expression driven by an ARE1-containing promoter on glycerol and n-decane. Bacterially expressed Yas3p bound specifically to Yas2p, but not to Yas1p, in vitro. In addition, although green fluorescent protein-tagged Yas3p was localized in the nucleus in glucose-containing medium, it changed its localization to an endoplasmic reticulum-like compartment upon transfer to medium containing n-decane. These findings suggest that Yas3p functions as a master regulator of transcriptional response, which changes its localization between the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum membrane in response to different carbon sources. Furthermore, quantitative real time PCR analysis of 12 ALK genes in YAS1, YAS2, and YAS3 deletion mutants suggested that Yas3p is involved in the transcriptional repression of a variety of ALK genes, including ALK1. In contrast, YAS3 deletion did not affect the mRNA level of an INO1 ortholog in Y. lipolytica, indicating functional diversity of Opi1 family transcription factors.

P450s constitute a superfamily and have been isolated from a wide variety of species ranging from bacteria to mammals (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J.

Many microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and fungi, have developed metabolic systems to assimilate n-alkanes as a carbon source using P450s (2Cardini G. Jurtshuk P. J. Biol.

The cytochrome P450ALKs, which are classified into the CYP52 family, are involved in the terminal mono-oxygenation of n-alkanes. P450ALKs have been found in many alkane-assimilating yeasts, including Candida tropicalis (5Sanglard D. Chen C. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The expression of many P450ALKs in these yeasts is induced when they are cultivated in the presence of n-alkanes as a sole carbon source and repressed when grown on glucose or glycerol. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of these P450ALKs are not fully understood. Y. lipolytica has a remarkable ability to utilize a wide variety of hydrophobic compounds, and this makes Y. lipolytica potentially important both in fundamental research and in biotechnological applications (12Barth G.

Gene deletion analysis was performed for ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, ALK4, and ALK6 (11Iida T. Sumita T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The deletion of ALK1 caused a defect in growth on medium containing n-decane, a short carbon chain n-alkane, as a sole carbon source, but it did not confer an apparent growth defect on n-hexadecane, a longer chain n-alkane. The double deletion of ALK1 and ALK2 resulted in growth defect on n-hexadecane. These results suggest the vital role of ALK1 and ALK2 in n-alkane assimilation (11Iida T. Sumita T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the functions of other ALK genes remain to be elucidated. The expression of ALK1 is highly induced by n-alkanes, including n-decane and n-hexadecane, and repressed strongly by glycerol and weakly by glucose (11Iida T. Sumita T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We identified an upstream activating sequence that provides the transcriptional induction in response to n-alkanes in the ALK1 promoter, and we named it alkane-responsive element 1 (ARE1) (16Sumita T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22183-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ARE1 contains an E-box-like sequence, and ARE1-like sequences are found in the promoters of several genes involved in n-alkane assimilation, including a subset of ALK genes and PAT1 encoding acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (18Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified YAS1 and YAS2 encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors essential for the transcriptional induction of ALK1 by n-alkanes (17Yamagami S. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22183-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Endoh-Yamagami S. Hirakawa K. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Deletion of YAS1 or YAS2 abolishes the n-alkane-dependent transcriptional induction of ALK1 and impairs the growth on n-alkanes. bHLH proteins are known to form homo- and/or heterodimers and to bind to E-box motifs (20Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 21Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell.

Yas1p and Yas2p also form a heterocomplex in vivo and in vitro and bind to ARE1 in vitro only when both are present (19Endoh-Yamagami S. Hirakawa K. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The bHLH motifs in Yas1p and Yas2p share highest sequence similarity with those of Ino4p and Ino2p, respectively, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The heterodimer complex formed by Ino2p and Ino4p binds to a DNA element called UASINO/ICRE, which is found in the promoters of phospholipid biosynthetic genes, and this induces the expression of the genes in the absence of myo-inositol (23Ambroziak J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the model proposed by Loewen et al. (30Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), Opi1p is sequestered on the ER membrane through interactions with the integral membrane protein Scs2 and with phosphatidic acid (PA) in the absence of myo-inositol. When myo-inositol is provided, PA is consumed for synthesis of phosphatidylinositol. Upon the decrease of PA in the ER membrane, Opi1p translocates into the nucleus, binds to Ino2p (31Wagner C. Dietz M. Wittmann J. Albrecht A. Schuller H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and represses the Ino2p-Ino4p-dependent transcription. In this study, we identified a Y. lipolytica ortholog of Opi1p, which we named Yas3p (yeast alkane signaling 3), and we investigated its function in n-alkane-dependent transcriptional regulation. The results suggest that Yas3p regulates the transcription of ALK1 and a subset of other ALK genes in response to n-alkanes through interaction with Yas2p. Importantly, our data provide evidence for the functional diversity of Opi1 family proteins that are widely and specifically encoded in fungal genomes. Yeast Strains and Growth Condition-Y. lipolytica strain CXAU/A1 (ura3, ade1::ADE1) (17Yamagami S. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22183-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used as a wild-type strain. The Δyas1 and Δyas2 strains were described previously (17Yamagami S. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22183-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Endoh-Yamagami S. Hirakawa K. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Δyas3, Δlyas3N, and Δlyas3 strains were obtained by replacing the second exon, the first exon, and the whole coding region of the long form of YAS3, respectively, with the ADE1 gene. The deletion cassettes (described below) were introduced into CXAU1 strain (ura3, ade1) (10Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and Ade+ transformants were selected. To obtain a strain that expresses Yas3p fused to EGFP (Yas3-EGFP) or Sec61p fused to DsRed (Sec61-DsRed) under the native promoter from its own chromosomal locus, pBSUYAS3-EGFP or pBSUSEC61-DsRed was digested with PshAI or BamHI, respectively, and introduced. Transformants were selected, and then the cells, in which the DNA region corresponding to intact YAS3 or SEC61, URA3, and the vector was popped out, were selected on YPD medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (32Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The correct integration or recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis and/or DNA sequencing. An appropriate carbon source was added to YNB (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate; Difco, 0.5% ammonium sulfate) as follows: 2% (w/v) glucose; 2% (w/v) glycerol; 2% (v/v) n-decane; and 2% (v/v) n-hexadecane. Uracil (24 mg/liter) was added, if necessary. For solid media, 2% agar was added. n-Alkanes were supplied in the vapor phase to YNB solid media; a piece of filter paper was soaked with n-alkanes and placed on the lid of a Petri dish, which was sealed and kept upside down. SD medium with or without inositol was prepared as described previously (19Endoh-Yamagami S. Hirakawa K. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C. The growth curve was obtained with an automatically recording incubator TN1506 (Advantec). Plasmids-The short form of the YAS3 gene with its flanking region from CXAU1 total DNA was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GCGATTGGTGATTAGCG-3′ and 5′-GTGGCCAATCAGACGC-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) to obtain pT-YAS3. The short form of YAS3 gene with its flanking region was also PCR-amplified from CXAU1 total DNA with primers 5′-ACCCGAAGCTTTTCGAGGTGCCCATTCAGAT-3′ and 5′-AGCGCCGCGGTCCAGCCGTTGTCTTGTCA-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the HindIII-SacII site of the pSUT5 vector (18Yamagami S. Iida T. Nagata Y. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to obtain pSUT5-YAS3. The deletion cassette for the second exon of the long form of YAS3 was constructed as described below. The plasmid pT-YAS3 was digested with EcoRI and EcoRV to remove the second exon of YAS3, blunted, and ligated with the ADE1-carrying BamHI fragment (filled) of pSAT4 to obtain pT-dyas3. The YAS3 deletion cassette was liberated by digestion of pT-dyas3 with ApaI and SpeI. The deletion cassette for the first exon of the long form of YAS3 was constructed as follows. The promoter region of the long form of YAS3 and the 3′-adjacent region of the first exon were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CAGAATTCCACGTGACTTCATGCGGGGTAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTGTGGTACTCTCGTTCCCGT-3′, and 5′-TTGGATCCGGAAACGACGACCGGTGAGGA-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGATATGTGTGGGCAGGGAACTTAG-3′, respectively. The amplified fragments were cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) after digestion with EcoRI or XbaI and BamHI. The ADE1-carrying BamHI fragment from pSAT4 was cloned into BamHI site of this plasmid to obtain pBSdlyas3N. The deletion cassette for the first exon of YAS3 was liberated by digestion of pBSdlyas3N with EcoRV and XbaI. The plasmid, pBSdlyas3, containing the deletion cassette for the whole region of the long form of YAS3 was constructed similarly to pBSdlyas3N, except that the 3′-noncoding region of YAS3 amplified by PCR using primers 5′-TTGGATCCTGTGGGTGCTCCAGAAGATGGCT-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGAGGCGGTAACAGTGTACTCCTGGT-3′ was cloned into pBluescript II SK(+), instead of 3′-adjacent region of the first exon. To express His6-tagged Yas1p and Yas2p, we used pET-YAS1 and pET-YAS2, respectively (19Endoh-Yamagami S. Hirakawa K. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To obtain pGEX-s-YAS3 for expression of GST-fused s-Yas3p, a DNA fragment was PCR-amplified with the primer pair 5′-CATGGATCCATGCCCAAGGCTCTGTCTTC-3′ and 5′-TAAGGATCCTTAGGCATCTCCCATCTCAA-3′ using pSUT5-YAS3 as a template, cut with BamHI, and cloned into the corresponding site in pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare). For the lacZ reporter assay, pS3×LZ, which contains lacZ under the control of three copies of ARE1 and LEU2 minimal promoter, was used (17Yamagami S. Morioka D. Fukuda R. Ohta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22183-22189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The plasmid, pSYAS2-EGFP, to express Yas2p fused to EGFP at its C terminus (Yas2-EGFP) from its own promoter was constructed as follows. The YAS2 ORF with its 5′-flanking region was amplified from CXAU1 total DNA by PCR using primers 5′-TCGACCAAGCTTCGATCTCCGTTATGTCCG-3′ and 5′-TTGTGGGAATTCCTCATCAATCTTGGGAGG-3′, and the amplified fragment was digested with HindIII and EcoRI. The YAS2 3′-flanking region was also amplified by PCR using primers and 5′-AAGATTGAATTCTAAATGCCACAATCACCC-3′ and 5′-TGAAGCTCTAGATACTGTGTGGGACAACTG-3′, and the amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and XbaI. These fragments were cloned into pSUT5, which had been cut with HindIII and XbaI, resulting in pSYAS2-EcoRI. The GFP coding region was amplified from pEGFP (Clontech) by PCR using primers 5′-GGAATTCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding site of the pSYAS2-EcoRI yielding the plasmid pSYAS2-EGFP. To obtain a strain that expresses Yas3-EGFP under its own promoter, we constructed the plasmid, pBSUYAS3-EGFP, as follows. The short form of YAS3 ORF with its 5′-flanking region was amplified from CXAU1 total DNA by PCR using primers, 5′-ACCCGAAGCTTTTCGAGGTGCCCATTCAGAT-3′ and 5′-CGAATTCGGCATCTCCCATCTCAACGT-3′, and the amplified fragment was digested with HindIII and EcoRI.

These DNA fragments were cloned into the HindIII-SacII sites of the pSUT5 to obtain pSYAS3-EGFP. URA3-carrying fragment was excised from pSUT5 with NcoI, blunted, and cloned into EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK(+) to obtain pB-URA3. YAS3-EGFP-containing fragment was amplified from pSYAS3-EGFP by PCR using primers 5′-GAAGGATCCTTCGAGGTGCCCATTCAGAT-3′ and 5′-GGAGGATCCTCCAGCCGTTGTCTTGTCA-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pB-URA3 to obtain pBSUYAS3-EGFP. To obtain a strain that expresses Sec61-DsRed under its own promoter, we constructed the plasmid, pBSUSEC61-DsRed, as follows. The SEC61 ORF with its 5′-flanking region was amplified from CXAU1 total DNA by PCR using primers 5′-GGAATTCGCTCCACCTACAAGTAGCCCA-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCTAATAGCAGCATCAACGTAGCC-3′, and the amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and StuI. The SEC61 3′-flanking region was also amplified by PCR using primers and 5′-AAGGCCTTAATTGCGCTAGGGTGTAACTGA-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCGAGTCATCTTCAAACCATCCA-3′, and the amplified fragment was digested with StuI and XbaI. These DNA fragments were cloned into the HindIII-XbaI site of the pBluescript II SK(+) to obtain pBSSEC61.

The plasmid pBSSEC61-DsRed was digested with ApaI and XbaI, and SEC61-DsRed-containing fragment was cloned into the corresponding site of pSAT4 to obtain pSASEC61-DsRed. SEC61-DsRed-containing fragment was excised from pSASEC61-DsRed with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pB-URA3, to obtain pBSUSEC61-DsRed. After PCR amplification, the DNA fragments were checked by sequence analysis. Restriction enzyme sites in the primers were indicated with underlines. Transformation of Y. lipolytica-Y. lipolytica was transformed by electroporation as described previously (10Iida T. Ohta A. Takagi M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1387-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis-Total RNA was prepared with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene), and 4 μg of total RNA was analyzed. Hybridization and detection were performed using digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes with PCR DIG probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). DNA probes were amplified using the following primer pairs: 5′-ATGTCCAACGCCCTCAAC-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTTCTCAGGGTCGAC-3′ for ALK1; 5′-ATGGATTCCCGATCAGCCTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCAATGAGGTTCTTCAAA-3′ for YAS1;5′-ATGCACCTTTCCCACCCACA-3′ and 5′-GTTGTTGTTGTTGTCGTGGG-3′ for YAS2;5′-CAACAGTCTACCCGAGC-3′ and 5′-AACACCTTGCCTCCAGC-3′ for YAS3; and 5′-CGGAATCACCTCCGTTCACGTC-3′ and 5′-CCTGTCGCTGCAGGTCGTACTC-3′ for YlINO1 with CXAU1 total DNA as a template. β-Galactosidase Activity Assay-We performed β-galactosidase activity assay as described (16Sumita T. Iida T. Yamagami S. Horiuchi H. Takagi M. Ohta A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), except that the cells were incubated with various carbon sources for 3 h. RNA Ligase-mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends-RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) was performed using the GeneRacer RLM-RACE kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with primers 5′-AGATGGGCGTTGGCGAGCTTAAGGAGA-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-CGACCTCCTCGGGCTCCACTTCTGC-3′ for 3′-RACE. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay-“Epicurian coli” BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) and Escherichia coli JM109 were used to express His6-tagged proteins and GST-s-Yas3p, respectively. A culture was grown to A600 = 0.5 at 37 °C in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). Following 4 h of incubation with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were harvested and lysed by French pressure cell press (SLM Instruments) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% v/v protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g, 4 °C, for 15 min. Fusion proteins were prepared as crude bacterial lysates. For binding assay of Yas1p and Yas2p to Yas3p immobilized on the beads, cell lysate (∼1.8 mg of protein) containing GST-s-Yas3p was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Cell lysate (∼1.0 mg of protein) containing His6-tagged proteins was added to the beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. For binding assay of Yas1p to the preformed Yas2p-Yas3p complex, cell lysate (∼700 μg of protein) containing GST-s-Yas3p was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Cell lysate (∼400 μg of protein) containing His6-Yas2p was added to the beads and incubated for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed as described above. Then cell lysate (∼400 μg of protein) containing His6-Yas1p was added to the beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed as described above. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of SDS/sample buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue), and 10 μl were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. His6-tagged proteins were detected with anti-poly Histidine monoclonal antibody (R & D Systems) at 1:5,000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:5,000 and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare) were used to visualize the resolved proteins. Fluorescence Microscopy-For DAPI staining, cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol for 15 min. Cells were washed twice and stained in 1 μg/ml DAPI for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice and subjected to microscopic observation. Microscopic images were acquired a BX52 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with ORCA-ER (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)-Total RNA was prepared using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) and treated with DNase I (Takara) to remove genome DNA. The total RNA was reverse-transcribed with ExScript RT reagent kit (Takara). qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) and the gene-specific primers (Table 1) with SmartCycler II (Cepheid). To quantify the mRNA expression levels, standard curves were prepared using CXAU1 total DNA as a template. Specific amplification of each ALK gene was confirmed by sequence analysis of five clones amplified using corresponding primers.TABLE 1Primers used for qRT-PCRORFPrimerSequenceALK1ALK1-F5′-AGTGGAAGTGTGGTAAGCCCAA-3′ALK1-R5′-CAAACTCGAGCAGTCGGTTCTT-3′ALK2ALK2-F5′-ACTTGGCCTTTTCCGATCCTT-3′ALK2-R5′-TTGAACTGAGTGGCCAGAACG-3′ALK3ALK3-F5′-CGCTCGAAAAGAAAAGTCCGA-3′ALK3-R5′-GGTCCCGCAAAGTGATCTTGT-3′ALK4ALK4-F5′-AAAGCGGTTTGCCAATGGA-3′ALK4-R5′-ACTGAGTGGCCAGGATAGCCTT-3′ALK5ALK5-F5′-TTTCATTCCCAAAGGCCAGAC-3′ALK5-R5′-CCCATCGCTCAGGAATGAACT-3′ALK6ALK6-F5′-CTGTTCCATTCGAGCCAAACTC-3′ALK6-R5′-CGGTGAAGTCGTGCACAATCT-3′ALK7ALK7-F5′-GTGTGGCTGAAAACGGACTGTT-3′ALK7-R5′-TTTCAAACCGGTCCTTCAAGG-3′ALK8ALK8-F5′-TCGGTTGGTTCAGGAGTTTACG-3′ALK8-R5′-AACCCTCAGACCTTCTCCCAGA-3′ALK9ALK9-F5′-TCACAACCACGAACCCAGCTA-3′ALK9-R5′-TCGCTGGTATACGAACGAGGAC-3′ALK10ALK10-F5′-TACAGTGTGTTCGCGACCCAT-3′ALK10-R5′-GCAAGTACTCCCATCCTCGTGA-3′ALK11ALK11-F5′-ACAGTCACATTTTCCGCCCA-3′ALK11-R5′-ATTGCTGGCCCAGACAGATTC-3′ALK12ALK12-F5′-TGCCGTTTACTGGACACACAGA-3′ALK12-R5′-TTTCCCAGAGGTCCTGGATGAT-3′ Open table in a new tab Identification of Yas3p-The bHLH motifs of Yas1p and Yas2p share the highest sequence similarity with those of S. cerevisiae Ino4p and Ino2p, respectively. Opi1p is involved in the transcriptional repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes controlled positively by Ino2p and Ino4p. These observations suggest the possibility that an Opi1p counterpart is also conserved in Y. lipolytica and that it is involved in the transcriptional regulation of ALK1.

https://openalex.org/W2076596105,"Upon T cell activation, IκB kinases (IKKs) are transiently recruited to the plasma membrane-associated lipid raft microdomains for activation of NF-κB in promoting T cell proliferation. Retroviral Tax proteins from human T cell leukemia virus type 1 and type 2 (HTLV-1 and -2) are capable of activating IKK, yet only HTLV-1 infection causes T cell leukemia, which correlates with persistent activation of NF-κB induced by Tax1. Here, we show that the Tax proteins exhibit differential modes of IKK activation. The subunits of IKK are constitutively present in lipid rafts in activated forms in HTLV-1-infected T cells that express Tax. Disruption of lipid rafts impairs IκB kinase activation by Tax1. We also show that the cytoplasmic Tax1 protein persistently resides in the Golgi-associated lipid raft microdomains. Tax1 directs lipid raft translocation of IKK through selective interaction with IKKγ and accordingly, depletion of IKKγ impairs Tax1-directed lipid raft recruitment of IKKα and IKKβ. In contrast, Tax2 activates NF-κB in a manner independent of lipid raft recruitment of IKK. These findings indicate that Tax1 actively recruits IKK to the lipid raft microdomains for persistent activation of NF-κB, thereby contributing to HTLV-1 oncogenesis.

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HTLV-1, human T cell leukemia virus type 1; Tak1, transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1; RFP, red fluorescence protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CAV1, caveolin-1; GalT, galactosyltransferase. is an oncogenic retrovirus that causes human adult T cell leukemia. The viral oncoprotein Tax1, encoded by the HTLV-1 genome, is the molecular determinant for transformation of T lymphocytes (1Tanaka A. Takahashi C. Yamaoka S. Nosaka T. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Tax1 modulates the activity of the transcriptional factor NF-κB to promote T cell proliferation, and it also inactivates tumor suppressor p53 (2Sun S.C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These molecular bases are thought to be crucial for Tax1-induced transformation of T lymphocytes. Moreover, vast amounts of experimental data have shown that Tax1 regulates a wide variety of cellular factors in addition to NF-κB and p53, which may play distinct roles at various stages of oncogenesis (4Matsuoka M. Jeang K.T. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Persistent activation of NF-κB is one of the characteristic features of adult T cell leukemia. Tax1 is essential to establish proliferative growth of T cells at least in the early stage of infection, and Tax1 immortalizes primary human T cells in a manner highly dependent on its ability to activate NF-κB (2Sun S.C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Tax2, the Tax protein from HTLV-2, shares a significant amino acid sequence homology with Tax1 and is able to activate NF-κB and to transactivate the long terminal repeat of both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 by enhancing the activity of CREB (5Feuer G. Green P.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although the viral genome can be isolated from some hairy cell leukemia patients, HTLV-2 infection is not causally linked to T cell leukemia (5Feuer G. Green P.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike Tax1, Tax2 rarely transforms primary cells although it can immortalize primary human T cells. The underlying mechanism for the differential effect of Tax1 and Tax2 in transformation of T cell remains poorly understood. The precise mechanism of Tax activation of NF-κB remains elusive. It has been demonstrated that Tax1 induces activation of NF-κB via several distinct mechanisms. First, Tax1 modulates the IκB kinase complex, the key regulator of NF-κB signaling, by directly stimulating the activity of the catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, through interaction with the non-catalytic subunit, IKKγ or NEMO (6Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Grant M. Connelly M.A. Hambor J.E. Marcu K.B. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5157-5165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Li X.H. Murphy K.M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), indicating that IKKγ is one of the key targets for Tax1-mediated activation of IKK. Second, Tax1 was shown to modulate the activity of upstream kinases of IKK, which include mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) and NF-κB-inducing kinase (13Yin M.J.

It has been recently shown that Tax1 stimulates the activity of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (Tak1), an upstream kinase of IKK, and promotes interaction of Tak1 with IKKγ (15Wu X. Sun S.C. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Depletion of Tak1 abrogates the activation of IKK induced by Tax1, suggesting a critical role of Tak1 in this activation process. Furthermore, Tax1 was shown to interfere with the noncanonical pathway of NF-κB signaling by inducing processing of NF-κB2/p100 through up-regulation of IKKα in T cells (16Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These evidences implicate that Tax1-mediated activation of NF-κB involves a complex process. The mechanism of the persistent activity of NF-κB by Tax1 is yet to be addressed. In T lymphocytes, activation of TCR elicits tyrosine phosphorylation cascades and induces membrane lipid raft recruitment and activation of signaling molecules such as ZAP70, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and PKCθ (17Drevot P.

The lipid rafts are glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched, detergent-resistant microdomains that play crucial roles in signaling transduction (19He H.T. Marguet D.

Aside from TCR-directed signaling events, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) also induces lipid raft translocation of IKK, together with the IKK-associated chaperone protein, Hsp90 (34Chen G. Cao P.

It remains largely unclear whether Tax1-mediated activation of NF-κBis involved in lipid raft translocation of IκB kinases. It has been shown that cytoplasmic Tax1 mediates activation of IκB kinases. Indeed, a portion of Tax1 was found to reside in the Golgi and to recruit the IKK complex to this subcellular location (35Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Bex F. Mol.

In the present study, we show that the Tax1 protein accumulates in the Golgi-associated lipid rafts in directing translocation of IKK to the microdomains by primarily targeting IKKγ. This process is crucial for Tax1 activation of NF-κB in both T cells and non-lymphoid cells. In contrast, Tax2 activates NF-κB in a manner independent of the lipid raft recruitment of IKK as seen in Tax2-immortalized T cells. These differential modes of IKK activation by the Tax proteins may have implications on the pathogenesis of T cell leukemia. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents-Human T cell lines including MT1, MT2, MT4, SupT1, and Jurkat were cultured in RMPI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2. SupT1 and Jurkat E6-1 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), MT1 and MT4 were kindly provided by Drs. Atsushi Koito and Takeo Ohsugi (Center for AIDS Research and Institute of Resource Development and Analysis, Kumamoto University, Japan). MT2 cells were obtained from Dr. Douglas Richman (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). Antibodies for IκBα, Tak1, Hsp90, and HA epitope were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, and serine-phosphorylated IκBα were purchased from IMGENEX (San Diego, CA). Anti-LAT was from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-β-actin, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin β subunit, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures were obtained from Sigma. The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was purchased from Calbiochem, and anti-Tax1 antibody was acquired from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Mammalian Expression Plasmids, DNA Transfection, and GST Pulldown-The expression plasmids for GST-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ as well as HA-tagged Tax1 were described previously (38Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Nelkin G. Tsan R. Fan D. Cheng-Mayer C. Fidler I.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To generate Tax1 mutants, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed to construct the fragments with mutations at the positions illustrated in Fig. 3A. The fragments of Tax1 mutants were inserted into expression vector pCEF with a C-terminal HA or GST tag and verified with DNA sequencing. Tax2 was constructed in the same vector as Tax1. To construct lipid raft-targeted IKKγ, a myristoylation signal from Lck was attached to the full-length of IKKγ to generate the myristoylated IKKγ fusion fragment (Myr-IKKγ), which was inserted into the lentivirus vector. GFP-GalT (galactosyltransferase) was purchased from Addgene Inc. (MA). To construct RFP-tagged caveolin-1, the full-length of the caveolin-1 (CAV1) cDNA was amplified from a human cDNA library, and C-terminal tagged with the RFP (monomeric red fluorescence protein) fragment. The CAV1-RFP fusion fragment was inserted into vector pLCEF8 and CAV1 was sequence-validated. To examine the interaction of IKKγ with Tax1 and its mutants, the FLAG-IKKγ expression plasmid was co-transfected with GST-tagged wild type Tax1, the Tax1 mutants, or IKKβ into HEK cells using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Alencia, CA). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in the Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture at 15 °C for 30 min. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were added into the soluble supernatants and incubation was at room temperature for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with the lysis buffer and subjected for SDS-PAGE plus Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody to detect FLAG-IKKγ. To evaluate the interaction of endogenously expressed Tak1 with IκB kinases, GST-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ was transfected into HEK cells in the presence of either the empty vector or Tax1-HA. GST pulldown assay and immunoblot analysis were performed as described above. Lentivirus Vector and Transduction-The full-length fragment of enhanced green fluorescence protein was fused with IKKβ and IKKγ to generate GFP-IKKβ and GFP-IKKγ fusion genes, which were constructed in the lentivirus vector pLCEF8, a modified vector of pLL3.7 (39Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Zhang M. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar) in which human elongation factor 1α promoter replaced U6 promoter. The Tax1-GFP fusion fragment was also constructed in pLCEF8. The lentivirus production and transduction in T cell lines were performed as described previously (38Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Nelkin G. Tsan R. Fan D. Cheng-Mayer C. Fidler I.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and ∼10 multiplicity of infection was used for transduction of T cells. Transduction efficiency was verified with fluorescence imaging and immunoblot. Generation of Tax2 Immortalized T Cell Lines-Primary CD4+ T lymphocytes from healthy donors were isolated with Dynal beads conjugated with anti-CD4 antibody (Invitrogen). The CD4+ cells were activated with phytohemagglutinin (1 μg/ml) and recombinant interleukin-2 (100 units/ml) for 5 to 7 days prior to transduction with the lentivirus expressing Tax2-GFP fusion protein. Following one month of in vitro culture of the transduced cells in the media supplemented with interleukin-2 (50 units/ml), virtually all of the viable cells were green fluorescence positive and the cells were maintained in culture for more than 6 months. Western Blot Analysis-Cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer B containing 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl plus protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures at 4 °C for 30 min. Equal amounts of cellular proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot. Anti-β-actin blot was used for the protein loading control. In Vitro Kinase Assay and NF-κB Reporter Assay-In vitro kinase assay to detect the activity of IκB kinases and the NF-κB reporter assay were performed as previously reported (38Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Nelkin G. Tsan R. Fan D. Cheng-Mayer C. Fidler I.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)-Nuclear extracts were prepared from various T cell lines with or without TNFα stimulation (10 ng/ml for 10 min at 37 °C), using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). The sequence of the oligonucleotide corresponding to the κB element from the interleukin-2Rα gene was 5′-gatcCGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTC-3′. The underlined sequence is the κB cis-element. The oligonucleotide was 5′-end labeled with biotin (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and annealed to its complementary strand. The NF-κB binding activity to the κB element was examined by EMSA using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce). In brief, 5 μg of the nuclear extracts were preincubated in a 20-μl total volume containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 50% glycerol, and 1 μg of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid and 2 μl of biotin-labeled probe (20 fmol) for 20 min at room temperature. The reactions were mixed with 5 μl of 5× loading buffer and run on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE: 89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) for 90 min at 100 V on ice, and transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 380 mA for 1 h in 0.5× TBE on ice. The membrane was optimally UV light cross-linked. Biotin-labeled DNA was detected by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and followed by chemiluminescence. Lipid Raft Fractionation by OptiPrep Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation-Cells (4 × 107 for T cells and 1 × 107 cells for HEK cells) were lysed in 2 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were sheared by 20 passages through a 22-gauge needle, incubated for 20 min on ice before mixing with the OptiPrep density gradient medium (Iodixanol solution, final concentration, 40% v/v; AXIS-SHIELD PoC AS, Oslo, Norway), and placed at the bottom of a 12-ml tube. By overlaying 4 ml of 30% and 4 ml of 5% of OptiPrep medium, a discontinuous OptiPrep gradient was formed. Ultracentrifugation was performed at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor. 1 ml of each fraction from the top to bottom was collected and subjected to Western blot analysis. Depletion of plasma and intracellular membrane cholesterol by MβCD in T cells was performed by pretreatment of the cells (4 × 107 cells/each sample) with 10 mm MβCD for 45 min at 37 °C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Following this step, the cells were subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation for lipid raft fractionation analysis. Fluorescence Imaging-MT2 cells were transduced with GFP, Tax1-GFP, GFP-IKKβ, or GFP-IKKγ using the lentivirus-mediated gene delivery system. Lipid raft was labeled with the Alexa Fluor 594 Lipid Raft Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were centrifuged and gently resuspended in chilled, complete culture media. Following centrifugation, the cell pellets were gently resuspended in 500 μl of Alexa 594-conjugated cholera toxin B (6 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 20 min. After this incubation, the cells were washed twice with chilled 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of the chilled anti-cholera toxin B antibody (100-fold dilution working solution) for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with chilled 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated dishes and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The Golgi-lipid raft association of Tax1 was assessed by co-transfection of Tax1-GFP with the Golgi lipid raft marker caveolin-1 tagged with RFP. The cells were then incubated with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) to stain the nuclei. Microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Assay-p-Nitrophenyl phosphate phosphatase assay was carried out for 12 h at 37 °C in an assay mixture (100 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of each fraction, and terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n NaOH. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. IκB Kinases Are Constitutively Present in the Lipid Rafts in HTLV-1-infected T Cells That Express Tax-Five T cell lines, including non-HTLV-1-infected T cells (Jurkat and SupT1) and HTLV-1-infected T cells (MT1, MT2, and MT4) were assessed for Tax1 expression. MT2 cells, but not other T cell lines, produced a detectable level of Tax1 (Fig. 1A). A hyperphosphorylation of IκBα, a substrate for activated IκB kinase, was detected in MT2 cells when the cells were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, MT2 cells exhibited a hyperactivity of the κB DNA binding, and TNFα stimulation did not further increase the κB binding activity (Fig. 1C), suggesting that NF-κB was maximally activated in these cells even in the absence of extracellular stimuli. IκBα was weakly phosphorylated in MT1 cells with a detectable basal activity of NF-κB, and this activity was further enhanced upon TNFα treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). In non-HTLV-1 infected, Jurkat T cells, the phosphorylation of IκBα was not detected and the basal activity of NF-κB activity was not observed, whereas the NF-κB activity was induced by TNFα (Fig. 1, B and C). These results implicate that a constitutive NF-κB activation is present in HTLV-1-infected T cells, and the expression of Tax1 leads to induction of full-scale activation of IκB kinases. To determine whether the activation of IκB kinase by Tax1 requires a process that involves lipid raft translocation of IKK, density gradient ultracentrifugation was applied for lipid raft fractionation analysis. As shown in Fig. 1D, portions of three subunits of the IKK complex, including IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, were constantly present in the lipid raft fractions in MT2 cells, corresponding to lipid raft biomarkers LAT and GM1 (fractions 4 and 5), whereas ERK1 exclusively resided in the soluble fractions. In contrast, in the HTLV-1-infected, non-Tax1 expressing cell line MT1, IKKs constantly remained in the cytoplasmic, soluble fractions (Fig. 1E). We further tested another non-Tax1 expressing, HTLV-1-infected T cell line, TL-Om1, and found that IκB kinases were in the soluble fractions (data not shown). To verify if the lipid raft presence of the IKK complex correlates with Tax1 expression, we examined another HTLV-1-infected T cell line, SLB-1, that expresses Tax1 (40Richard V. Lairmore M.D. Green P.L. Feuer G. Erbe R.S. Albrecht B. D'Souza C. Keller E.T. Dai J. Rosol T.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 2219-2228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB in SLB-1 cells was comparable with that in MT2 cells (Fig. 1F). Indeed, the IκB kinases, not ERK1, were found in the lipid raft fractions in SLB-1 cells, corresponding to GM1 fractions (Fig. 1G). The amounts of the IκB kinase proteins in lipid rafts were abundant, which were detected in both fractions 4 and 5. To verify whether the IκB kinases are associated with lipid rafts in HTLV-1-infected, Tax1-expressing T cells, we treated MT2 cells with MβCD (dissolved in water), a selective cholesterol inhibitor that impairs formation of lipid rafts. Both IKKβ and IKKγ were exclusively found in the soluble, non-lipid raft fractions, whereas the level of IKKα in lipid rafts was significantly reduced following MβCD treatment (Fig. 2A). In MT2 cells, IKKα was persistently phosphorylated in both the lipid raft fraction (highest intensity of the IKKα phosphorylation in the fraction 5) and non-lipid raft fractions (Fig. 2B). Under the identical immunoblot conditions, phosphorylation of IKKα was rarely detected in MT1 cells, primarily due to low affinity of the phospho-specific antibody, which was unable to detect weak phosphorylation at short exposure. These data indicate that Tax1 induces hyperphosphorylation and activation of IκB kinases, which in turn drives a full range of activation of NF-κBinT cells. Indeed, disruption of lipid rafts by MβCD inhibited NF-κB activity in MT2 cells (Fig. 2C), and prevented Jurkat cells from TNFα-induced activity of NF-κB (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the lipid raft-translocated IKKs are in activated forms in Tax1-expressing T cells and that Tax1 is likely to be the causative factor to promote lipid raft translocation of IκB kinases. Tax1 Directs Lipid Raft Translocation of IKK Correlating with Its Ability to Activate IKK-To evaluate structural recruitments of Tax1 in activating IκB kinases, we constructed several mutants of Tax1. M22 contains two amino acid substitutions at amino acids 130–131 and abrogates the ability of Tax to activate IKK but retains a full capacity to induce viral gene transcription through HTLV-1 LTR. As depicted in Fig. 3A, two additional mutants of Tax1, ΔGG and ΔPXXP, with deletions at amino acids 33–34 and 73–79, respectively, were generated, as these two amino acid sequences are highly conserved among the Tax proteins from HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. We assessed the ability of wild type (WT) Tax1 and Tax1 mutants in inducing the activity of IKKβ and found that the WT Tax1, but not any of the Tax1 mutants, stimulated the kinase activity of IKKβ (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, Tax1, but not any of the mutants induced NF-κB driven β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3C). Similar to the WT Tax1, M22 maintained the ability to activate HTLV-1 LTR, whereas the ΔGG and ΔPXXP mutants lost such ability (data not shown). Because the ΔGG and ΔPXXP mutants abolished the abilities in inducing the activities of NF-κB and CREB that transactivates HTLV-1 LTR, it is likely that these two mutants may be improperly folded. Tax1 activation of IκB kinases does not require lymphocyte-specific factors. To determine whether the lipid raft translocation of the IKK complex correlates with the ability of Tax1 to activate IKK, we transfected WT Tax1 and its mutants into a non-lymphoid cell line, HEK. The WT Tax1 induced the lipid raft translocation of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, corresponding to the GM1 fraction, whereas ERK1 remained in the soluble fractions (Fig. 3D, fraction 5). In contrast, all three Tax1 mutants lost the ability to drive the translocation of IκB kinases to lipid rafts (Fig. 3, E–G). Moreover, the IKK-associated chaperone protein Hsp90, an essential modulator of the IKK complex, and Tak1, an upstream kinase of IKK, were also able to translocate into the lipid raft fractions in Tax1-expressing HEK cells, but not in cel"
https://openalex.org/W1978166553,"Background Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently represents the closest “gold standard” for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), but operational data are scant on the impact and cost-effectiveness of TB culture for human immunodeficiency (HIV-) infected individuals in resource-limited settings. Methodology/Principal Findings We recorded costs, laboratory results, and dates of initiating TB therapy in a centralized TB culture program for HIV-infected patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, constructing a decision-analysis model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of TB culture from the perspective of a public-sector TB control program. Of 217 TB suspects presenting between January 2006 and March 2008, 33 (15%) had culture-confirmed active tuberculosis; 23 (70%) were smear-negative. Among smear-negative, culture-positive patients, 6 (26%) began TB therapy before culture results were available, 11 (48%) began TB therapy after culture result availability, and 6 (26%) did not begin TB therapy within 180 days of presentation. The cost per negative culture was US$17.52 (solid media)–$23.50 (liquid media). Per 1,000 TB suspects and compared with smear alone, TB culture with solid media would avert an estimated eight TB deaths (95% simulation interval [SI]: 4, 15) and 37 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (95% SI: 13, 76), at a cost of $36 (95% SI: $25, $50) per TB suspect or $962 (95% SI: $469, $2642) per DALY averted. Replacing solid media with automated liquid culture would avert one further death (95% SI: −1, 4) and eight DALYs (95% SI: −4, 23) at $2751 per DALY (95% SI: $680, dominated). The cost-effectiveness of TB culture was more sensitive to characteristics of the existing TB diagnostic system than to the accuracy or cost of TB culture. Conclusions/Significance TB culture is potentially effective and cost-effective for HIV-positive patients in resource-constrained settings. Reliable transmission of culture results to patients and integration with existing systems are essential."
https://openalex.org/W1985472924,"Spore discharge in the majority of the 30,000 described species of Basidiomycota is powered by the rapid motion of a fluid droplet, called Buller's drop, over the spore surface. In basidiomycete yeasts, and phytopathogenic rusts and smuts, spores are discharged directly into the airflow around the fungal colony. Maximum discharge distances of 1-2 mm have been reported for these fungi. In mushroom-forming species, however, spores are propelled over much shorter ranges. In gilled mushrooms, for example, discharge distances of <0.1 mm ensure that spores do not collide with opposing gill surfaces. The way in which the range of the mechanism is controlled has not been studied previously.In this study, we report high-speed video analysis of spore discharge in selected basidiomycetes ranging from yeasts to wood-decay fungi with poroid fruiting bodies. Analysis of these video data and mathematical modeling show that discharge distance is determined by both spore size and the size of the Buller's drop. Furthermore, because the size of Buller's drop is controlled by spore shape, these experiments suggest that seemingly minor changes in spore morphology exert major effects upon discharge distance.This biomechanical analysis of spore discharge mechanisms in mushroom-forming fungi and their relatives is the first of its kind and provides a novel view of the incredible variety of spore morphology that has been catalogued by traditional taxonomists for more than 200 years. Rather than representing non-selected variations in micromorphology, the new experiments show that changes in spore architecture have adaptive significance because they control the distance that the spores are shot through air. For this reason, evolutionary modifications to fruiting body architecture, including changes in gill separation and tube diameter in mushrooms, must be tightly linked to alterations in spore morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2014859464,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been shown to reduce Na+-driven alveolar fluid clearance in BALB/c mice in vivo. To investigate the cellular mechanisms by which RSV inhibits amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC), the main pathways through which Na+ ions enter lung epithelial cells, we infected human Clara-like lung (H441) cells with RSV that expresses green fluorescent protein (rRA2). 3-6 days later patch clamp recordings showed that infected cells (i.e. cells expressing green fluorescence; GFP+) had significantly lower whole-cell amiloride-sensitive currents and single channel activity (NPo) as compared with non-infected (GFP-), non-inoculated, or cells infected with UV-inactivated RSV. Both alpha and beta ENaC mRNA levels were significantly reduced in GFP+ cells as measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Infection with RSV increased expression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrite concentration in the culture medium; nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 subunit and NF-kappaB activation were also up-regulated. iNOS up-regulation in GFP+ cells was prevented by knocking down IkappaB kinase gamma before infection. Furthermore, pretreatment of H441 cells with the specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W (1 microM) resulted in a doubling of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in GFP+ cells. Additionally, preincubation of H441 cells with A77-1726 (20 microM), a de novo UTP synthesis inhibitor, and 1400W completely reversed the RSV inhibition of amiloride-sensitive currents in GFP+ cells. Thus, both UTP- and iNOS-generated reactive species contribute to ENaC down-regulation in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells."

We asked whether one or more biological responses to TSP1 might be explained through EGF receptor (EGFR) activation. In A431 cells, TSP1 increased autophosphorylation of Tyr-1068 of EGFR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The ability of TSP1 to activate EGFR was replicated by the tandem EGF-like repeats as a recombinant protein. The three EGF-like repeats alone produced a high level of Tyr-1068 phosphorylation.

Therefore, the NH2-terminal globular domain, the TSRs and calcium-binding repeats, and the COOH-terminal domain of TSP1 all exhibit receptor binding activities that elicit distinct host cell responses. Aside from minimal recognition by integrins (14Calzada M.J. Annis D.S. Zeng B. Marcinkiewicz C. Banas B. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Biol.

TSP1 is secreted by numerous cell types and is present in the extracellular matrix (17Lahav J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TSP1 was first demonstrated in the releasate of thrombin-stimulated platelets (18Lawler J. Blood. 1986; 67: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed by endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, cells of monocytes/macrophage lineage, and tumor cells (17Lahav J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of TSP1 biology has been established in these cell systems. TSP1 is also expressed in epithelia, is abundant in the basement membranes underlying these cells (17Lahav J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and participates in epithelial cell responses, including re-epithelialization during wound healing (8Uno K. Hayashi H. Kuroki M.

In previous studies, we demonstrated that TSP1 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the zonula adherens proteins γ-catenin and p120ctn (24Goldblum S.E. Young B.A. Wang P. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1537-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), an event that can occur downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR) (25Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR contains an NH2-terminal, ligand-binding ectodomain that is coupled to an intracellular catalytic domain and its tyrosine autophosphorylation sites (27Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the EGFR ectodomain induces receptor homodimerization and heterodimerization with other ErbB family members, intrinsic kinase activity, and autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues which, in turn, serve as docking sites within the cytoplasmic domain for signaling molecules (27Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity EGFR ligands share a 45-55-aa EGF motif with six spatially conserved cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds that dictate their tertiary conformation (28Harris R.C. Chung E. Coffey R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). These ligands are synthesized as transmembrane precursor proteins that are cleaved by cell surface matrix metalloproteases (MMP) (28Harris R.C. Chung E. Coffey R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases) (29Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D.

EGFR ligands that specifically activate EGFR include EGF, transforming growth factor α, amphiregulin, and others that activate both EGFR and ErbB4, including heparin-binding EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin (28Harris R.C. Chung E. Coffey R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In addition to these “authentic” ErbB ligands, EGF-like sequences are present in many other proteins, including TSP1 (33Apella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEB. Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 34Schenk S. Hintermann E. Bilban M. Koshikawa N. Hojilla C. Khokha R. Quaranta V. J.

Griffith L. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), have been demonstrated to activate EGFR. EGFR not only responds to direct binding of EGF motif-containing ligands, but it can be transactivated by heterologous receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (36Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) and integrins (37Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Whether TSP1 elicits biological responses through EGFR and/or other ErbB receptors, either through direct binding or transactivation, is not known. Here, we provide evidence that the EGF-like repeats of TSP1 and other TSP family members, likely through an MMP-mediated indirect process, activate EGFR and that this activation is coupled to downstream signaling events and cellular responses that can explain aspects of TSP1 bioactivity. Human Intact TSP1 Preparation-Human platelet TSP1 was purified as described (24Goldblum S.E. Young B.A. Wang P. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1537-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh human platelets (Birmingham American Red Cross, Birmingham, AL) were thrombin-stimulated, and the platelet releasate was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) affinity column preequilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS-C: 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The bound TSP1 was eluted and applied to an A0.5 M gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with TBS-C, pH 7.4. Preparation of Recombinant TSP Proteins-Baculovirus-expressed recombinant human TSP1 domains were purified after secretion as described (38Misenheimer T.M. Huwiler K.G. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J.

These recombinant proteins (numbered from the initiating methionine of the full-length subunit) include the following: 1) the NH2-terminal heparin-binding domain + oligomerization domain + von Willebrand factor-C domain (aa 19-374) (NoC); 2) the von Willebrand factor-C domain + TSRs 1-3 (aa 312-548) (CP123); 3) TSR repeat 3 + EGF-like repeats 1-3 (aa 491-691) (P3E123); 4) EGF-like repeats 1-3 (aa 549-691) (E123); 5) EGF-like repeats 1 and 2 (aa 549-647) (E12); 6) EGF-like repeat 2 (aa 590-647) (E2); 7) EGF-like repeat 3 (aa 648-691) (E3); 8) EGF-like repeats 1-3 to the COOH terminus (aa 549-1170) (E123CaG); 9) the third EGF repeat to the COOH terminus (aa 648-1170) (E3CaG); and 10) the wire and COOH-terminal lectin-like domain (aa 692-1170) (CaG). In addition, two baculovirus-expressed TSP2 constructs, P3E123 (aa 493-693) and E123CaG (aa 551-1172), and two TSP-4 constructs, E1234 (aa 286-462) and E1234CaG, were prepared (40Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein concentration and purity were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient based on the amino acid composition and by PAGE in SDS with and without prior reduction. Cell Culture-Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (ATCC) enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 5 mm l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and vitamins in the presence of penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Sigma). Knockdown of EGFR and MMP9 through RNA Interference-Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex products designed to target EGFR and MMP9, as well as an irrelevant control duplex siRNA not corresponding to any known sequence in the human genome, were introduced into A431 cells (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) (41Gong P. Angelini D.J. Yang S. Xia G. Cross A.S. Mann D. Bannerman D.D. Vogel S.N. Goldblum S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13437-13449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). First, 5 × 105 A431 cells were centrifuged (200 × g, 10 min), after which the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of A431 Nucleofector solution (Amaxa Biosystems) and incubated with 4.0 μg of siRNA duplexes. The A431 cell/siRNA mixture was transferred to an Amaxa-certified cuvette and subjected to programmed electroporation (program X-001) (Amaxa Biosystems). The MMP9 siRNA-transfected cells were cultured for increasing times, and the supernatants were concentrated and assayed for MMP9 in an MMP9 ELISA kit (Calbiochem). At these same time points, the EGFR siRNA-transfected cells were lysed and processed for immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody (BD Biosciences). To confirm equivalent protein loading and transfer, blots were stripped with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, and reprobed with 0.5 ng/ml murine anti-physarum β-tubulin IgG2b (Roche Applied Science) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BD Transduction Laboratories) and again developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). EGFR Activation-To determine whether TSP1 activates EGFR, A431 cells were serum-starved for 6 h, after which they were exposed for 0.5 h to increasing concentrations of recombinant human EGF (R & D Systems, Inc), TSP1, or media alone, or they were exposed for increasing times to a fixed concentration of EGF (100 ng/ml or 16.7 nm), TSP1 (30 μg/ml or 214 nm), or media alone. In selected experiments, cells were pretreated for 2 h with the EGFR-selective tyrphostin, AG1478 (5 μm) (Calbiochem) (42Yaish P. Gazit A. Gilon C. Levitzki A.

In other experiments, A431 cells were transfected with EGFR or MMP9 targeting or control siRNAs. In still other experiments, A431 cells were exposed for 0.5 h to increasing concentrations of recombinant TSP1 domains or media alone or were exposed for increasing times to a fixed concentration (3.8 μg/ml or 214 nm) of TSP1 EGF-like repeats, i.e. E123 (aa 549-691) equimolar to native TSP1 at 30 μg/ml (214 nm). Finally, in one set of experiments, TSP1 (214 nm) was pre-incubated with either of two monoclonal antibodies raised against the EGF-like repeats, C6.7 and HB8432 (46Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A.

Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or a species- and isotype-matched antibody control, B7-1/CD80. Cells were thoroughly rinsed with ice-cold HEPES buffer and solubilized with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na2VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 500 μm paranitrophenol, and 1 mm phenylarsine oxide (all purchased from Sigma). The EC lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were probed with murine monoclonal anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr-1068) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) and developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm equivalent protein loading, blots were stripped and reprobed for β-tubulin. For each immunoblot, densitometric quantification of phospho-EGFR Tyr-1068 signal was normalized to the β-tubulin signal for the same lane on the same stripped and reprobed blot. Patterns of EGFR Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Response to EGF, TSP1, and E123-A431 cells were serum-starved for 6 h after which they were exposed to media alone, EGF (10 ng/ml or 1.67 nm, 10 min), native TSP1 (30 μg/ml or 214 nm, 0.5 h), or an equimolar concentration (3.8 μg/ml or 214 nm, 1 h) of TSP1 E123 (aa 549-691). The cells were lysed and the lysates processed for immunoblotting with a series of defined, epitope-mapped, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-EGFR antibodies that recognize Tyr-845, Tyr-992, Tyr-1045, and Tyr-1173 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) and Tyr-1086 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) all contained within the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR (27Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As stated above, a murine monoclonal antibody was use to probe for phospho-EGFR Tyr-1068. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-tubulin antibodies. Activation of PLCγ-A431 cells were cultured to ∼80% confluence in 6-well plates, serum-starved for 4 h, and incubated for increasing times with increasing concentrations of TSP1 or media alone. In selected experiments, cells were pretreated with the EGFR-selective tyrphostin, AG1478 (5 μm). In other experiments, cells were transfected with EGFR targeting or control siRNAs. In still other experiments, cells were exposed for 0.5 h to E123 (214 nm). Cells were lysed, and the lysates were resolved by 4-12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and blocked. The membranes were immunoblotted with rabbit anti-human phospho-PLCγ (Tyr-783) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) followed by goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated IgG (Pierce) and developed with ECL (48Kim J.W. Sim S.S. Kim U.-H. Nishibe S. Wohl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3940-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm equivalent protein loading and transfer, blots were stripped and reprobed for total PLCγ with rabbit anti-human PLCγ antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Migration Assay-A431 cells were cultured to confluence in the wells of 24-well plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY). Using a sterile 200-μl pipette tip, a single wound was made across the diameter of each monolayer, after which cell debris was removed by washing with HEPES as described (49Wang W. Passaniti A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated for 48 h with EGF (10 ng/ml or 1.67 nm), TSP1 (30 μg/ml or 214 nm), recombinant TSP1 E123 (3.8 μg/ml or 214 nm), or media alone, each in the presence or absence of the EGFR-selective tyrphostin, AG1478 (5 μm). In selected experiments, cells were transfected with EGFR-targeting or control siRNAs. At 48 h, images of each monolayer were captured using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope coupled to a Nikon Cool pix 4300 camera. Cell migration into the wound was calculated using Image J software (Rasband, WS, Image-J, National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov). To evaluate for AG1478-induced A431 cell cytotoxicity, A431 cells cultured to confluence in 96-well plates were incubated for 48 h with AG1478 (5 μm) or media alone. At 48 h, the media were removed, and the monolayers were washed and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (5 mg/ml PBS). The crystalline formazan product was solubilized for 16 h in 10% SDS, 0.01 n HCl, and A540 nm determined. Cross-competition Binding Studies-To determine whether E123 binds to the same receptor and/or same portion of the EGFR ectodomain as do high affinity EGFR ligands, binding of fluoroprobe-labeled EGF and E123 to suspended A431 cells was studied with flow cytometry. Purified recombinant E123 was dialyzed versus borate buffer (Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Unit, Pierce), reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) reconstituted in dimethylformamide, and again dialyzed to remove excess unconjugated FITC dye (EZ-Label FITC protein labeling kit, Pierce). A431 cells in fluorescence-activated cell sorter tubes (0.5-1.0 × 106 cells/tube) were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with increasing final concentrations of either FITC-EGF (Invitrogen) or FITC-E123. To define binding over time, A431 cells were incubated at 4 °C with either FITC-EGF (50 ng/ml) or FITC-E123 (2 μg/ml) for increasing times. To establish binding specificity, FITC-EGF (3 μg/ml) was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of unlabeled EGF (up to 500-fold relative to labeled ligand), and FITC-E123 (5 μg/ml) was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of unlabeled E123 (up to 500-fold relative to labeled ligand). Finally, cross-competition binding studies were performed using FITC-EGF with increasing concentrations of unlabeled E123 and FITC-E123 with increasing concentrations of unlabeled EGF. The cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences). Chemical Cross-linking Experiments-To establish a direct receptor-ligand interaction between E123 and cell surface-expressed EGFR ectodomain, E123 (3.8 μg/ml or 214 nm) and cells were co-incubated in the presence of the H2O-soluble, cell-nonpermeable, chemical cross-linking reagent, bis(sulfos-uccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Mr = 572.43) (Pierce) as described (50Ringerike T.

The two ends of this homobifunctional reagent cross-link amine groups and are separated by a flexible 11.4D spacer arm. A431 cells were serum-starved for 6 h, washed three times with ice-cold PBS (20 mm NaPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, in HEPES) to remove amine-containing media, and incubated for 0.5 h at 4 °C with E123 (3.8 μg/ml or 214 nm) or m"
https://openalex.org/W2148659964,"Cells adapt to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress by arresting global protein synthesis while simultaneously activating specific transcription factors and their downstream targets. These processes are mediated in part by the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. Following restoration of homeostasis protein synthesis is resumed when the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1 dephosphorylates and reactivates eIF2alpha. Proteasome inhibitors, used to treat multiple myeloma patients evoke ER-stress and apoptosis by blocking the ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins (ERAD), however, the role of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in leukemic cells under conditions of proteasome inhibitor-mediated ER stress is currently unclear.Bcr-Abl-positive and negative leukemic cell lines were used to investigate the functional implications of PP1-related phosphatase activities on eIF2alpha phosphorylation in proteasome inhibitor-mediated ER stress and apoptosis. Rather unexpectedly, salubrinal, a recently identified PP1 inhibitor capable to protect against ER stress in various model systems, strongly synergized with proteasome inhibitors to augment apoptotic death of different leukemic cell lines. Salubrinal treatment did not affect the phosphorlyation status of eIF2alpha. Furthermore, the proapoptotic effect of salubrinal occurred independently from the chemical nature of the proteasome inhibitor, was recapitulated by a second unrelated phosphatase inhibitor and was unaffected by overexpression of a dominant negative eIF2alpha S51A variant that can not be phosphorylated. Salubrinal further aggravated ER-stress and proteotoxicity inflicted by the proteasome inhibitors on the leukemic cells since characteristic ER stress responses, such as ATF4 and CHOP synthesis, XBP1 splicing, activation of MAP kinases and eventually apoptosis were efficiently abrogated by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide.Although PP1 activity does not play a major role in regulating the ER stress response in leukemic cells, phosphatase signaling nevertheless significantly limits proteasome inhibitor-mediated ER-stress and apoptosis. Inclusion of specific phosphatase inhibitors might therefore represent an option to improve current proteasome inhibitor-based treatment modalities for hematological cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2155055442,"L-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule that tethers leukocytes to the luminal walls of venules during inflammation and enables them to roll under the force of blood flow. Clustering of L-selectin during rolling is thought to promote outside-in signals that lead to integrin activation and chemokine receptor expression, ultimately contributing to leukocyte arrest. Several studies have underscored the importance of the L-selectin cytoplasmic tail in functionally regulating adhesion and signaling. Interestingly, the L-selectin tail comprises only 17 amino acids, and yet it is thought to bind simultaneously to several proteins. For example, constitutive association of calmodulin (CaM) and ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) to L-selectin confers resistance to proteolysis and microvillar positioning, respectively. In this report we found that recombinant purified CaM and ERM bound non-competitively to the same tail of L-selectin. Furthermore, molecular modeling supported the possibility that CaM, L-selectin, and moesin could form a heterotrimeric complex. Finally, using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer, it was shown that CaM, L-selectin, and ERM could interact simultaneously in vivo. Moreover, L-selectin clustering promoted CaM/ERM interaction in cis (i.e. derived from neighboring L-selectin tails). These results highlight a novel intracellular event that occurs as a consequence of L-selectin clustering, which could participate in transducing signals that promote the transition from rolling to arrest."

It is part of the inner layer of photosystem II antenna system retained in high light acclimated plants. To study the structure-function relation and the role of individual pigments in this complex, we (i) “knocked out” each of the chromophores bound to multiple (nine total) chlorophyll sites and (ii) exchanged the xanthophylls bound to the three xanthophyll sites. The occupancy and associated energy of the pigment binding sites were determined. The role of the individual pigments in protein folding, stability, energy transfer, and dissipation was studied in vitro. The results indicate that lutein has a primary role in the folding and stability of the complex, whereas violaxanthin and zeaxanthin have a negative effect on folding yield and stability, respectively. The data showed a distinct function for the L1 and L2 carotenoid binding sites, the former preferentially involved in gathering the excitation energy to chlorophyll a (Chl a), whereas the latter modulates the concentration of chlorophyll singlet excited states dependent on the xanthophylls bound to it, likely via an interaction with Chl-603. Our results also underscored the role of zeaxanthin and lutein in quenching the excitation energy, whereas violaxanthin was shown to be very effective in energy transfer.

Photosystems are composed of two moieties: (i) a reaction center devoted to the conversion of light energy into chemical energy and (ii) an antenna system that increases the capacity of light absorption and contributes to photoprotection (1Albertsson P.-A. Andreasson E. Svensson P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the antenna system is composed of members of a multigenic family called light-harvesting complexes (Lhc). In higher plants, 10 different subunits are associated with the photosystems, Lhca1-4 with PSI and Lhcb1-6 with PSII (2Jansson S.

Although the binding sites are conserved, their specificity for Chl a or Chl b can vary between different complexes. Conserved Chl a binding sites are located for the most part near helices A and B in the center of the structure, whereas the more peripheral sites differ in their affinity depending on the gene product (25Schmid V.H. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3619-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite their similarity in sequence and three-dimensional organization, distinct Lhc isoforms were conserved during evolution of the green lineage (26Alboresi A. Caffarri S. Nogue F. Morosinotto T. Bassi R. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3e2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and mutants lacking individual Lhc complexes show fitness reduction in a natural environment (27Ganeteg U. Kulheim C. Andersson J. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific function for each of them. For example, knock-out of Lhcb6 significantly affects non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a mechanism of heat dissipation of excitation energy absorbed in excess (28Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Annu.

Within this picture, the properties and specificity of the binding sites and the ability of polypeptide chains to tune the spectral properties of pigments have a fundamental role in determining the different functions of the Lhc proteins. Lhcb5 is a PSII antenna protein involved in photoprotection by quenching of Chl singlets (32Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R.

Furthermore, together with Lhcb4 and Lhcb6, Lhcb5 has been found capable of generating radical carotenoid cations involved in the qE mechanism, the energy-dependent quenching of excitonic energy (33Ahn T.K.

In this work we analyzed the properties of each pigment located in the binding sites of Lhcb5, to clarify the molecular basis of the physiological function of this protein. DNA Cloning, Mutations, and Isolation of Overexpressed Lhcb5 Apoprotein-cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding Lhcb5 (GenBank™ accession number AF134129) was supplied by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. Mature Lhcb5 was amplified and cloned in pQE-50 expression vector as described previously (32Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mutations were obtained as described (15Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange™site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Lhcb5 WT and mutant apoproteins were overexpressed in the SG13009 strain of Escherichia coli and purified following a protocol described previously (36Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 37Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuhlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Reconstitution in Vitro of Recombinant Lhcb5-Reconstitution and purification of recombinant Lhcb5 pigment-protein complexes were performed as described previously (13Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 83.3 μm carotenoids and 231.5 μm chlorophylls with a Chl a/b ratio of 3 were added to 13.9 μm apoprotein. Pigments were purified from spinach as described previously (38Goodwin T.W. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Plant Pigments. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1981: 3-18Google Scholar). For reconstitution with modified carotenoid composition the mixture was obtained from pure pigments either purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Chl a and Chl b) or purified by HPLC (xanthophylls). When more than one carotenoid was present in the pigment mix, all of the species were added in equal amounts. Pigment Analysis-HPLC analysis was performed according to Gilmore and Yamamoto (39Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio and Chl a/b ratio were measured independently by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments (17Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy-Room temperature absorption spectra were recorded using an SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m sucrose, and 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. The wavelength sampling step was 0.4 nm. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorimeter and corrected for the instrumental response. Differences between mutant absorption spectra were calculated after normalization to the chlorophyll stoi-chiometries as described by Bassi et al. (15Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quantum yields were calculated as the ratio between the emission spectra area (650-800 nm) and the absorption at 625 nm wavelength (5 nm bandwidth). This is the same wavelength (625 nm, 5 bandwidth) we employed for the excitation and was chosen because Chl a absorbs in this region, and thus the yield calculation was less affected by the different Chl a/b ratios in the samples. CD spectra were measured at 10 °C on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter using an R7400U-20 photomultiplier tube; samples were placed in the same solution described for absorption, with an OD of 1 at the maximum absorption peak in the Qy transition. The measurements were performed in a 1-cm cuvette. Denaturation temperature measurements were performed by following the decay of the CD signal at 682 nm when increasing the temperature from 20 to 80 °C with a time slope of 1 °C/min and a resolution of 0.2 °C. The thermal stability of the samples was determined by finding the t½ of the signal decay. Mutational Analysis of Chl Binding Sites-Chl binding residues were identified in the Lhcb5 sequence by comparison (2Jansson S.

The cDNA encoding Lhcb5 from A. thaliana was mutated at sequences encoding the putative Chl binding residues (Table 1) by substituting the nucleophilic residues with apolar amino acids unable to coordinate Mg2+. WT and mutant apoproteins were overexpressed in E. coli and reconstituted in vitro upon the addition of pigments. WT-Lhcb5 and seven mutants yielded stable reconstituted products and showed a monomeric aggregation state when analyzed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. In the case of four mutants, it was not possible to obtain stable products (see Table 1).TABLE 1Pigment binding properties of mutants in individual Chl binding residues Open table in a new tab To determine the nature and the spectroscopic properties of the pigments coordinated to the individual sites, the pigment content (Table 1) and the absorption spectra (Fig. 1) of the reconstituted mutants were measured and compared with those of the WT. The Chl a/b ratio of Lhcb5 WT from Arabidopsis is 2.1 ± 0.1, corresponding to the binding of six Chl a and three Chl b molecules for the proposed stoichiometry of nine Chl-protein molecules (10Dainese P. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8136-8142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Most of the mutants (with the exception of E65V/R181L and E129V) show a decrease in Chl a/b ratio, implying that Chl a is the ligand for the majority of the sites. Moreover, for all mutants but E129V, the ratio between lutein and neoxanthin is identical to that of the WT, suggesting that the mutations do not induce in first approximation a specific loss of xanthophylls, thus allowing normalizing of the chlorophyll content to the carotenoid content. Detailed results of the individual mutants are presented below. Mutant N179F (Chl-612)-The change in Chl a/b and Chl/Car ratios (Table 1) induced by the mutation are fully consistent with the loss of a single Chl a molecule, whereas the xanthophyll content is not affected by the mutation. The WT minus N179F difference absorption spectrum (Fig. 2A) indicates that Chl-612, which has a maximum at 682 nm at room temperature, is the red-most form of Lhcb5. As shown previously, similar absorption maxima were observed for Chl-612 in all Lhc complexes analyzed thus far (22Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol.

Mutants Q193L and H208L (Chl-613 and -614)-The pigment analysis (Table 1) suggests that both mutants lost one Chl molecule. Sites 613 and 614 are occupied mainly by Chl a, although the mutations induce a loss of a small amount of Chl b, suggesting that they are able to accommodate Chl b as well. In the difference spectra (Fig. 2, B and E) of both mutants, two major bands are visible at 665 and 678 nm; these can be attributed to the loss of interaction between these two Chl, which are indeed located close in the structure (5Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). An additional band at 655 nm accounts for the loss of Chl b. In both mutants we would expect to lose the excitonic interaction and gain a new absorption of the monomeric Chl still present in the complex (Chl-614 in the Q193L mutant and Chl-613 in the H208L mutant). This is consistent with the experimental data, where the same bands are present in both spectra. Moreover, the ratio between the bands in the two mutants is different, with mutant Q197L loosing more of its signal at 678 nm and mutant H208L losing more at 665 nm. The absence of a negative contribution in the difference spectra is expected based on a difference in band broadening between interacting and noninteracting Chl and on a similar distribution of the oscillator strength over the two bands. Moreover, the presence of Chl b in both sites strongly complicates the picture, because Chl a-Chl b interaction (and vice versa) is expected. These observations also imply that the shift in the site energy of the Chl induced by the interaction is rather small and that the site energy of these two chromophores differs substantially, with Chl-613 absorbing around 678 nm and Chl-614 at 665 nm. A very similar picture was found in Lhca1, Lhcb1, and Lhcb4 (15Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutant E65V/R181L (Chl-602)-Normalization to the carotenoid content indicates the loss of one Chl molecule (Table 1). However, this would mean that site 602 has a mixed occupancy (50:50 Chl a:Chl b), at variance compared with the other Lhc complexes, where this chlorophyll binding site was suggested to bind Chl a and the corresponding mutation led to a loss of carotenoids (15Bassi R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20612-20619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The specificity for Chl a of this site is likely to be essential for the mechanism of Lhc protein folding, which is initiated by Chl a and xanthophylls (41Horn R. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44400-44406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Horn R. Grundmann G. Paulsen H. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was proposed that during Lhc assembly in vivo, the first polypeptide-Chl a interaction involves a conserved motif, Glu-X-X-(His/Asn)-X-Arg, which corresponds to Chl binding sites 610, 612, 602, and 603 (43Hoober J.K. Eggink L.L. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 197-215Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 44Eggink L.L. Hoober J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9087-9090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that mutant E65V/R181L loses one Chl a and one Chl b (Table 1), with the Chl a accommodated in site 602. The second Chl affected by the mutation needs to have a high affinity for Chl b. In the difference absorption spectrum (Fig. 2C), in addition to the main contribution at 678 nm, two bands in the Chl b region were detected at 638 and 651 nm. Loss of Chl b upon mutation on the Chl-602 binding site was obtained also for Lhcb1 (21Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and Lhca1 (22Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In those cases it was suggested that the Chl b lost upon the mutation was Chl-611, which in the structure is the nearest Chl lacking a protein ligand (5Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). A similar interpretation also holds for Lhcb5, thus suggesting that Chl-602 and -611 in Lhcb5 are Chl a and b molecules, respectively. The presence of a second Chl b band in the difference spectrum is probably a consequence of an alteration on protein structure due to mutation on the ionic couple Glu-65/Arg-181. Because this ionic bridge is important for protein folding and stability, its absence might affect a second Chl b binding site. With the present data, we were not able to assess whether this secondary effect was only a perturbation in the absorption spectrum or the effective loss of pigment. Mutant H68F (Chl-603)-Normalization to the carotenoid content indicates the loss of one Chl molecule (0.8 Chl a and 0.2 Chl b). However, similar to the case for Chl-602, Chl-603 also belongs to the conserved “Chl a core,” suggesting that this mutation leads instead to the loss of two Chl molecules (1.4 Chl a and 0.6 Chl b). The nearest neighbor to Chl-603 is Chl-609, which is thus the best candidate for the second Chl lost in this mutant. The WT minus H68F absorption difference spectrum peaks at 678 nm. The peak is broad and cannot be fitted with a single Gaussian distribution but requires two of them, with maxima at 675 and 679 nm, respectively (Fig. 2D). The presence of two Chl a forms supports the hypothesis that more than one Chl a is affected by the mutation. A shoulder around 656 nm and a small contribution at 638 nm account for the loss of Chl b. Based on the hypothesis that this mutant is losing Chl-603 and -609, the absorption spectrum of Chl-603 can be obtained by the difference between the absorption of mutant E173V, which loses only Chl-609, and that of mutant H68F. The result indicates that Chl-603 has an absorption maximum at 675 nm, as is the case in Lhcb1 and Lhcb4 (21Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mutant E137V (Chl-609)-Pigment analysis suggests that this mutant loses one Chl and that the binding site has mixed occupancy (Table 1). A small loss of neoxanthin and lutein, probably from the N1 and L2 sites, was also observed. The difference absorption spectrum shows the Chl a component at 679"

Here, we identify protein kinase A (PKA) as a molecular switch that allows Gβ2γx dimers to effect voltage-independent inhibition of Cav3.2 channels. Inhibition requires phosphorylation of Ser1107, a critical serine residue on the II-III loop of the channel pore protein. S1107A prevents inhibition of unitary currents by recombinant Gβ2γ2 dimers but does not disrupt dimer binding nor change its specificity. Gβγ dimers released upon receptor activation also require PKA activity for their inhibitory actions. Hence, dopamine inhibition of Cav3.2 whole cell current is precluded by Gβγ-scavenger proteins or a peptide that blocks PKA catalytic activity. Fittingly, when used alone at receptor-selective concentrations, D1 or D2 agonists do not elicit channel inhibition yet together synergize to inhibit Cav3.2 channel currents. We propose that a dual-receptor regulatory mechanism is used by dopamine to control Cav3.2 channel activity. This mechanism, for example, would be important in aldosterone producing adrenal glomerulosa cells where channel dysregulation would lead to overproduction of aldosterone and consequent cardiac, renal, and brain target organ damage.

Inhibition of Cav2 channels by Gβγ dimers depends on voltage and can be modulated by protein kinase C (7Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P.

By contrast, LVA channels of Cav3 family have a less restricted distribution (9Talley E.M. Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Daud A. Perez-Reyes E. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1895-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are expressed in peripheral tissues (10Cribbs L.L. Lee J.H. Yang J. Satin J. Zhang Y. Daud A. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M.

They are prominently expressed in zona glomerulosa cells (ZG) of the adrenal gland (11Schrier A.D. Wang H. Talley E.M. Perez-Reyes E. Barrett P.Q. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C265-C272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where Cav3.2 channel activity controls the production of aldosterone. LVA channel currents are inhibited consistently by a host of GPCR-linked hormones (dopamine, enkephalin, nociceptin, bradykinin, somatostatin, and corticotrophin) (12Chemin J. Traboulsie A. Lory P. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Tao J. Hildebrand M.E. Liao P. Liang M.C. Tan G. Li S. Snutch T.P. Soong T.W. Mol.

In each of these examples, channel inhibition depends on Gβγ activity, yet an understanding of the molecular events required for channel inhibition remains incomplete. For instance, dopamine inhibits nickel-sensitive LVA calcium channel currents in sympathetic and dorsal root neurons (14Marchetti C. Carbone E. Lux H.D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

Yet, as typified in ZG cells, Gβγ alone is not sufficient to mediate channel inhibition transduced by dopamine, and conflicting data posits the singular importance of activating D1- or D2-receptor subtypes that produce opposing changes in the level of the intracellular messenger cAMP (20Drolet P. Bilodeau L. Chorvatova A. Laflamme L. Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 503-514PubMed Google Scholar, 21Osipenko O.N. Varnai P. Mike A. Spat A. Vizi E.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using a heterologous expression system, we recently described a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of LVA channels that involves heterotrimeric G-protein βγ dimers (22Wolfe J.T. Wang H. Howard J. Garrison J.C. Barrett P.Q. Nature. 2003; 424: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Unlike inhibition of HVA channels, inhibition of LVA channel activity by Gβγ dimers is independent of voltage, specific for Cav3.2/α1H channels within the LVA channel family, and requires active Gβγ dimers that contain Gβ2. Yet, like Gβγ-induced HVA channel inhibition, LVA channel inhibition depends on a direct interaction of Gβγ dimers with the channel protein. Accordingly, recombinant Gβ2γ2 dimers inhibit Cav3.2 single channel activity when applied to membrane patches excised from HEK293 cells (23DePuy S.D. Yao J. Hu C. McIntire W. Bidaud I. Lory P.

Here, we test the possibility that the described molecular mechanism for the inhibition of Cav3.2 channels underlies dopamine-induced inhibition of Cav3.2 currents. Our results reconcile previous findings yet are unexpected. They demonstrate that: 1) protein kinase A (PKA) acts as a molecular switch to enable the inhibition of Cav3.2 currents by Gβ2γ2 dimers, and 2) they highlight a role for a novel cooperative action of D1 and D2 receptors in controlling Cav3.2 calcium channel activity. Cell Culture and Transfection-H295R cells (human adrenocortical carcinoma cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 containing 10% cosmic calf serum, 1 μg/ml gentamicin. All culture vessels for H295R cells were coated with sterile 0.1% gelatin and washed with 1× (phosphate-buffered saline) before use. HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% pen/strep. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids for wild-type or mutant Cav3.2/Cav3.1 channels by using JetPEI reagent (Polyplus-transfection.com) and used for patching or immunoprecipitation 48 h after transfection. Electrophysiology-Cav3.2 currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments), and data collected with PCLAMP 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Data were analyzed by using Clampfit 9.2 (Axon Instruments) and OriginPro 7.5 (OriginLab) software. ANOVA was used for statistical examination with post hoc Dunnett's test, where significance was taken as p < 0.05. Average data are given as mean ± S.E. Whole Cell Recording-Steady-state channel activation was determined using tail currents in response to test depolarization in 5-mV increments (–60 mV to +10 mV) from a holding potential of –90 mV upon repolarization to –60 mV; steady-state channel inactivation was determined in response to +20 mV test depolarization (6 ms) from holding a potential incremented in 5 mV (–90 mV to –20 mV; 6 s) upon repolarization to –60 mV. To follow the time course of agonist-induced current inhibition, repetitive tail currents elicited upon repolarization to –75 mV from a test pulse of –15 mV were delivered every 6 s.

CHAPS and dithiothreitol were added to the bath solution to maintain the stability and solubility of Gβγ recombinant proteins. Purified Gβγ subunits were added directly to the bath solution. Channel openings were detected with a 50% threshold crossing criterion. Open probability (NPo) was calculated as the ratio of the sum of channel open time (per sweep) and the analyzed test pulse duration (23DePuy S.D. Yao J. Hu C. McIntire W. Bidaud I. Lory P.

Immunoprecipitation and Binding-HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Cav3.2 and Cav3.2 (S1107A) channels were stimulated with 10 μm 8-bromo-cAMP (10 min at 37 °C). Stimulation was terminated by snap-freezing dry-ice/methanol. Frozen cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (in mm: 150 NaCl, 25 Tris-HCl, 2 EDTA, pH 7.5, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.025 leupeptin, 0.025 aprotinin, 20 β-glycerolphosphate, 0.0005 microcystin, 10 pyrophosphate, 0.0001 vanadate) and 0.5% Triton-X (30 min, 4 °C). The lysate was centrifuged (5 min. at 10,000 × g), and the supernatant recovered. Four micrograms each of anti-Cav3.2 or goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc) were incubated with 2 mg of supernatant (2 h, 4 °C), before incubation with protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed (3×) with lysis buffer, and then (3×) with binding buffer (in mm: 140 K+-aspartate, 5 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.162 CHAPS (0.01%), and 0.04 dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 10 nm recombinant Gβ1γ2 or Gβ2γ2 (room temperature, 30 min.) in binding buffer (100 μl), and transferred to WIZARD minicolumns (Promega) for rapid washing (6×) with binding buffer. Immunoprecipitated channel and bound recombinant proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer at 80 °C. Samples were resolved by 4–15% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Gβ2γ2 and anti-Gβ1γ2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylation Assay-Recombinant GST fusion proteins of Cav3.2 II-III loop and deletion mutants were purified as previously described (26Yao J. Davies L.A. Howard J.D. Adney S.K. Welsby P.J.

Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by boiling in SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Phosphorylation levels were assessed by the Storm 820 Phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). PKA Activity Enables the Inhibition of Cav3.2 Unitary Currents by Gβ2γ2-In patches excised from HEK293 cells stably expressing Cav3.2 channels, recombinant Gβ2γ2 subunits reduce the frequency of Cav3.2 unitary openings (23DePuy S.D.

Here, we confirm these findings in HEK293 cells that are transiently expressing recombinant Cav3.2 channels. Calcium current was elicited from a holding potential of –90 mV by a depolarizing test pulse to –35 mV. Following patch excision, control activity was measured for 5–6 min during bath perfusion with vehicle, before the direct application of Gβγ subunits. At –35 mV, active calcium channels displayed varied patterns of small openings. As illustrated in Fig. 1A from an exemplar recording of an excised patch that may have more than one active channel, channel openings were abundant early in the record producing a transient ensemble averaged current consistent with time-dependent inactivation. Gβ2γ2 (1–2 nm) reduced (41%) the channel open probability (NPo) per sweep, a value calculated from the ratio of the total open time and the test pulse duration, and increased (193%) the number of silent/null sweeps (denoted by the solid circles). Surprisingly, these findings were not replicated in human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (NCI-H295R) transiently expressing recombinant human Cav3.2 channels. Rather, we observed that Gβ2γ2 failed to inhibit Cav3.2 single channel currents recorded from patches excised from unstimulated NCI-H295R cells; neither the single channel probability (NPo) per sweep, nor the number of silent sweeps was changed by the application of Gβ2γ2 (Fig. 1B). To reconcile these findings, we considered the possibility that activation of an additional second messenger system that remained quiescent in unstimulated H295R cells was required for current inhibition. A role for PKA in the regulation of LVA current is supported by numerous electrophysiological studies; however, the resulting alteration in channel activity seems context dependent and complex. PKA activity increases recombinant currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes (27Kim J.A. Park J.Y. Kang H.W. Huh S.U. Jeong S.W. Lee J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Accordingly, we considered the possibility that PKA mediated phosphorylation of the channel protein may be required for Gβ2γ2-mediated inhibition of Cav3.2 single channel currents. We treated H295R cells expressing Cav3.2 channels with 10 μm 8-Br-cAMP for 10 min prior to patch excision, and tested for inhibition. Gβ2γ2 markedly decreased NPo (diary plot, Fig. 1D) and concomitantly increased the number of silent sweeps. The Gβ2γ2-mediated decrease in sweep NPo averaged 35 ± 3% (n = 6) and was accompanied by a 131 ± 44% increase in the number of null sweeps. These changes in channel open probability were not elicited by Gβ1γ2 dimers (Fig. 1E) and were not complemented by changes in: the first latency to open (50.7 ± 4.9 ms (cAMP), 50.4 ± 0.6 ms (cAMP + β2γ2), the single channel conductance of (6.6 pS with 60 mm CaCl2), or the open-state distributions of dwell times, which remained fitted to the sum of two exponentials with unchanged proportions (cAMP + β2γ2: τ1 = 0.60 ± 0.14 ms (62%), τ2 = 2.61±.26 ms (38%) (supplemental Fig. S1). Nor did Gβ2γ2 alter the amplitude distribution of the test-pulse currents. Average midpoints for the primary conductance state (65% of openings) were not different from each other (–0.394 ± 0.004 pA, cAMP; –0.389 ± 0.005 pA, cAMP+ Gβ2γ2, at –35 mV). Hence, modulation of Cav3.2 single channel currents by Gβ2γ2 dimers in cAMP-stimulated model ZG cells displayed hallmark characteristics of native LVA currents (24Barrett P.Q. Lu H.K. Colbran R.

Dopamine Induces a Voltage-independent Inhibition of Cav3.2 Current That Requires Active Gβγ Dimers and PKA-Dopamine mediates its actions via two distinct classes of receptors: D1-like (D1, D5) that couple to the heterotrimeric G protein Gαs, and D2-like receptors (D2, D3, D4) that couple to Gαi/Gαo(37Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). D1-, and D2-like receptors (D2l/D2s and D4) receptors are expressed in the human and rodent adrenal cortex, and in human NCI-H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells (38Wu K.D. Chen Y.M. Chu T.S.

Because dopamine inhibits nickel-sensitive LVA currents in many native cells including the aldosterone producing ZG cell, we characterized inhibition of recombinant Cav3.2 channels transduced by endogenous dopamine receptors in H295R cells that lacked native Cav3.2 channel expression. Dopamine produced current inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B) that was slow in onset (Fig. 2A), depended on dose (1–50 μm; Fig. 2B), occurred at all test potentials (–45 to +15 mV; data not shown), and was not accompanied by either a change in the voltage-dependence of activation (Fig. 2C) or inactivation (Fig. 2D). Therefore, this scaled reduction in Cav3.2 whole cell calcium current in H295R cells by dopamine mimics the voltage-independent inhibition of current induced by Gβ2γ2 dimers in HEK293 cells (22Wolfe J.T.

Therefore, we perturbed dopamine signaling to determine whether cAMP and active Gβγ subunits are required for inhibition of Cav3.2 current by dopamine. We provided a “sink” for active Gβγ by transfecting H295R cells with either transducin, the sensory rhodopsin II Gα subunit, or βARKct, the C terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (40Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of either transducin or βARKct prevented the inhibition of Cav3.2 current induced by dopamine (Fig. 3A). Current levels remained indistinguishable from those of vehicle-treated cells transfected with empty vector (vehicle: 1.1 ± 1.5%, n = 8; βγ sinks combined: 6 ± 2.4%, n = 9). Because PKA plays a central role in dopamine signaling, and 8-Br-derivatives of cyclic nucleotides preferentially target nucleotide activated protein kinases (41Greengard P. Allen P.B. Nairn A.C.

Science Signaling [Electronic Resource]. 2008; 1: re4Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Inclusion of PKI in the patch pipette precluded channel inhibition induced by dopamine but failed to inhibit Cav3.2 channel current in vehicle-treated cells (vehicle: 2.7 ± 1.5%, n = 11; PKI: 0.4 ± 2.3%, n = 5; n.s.). Collectively, these data identify PKA as the cAMP effector and provide support for a cooperative role for active Gβγ subunits and PKA in the regulation of channel activity by dopamine. II-III Intracellular Loop Harbors a Critical PKA Phosphorylation Site for Channel Regulation-Inhibition of Cav3.2 channels by heterologously expressed Gβ2γ2 dimers depends on the intracellular loop that connects transmembrane domains II and III. Replacing the II-III loop of Cav3.2 channels with that of unregulated Cav3.1 channels prevents current inhibition (22Wolfe J.T. Wang H. Howard J. Garrison J.C. Barrett P.Q. Nature. 2003; 424: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To test the importance of the II-III loop in the regulation of LVA channels by dopamine, we evaluated the regulation of a chimeric Cav3.2 channel (Cav3.2 (Cav3.1 II-III) that contains the II-III loop from Cav3.1 channels. Each of three channel constructs: wild-type Cav3.1, wild-type Cav3.2, or chimeric Cav3.2, Cav3.2(Cav3.1 II-III) was transiently expressed in H295R cells and tested for dopamine-induced current inhibition (Fig. 4A).

Binding appears to involve the active site of EndoG. EndoGI is present in the cell nucleus at micromolar concentrations. Upon induction of apoptosis, levels of the inhibitor appear to be reduced, and it is relocalized to the cytoplasm. EndoGI, encoded by the predicted open reading frame cg4930, is expressed throughout Drosophila development.

The main enzyme responsible for apoptotic DNA degradation is CAD (or DFF40). CAD is controlled through its association with ICAD (or DFF45), which serves a dual function. First, ICAD plays a chaperone-like role for CAD; no functional CAD is produced without ICAD. Second, ICAD is an inhibitor of CAD. During apoptosis, ICAD is cleaved by caspases to liberate active CAD (1Parrish J.Z. Xue D. Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev.

During our studies of enzymes involved in mRNA deadenylation, we rediscovered EndoG through its ability to degrade poly(A). More interestingly, we found an endogenous protein inhibitor of EndoG in Drosophila. This inhibitor, which we termed EndoGI, is located in the cell nucleus. We present evidence suggesting that it protects the cell from chromosomal damage inflicted by EndoG in nonapoptotic cells. Plasmids-EndoGI, EndoG, and 14-3-3 ζ were amplified from cDNA clones 16I11, 21H12, and 66H2 (obtained from BACPAC; available on the World Wide Web), respectively. 14-3-3 ∈ was amplified from S2 cell cDNA. Appropriate restriction sites were introduced with the primers. 14-3-3 ∈ and ζ were ligated into the BamHI/KpnI sites, and EndoGI and its variants were ligated into the ClaI/EcoRI sites of the pRSET C vector (Invitrogen) in frame with an N-terminal His tag. For EndoGI deletion variants, artificial start or stop codons were introduced by PCR, and the products were cloned into pRSET C. For expression of nontagged EndoGI, the sequence encoding the His tag was removed from the pRSET C expression clone with NdeI and EcoRI. The EndoG coding sequence lacking the N-terminal 53 amino acids (EndoG ΔN53) was PCR-amplified with primers introducing an artificial start codon before codon 54 and appropriate restriction sites. The product was ligated into the NcoI/KpnI sites of pETM-11 (30Sauter C. Basquin J. Suck D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4091-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in frame with the N-terminal His tag. For the EndoG ΔN53 DAGA mutant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on full-length cDNA, an artificial start codon replacing amino acids 1–53 was then introduced by PCR, and the product was ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pRSET C in frame with the N-terminal His tag. For the bicistronic co-expression construct, EndoGI was amplified and ligated into the NcoI/EcoRI sites of pET21d (Novagen). EndoG ΔN55 was amplified with a 5′ primer introducing an EcoRI site, a ribosome binding site, and a start codon (5′-GTG AAT TCA ATA ATT TTG TTT AAC TTT AAG AAG GAG ATA TAC ATATGT TGA TTC CCG CCC AAG-3′) and a suitable 3′ primer and ligated into the EcoRI/NotI sites of the pET21d-endoGI expression construct in frame with a C-terminal His tag. For the full-length EndoG DAGA mutant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a full-length cDNA clone. The coding sequence was then amplified with a 3′ primer replacing the natural stop codon with a FLAG tag, followed by a stop codon and a suitable restriction site, and ligated into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of a pMT/V5-His C vector (Invitrogen). This vector allows expression in Drosophila S2 cells under the control of a Cu2+-regulated promoter. GFP-EndoGI fusions were made in the pAc5.1 vector (Invitrogen) containing the coding sequence for enhanced GFP (a gift from E. Izaurralde, Max-Planck-Institute, Tübingen, Germany). EndoGI coding sequences were amplified with primers introducing two EcoRI sites and removing the start codon. Products were ligated into the EcoRI-opened pAc5.1 enhanced GFP plasmid in frame with GFP. The fusion protein can be expressed in S2 cells under the control of a constitutive actin promoter. The intronless grim coding sequence was amplified from chromosomal DNA of Drosophila melanogaster w1118 with primers introducing restriction sites and a C-terminal FLAG tag and cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pMT/V5-His C. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Protein Purification-All column materials were from GE Healthcare except where noted. Preparation of S2 cell extract and DEAE chromatography have been described (31Temme C. Zaessinger S. Simonelig M. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2862-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fractions containing EndoGI were pooled and applied to a MacroprepS column. EndoGI was present in the flow-through. Ammonium sulfate was added to 40% saturation, and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Superose column. The EndoGI-containing fractions were further purified by hydroxyapatite (Biogel-HTP; Bio-Rad) and MonoQ chromatography. The pattern of protein bands was not changed by subsequent gel filtration on Superdex 200. DEAE column fractions containing EndoG were also pooled and applied to a MacroprepS column. Enzyme eluted from the column was further purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation (20% saturation), and Superdex 200 gel filtration. Further details of the procedures are available upon request. For expression of EndoGI, Escherichia coli BL21 Codon+ was transformed with the expression plasmid, grown at 37 °C in LB medium, and induced in midlog phase (A600 = 0.6) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was reduced to 25 °C. After 3 h, cells were harvested; washed with PBS; resuspended in ice-cold EndoGI buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 300 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin; and broken on ice by sonication. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Fractionation was carried out at 4–8 °C. Extracts were applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). After washing with EndoGI buffer containing 300 mm KCl and then with EndoGI buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, protein was eluted with EndoGI buffer containing 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were diluted with EndoGI buffer, applied to a MonoQ column, and eluted with a 20-column volume gradient from 50 to 500 mm KCl in EndoGI buffer. Fractions containing the overexpressed proteins were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation through Amicon ultracentrifugal filter (Millipore). 2 ml of this concentrated protein was applied to a 120-ml Superdex 200 preparation grade column equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. EndoGI variants and the 14-3-3 proteins were expressed according to the same procedure and purified by the same sequence of columns. For expression of EndoG, E. coli BL21 Codon+ was transformed simultaneously with the EndoG plasmid and the EndoGI plasmid lacking a his tag, and double selection with ampicillin and kanamycin was carried out. Cell growth (in the continuous presence of both antibiotics) and induction, lysis, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography were as described above. EndoG-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and an ammonium sulfate precipitation at 10% saturation was performed on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml phenyl-Superose column. The column was eluted by a descending ammonium sulfate gradient, and the peak fractions were pooled; dialyzed against 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2; and applied to a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column. EndoG was eluted with a 10-ml gradient to 0.2 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) in the same buffer lacking MgCl2. Titrations of purified EndoG with EndoGI under stoichiometric conditions suggested that about 30% of the protein was active. Partial activity of the enzyme was not due to residual EndoGI; none was detectable by Western blotting. For purification of EndoG ΔN53 DAGA, expression, cell lysis and centrifugation were done according to the same protocol. The pellet containing the majority of the desired protein was dissolved in urea buffer (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaH2PO4) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with urea buffer, and protein was eluted with urea buffer brought to pH 4.0 with HCl. Eluted proteins were diluted with urea buffer to below 0.5 mg/ml and renatured by dialysis in a cold room against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.7 m l-arginine overnight and then against the same buffer containing 0.4 m l-arginine for 12 h and finally against the same buffer lacking arginine overnight. The solution was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was concentrated and applied to a 120-ml Superdex 200 column. Co-expression of EndoG ΔN55 N187K and EndoGI from the bicistronic construct was done in BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene). Cells were grown in LB medium to midlog phase (A600 = 0.6) at 37 °C and cooled to 20 °C, and expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. Cells were harvested, suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap HP column equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a 10-column volume gradient to 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer; diluted into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgSO4,2 mm dithioerythritol; and loaded onto a MonoQ column. Whereas EndoGI bound to the column, EndoG was found exclusively in the flow-through and subsequently loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 2 mm dithioerythritol. Bound EndoG was eluted with a 20-ml gradient to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer and finally purified on Superdex 75 equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm dithioerythritol. Protein concentrations were determined photometrically, with extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid composition. Because EndoG ΔN53 was available at low concentration and not homogeneous, its concentration was estimated by densitometry of a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and comparison with a bovine serum albumin standard. The concentration of active EndoG was determined by a stoichiometric titration with EndoGI and was 30% of the chemical concentration. This may reflect a fraction of inactive protein, inaccuracy of the concentration measurement, or both. In the figure legends, both the chemical concentration and the concentration of active dimer are indicated. Activity Assays-Homogeneously labeled poly(A) was made by extension of an oligo(A) primer by poly(A) polymerase with [α-32P]ATP (32Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). L3pre-based RNAs were synthesized with [α-32P]UTP as described (33Kerwitz Y. Kühn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Size-fractionated poly(A) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase under standard conditions. For 3′ labeling, 9 pmol (3′-ends) of size-fractionated poly(A) was incubated with 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 2 pmol of bovine poly(A) polymerase as described (31Temme C. Zaessinger S. Simonelig M. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2862-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Poly(A)-degrading activity was assayed by the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble products from homogeneously labeled poly(A); 1 μl of protein sample was mixed at room temperature with 20 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm KCl) containing 20,000–50,000 cpm of homogeneously labeled poly(A) and 54 μm (mononucleotide concentration) of unlabeled poly(A) of heterogeneous size. The reaction was started immediately by incubation at 30 °C for the appropriate time. When required, EndoG and EndoGI were preincubated in the reaction mix for 90 min, and reactions were started by the addition of poly(A). Protein concentrations used are indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0). 75 μl of cold 16% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid were added immediately before centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the amount of acid-soluble nucleotides was determined by scintillation counting. Soluble radioactivity in a sample incubated without enzyme was subtracted as background. The in-gel activity assay used for the identification of EndoG was carried out as described (34LaGrandeur T.E. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) except that the reaction buffer was the one described above. The gel solution included 26 nm (as mononucleotides) of homogeneously labeled poly(A). For inhibition assays, EndoG and EndoGI were preincubated in the reaction mix for 90 min when necessary, and reactions were started by the addition of poly(A). Complete complex formation during the time of preincubation was experimentally verified. Protein concentrations used are indicated in the figure legends. Affinity of the EndoG-EndoGI interaction was determined by a titration of a fixed amount of EndoG with EndoGI or EndoGI variants. Results were fitted to Equation 1, Inhibition&percnt;=(cG0+I0+KD1)-(cG0+I0+KD1)2-4·cG0·I02·cG0·inhibition100&percnt;Eq. 1 where cG0 represents the initial concentrations of EndoG dimers, and I0 represents the initial concentrations of EndoGI monomers, respectively. KD1 is the dissociation constant of the complex. Since the concentration of active EndoG was not known precisely, a free fit of this parameter was allowed. However, the KD values obtained were quite insensitive to the concentration of EndoG. KD values are reported ± S.D. and are based on at least four independent titrations. The affinity of EndoG ΔN55 N187K (EndoG N187K for short) for EndoGI was determined by a competition (deinhibition) experiment in which a fixed amount of EndoG was mixed with increasing amounts of EndoG N187K before EndoGI was added, and the resulting nuclease activity was determined after complex formation. Curve fitting was based on the assumption that no mixed dimers were formed in the course of the experiment. The interaction of EndoG and EndoGI is characterized by a KD1 value of 0.2 pm, determined as above. The deinhibition approach revealed the KD2 value of the inactive variant EndoG N187K and EndoGI. Nuclease activity was measured at a substrate concentration of 53 μm (as mononucleotides; about Km). A competitive inhibition according to DIXON results in Equation 2, 1v=KmVmax·S0·KD1·I0-I0+cGvar0+KD22+(I0+cGvar0+KD2)24-I0·cGvar0+1Vmax·1+KmS0Eq. 2 where v represents the substrate turnover rate at a specified initial substrate concentration S0, Vmax is the maximum substrate turnover rate at saturating substrate concentrations, Km is the substrate concentration at half-maximum rate, I0 the initial concentration of EndoGI, and cGvar0 is the initial dimer concentration of the inactive EndoG N187K competing with EndoG for EndoGI binding. All measurements were performed at least in duplicate, and the data were averaged. Errors are the S.E. values resulting from data fitting. The rate constant of inhibitor release from the EndoG·EndoGI complex (koff) was determined by the gain in enzymatic activity after the addition of EndoG N187K to the preformed complex. EndoG N187K was used in excess to ensure the irreversibility of the reaction. Equation 3 describes the relationship (proportionality) of the reaction rate and the concentration of the active enzyme (deinhibited enzyme), where v(c) is the constant rate after attaining the equilibrium, and v(t) is the rate at time t. v(c)-v(t)v(c)=exp(-koff·t)Eq. 3 The product formation dependent on time yields the rate of the reaction. Integration of the differential equation following from Equation 3 yields the relationship of the time-dependent product formation and allows the determination of koff, P(t)=n+v(c)·t+v(c)koff·exp(-koff·t) where P represents the product concentration at time t, and n is the offset. The progress curve of the gain in substrate turnover was investigated considering the maximum turnover rate determined for a simultaneous incubation of all components and yielded a value koff of (2.66 ± 0.12)·10–6 s–1. The error indicated is the S.E. value of the parameter resulting from data fitting. Mass Spectrometry-For protein identification, excised bands were digested with trypsin (35Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H. Schierhorn A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20408-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by capillary liquid chromatography (Micromass), desalted online through a Symmetry300 C18 trap column (Waters), separated on a dC18 Atlantis NanoEase column (Waters), and analyzed on a Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with a modified nanoelectrospray ionization source to hold a pico-tip (New Objective). MS/MS measurements were done on doubly and triply charged ions. Data were searched against the MSDB data base with MASCOT (available on the World Wide Web). For the analysis of mutant EndoG, the protein was desalted with a ZipTip C4 (Millipore), and protein mass was determined with a Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer as described (35Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K.

A mass of 30,553 ± 3 Da was found, consistent with the predicted mass of the EndoG ΔN55 N187K mutant (30,550 Da compared with 30,536 Da for the wild-type protein). For peptide analysis, desalted mutant EndoG was digested with trypsin, peptides were reduced with DTT, and cysteines were alkylated with iodoacetamide. Peptide mass fingerprint spectra were recorded on an Ultraflex-II TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker) as described (35Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H. Schierhorn A. Beck-Sickinger A.G.

A peptide with a mass of 2329.43 ± 0.4 ([M + H]+) was found, corresponding to cleavage behind the mutant Lys187 (amino acids 168–187 with a carbamidom-ethylated Cys169). Data Base Searches-Homology searches were done with TBLASTN. Default parameters were used. Searches were carried out first with the complete sequence of D. melanogaster EndoGI and then with the consensus sequence obtained by an alignment of 24 homologous domains from the 12 EndoGI homologs identified in the first search. Analytical Ultracentrifugation-Proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with an Optima XL-A (Beckman Instruments) and an An50Ti rotor equipped with double sector cells. Sedimentation data were obtained at 10,000 rpm, 20 °C at a detection wavelength of 230, 280, or 290 nm. The apparent molecular masses of the protein samples were calculated using the software provided by Beckman Instruments; the density of the buffer was set to 1.026 ml/g due to glycerol content of the buffer. S.D. values are based on at least two different experiments, each analyzed at at least two different wavelengths. S2 Cell Culture-All procedures were as described (36Bönisch C. Temme C. Moritz B. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21818-21828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Immunological Procedures-Antibodies against EndoGI were generated by Eurogentec (Belgium). Other antibodies were as follows: monoclonal anti-tubulin clone DM 1A and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma); rabbit anti-rox2 (37Benoit B. Nemeth A. Aulner N. Kühn U. Simonelig M. Wahle E. Bourbon H.-M.

https://openalex.org/W1971071440,"Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major human health scourge and a key cause of mortality. Its pathogenicity partly results from the phenomenon of ""cytoadherence"" mediated by the PfEMP1 (Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) family. Extracellular domains of PfEMP1s are variable and bind various host endothelial receptors, whereas their cytoplasmic domains (VARCs) are relatively conserved. VARCs affix PfEMP1s in the human erythrocyte membrane by interacting with host cytoskeleton proteins and exported parasite proteins. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for PfEMP1 phosphorylation (on VARC) and propose an important function for this modification. Specific inhibitors and enhancers have been used to identify erythrocytic casein kinase II (CKII) as the enzyme responsible for VARC modification activity. We have also delineated probable CKII target residues on VARC, which mainly reside in an N-terminal acidic cluster. Our data show that VARC phosphorylation alters its binding to parasite encoded knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). Finally, we demonstrate reduced cytoadherence of infected RBCs to endothelial receptors like ICAM-1 and CSA (these contribute to cerebral and placental malaria, respectively) in response to their CKII inhibition. Collectively, this study furthers our understanding of VARC function, underscores the importance of erythrocytic CKII in cytoadherence, and suggests a possible new target for anti-cytoadherence molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1991462486,"A structural model of the NhaA dimer showed that a β-hairpin of each monomer combines to form a β-sheet at the periplasmic side of the membrane. By Cys scanning the entire β-hairpin and testing each Cys replacement for functionality and intermolecular cross-linking, we found that Gln47 and Arg49 are critical for the NhaA dimer and that K57C causes an acidic shift of 1 pH unit to the pH dependence of NhaA. Comparing the growth of the NhaA variants with the previously isolated β-hairpin deleted mutant (Δ(P45-N58)) and the wild type validated that NhaA dimers have an advantage over monomers in growth under extreme stress conditions and unraveled that during this growth the apparent Km for Na+ of Δ(P45-N58) was increased 50-fold as compared with the wild type. Remarkably, the effect of the extreme stress on the NhaA variants is reversible. Testing the temperature stability (4–55 °C) of the NhaA variants in dodecyl maltoside micells showed that the mutants impaired in dimerization were much less temperature-stable than the wild type.

A comparison between the three-dimensional crystal structure of NhaA monomers and the electron density map obtained by cryoelectron microscopy of the two-dimensional crystals (17Screpanti E. Padan E. Rimon A. Michel H. Hunte C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed a very good fitting of the monomers in the two crystal types. These results implied that the three-dimensional crystal structure of NhaA is native and allowed to get a high resolution structural model of the NhaA dimer (14Hilger D. Polyhach Y. Padan E. Jung H. Jeschke G. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 3675-3683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This model shows that the main contact between the monomers is built by the two β-hairpins of the monomers, forming a four-stranded β-sheet at the periplasmic side of the membrane. At the cytoplasmic side, only few residues in the cytoplasmic ends of TMS IX and TMS VII participate in the dimer interface.Recently, we have constructed a NhaA mutant, Δ(P45-N58), deleted of the β-hairpin (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26810-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Δ(P45-N58) protein exists exclusively in a monomeric form in the native membrane, proteoliposomes, and β-dodecyl-d-maltoside (DDM) micells. The NhaA monomers are fully active in isolated membrane vesicles and support growth of cells under the routinely stress conditions of growth, implying that the functional unit of NhaA is the monomer. However, under extreme stress conditions of growth, the wild type dimers were much more beneficial than the mutant monomers in conferring growth resistance (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26810-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results have suggested that the β-hairpin is needed for NhaA dimerization and that whereas the NhaA monomer is the functional unit of NhaA, the dimers are crucial for growth under extreme stress conditions.Nevertheless, several main questions have remained open: (i) Which amino acid in the NhaA β-hairpin is crucial for maintaining the NhaA dimers? (ii) How is the dimer constructed? These questions are particularly interesting because whereas β-sheet is a known common aggregation motif of soluble proteins, oligomerization motifs of membrane proteins are unknown. (iii) Why do the NhaA dimers confer upon the cells higher resistance to Na+ and Li+, as compared with the monomers? To answer these questions, we Cys replaced amino acid residues (each separately and in combination) in the NhaA segment Pro45–Asn58, which comprises the β-hairpin of NhaA, and studied the mutations with respect to cell growth under various growth conditions, Na+/H+ antiporter activity at physiological pH, intermolecular cross-linking, aggregation state, and the ability to provide temperature stability to the NhaA molecule in detergent micells and in situ in the membrane. We found that the NhaA dimers are critically dependent on the β-sheet and are crucial for NhaA stability under extreme stress conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Culture Conditions-EP432 is an E. coli K-12 derivative, which is melBLid, ΔnhaA1::kan, ΔnhaB1::cat, ΔlacZY, thr1 (4Pinner E.

The antibiotics used were 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 50 μg/ml kanamycin. To test the resistance to Li+ and Na+, EP432 cells transformed with the respective plasmids were grown on LBK to A600 of 0.5. For growth on agar, samples (2 μl) of serial 10-fold dilutions of the cultures were spotted onto agar plates containing the routine selective media (modified LB medium containing 0.6 m NaCl at pH 7 or 8.3 or 0.1 m LiCl at pH 7) and incubated for 2 days. When indicated, more extreme stress conditions (0.1 m LiCl at pH 8.3 or 8.5) were used. For growth in liquid culture, the routine selective medium was as above, and when indicated, more extreme stress conditions were used (0.7 or 0.8 m at pH 8.4).Plasmids-Plasmid pGM36 encodes NhaA (21Karpel R.

All of the plasmids carrying mutations are designated by the name of the plasmid followed by the mutation.Site-directed Mutagenesis-Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted following a polymerase chain reaction-based protocol (25Ho S.

Mutant E54C on pCL-AXH3 background was obtained by ligating the EcoRI-BglII fragment (465 bp) with EcoRI-BglII fragment (4.3 kb) of the plasmid pCL-AXH3. To generate the triple mutant Q47A/L48A/R49A pAXH3 was used as a template. Mutant S52C was described previously in Ref. 12Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. Mutants P247C, A248C, and L255C were described previously in Ref. 27Tzubery T. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol.

The double mutant Δ(P45-N58)-L255C was obtained on a pCL-AXH3 background by ligating the BglII-MluI fragment (682 bp) with BglII-MluI fragment (4.08 kb) of plasmid pCL-AXH3. All of the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of the entire gene, through the ligation junction with the vector plasmid.Isolation of Membrane Vesicles, Assay of Na+/H+ Antiporter Activity-EP432 cells transformed with the respective plasmids were grown, and everted vesicles were prepared and used to determine the Na+/H+ or Li+/H+ antiporter activity as described (28Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The assay of antiporter activity was based upon the measurement of Na+ or Li+ induced changes in the ΔpH as measured by acridine orange, a fluorescent probe of ΔpH. The fluorescence assay was performed with 2.5 ml of reaction mixture containing 50–100 μg of membrane protein, 0.5 μm acridine orange, 150 mm KCl (or choline chloride), 50 mm 1,3-bis-{tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino} propane, and 5 mm MgCl2, and the pH was titrated with HCl. After energization with either ATP (2 mm) or d-lactate (2 mm), quenching of the fluorescence was allowed to achieve a steady state, and then either Na+ or Li+ was added. A reversal of the fluorescence level (dequenching) indicates that protons are exiting the vesicles in antiport with either Na+ or Li+. As shown previously, the end level of dequenching is a good estimate of the antiporter activity (30Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the concentration of the ion that gives half-maximal dequenching is a good estimate of the apparent Km of the antiporter (30Schuldiner S.

The concentration range of the cations tested was 0.01–100 mm at the indicated pHs, and the apparent Km values were calculated by linear regression of a Lineweaver-Burk plot.Detection and Quantifying NhaA and Its Mutated Derivatives in the Membrane-Total membrane protein was determined according to Ref. 32Bradford M.M.

Membranes (300 μg of membrane protein) were resuspended in a buffer (0.5 ml) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, and one of the freshly prepared homobifunctional cross-linkers: 2 mm 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH; Pierce), 1 mm N,N-o-phenylenedimaleimide (o-PDM; Sigma), or 2 mm MTS-2-MTS (Toronto Research Chemicals). The stock solutions of the cross-linkers were prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide so that the amount of N,N-dimethylformamide in the reaction mixture did not exceed 1%, a concentration that does not affect the antiporter activity. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature with gentle rotation for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the case of the maleimides (BMH and o-PDM) or by dilution in a TSC buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 140 mm choline chloride) in the case of MTS-2-MTS and centrifugation (Beckman, TLA 100.4, 265000g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was added to 50 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and incubated with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice in binding buffer (22Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y.

The sample buffer contained 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7, 0.015% DDM, and 10% glycerol. The cathode buffer contained Coomassie Blue 0.02% (G 250; Merck), and 0.015% DDM was added to both the anode and cathode buffers. The electrophoresis was conducted at 15 mA for 1 h. The gel was stained by Coomassie Blue or silver-stained and dried, and the band densities were determined as above.The Effect of MTSES on Mobility of on BN-PAGE-High pressure membranes were incubated with 10 mm MTSES at room temperature with gentle shaking for 20 min. Then the reaction was stopped by dilution into 3 ml of TSC buffer and centrifuged (Beckman, TLA 100.4, 265,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The protein was extracted and affinity-purified on Ni+2-NTA as described before (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Padan E. J. Biol.

J. 2007; 93: 3675-3683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). According to this model, β-hairpins of two NhaA monomers form a β-sheet that participates in the dimer interface. To identify specifically which residues in the β-hairpin contribute to the dimer interface in the native membrane, we constructed Cys replacement mutations of all the amino acid residues in the β-hairpin (Pro45–Asn58) (Fig. 1A). The mutants were constructed in Cys-less NhaA (CL-NhaA), a variant that is as expressed and active as the native NhaA (22Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We also constructed a triple mutant Q47A/L48A/R49A on a wild type background.To characterize the mutations with respect to expression, growth, and antiporter activity, the mutated plasmids were transformed into EP432, an E. coli strain that lacks the two Na+ specific antiporters (NhaA and NhaB). This strain neither grows on the routine selective medium (0.6 m NaCl at pH 7 or pH 8.3 or 0.1 m LiCl at pH 7) nor exhibits any Na+/H+ antiporter activity in isolated everted membrane vesicles, unless transformed with a plasmid encoding an active antiporter (reviewed in Refs. 1Padan E.

Acta. 2005; 1717: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar).Whereas mutant S52C was expressed to only 10% of the control level (Table 1), all other mutants were expressed to above 34%, as compared with the level of expression of the wild type (100%). Notably, because all mutants are expressed from multicopy plasmids, the expression level of the mutants is way above the level expressed from a single chromosomal gene (34Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression level was expressed as a percentage of the control cells (EP432/pCL-AXH3). Growth experiments were conducted on agar plates with high Na+ (0.6 m) or high Li+ (0.1 m) at the pH values indicated. +++, control: number and size of colonies after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C is similar to that of wild type on LBK; ++, number of colonies after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C at alkaline pH is similar to that of the control but the colony size was smaller; +, both size and number (1 order of magnitude) smaller than the control; –, no growth. Na+/H+ and Li+/H+ antiporter activity at pH 8.5 was determined with 10 mm NaCl or LiCl. The activity (level of dequenching) is expressed as a percentage of the positive control (EP432/pCl-AXH3). EP432/pBR322 served as a negative control.

The variants Q47C and L48C grew both on LBK and on the routine Na+ selective media less efficiently than the wild type (Fig. 2A and Table 1). On the Li+ routine selective plates, only the growth of S52C was impaired, most likely because of its low expression (Table 1). The rest of the Cys replacement mutants grew similar to the wild type on the routine selective media (Table 1). The triple mutant Q47A/L48A/R49A grew on LBK agar plates (Fig. 2A) and on the routine Na+ selective plates very similar to the wild type (Table 1).FIGURE 2Growth characteristics of wild type and mutants Q47C, L48C, R49C, and Q47A/L48A/R49A under extreme stress conditions with respect to concentration of Li+, Na+, and pH.

https://openalex.org/W2051200740,"The activity of the nitrogenase enzyme in the diazotroph Azospirillum brasilense is reversibly inactivated by ammonium through ADP-ribosylation of the nitrogenase NifH subunit. This process is catalyzed by DraT and is reversed by DraG, and the activities of both enzymes are regulated according to the levels of ammonium through direct interactions with the P(II) proteins GlnB and GlnZ. We have previously shown that DraG interacts with GlnZ both in vivo and in vitro and that DraT interacts with GlnB in vivo. We have now characterized the influence of P(II) uridylylation status and the P(II) effectors (ATP, ADP, and 2-oxoglutarate) on the in vitro formation of DraT-GlnB and DraG-GlnZ complexes. We observed that both interactions are maximized when P(II) proteins are de-uridylylated and when ADP is present. The DraT-GlnB complex formed in vivo was purified to homogeneity in the presence of ADP. The stoichiometry of the DraT-GlnB complex was determined by three independent approaches, all of which indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry (DraT monomer:GlnB trimer). Our results suggest that the intracellular fluctuation of the P(II) ligands ATP, ADP, and 2-oxoglutarate play a key role in the post-translational regulation of nitrogenase activity."

Several well characterized solute-specific transport systems in this group have at least one irreplaceable acidic residue that plays a critical role in energy coupling during transport. Previous studies have established the importance of acidic residues in substrate recognition by major facilitator superfamily secondary multidrug transporters, but their role in the transport mechanism remained unknown. We have been investigating the involvement of acidic residues in the mechanism of MdfA, an Escherichia coli secondary multidrug/proton antiporter. We demonstrated that no single negatively charged side chain plays an irreplaceable role in MdfA. Accordingly, we hypothesized that MdfA might be able to utilize at least two acidic residues alternatively. In this study, we present evidence that indeed, unlike solute-specific secondary transporters, MdfA tolerates displacements of an essential negative charge to various locations in the putative drug translocation pathway. The results suggest that MdfA utilizes a proton translocation strategy that is less sensitive to perturbations in the geometry of the proton-binding site, further illustrating the exceptional structural promiscuity of multidrug transporters.

One central mechanism of bacterial drug resistance involves extrusion of drugs from the cell by membrane transporters (1Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Nature. 2007; 446: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The bacterial Mdr transporters fall into one of five families, of which the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary transporters is the largest (10Saier Jr., M.H. Paulsen I.T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Being abundant in the genomes of many bacterial strains, the MFS-Mdr transporters pose intriguing mechanistic and evolutionarily related questions (e.g. Refs. 11Neyfakh A.A. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and 12Krulwich T.A. Lewinson O. Padan E. Bibi E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several of these questions are being investigated utilizing MdfA from Escherichia coli (13Sigal N. Cohen-Karni D. Siemion S. Bibi E. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 11: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as a model for secondary Mdr transporters.MdfA (14Edgar R. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2274-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), encoded by the cmr gene (15Nilsen I.W. Bakke I. Vader A. Olsvik O. El-Gewely M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3188-3193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a 410-amino acid residue-long membrane protein with 12 transmembrane helices. Close homologues of MdfA have so far been identified mainly in pathogenic bacteria (for review, see Ref. 13Sigal N. Cohen-Karni D. Siemion S. Bibi E. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 11: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells expressing MdfA from a multicopy plasmid exhibit multidrug resistance against a diverse group of structurally and electrically dissimilar lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds including cationic and electrically neutral drugs (14Edgar R.

Transport experiments have shown that MdfA is driven by the proton electrochemical potential, and in addition to its drug/proton exchange activity, it may also function as a (Na+)(K+)/proton antiporter (14Edgar R. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2274-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Mine T. Morita Y. Kataoka A. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem.

Clearly, therefore, proton translocation by MdfA is crucial for all of its known functions in the cell.Of all the open mechanistic questions regarding the function of MFS-Mdr transporters, the question of multidrug recognition has been characterized in detail (9Higgins C.F. Nature. 2007; 446: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 20Lewinson O. Adler J. Sigal N. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the mechanism underlying active transport remained the least understood. Specifically, although they are crucial for their drug/proton antiport activity (18Lewinson O. Adler J. Poelarends G.J. Mazurkiewicz P. Driessen A.J. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), very little is known about proton recognition and translocation by MFS-Mdr transporters. In this regard, studies of several specific secondary transporters have been instrumental in providing clues for determining how protons may be recognized. The best example is the lactose/proton symporter, LacY, where two carboxyl side chains play irreplaceable roles in proton-coupled sugar translocation (21Guan L. Kaback H.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Similarly, negatively charged residues are mechanistically involved in other antiporters and symporters (22Yamaguchi A. Nakatani M. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8344-8348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Pourcher T. Zani M.L. Leblanc G. J. Biol.

Hirayama B.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13175-13184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Stimulated by these studies, we have examined the role of acidic residues in MdfA. Surprisingly, we observed that no single acidic residue plays an irreplaceable role in drug resistance and transport by MdfA, although several are important for electrostatic interaction with cationic substrates (28Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Sigal N. Molshanski-Mor S. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This observation elicited several hypotheses, regarding the mechanism of proton recognition by MdfA. We tested the possibility that at least two acidic residues might be utilized alternatively. The results described here not only support this idea but also reveal an additional level of promiscuity, suggesting that a functionally critical negative charge still works even when moved to alternative locations inside the putative multidrug translocation pathway of MdfA.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Plasmids-E. coli UTmdfA::kan or its derivative UTLmdfA::kan 3R. Edgar and E. Bibi, unpublished data. with plasmid pT7-5/mdfA-His6 were used for resistance, expression, transport assays (28Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and library selection (see below).Drug Resistance Assays-Drug resistance was assayed using solid media, as described previously (16Adler J. Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with the antibiotics ampicillin (200 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) to 1.0 A600 units. A series of 10-fold dilutions was prepared, and 4 μl of each dilution were spotted on plates containing different concentrations of the test drug. Colonies were recorded after 16–24 h of incubation at 37 °C. For selective screening of MdfA mutant libraries, cells were transformed by electroporation with the plasmid library and seeded on plates supplemented by lethal concentrations of the test drug. Resistant colonies were isolated after 30 h at 37 °C.Expression Analysis by Western Blotting-Overnight cultures were diluted and grown to an A600 of 1 unit. Bacteria were harvested, and membranes were prepared as described previously (30Bibi E. Gros P. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9209-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions (5–10 μg of protein) were then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotting, and detection using India HisProbe-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).Transport Assays-EtBr efflux assays were conducted as described (28Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), with modifications. Overnight cultures were diluted to 0.04 A600 units, grown at 37 °C to 1.0–1.2 A600 units, and kept on ice. Aliquots of cells (0.3 A600 units) were pelleted, resuspended in 2 ml of HEPES buffer (25 mm, pH 6.5), and loaded with EtBr (5 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (100 μm). Loaded cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in the same buffer containing EtBr (5 μm) without carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, and subjected to fluorescence measurements. After ∼1 min in the fluorometer, glucose was added (to 0.4%), and EtBr efflux was monitored continuously by measuring the fluorescence, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 620 nm, respectively. For TPP and chloramphenicol uptake assays, harvested cells (0.6 A600) were washed once with potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.5) and 1 mm MgSO4, resuspended in the same buffer at 10–15 A420 units, and divided (50-μl aliquots). Following 2 min of recovery at 37 °C in the presence of 0.2% glucose, transport was initiated by the addition of [3H]chloramphenicol (5 μm) or [3H]TPP (50 μm). Transport was terminated by rapid filtration as described previously (14Edgar R. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2274-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).Measurement of Substrate Binding-E. coli UTLmdfA::kan transformed with plasmid pT7-5/araP/mdfA-His6 encoding the indicated mutants were grown, and membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (31Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For each experiment, 200 μl of membranes (containing 15 mg/ml protein) were quickly thawed in 37 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 200,000 × g. The membrane pellet was resuspended and homogenized in 1.9 ml of ice-cold 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. Next, for each reaction, 40 μl of membranes were mixed with 10 μl of 25 mm TPP or water, and binding was carried out by 30 min of incubation at room temperature. Samples were then stored on ice. Cysteine labeling was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of maleimide-polyethylene glycol (Mal-PEG) (5 kDa) and 3 min of incubation at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 60 mm dithiothreitol and 10 min of incubation on ice. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. The reaction product appeared as a slower migrating MdfA-Mal-PEG band.Construction of MdfA Mutant Library-Plasmid pT7-5/mdfA-His6 was modified to carry a NotI site before the His6 tag coding sequence at the 3′ end of mdfA and a NcoI site at the 5′ end, which resulted in a Q2A mutation. The modified gene (termed pT7-5/mdfA-His6) was examined for MdfA expression and function and found to be indistinguishable from wild type MdfA. Wobble base PCR (20 cycles with Bioline Taq polymerase) was performed using primers: sense 5′-gaaagcgtagctatactcg-3′ and antisense 5′-gacagatcgatgagatagg-3′ with 3 ng of pT7-5/mdfAHis6(E26T/D34M) in the presence of 0.02 mm 8-oxo dGTP and 1.5 mm MgCl2. Following DpnI treatment and DNA purification, a second PCR was performed with the same primers. The purified product (150 ng) was overdigested (20 h) with NotI and NcoI and ligated to a NotI/NcoI-digested plasmid, which carries an irrelevant gene instead of mdfA (100 ng). E. coli UTLmdfA::kan was transformed by the ligation products and seeded on ampicillin-supplemented plates. About 105 colonies were collected, and a plasmid library was prepared.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONConstruction and Characterization of Double Mutants of MdfA-The results of individual neutralizations of acidic residues in MdfA (29Sigal N. Molshanski-Mor S. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were surprising because they raised the possibility that as an Mdr transporter, MdfA functions in a manner that is different from other known secondary transporters (both symporters and antiporters) driven by the ion electrochemical gradient, where the mechanism involves at least one essential acidic residue. Therefore, we hypothesized that either (i) proton recognition and translocation by MdfA does not require acidic residues, or alternatively, (ii) two or more acidic residues may substitute for each other. To approach the second possibility, we chose to focus on two, putatively membrane-embedded acidic residues, Glu-26 and Asp-34. Previous studies showed that each of these acidic side chains is important for transport of cationic substrates but not neutral ones (28Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Sigal N. Molshanski-Mor S. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As controls, we utilized two additional acidic residues, Glu-45 and Asp-52, in the putative periplasmic loop 1. Altogether, six double mutants were constructed by neutralizing combinations of the chosen acidic residues with cysteines (Fig. 1A). The single and double mutants were tested for expression (Fig. 1B) and ability to confer multidrug resistance against positively charged (EtBr, benzalkonium, erythromycin) and neutral (chloramohenicol, thiamphenicol) compounds (Fig. 1C). The results show that replacement of only one specific set of acidic residues (E26C/D34C) abrogated MdfA-mediated resistance to all the test drugs (see also supplemental Table 1S). Next, the EtBr and chloramphenicol transport activity of each double mutant was assayed. As expected from the results of resistance experiments, none of the double mutants catalyzed efflux of the cationic substrate EtBr (not shown), further illustrating the importance of electrostatic interactions in the multidrug recognition pocket of MdfA (28Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, several of the mutants retained chloramphenicol transport activity (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, although all the D34C-harboring double mutants are severely defective in their chloramphenicol resistance and transport activity, only mutant E26C/D34C had lost all of its tested functions, including resistance to thiamphenicol. Of all the other mutants, D34C/E45C was also severely impaired; however, introducing another neutralizing mutation at position 34 (D34M/E45C) did not abolish resistance (supplemental Fig. S1). To further evaluate the suggestion that neutralizing Glu-26 and Asp-34 simultaneously is detrimental, in addition to the cysteine replacement described earlier, we characterized other double E26X/D34Z mutants (Fig. 2), including the two combinations of the most active single substitutions E26Q and E26T with D34M. As shown, all the single mutants retained some resistance activity. In contrast, although the double mutants were expressed at levels comparable with that of wild type MdfA (Fig. 2, A and C), none of them was able to support growth on drug-supplemented plates (Fig. 2, B and D). These results demonstrate that individually, the acidic residues at position 26 and 34 play important roles in cationic substrate recognition but are not essential for transport activity (as shown with neutral substrates). The detrimental effect of neutralizing both sites simultaneously suggests that membrane-embedded acidic residues might play an essential role in MdfA and that this role can be alternatively fulfilled by either Glu-26 or Asp-34. However, the loss of function could also reflect improper folding of the double mutant.FIGURE 2Characterization of 26/34 double mutants of MdfA. A and C, Western blot analysis of expression.

To this end, we utilized a mutant of MdfA that is devoid of any native cysteines and contains a single cysteine at position 54 (single Cys-54) (31Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In control experiments, we observed that binding of TPP to Cys-less MdfA Cys-54 stimulated the reactivity of residue Cys-54 with the cysteine-reactive label, Mal-PEG (Fig. 3). This increase in cysteine reactivity indicates that substrate binding induces a conformational change in MdfA that is accompanied by exposure of Cys-54 to the aqueous solvent (31Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As observed previously (31Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), chloramphenicol did not have a detectable effect of labeling. In contrast to Cys-less MdfA Cys-54, TPP did not stimulate labeling of residue Cys-54 in the inactive MdfA R112M mutant, suggesting that TPP-induced stimulation requires a functional transporter (Fig. 3). Notably, a faster migrating band is more pronounced in the sample of inactive R112M mutant, possibly representing a degradation product, an indication that this mutant might indeed be structurally impaired. Studying the reactivity of single Cys-54 also carrying simultaneously E26T and D34M mutations showed that TPP does stimulate the reactivity of Cys-54 in this mutant, suggesting that it is correctly folded and conformationally responds to the substrate (Fig. 3). These results suggest that mutating Glu-26 and Asp-34 does not have a detrimental structural effect on MdfA. Therefore, considering the mechanisms of other secondary transporters, we propose that proton recognition and translocation by MdfA may be mediated through either Glu-26 or Asp-34.FIGURE 3Effect of TPP on single cysteine labeling in various MdfA mutants. A, membranes from cells overexpressing the indicated single cysteine mutant were incubated with or without TPP (T) or chloramphenicol (C) and then with maleimide-PEG. The labeled product appeared as a slower migrating band in SDS-PAGE as probed by Western blotting. The results shown are representative, B, TPP binding is indirectly deduced from its quantified stimulatory effect on labeling. Averages and standard errors of the mean (bars) from three independent experiments are shown for the experiments ± TPP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Displacement of an Essential Acidic Residue by Site-directed Mutagenesis-If our proposal that Glu-26 and Asp-34 are able to act alternatively as mediators of proton-coupled antiport by MdfA is true, then it must mean that unlike in solute specific secondary transporters, the exact location of the negative charge in the transport pathway of MdfA may not be critical. To test this, we first examined whether an acidic residue can be functionally placed in between and instead of the acidic residues at positions 26 and 34. Accordingly, several mutants of MdfA(E26Q/D34M) were characterized. All the mutants were expressed in the membrane fraction at levels similar to that of wild type MdfA (Fig. 4A), but only two, E26Q/T29E/D34M and E26Q/G32E/D34M, reproducibly showed a low resistance activity against thiamphenicol (Fig. 4B). The orientation of the newly inserted acidic residues (T29E and G32E) with respect to the putative translocation pathway is different from that of Glu-26 or Asp-34 (Fig. 4C), thus offering a reasonable explanation for why the mutants exhibit such a low resistance activity.FIGURE 4Characterization of the E26Q/D34M triple mutants of MdfA with engineered acidic residue in transmembrane helix 1.

This was accomplished by utilizing the inactive double MdfA mutant E26T/D34M as a template for construction of a library of MdfA mutants by error-prone PCR (see “Materials and Methods”). Cells transformed with the library were plated on LB agar plates supplemented with thiamphenicol (10 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (3 μg/ml). Two resistant colonies out of ∼10,000 were isolated, and the purified plasmids were characterized by retransformation and sequenced along the entire mdfA gene. In addition to the original E26T/D34M replacements, both mutants had two mutations: A150E/I327L (isolated from thiamphenicol plates) and A150E/S309P (isolated from chloramphenicol plates). Next, each of the new mutations was individually subcloned into the double mutant E26T/D34M, and the resulting triple mutants were tested as above. The results show that all the mutants were expressed (Fig. 5A) and that only mutants containing the A150E substitution conferred significant resistance against several of the test drugs (Fig. 5B). Notably, although single mutants neutralized at positions 26 or 34 are unable to transport cationic substrates (29Sigal N. Molshanski-Mor S. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the new mutants with a single negative charge at position 150 also regained function against positively charged substrates, such as TPP. Therefore, introduction of a negative charge at position 150 (instead of Glu-26 and Asp-34) restores both the transport activity and the proposed electrostatic interaction with cationic substrates (28Edgar R. Bibi E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structural model of MdfA (32Sigal N. Vardy E. Molshanski-Mor S. Eitan A. Pilpel Y. Schuldiner S.

To evaluate the activity of the new mutants further, transport assays were conducted with the respective cationic and neutral substrates TPP and chloramphenicol. Fig. 6 shows that, as with wild type MdfA, TPP and chloramphenicol uptake was significantly decreased in cells expressing the triple mutant E26T/D34M/A150E, whereas cells harboring empty vector or the inactive double mutant E26T/D34M accumulated the radiolabeled substrate. These results are in accordance with the behavior of the mutants in drug resistance assays.FIGURE 5Characterization of the MdfA constructs harboring combinations of A150E, S309P, and I327L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), although protonation-deprotonation remains to be shown directly with MdfA. A tentative explanation for the observation that the negative charge can be displaced functionally would be that active transport is driven by competition between protons and substrate molecules on binding to an acidic residue. As discussed previously, drugs interact with MdfA and other multidrug transporters by spatially promiscuous interactions (20Lewinson O. Adler J. Sigal N. Bibi E. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2072046699,"We have shown that branching morphogenesis of mammary ductal structures requires the action of the morphogen epimorphin/syntaxin-2. Epimorphin, originally identified as an extracellular molecule, is identical to syntaxin-2, an intracellular molecule that is a member of the extensively investigated syntaxin family of proteins that mediate vesicle trafficking. We show here that, although epimorphin/syntaxin-2 is highly homologous to syntaxin-1a, only epimorphin/syntaxin-2 can stimulate mammary branching morphogenesis. We construct a homology model of epimorphin/syntaxin-2 based on the published structure of syntaxin-1a, and we use this model to identify the structural motif responsible for the morphogenic activity. We identify four residues located within the cleft between helices B and C that differ between syntaxin-1a and epimorphin/syntaxin-2; through site-directed mutagenesis of these four amino acids, we confer the properties of epimorphin for cell adhesion, gene activation, and branching morphogenesis onto the inactive syntaxin-1a template. These results provide a dramatic demonstration of the use of structural information about one molecule to define a functional motif of a second molecule that is related at the sequence level but highly divergent functionally.

Branching morphogenesis is a developmental process involved in the formation of many organs, including mammary gland, lung, kidney, and salivary gland. In the mammary gland, branching morphogenesis allows the primitive anlage to develop into the highly ramified mammary ductal tree. Investigations of the signaling processes involved in mammary ductal branching have revealed that branching requires the presence of a growth factor and the morphogen epimorphin (1Hirai Y. Lochter A.

Although epimorphin was first identified as an extracellular morphogen through the use of function-blocking antibodies in lung and skin organ culture assays (12Hirai Y. Takebe K. Takashina M.

Cell. 1993; 73: 425-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the idea that epimorphin/syntaxin-2 might have distinct roles dependent upon its location on the outside or inside of the plasma membrane is controversial (14Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E.

Sci. 1993; 18: 124-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in part because epimorphin lacks a canonical peptide signal sequence to direct extracellular localization through the ER/Golgi pathway. Since the discovery of epimorphin/syntaxin-2, a number of molecules have been found that not only transit the plasma membrane in the absence of a signal sequence, but also have distinct functions in the cytosol and in the extracellular milieu (17Radisky D.C. Hirai Y. Bissell M.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 426-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although investigations of such bifunctional, bi-topological molecules are normally focused on either their intracellular or extracellular functions, the possibility that structural information about a molecule in one orientation could provide functional insight about the same molecule in the opposite orientation, where it binds to a completely different ligand or set of ligands, has remained largely unexplored. Although the structure of epimorphin/syntaxin-2 has not been reported, structural data exist for other members of the syntaxin family (18Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The conserved syntaxin structure is composed of an N-terminal autonomously folded 3-helix bundle domain (Habc), a flexible linker region, an α-helical SNARE domain, which participates in the coiled-coil assembly of the SNARE complex, and a C-terminal membrane anchor (Fig. 1, B and C) (19Chen X. Lu J. Dulubova I. Rizo J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2008; 41: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). NMR and crystal structures have shown that some syntaxins partition between two conformations: the open conformation, in which the SNARE domain is able to participate in the multiprotein SNARE complex, and the closed conformation, in which the SNARE domain interacts with the b and c helices of Habc, to form an intramolecular antiparallel four-helix bundle (19Chen X.

Deletion analyses have revealed that the functional domain of epimorphin can be distinguished from those of the syntaxins (1Hirai Y. Lochter A. Galosy S. Koshida S. Niwa S. Bissell M.J. J.

Here, we use structural and functional information about syntaxins to create an epimorphin homology model and to deduce the site of a key epimorphin ligand binding motif; we also demonstrate the specificity of the interactions formed by this motif using site-directed mutagenesis to create an active morphogen from the functionally inactive syntaxin-1a. These results identify precisely the minimal structural motif of epimorphin essential for its function as a morphogen and bring us closer to understanding its mode of interaction with critical physiological ligands.

Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and protease inhibitor were from Calbiochem. Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dye and TaqDNA Polymerase were from Sigma. Purified oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis and PCR were from Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX). Deoxynucleotide triphosphates and epidermal growth factor were from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Prof. Frederick M. Hughson (Dept. of Molecular Biology, Princeton University) provided samples of syntaxin-1a protein lacking the transmembrane domain. Three-dimensional Homology Modeling-Homology modeling was carried out using the SWISS-MODEL/PROMOD II server using the “first approach mode” (25Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar). In brief, the amino acid sequence of syntaxin-2 was submitted to the server, and suitable templates with a sequence identity of more than 25% were selected. Five template structure coordinates (3c98B.pdb, 1ez3B.pdb, 1ez3C.pdb, 1ex3A.pdb, and 1br0A.pdb) were superimposed, and a structural and local pairwise alignment of the target sequence to the main template structures was generated. The positions of the backbone atoms of the template structure were averaged, and the best loops were selected using a method that accounts for force field energy, steric hindrance, and favorable interactions. Starting with conserved residues, the model side chains were built by isosteric replacement of template structure side chains. Deviations in the model were energy-minimized using the GROMOS96 force field. Generation of Recombinant Epimorphin-Expression constructs were generated by PCR amplification using cDNA for mouse epimorphin or human syntaxin-1 as template. Habc-epimorphin (EPM) lacks the N-terminal 26 amino acids, the linker, SNARE helix, and transmembrane domains and was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides as follows: HSHisF, CCGCGCCATATGCACCATCACCATCACCATGGCGGGGATCATTTCATGGACGGTTTCTTCCAT, and HSHisR, CGCGCGAAGCTTTTATTATTTGCTTCGCTCCCGGAACAGGAT. Recombinant syntaxin-1a (Habc-1a) is derived from the homologous three-helix bundle domain of syntaxin-1a and was PCR-amplified using the following oligonucleotides: HS1AHis, CCGCGCCATATGCACCATCACCATCACCATGGCGGGGACCGCTTCATGGATGAGTTCTTTGAA, and HS1AHisR, CGCGCGAAGCTTTTATTATTTGCAGCGTTCTCGGTAGTCTGA. Both Habc-EPM and 3-Hlx-1A were cloned as Nde1 and HindIII fragments into a pET-27b(+) (Novagen, San Diego, CA) expression vector leading to a N-terminal fusion of His6 tag to the protein fragment. Recombinant Habc-1→2 is derived from Habc-1A with the proposed ligand binding site residues mutated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All mutations were introduced by PCR amplification of the entire expression plasmid using two mutated oligonucleotide primers. Two complementary primers carrying the mutation were used for the substitution mutations. The sequences of the sense primers used for the substitution of the amino acids indicated were the following, with the modified codons inbold and the nucleotide changed indicated in bold as follows. To create the 1→2 protein: M79N, 5′-AGGAACTGGAGGAGCTCAACTCGGACATTAAGAAGACAG-3′; E101D, 5′-CGAGCAGAGCATCGACCAGGAGGAAGGTC-3′; C145S, 5′-GACTACCGAGAACGCAGCAAATAATAAAAGCTTGCGG-3′; and Y141F, 5′-CCACTCAGTCAGACTTCCGAGAACGCAGC-3′.

The procedures used for protein production are in the supplemental Materials and Methods. Cell Culture and Cell Assays-The mouse mammary epithelial cell lines SCp2 and EpH4 were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin); the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml EGF, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, and 10 μg/ml insulin. Adhesion assays were carried out essentially as previously described (1Hirai Y. Lochter A. Galosy S. Koshida S. Niwa S. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Wells of a 24-well polystyrene plate (bacterial-grade, Falcon) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 250 μl/well of recombinant EPM at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. The wells were air-dried, then blocked with a 0.1% solution of pluronic F108 (BASF) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min, and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (100,000 cells/well) were plated onto the protein-coated substrata and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The wells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the remaining cells attached to the plate were trypsinized and counted. Wells coated with fibronectin were used as a positive control for adhesion. Blocking antibodies were: α1 (Ha31/8, 25 μg/ml, BD Biosciences); α5 (5H10-27, 25 μg/ml, BD Biosciences); αv (H9.2B8, 25 μg/ml, BD Biosciences); β1 (Ha2/5, 25 μg/ml, BD Biosciences); and β3 (2C9.G2, 25 μg/ml, BD Biosciences). Transcriptional analysis was performed using RNA from SCp2 cells grown for 2 days in growth medium (control) or growth medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml Habc-EPM, Habc-Syn1a, or Habc-1→2. Isolated total RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse 430_2 gene expression chips at the Mayo Clinic microarray core facility. Processing, normalization, and background correction were carried out using the GCRMA function of Genespring. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on reverse-transcribed cDNA, using ABI 8900 fast cycler instruments, following manufacturer protocols. TaqMan assays used were purchased from ABI and were: MMP3 (Mm01168406_g1), Fas (Mm01204974_m1), Mgp (Mm00485009_m1), Aqp3 (Mm01208559_m1), and Krt1–16 (Mm00492979_g1). Branching morphogenesis assays were performed using modifications of previously published protocols (3Hirai Y. Radisky D. Boudreau R. Simian M. Stevens M.E. Oka Y. Takebe K. Niwa S. Bissell M.J. J.

Development. 2001; 128: 3117-3131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described in the supplemental Materials and Methods. Our previous studies had shown that extracellular epimorphin, when presented in combination with a growth factor such as EGF, is sufficient to direct mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis; we had further localized the morphogenic activity of epimorphin to a domain of the molecule contained within the first 187 amino acids, a fragment that we designated as H12 (1Hirai Y. Lochter A. Galosy S. Koshida S. Niwa S. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Hirai Y. Radisky D. Boudreau R. Simian M. Stevens M.E. Oka Y. Takebe K. Niwa S. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether this property is unique to epimorphin among the syntaxin family of proteins, we used a three-dimensional collagen branching assay to compare the morphogenic capacity of this fragment of EPM with a fragment of syntaxin-1a that also lacks the transmembrane domain (Syn1a). We found that cells exposed to EPM in combination with EGF showed abundant branching morphogenesis, whereas cells treated with EGF alone or with Syn1a and EGF showed no branching (Fig. 1A). The H12 domain of epimorphin consists of an N-terminal region, the three helix Habc bundle, and a linker sequence (Fig. 1B). Crystal and NMR structural analyses of syntaxins suggest that the N-terminal 28 amino acids and the linker region have little defined structure, and thus that the Habc domain is the only structured element of H12-EPM (Fig. 1C) (20Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 26Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

We hypothesized that a minimal fragment containing only the Habc bundle would possess all of the functional activity of the complete H12 domain. We expressed the Habc domains of epimorphin (Habc-EPM) and syntaxin-1a (Habc-Syn1a) and found that only Habc-EPM was sufficient to reproduce the effects of H12 in branching morphogenesis (not shown). We therefore used the Habc proteins of EPM and Syn1a in all subsequent experiments. Epimorphin and syntaxin-1a show a very high level of sequence similarity, with 68% identity and 82% homology for human epimorphin versus human syntaxin-1a when compared within the Habc homologous domain (Fig. 2A). That epimorphin and syntaxin-1a proteins showed very different effects in the morphogenesis assay (Fig. 1A) suggested that the morphogenic activity of epimorphin was critically dependent upon presentation of a highly specific ligand binding interface, in which these two proteins were likely to differ by a just a few amino acids. Structural studies of syntaxins in the closed conformation have revealed that, within the N-terminal Habc bundle, the interface between the second and third helices forms a groove that binds to the SNARE helix in the closed conformation of the intact molecule to form a four-helix structure (20Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 26Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

We hypothesized that epimorphin binds to its receptor through a comparable interaction, that is, that there exists a helix on the epimorphin receptor that serves as an alternative epimorphin ligand, binding to the cleft between the second and third helices of the Habc domain. We constructed an epimorphin homology model by threading the sequence of epimorphin through the published crystal structure of syntaxin-1a (Fig. 2B). We used this model to identify the amino acid residues of the epimorphin Habc bundle with side chains pointing toward the cleft formed by the second and third helices. Of the residues in the homology model that were predicted to be in contact with the hypothetical fourth helix, four were found to differ between syntaxin-1a and epimorphin and to be oriented toward the predicted binding cleft (syn1a/epimorphin: D79E, D101E, F142Y, and S146C). It is noteworthy that, although the α-helical domains of the Habc bundle are generally conserved between epimorphin and syntaxin-1a, these four residues that differ between the two molecules are conserved between species in mouse, rat, and human (Fig. 2A). We used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a mutant construct of Habc-Syn1a in which these residues were mutated to match the corresponding positions on epimorphin (Habc-1→2, Fig. 2, B and C). We used similar methods to generate a mutant construct of Habc-EPM in which the residues were mutated to match the corresponding positions on syntaxin-1a (Habc-2→1, not shown). We determined the activity of the quadruple mutant Habc-1→2 and Habc-2→1 proteins in assays that measure binding to epithelial cells, alteration of gene expression, and induction of mammary branching morphogenesis. Association of epimorphin with cells can be assessed through cell binding assays in which proteins are adsorbed to the surface of culture plates and then overlaid with cells in suspension (1Hirai Y.

We found that the SCp2 cells adhered well to the positive control fibronectin, to Habc-EPM, and to Habc-1→2 protein, but not to Habc-Syn1a or to Habc-2→1 (Fig. 3, A and B). We found similar results with other mammary epithelial cell lines, as well, including mouse EpH4 cells (Fig. 3C) and human MCF10A cells (Fig. 3D). These results show that the mutation of the four amino acids within the cleft formed by the second and third helices of syntaxin-1a reconstitutes the cell binding activity of epimorphin/syntaxin-2. As we had found greatly reduced binding of the mammary epithelial cells to the Habc-2→1 mutant, we used the Habc-Syn1a mutant as control for further experiments. We had previously found that epimorphin binds to mammary epithelial cells through adhesion to αv-integrins (2Hirai Y. Nelson C.M. Yamazaki K. Takebe K. Przybylo J. Madden B. Radisky D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), so we tested whether anti-integrin antibodies blocked binding of SCp2 cells to Habc-EPM and Habc-1→2. We found that antibodies that blocked integrins αv and β1 also blocked cell association with Habc-EPM (Fig. 4A) and Habc-1→2 (Fig. 4B), but that antibodies targeting integrins α1, α5, and β3 had little effect. These results show that cell binding to Habc-EPM and Habc-1→2 occurs through the same receptors. We next assessed global transcriptional alterations of cells treated with the Habc constructs. When expression levels were normalized to untreated cells, 1166 genes were found to be regulated >2-fold in at least one of the treatment conditions, and many of these showed common pattern of regulation between Habc-EPM and Habc-1→2 (Fig. 5A; data for all genes is in supplemental Table S1). We validated the microarray results for selected genes relevant to epimorphin function and mammary branching morphogenesis. Epimorphin has been shown to induce MMP3 (4Simian M. Hirai Y. Navre M. Werb Z. Lochter A. Bissell M.J. Development. 2001; 128: 3117-3131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a molecule involved in mammary ductal side branching (30Wiseman B.S. Sternlicht M.D. Lund L.R.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and we found that both Habc-EPM and Habc-1→2 (but not Habc-Syn1a) induced MMP3 (Fig. 5B). We also found that Habc-EPM and Habc1→2 increased gene expression of a number of additional transcripts encoding molecules known to be involved in branching morphogenesis, including Fas (31Song J.

Physiol. 2004; 286: L1179-L1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Both Habc-EPM and Habc-1→2 also selectively down-regulated transcription of a number of mammary luminal epithelial cell markers, including aquaporin-3 (33Matsuzaki T. Machida N. Tajika Y. Ablimit A. Suzuki T. Aoki T. Hagiwara H. Takata K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 123: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and keratin-16 (34Tsubura A. Okada H. Senzaki H. Hatano T. Morii S. Histopathology. 1991; 18: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C), consistent with the loss of luminal morphology during branching morphogenesis (35Fata J.E. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, transcript level alterations induced by Habc-EPM were also found in Habc-1→2, but not in Habc-Syn1a. We assessed the ability of the recombinant proteins to induce mammary branching morphogenesis of SCp2 cell clusters. We found that treatment with EGF, or with EGF and Habc-Syn1a, led to growth of the cell clusters, but little or no branching, whereas those treated with Habc-EPM and EGF or Habc-1→2 and EGF exhibited robust branching activity (Fig. 6, A and B). These results show that, by mutating four amino acids, we have reconstituted the epimorphin morphogenic activity using an inactive syntaxin-1a template. In this study, we used structural information from the crystal structure of the homologous protein syntaxin-1a to develop a hypothesis about a potential ligand binding motif of epimorphin/syntaxin-2 and to identify amino acids essential for the function of this motif. This strategy relied upon the fact that epimorphin and syntaxin-2 have identical sequences but distinct behavior and functional domains, reflective of their different localizations: epimorphin is present on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (1Hirai Y. Lochter A. Galosy S. Koshida S. Niwa S. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas syntaxin-2 is found on the cytoplasmic face. It is noteworthy that epimorphin/syntaxin-2 has no canonical signal sequence, and as such, extracellular localization of epimorphin apparently occurs without transit through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. A variety of proteins lacking canonical signal sequences, including fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2 and interleukin-1β, have been found to exit cells using nonclassic prote"
https://openalex.org/W2021354813,"ID2 is a member of a subclass of transcription regulators belonging to the general bHLH (basic-helix-loop-helix) family of transcription factors. In normal cells, ID2 is responsible for regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation. More recent studies have demonstrated that ID2 is involved in tumor progression in several cancer types such as prostate or breast.In this work, we investigated, for the first time, the relationship between the expression of ID2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of these patients. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays, which included 62 NSCLC tumors. In malignant tissues, ID2 expression has been detected in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, but we have demonstrated that only nuclear expression of ID2 is inversely correlated with the differentiation grade of the tumor (p = 0.007). Interestingly, among patients with poorly differentiated tumors, high nuclear expression of ID2 was an independent and unfavorable prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.036).These results suggest that ID2 could be involved in tumor dedifferentiation processes of NSCLC, and could be used as prognostic marker for patients with poorly differentiated tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2065615367,"In mice behavioral response to pain is modulated by social status. Recently, social context also has been shown to affect pain sensitivity. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of interaction between status and social context in dyads of outbred CD-1 male mice in which the dominance/submission relationship was stable. Mice were assessed for pain response in a formalin (1% concentration) test either alone (individually tested-IT), or in pairs of dominant and subordinate mice. In the latter condition, they could be either both injected (BI) or only one injected (OI) with formalin. We observed a remarkable influence of social context on behavioral response to painful stimuli regardless of the social status of the mice. In the absence of differences between OI and IT conditions, BI mice exhibited half as much Paw-licking behavior than OI group. As expected, subordinates were hypoalgesic in response to the early phase of the formalin effects compared to dominants. Clear cut-differences in coping strategies of dominants and subordinates appeared. The former were more active, whereas the latter were more passive. Finally, analysis of behavior of the non-injected subjects (the observers) in the OI dyads revealed that dominant observers were more often involved in Self-grooming behavior upon observation of their subordinate partner in pain. This was not the case for subordinate mice observing the pain response of their dominant partner. In contrast, subordinate observers Stared at the dominant significantly more frequently compared to observer dominants in other dyads. The observation of a cagemate in pain significantly affected the observer's behavior. Additionally, the quality of observer's response was also modulated by the dominance/submission relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2050703700,"Alternative translation is an underappreciated post-transcriptional regulation mechanism. Although only a small number of genes are found to be alternatively translated, most genes undergoing alternative translation play important roles in tumorigenesis and development. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is involved in many cellular events during tumorigenesis and development. The specificity, localization, and activity of PP2A are regulated by B regulatory subunits. B56∈, a member of the B56 regulatory subunit family, is involved in multiple signaling pathways and regulates a number of developmental processes. Here we report that B56∈ is alternatively translated, leading to the production of a full-length form and a shorter isoform that lacks the N-terminal 76 amino acid residues of the full-length form. Alternative translation of B56∈ occurs through a cap-dependent mechanism. We provide evidence that the shorter isoform is required for Wnt signaling and regulates the midbrain/hindbrain boundary formation during Xenopus embryonic development. This demonstrates that the shorter isoform of B56∈ has important biological functions. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminal sequence of B56∈, which is not present in the shorter isoform, contains a nuclear localization signal, whereas the C terminus of B56∈ contains a nuclear export signal. The shorter isoform, which lacks the N-terminal nuclear localization signal, is restricted to the cytoplasm. In contrast, the full-length form can be localized to the nucleus in a cell type-specific manner. The finding that B56∈ is alternatively translated adds a new level of regulation to PP2A holoenzymes.

Recent progress in genome projects has led to the unexpected finding that the number of protein-coding genes does not account for the increasing complexity or diversity in eukaryotes. For example, the number of protein-coding genes in a sea urchin genome (1Cameron R.A. Mahairas G. Rast J.P. Martinez P. Biondi T.R. Swartzell S. Wallace J.C. Poustka A.J. Livingston B.T. Wray G.A. Ettensohn C.A. Lehrach H. Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9514-9518Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) is comparable with that in mammalian genomes (2Pennisi E. Science. 2003; 3001484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in generating the tremendous biological complexity in eukaryotes. Alternative translation is a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism that occurs at the level of translation. Alternative translation was first discovered in viruses. It is unique in that multiple protein isoforms are generated from a single mRNA through selective usage of translation initiation sites. Alternative translation isoforms may be targeted to different subcellular compartments or expressed in different tissues. In some cases, alternative translation isoforms have distinct functions. Even though alternative translation is an important post-transcriptional regulation mechanism, only a small number of vertebrate genes have been found to be alternatively translated (for review see Ref. 3Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Alternative translation has been studied for decades. Based on the “scanning model,” which was proposed by Kozak 30 years ago (4Kozak M. Cell. 1978; 15: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), the first step of translation initiation is the assembly of the 40 S ribosomal subunit, which carries tRNAMet, on the 5′ end of mRNA. Ribosomes then migrate on the mRNA, a process known as “scanning.” Once the first AUG codon in a context favorable for initiating translation is recognized via pairing with anti-codon in tRNAMet (5′-CAU-3′), ribosomes stop scanning and initiate peptide synthesis (5Mayer C. Kohrer C. Kenny E. Prusko C. RajBhandary U.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4787-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In some cases, however, ribosomes skip the first AUG and initiate translation from an alternative site(s). There are two mechanisms for alternative translation. The first mechanism is known as re-initiation or the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) 3The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.-dependent mechanism, meaning that ribosomes bind to IRES and initiate translation downstream of the IRES. Because initiation complex assembly on the 5′ mRNA cap is not required in this case, this mechanism is also known as a “cap-independent mechanism.” The second mechanism for escaping the first AUG is the context-dependent leaky scanning mechanism, meaning that because of the mRNA sequence flanking the first AUG, only a fraction of ribosomes initiate translation at the first AUG, whereas others continue scanning and initiate translation further downstream. As context-dependent leaky scanning requires assembly of ribosomes on the 5′ cap, it is often called “cap-dependent alternative translation.” So far, only a small number of genes have been found to be alternatively translated (3Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 6Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, many of them play important roles during tumorigenesis and development. As one of the most abundantly expressed protein phosphatases, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is involved in numerous biological processes, including tumorigenesis and development (7Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 8Mumby M.

The holoenzyme is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic subunit (C), a structural subunit (A), and a regulatory subunit (B). The catalytic activity, the substrate specificity, and the subcellular localization of PP2A are controlled by the regulatory subunits. Three PP2A regulatory subunit families have been identified, including B55/B, B56/B′, and PR72/B″. Mammalian B56 family is composed of five members (B56α, -β,-δ,-∈, and -γ). B56 family members have a highly conserved central core region and variable N- and C-terminal sequences (10McCright B. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 302: 477-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we report that B56∈ is alternatively translated. This results in the production of a 56-kDa full-length form (B56∈-fl) and a 48-kDa isoform, lacking the N-terminal 76-amino acid residues (B56∈-s) through a cap-dependent alternative translation mechanism. We provide evidence that B56∈-s is required for midbrain/hindbrain boundary formation and is involved in the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, we have identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the N-terminal 76 amino acid residues of B56∈-fl and a nuclear export signal (NES) from the C-terminal sequence of B56∈. We show that B56∈-s, which lacks the N-terminal NLS, is restricted to the cytoplasm, whereas B56∈-fl can be localized to the nucleus in a cell type-specific manner. Hence, our studies have identified an important mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of B56∈. Embryo Manipulations-Embryos were obtained and micro-injected as described (28Sive H. Grainger R. Harland R. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual.1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 91-141Google Scholar). The dosage of RNA or morpholino for microinjection was indicated in the figure legends or text. For animal cap assay, animal caps were dissected at late blastula stage with a microsurgery device (Gastromaster, Nepagene, Japan). Caps were cultured in 1× modified Marc’s Ringer and harvested when the sibling control reached stage 16. Tissue Culture and Confocal Microscopy Analysis-The culture medium for 293 cells was Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. The culture medium for MB-MDA-231 cells was RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). For confocal microscopy analysis, transfected cells were plated on glass coverslips. After coverslip attachment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted in mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Shield). For leptomycin B treatment, cells were exposed to leptomycin B (2 ng/ml; Sigma) for 7 h before fixation.

Western Blots-For Western blot analysis, embryos or oocytes were homogenized (40 μl per embryo or oocyte) in cold lysis buffer (125 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and at 14,000 × g for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were collected. After SDS sample buffer was included, each sample was boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed according to the standard protocol. Antibodies are as follows: anti-FLAG (1:1000; M2, Sigma), anti-Myc (1:1000; 9E10, Sigma), anti-B56γ (1:200; 39-3600, Invitrogen), and anti-PP2Ac (1:5000; Millipore). A keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide (Ac-CELKRGLRRDGIIPT-OH) was synthesized at New England Peptide and was used to immunize rabbits for generating anti-B56∈ (human and mouse) antiserum. A B56∈ peptide affinity column was prepared using the SulfoLink immobilization kit (Pierce). The B56∈ antiserum was loaded to the affinity column, washed, and eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The eluate, which contains anti-B56∈ antibody, was neutralized and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. For Western blot, the purified anti-B56∈ antibody was used at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml.

We noticed that overexpression of a C-terminal FLAG-tagged Xenopus B56∈ (∈-FLAG) in Xenopus embryos resulted in the appearance of two polypeptides on the FLAG Western blot (Fig. 1B) (17Rorick A.M. Mei W. Liette N.L. Phiel C. El-Hodiri H.M. Yang J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 302: 477-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). According to their migration rates, the estimated molecular mass of the slower migrating polypeptide is ∼56-kDa, which is the calculated molecular mass of ∈-FLAG. The faster migrating polypeptide is ∼48-kDa. A similar observation was made when ∈-FLAG RNA was translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). The 5′-coding sequence of vertebrate B56∈ mRNA contains three in-frame AUGs, which encode Met1, Met77, and Met85 (Fig. 1A). The internal methionines are conserved in all vertebrate orthologs of B56∈ but not in other B56 family members. To test whether the 48-kDa polypeptide could be an alternative translation product initiated from the second AUG, we generated ΔN, a truncation mutant lacking the initial AUG and the following 108-bp sequence. As a consequence, translation of ΔN is started at the second AUG of B56∈, which corresponds to Met77. When analyzed on SDS-PAGE, the migration rate of the ΔN translation product is identical to that of the 48-kDa polypeptide derived from ∈-FLAG (Fig. 1B). This raises the possibility that the 48-kDa polypeptide is an alternative translation isoform of B56∈. Next, we generated several point mutations, including M77A (Met77 to Ala), M77V (Met77 to Val), M85G (Met85 to Gly), and M77A/M85G (Fig. 1C). We reasoned that mutation of Met77 would prevent the production of the 48-kDa polypeptide, if this 48-kDa polypeptide is indeed an alternative translation product of B56∈. RNAs encoding these mutants and ∈-FLAG were synthesized in vitro and injected into fertilized eggs. Control and injected embryos were harvested at stage 9 and analyzed by FLAG Western blot. Consistent with previous results, ∈-FLAG produced the 48- and the 56-kDa polypeptides. M77A and M77V produced the 56-kDa polypeptide but not the 48-kDa polypeptide. Strikingly, a polypeptide migrating slightly faster than the 48-kDa polypeptide was detected. This is likely a translation product initiated at Met85. When both Met77 and Met85 were mutated (M77A/M85G), neither the 48-kDa polypeptide nor the faster migrating polypeptides were detected (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the 48-kDa polypeptide is a product of alternative translation initiated from the second AUG that corresponds to Met77 of the full-length B56∈. Hereafter, we designate the full-length and the shorter B56∈ isoforms as B56∈-fl and B56∈-s, respectively. B56 family members are highly similar to each other. We asked whether B56∈ from other species and other B56 family members are alternatively translated as well. C-terminal FLAG-tagged human B56∈ (hB56∈), mouse B56∈ (mB56∈), Drosophila wdb, human B56α ((hB56α), and Xenopus B56δ (xB56δ) were constructed. When expressed in Xenopus embryos, only xB56∈, hB56∈, mB56∈, and wdb were alternatively translated, as judged by the appearance of two polypeptides on the FLAG Western blot (Fig. 1E). Thus, B56∈ and Drosophila wdb, but not other B56 family members, were alternative translated. To determine whether endogenous B56∈ is alternatively translated, a polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal epitope of mammalian B56∈ was generated. This antibody recognized B56∈, without cross-reacting with overexpressed hB56α, hB56β, xB56δ, and hB56γ1 (Fig. 1F). Using this antibody, we examined the expression of B56∈ in several cell lines and adult mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 1G, both B56∈-s and B56∈-fl were detectable in HeLa, SW480, MCF7, and MB-MDA-231 cells. In HEK 293 cells, however, the expression level of B56∈-s was below the limit of detection. B56γ is alternatively spliced (10McCright B. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26123-26128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Csortos C. Zolnierowicz S.

Minna J.D. Kamibayashi C. Genomics. 2002; 79: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When the expression of B56γ was analyzed, all three splicing isoforms were detected in HeLa, SW480, and HEK 293 cells. The MB-MDA-231 cell only expressed B56γ1 and B56γ3. MCF7 cells expressed very low level of B56γ (Fig. 1G). Additionally, we analyzed the expression of B56∈ in adult mouse tissues. Both isoforms were detected in the forebrain, cerebellum, and adrenal gland, whereas heart, muscle, liver, kidney, and lung expressed predominantly B56∈-fl (Fig. 1H). These results demonstrate that endogenous B56∈ undergoes alternative translation, and the relative abundance of two isoforms is cell type-dependent. Alternative Translation of B56∈ Occurs through a Cap-dependent Mechanism-As described above, alternative translation may be through the IRES-dependent mechanism or the cap-dependent mechanism. The cap-dependent alternative translation requires assembly of ribosomes on the 5′ cap of mRNA, whereas ribosomes bind directly to IRES in the case of IRES-dependent alternative translation. To distinguish which mechanism applies to alternative translation of B56∈, we asked whether assembly of ribosomes on the 5′ cap of B56∈ mRNA is required for translation of B56∈-s. Capped and non-capped mRNAs of ∈-FLAG were synthesized in vitro and injected into Xenopus oocytes. Thirty minutes after injection, oocytes were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis. Injection of capped, but not non-capped, ∈-FLAG RNA resulted in production of B56∈-fl and B56∈-s (Fig. 2A). In addition, we found that translation of both B56∈-fl and B56∈-s was blocked by overexpression of the elF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) but not by overexpression of GFP (Fig. 2B). 4E-BP inhibits assembly of elF4F complex, a multisubunit complex interacting directly with the 5′ cap structure of mRNA (34Gingras A.C. Raught B. Gygi S.P. Niedzwiecka A. Miron M. Burley S.K. Polakiewicz R.D. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). These results indicate that assembly of ribosomes on the 5′ end of B56∈ mRNA is required for translation of B56∈ isoforms and suggest that alternative translation of B56∈ is cap-dependent. In the case of cap-dependent alternative translation, the sequence around the first AUG of an mRNA determines whether ribosomes initiate translation or continue scanning. If B56∈-s is generated through a cap-dependent mechanism, one might predict that the first AUG of B56∈ mRNA is in a context unfavorable for translation initiation. This AUG and its context, when transferred to the 5′ of a nonrelated sequence, would cause alternative translation. To test this, we generated an ∈N-Myc-EGFP, which contains the 5′-coding sequence of B56∈ (Met1-Phe76) followed in-frame with a Myc-EGFP (Fig. 2C). Indeed, when expressed in Xenopus embryo, ∈N-Myc-EGFP produced two polypeptides. One migrated with the same rate as Myc-EGFP did on SDS-PAGE. The other migrated about 8 kDa larger than Myc-EGFP, which corresponds to the calculated molecular weight of the N-terminal 76 amino acid residues of B56∈-fl (Fig. 2D). This result indicates that the first AUG of B56∈ is in a context unfavorable for translation initiation. Cap-dependent alternative translation can be prevented by improving the context of the upstream translation initiation site (3Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 6Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To further test the hypothesis that alternative translation of B56∈ is through a cap-dependent mechanism, we constructed a Myc-∈-FLAG. Myc-∈-FLAG contains six copies of the Myc tag fused at the N terminus of B56∈ (Fig. 2E). We reasoned that engineering an AUG in a context favorable for translation initiation upstream of the B56∈ open reading frame would prevent the production of B56∈-s. Indeed, overexpression of Myc-∈-FLAG in Xenopus embryo only produced one polypeptide. The translation of B56∈-s was completely blocked. The estimated molecular mass of the polypeptide is about 75 kDa, which corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of Myc-∈-FLAG (Fig. 2F). Thus, improving the context of upstream translation initiation site blocks the translation of B56∈-s. These results demonstrate that alternative translation of B56∈ occurs through a cap-dependent mechanism. B56∈-s Is Essential for the Midbrain/Hindbrain Boundary Formation-Knowing that B56∈ is alternatively translated, we wanted to know whether B56∈-s, which lacks the N-terminal 76 amino acid residues of B56∈-fl, is biologically functional. We took advantage of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, which, upon binding to their mRNA target, inhibit translation initiation by acting as a “roadblock” for the scanning ribosome. As alternative translation of B56∈ occurs through a cap-dependent mechanism, we hypothesized that a morpholino, which targets the sequence between the first and the second AUG of Xenopus B56∈ mRNA, should block the translation of B56∈-s, without affecting B56∈-fl. Four morpholinos that target to different B56∈ sequences were synthesized (Fig. 3A). As expected, MO1 (15Yang J. Wu J. Tan C. Klein P.S.

Driscoll M. Kyrpides N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mammalian members include the flotillins, the prohibitins (PHBs), podocin, stomatin, and stomatin-like proteins (2Browman D.T. Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M.

The SPFH domain, also known as PHB or HflK/C domain, was originally considered to be evolutionarily conserved, but it was recently proposed that it emerged independently in different proteins by convergent evolution (4Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C. Malaga-Trillo E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The role of this domain mostly remains elusive, although the SPFH domain of podocin was found to be involved in cholesterol binding (5Huber T.B. Schermer B. Muller R.U. Hohne M. Bartram M. Calixto A.

Members of the SPFH domain-containing proteins are attached to membranes of different subcellular compartments, including mitochondria (prohibitin), trans-Golgi network (flotillins), endosomes, and the plasma membrane (flotillin and stomatin) (2Browman D.T.

In conjunction with this diverse targeting these proteins carry out diverse functions, like regulation of membrane channels, endocytosis, and coupling of plasma membrane signaling complexes to the cytoskeleton (2Browman D.T. Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 394-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). All mammalian SPFH domaincontaining proteins associate with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), and thus appear to occupy lipid raft-like domains of different cellular membranes (2Browman D.T.

Using an antibody screen against isolated lipid raft proteins from human myelomonocytic cells, our laboratory recently identified two novel members of this protein group named erlin (endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft protein)-1 and -2 (previously known as KE04p/SPFH1 and C8orf2/SPFH2, respectively) (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The initial study characterized them as components of lipid raft-like domains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Erlin-2 was independently identified as a component of endothelial caveolae (7Sprenger R.R. Fontijn R.D. van Marle J. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and as an interacting partner of activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (7Sprenger R.R. Fontijn R.D. van Marle J.

The function of the erlins is still relatively unexplored, but the latter study suggests that erlin-2 acts as a substrate recognition factor during ER-associated protein degradation of activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and other substrates (8Pearce M.M. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20104-20115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Both erlins are closely related as they share ∼80% identity at the amino acid level, whereas the extreme N and C termini show the lowest conservation (2Browman D.T. Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M.

The extreme N terminus of erlin-1 and -2 contains a transmembrane domain, which anchors and targets these proteins to the ER membrane (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Erlin-2 was shown to be a type II ER membrane protein, with only the first three N-terminal amino acids on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, and most of the protein, including central and C-terminal regions, being found in the ER lumen (8Pearce M.M. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20104-20115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Erlin-1 likely has the same membrane topology, due to its high similarity to erlin-2. In addition to DRM association, another common characteristic of SPFH domain-containing proteins is the propensity to form oligomers, although the size of these complexes varies somewhat between members. Stomatin and podocin both form large homo-oligomers of ∼9–12 and ∼20–50 monomers, respectively (5Huber T.B. Schermer B. Muller R.U. Hohne M. Bartram M. Calixto A. Hagmann H. Reinhardt C. Koos F.

Model K. Langer T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Flotillin-1 and -2 on the other hand form homo- and heterotetramers (13Solis G.P. Hoegg M.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3031-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of all SPFH domain-containing proteins investigated thus far depends on regions close to their C terminus. Domains of predicted coiled-coil secondary structure are required for oligomerization of the prohibitins and the flotillins (12Tatsuta T. Model K. Langer T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although the oligomerization domains of most SPFH domain-containing proteins have only been defined in relatively broad terms, the domain necessary for oligomerization and DRM association of stomatin was mapped to a 9-amino acid stretch downstream of the SPFH domain (16Umlauf E. Mairhofer M. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because oligomerization and DRM association are common features of SPFH domain-containing proteins (2Browman D.T. Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 394-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), they are likely essential for their function. Domains or motifs, which mediate these properties, may be functionally important. In the first part of this study, we characterized complex formation of endogenous and ectopically expressed erlin proteins. Consequently our second aim was to identify domains within the erlins mediating oligomerization as well as DRM association, because these two properties seem to be mediated by the same general regions in other SPFH domain-containing proteins. Here we report the identification of two distinct erlin regions, which mediated specific biochemical properties of these proteins. Although one region was found to be required for lower order oligomerization and DRM association, another one was responsible for incorporation into multimeric complexes.

Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), respectively (see supplemental Fig. S1). All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Bioinformatics-Conserved domains in erlin-1 and -2 were determined as follows: The PHB domain (smart00244) was identified by the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool. The SPFH domain corresponds to the Band_7/SPFH domain (pfam01145), and the HflK/C domain corresponds to the conserved domains Band_7/HflK (cd0304) and Band_7/HflC (cd0305), which were determined based on homologies to the bacterial membrane protease subunits HflK and HflC. All are available at the conserved domain data base at NCBI. Plasmid Constructs-HA- and FLAG-tagged full-length (FL) erlin-1, FL erlin-2FLAG, and HA-tagged erlin-2 truncation mutants were generated by PCR using erlin-1 and -2 cDNAs described in a previous study (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) as templates. FL erlin-2HA has been described previously (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). All HA-tagged constructs were cloned into the pLPCX, and all FLAG-tagged constructs were cloned into the pLNCX2 retroviral vector (Clontech). In all cases constructs were inserted into vectors using XhoI and ClaI restriction sites. Erlin-2 (E2) F305A HA and E2 IPMFM→A HA were generated from the erlin-2HA/pLPCX plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with minor modifications. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines-HeLa, NIH-3T3, and Bosc23 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. NIH-3T3 cell lines stably expressing erlin constructs were generated by retroviral infection as described previously with some modifications (17Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, retrovirus-containing supernatants were produced by transiently transfecting Bosc23 cells with retroviral vectors described above using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For infection, retroviral supernatant diluted 1:1 in growth media containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene was added to cells. Cells infected with HA-tagged erlin constructs in pLPCX were selected for positive clones using 2 μg/ml puromycin. To generate NIH-3T3 cells co-expressing HA-tagged and FLAG-tagged erlin constructs, cell lines expressing erlin-HA constructs were re-infected with erlin-FLAG constructs in pLNCX2 and selected for positive clones by adding 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) to puromycin containing growth medium. Frozen pellets of two 150-mm tissue culture dishes of nearly confluent cells were used for immunoprecipitations, sucrose density gradient centrifugations, DRM isolations, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (M-β-CD) treatment of membrane fractions. For harvesting, cells were washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), detached with a cell scraper and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were stored at -80 °C until use. Immunoprecipitation-For immunoprecipitations frozen cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) and homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 0.5–1 mg of protein of the cell lysate was used per immunoprecipitation reaction. After preclearing lysates by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for 45 min, samples were incubated with either α-HA, mouse α-FLAG, normal IgG, erlin antiserum, or pre-immune serum for 1 h, followed by protein G-Sepharose for an additional hour. Immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Rabbit α-FLAG was used as primary antibody for all α-FLAG Western blots of immunoprecipitation samples. For all other Western blots, the identical antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were also employed as primary antibodies in combination with light chain-specific secondary antibodies. siRNA Transfection-Predesigned siRNA duplexes specific for human erlin mRNAs were purchased from Qiagen. We obtained two erlin-1-specific siRNAs with catalogue numbers SI00731402 (Hs_SPFH1_2) and SI00731409 (Hs_SPFH1_3), which we herein refer to as siRNAs E1_1 and E1_2, respectively. Catalogue numbers of the two erlin-2-specific siRNAs purchased are SI00731437 (Hs_SPFH2_3) and SI03167234 (Hs_SPFH2_6), herein referred to as E2_1and E2_2. “AllStars negative control siRNA” (Qiagen) was used as the negative control. siRNA transfection of HeLa cells was performed using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Cells were transfected in 6-well plates (2.3 × 106 cells/well) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 10 nm siRNA and 12 μl of HiPerFect for each well. 72 h after transfection cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and erlin protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation-Sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed as described previously (18Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, frozen cell pellets were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in MES-buffered saline (MBS, 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, and protease inhibitors) and homogenized with 25 strokes in Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation as described above, and 1 ml of lysate was layered on top of an 11-ml 40–5% continuous sucrose gradient (containing 1% Triton X-100). Gradients were spun at 170,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor (Beckman). Gel filtration molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) were resuspended in 1% Triton/MBS and run in parallel. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from each gradient, and equal volumes of each fraction were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie staining using GelCode Blue Stain (Pierce) or Western blotting. M-β-CD Treatment-Treatment of crude membrane fractions with 50 mm M-β-CD was performed as previously reported (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Subsequently, DRM isolation, immunoprecipitation, and sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed with M-β-CD-treated membranes and controls, which were treated with PBS only. Isolation of DRM Fractions-DRM fractions were prepared as described previously (17Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen cell pellets were lysed in 1% Triton X-100/MBS with protease inhibitors, and lysate was adjusted to 40% sucrose in a volume of 2 ml. Lysate was overlaid with a 10-ml continuous 30–5% sucrose gradient and spun at 170,000 × g for 17 h in SW41 rotor. After centrifugation the top ∼3.5 ml of the gradient was discarded, and the next 3.5–4 ml containing the opaque band of detergent-resistant material was diluted with 8 ml of MBS and subjected to another ultracentrifuge spin of 1 h to pellet the DRM fraction. The soluble fraction in the bottom 2 ml of the gradient was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, both DRM and soluble fraction were resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and 1 m Tris (pH 11), and equal parts of each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. When DRM isolation was performed on M-β-CD-treated membranes the gradient was fractionated into six 2-ml fractions and further subfractionated into insoluble and soluble material as described previously (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Equal portions of insoluble material from all fractions (1Tavernarakis N.

Microscopy-For immunofluorescent staining, NIH-3T3 cells were seeded onto acid-washed coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum 1 day prior to fixation. Transient transfection with E2 N300 HA was performed on cells seeded onto coverslips using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were fixed 24 h post transfection. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and cells were incubated with each antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After fixation and each antibody incubation, cells were washed trice in PBS. Endogenous erlins in 3T3 pLPCX cells were stained with PAN-erlin antibody and donkey α-rabbit AlexaFluor 488. HA-tagged erlin-2 constructs were stained with 3F10 antibody, cells were co-stained with rabbit α-calnexin as ER marker, and goat α-rat AlexaFluor 488 and donkey α-rabbit AlexaFluor 568 were used as secondary antibodies (all fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies from Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted using Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako). Images were acquired as Z-stacks using an LSM 510 Meta confocal on an Axiovert 200M microscope with a63×/1.4 Plan Apochromat objective (all from Carl Zeiss) and are presented as projections of three focal planes, which were generated using LSM Image Browser (Carl Zeiss). For presentation purposes, levels, contrast, and brightness were adjusted across the entire image using Adobe Photoshop. Erlin-1 and -2 Form Homo- and Hetero-oligomers-We previously reported that, in addition to the 43-kDa band corresponding to the monomeric form of ectopically expressed HA-tagged erlin-2, a ∼80-kDa band, which might represent a dimeric version of the protein, can be detected in DRM fractions isolated from NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts (6Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similar higher molecular weight bands were also found on erlin-1 Western blots (Data not shown). This finding and the fact that oligomerization appears to be a common feature of SPFH domain-containing proteins (2Browman D.T. Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 394-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), led us to investigate whether the erlins form homo- and hetero-oligomers. We used co-immunoprecipitation experiments to test whether erlin monomers could interact with each other, which is the prerequisite for oligomerization. To examine homo-oligomerization, we stably co-expressed HA- and FLAG-tagged versions of either human erlin-1 or -2 and performed immunoprecipitations with HA- and FLAG-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). We found that erlin-1HA precipitated with erlin-1FLAG, and vice versa, and the same was observed for HA- and FLAG-tagged erlin-2 (Fig. 1A). This showed that erlin-1 and -2 monomers have the ability to homo-oligomerize. Next, we examined interactions between erlin-1 and erlin-2 by immunoprecipitations on NIH-3T3 cells co-expressing HA-tagged erlin-1 and FLAG-tagged erlin-2, or vice versa, and found an interaction between ectopically expressed erlin-1 and erlin-2 (Fig. 1B). To confirm this finding in an endogenous setting, immunoprecipitations on endogenous erlin proteins were performed in HeLa cells, a human cervical carcinoma cell line (Fig. 1C). We used polyclonal antibodies specific for either erlin-1 or -2, which were raised against the extreme N terminus of erlin-1 or erlin-2, respectively, a region with very little conservation between erlin-1 and -2 (supplemental Fig. S1; see also Fig. 5A). These antibodies were specific for human erlin proteins, because they recognized endogenous protein in HeLa cells but not in vector control murine NIH-3T3 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with our data on overexpressed proteins, we observed an interaction of endogenous erlin-1 and -2 (Fig. 1C). The interaction between erlin monomers appears to be very stable, because all immunoprecipitation experiments described here (Fig. 1, A–C) were carried out in a lysis buffer, containing substantial amounts of various detergents (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on these data we concluded that erlin-1 and -2 form homo- and hetero-oligomers.FIGURE 5Residue Phe-305 within a short hydrophobic stretch is dispensable for oligomerization and lipid raft association but is required for high molecular weight complex association of erlin-2.

https://openalex.org/W2023516494,"Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is an abundant platelet α-granule chemokine released following platelet activation. PF4 interacts with thrombomodulin and the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of protein C, thereby enhancing activated protein C (APC) generation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. However, the protein C Gla domain not only mediates protein C activation in vivo, but also plays a critical role in modulating the diverse functional properties of APC once generated. In this study we demonstrate that PF4 significantly inhibits APC anti-coagulant activity. PF4 inhibited both protein S-dependent APC anticoagulant function in plasma and protein S-dependent factor Va (FVa) proteolysis 3- to 5-fold, demonstrating that PF4 impairs protein S cofactor enhancement of APC anticoagulant function. Using recombinant factor Va variants FVa-R506Q/R679Q and FVa-R306Q/R679Q, PF4 was shown to impair APC proteolysis of FVa at position Arg306 by 3-fold both in the presence and absence of protein S. These data suggest that PF4 contributes to the poorly understood APC resistance phenotype associated with activated platelets. Finally, despite PF4 binding to the APC Gla domain, we show that APC in the presence of PF4 retains its ability to initiate PAR-1-mediated cytoprotective signaling. In summary, we propose that PF4 acts as a critical regulator of APC generation, but also differentially targets APC toward cytoprotective, rather than anticoagulant function at sites of vascular injury with concurrent platelet activation.

Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein zymogen, which is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on the surface of endothelial cells (for review, see Refs. 1Dahlback B.

Activated protein C (APC) down-regulates the coagulation cascade by inactivation of procoagulant cofactors, factor Va (FVa) and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) (6Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol.

Homozygous protein C deficiency causes purpura fulminans in neonates (8Seligsohn U. Berger A. Abend M. Rubin L. Attias D. Zivelin A. Rapaport S.I. N. Engl. J.

Proteolysis of FVa and FVIIIa by APC is enhanced >20-fold in the presence of protein S, which acts as a cofactor for APC (10Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5521-5524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, inherited or acquired protein S deficiency is also associated with significantly increased risk of thrombosis (11Comp P.C. Nixon R.R. Cooper M.R. Esmon C.T. J. Clin.

Recent studies have demonstrated that APC bound to EPCR via its Gla domain can also initiate protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1)-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling in endothelial cells (13Cheng T. Liu D. Griffin J.H. Fernandez J.A. Castellino F. Rosen E.D. Fukudome K. Zlokovic B.V. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 14Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cytoprotective properties of APC are of therapeutic benefit to patients with severe sepsis syndrome (15Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5107) Google Scholar). FVa inactivation by APC occurs due to limited proteolytic cleavage of FVa at positions Arg506 and Arg306 (16Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that FVa inactivation by APC occurs rapidly in the presence of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (16Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Oliver J.A. Monroe D.M. Church F.C. Roberts H.R. Hoffman M. Blood. 2002; 100: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, APC-mediated FVa inactivation is markedly inhibited in the presence of activated platelets (17Oliver J.A. Monroe D.M. Church F.C. Roberts H.R. Hoffman M. Blood. 2002; 100: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Stern D.M. Nawroth P.P. Harris K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 713-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one or more mechanisms through which platelet-mediated APC resistance occurs are unclear. However, previous work has indicated that platelet-mediated inhibition of APC anticoagulant function is enhanced by an unidentified protein component of the platelet secretory granules released following platelet activation (19Jane S.M. Mitchell C.A. Hau L. Salem H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that platelet factor 4 (PF4) may play an important role in regulating protein C activation (20Slungaard A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PF4 is synthesized in megakaryocytes, and subsequently stored in platelet α-granules (20Slungaard A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast to other cationic proteins, PF4 enhances APC generation up to 25-fold on endothelial cell surfaces (21Slungaard A. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Key N.S. Long J.R. Piegors D.J. Lentz S.R. Blood. 2003; 102: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Slungaard A. Key N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25549-25556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This specific enhancement has been attributed to a PF4-mediated increase in the affinity of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex for protein C, resulting in a 30-fold decreased Km for protein C activation (22Slungaard A. Key N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25549-25556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, subsequent studies demonstrated that enhancement is mediated through the interaction between PF4 and the protein C Gla domain (23Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The protein C/APC Gla domain also plays critical roles in regulating both APC anticoagulant and cytoprotective signaling properties. However, the functional consequences of the interaction between the APC Gla domain and PF4 in relation to APC anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic functions have not previously been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that PF4, in contrast to its role in protein C activation, attenuates APC anticoagulant activity in plasma. Furthermore, PF4 inhibits the ability of protein S to function as a cofactor for APC. Finally, despite PF4 binding to the protein C/APC Gla domain, we also demonstrate that the APC Gla domain interaction with EPCR is preserved, such that APC in the presence of PF4 retains its ability to initiate PAR-1-mediated cytoprotective signaling. Consequently, our findings support a novel physiological role for PF4 in modulating APC function. Materials—Human PF4 was purchased from both Hematologic Technologies Inc.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 80 μl of protein C-deficient plasma was incubated with 20 μl of PPP Reagent containing 5 pm tissue factor and 4 μm phospholipids (PC/PS/PE, 60%/20%/20%) in the presence or absence of APC (1.25-10 nm, all final concentrations). Thrombin generation was initiated by automatic dispensation of 2.5 mm fluorogenic thrombin substrate (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-amidomethyl coumarin·HCl) and 100 mm CaCl2 into each well (final concentrations, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-amidomethyl coumarin·HCl, 0.42 mm, and CaCl2, 16.67 mm). Thrombin generation was determined using a thrombin calibration standard. Measurements were taken at 20-s intervals for 60 min, or until thrombin generation was complete. The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) of each reaction was then calculated. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and data were reported as mean ETP ± S.E. Protein S Enhancement of APC Anticoagulant Activity in Protein S-deficient Plasma—APC anticoagulant activity in protein S-deficient plasma in the presence of PF4 was determined using a similar assay to that described above. Briefly, protein S-deficient plasma was incubated with APC (10 nm) in the presence of plasma-purified protein S (6.25-100 nm). Thrombin generation was initiated and assessed using Thrombinoscope software as described previously. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data plotted as mean ETP ± S.E. Determination of Protein S-independent and Protein S-dependent APC-mediated FVa Proteolysis—FVa degradation by APC in the absence of protein S was assessed as previously described (26Tran S. Norstrom E. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6648-6655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recombinant FVa (0.8 nm, final concentration) was incubated with phospholipid vesicles (PS/PE/PC, 10%/20%/70%, 25 μm final concentration) in the presence or absence of PF4 (1 μm, final concentration) in HNBSACa buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.7, with 5 mg/ml BSA, and 5 mm CaCl2). APC (1.65 nm, final concentration) was added to initiate FVa inactivation, and aliquots were drawn at set time intervals over a 20-min time course. FVa inactivation was stopped by 1/25 dilution in ice-cold HNBSACa. The FVa activity was measured at each time point using a prothrombinase assay containing 5 nm FXa, 0.5 μm prothrombin, and phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS, 90%/10%, 50 μm final concentration) for 2 min, then stopped with 40-fold dilution in ice-cold EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% polyethylene glycol 6000, pH 7.9). The amount of thrombin formed was measured using a thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate BIOPHEN CS-01(38Han M.H. Hwang S.I. Roy D.B. Lundgren D.H. Price J.V. Ousman S.S. Fernald G.H. Gerlitz B. Robinson W.H. Baranzini S.E. Grinnell B.W. Raine C.S. Sobel R.A. Han D.K. Steinman L. Nature. 2008; 451: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The residual FVa activity was determined by comparison with the FVa activity observed prior to APC incubation. The plotted values represent the mean of at least three individual experiments ± S.E. Protein S-dependent FVa proteolysis was measured at protein S concentrations in the presence or absence of PF4. Human protein S (2.5-25 nm) was incubated with 0.8 nm APC, 8 nm FVa, and 75 μm phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS/PE, 60%/20%/20%) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (0.2 nm APC, 2 nm FVa, and 19 μm phospholipid vesicles, final concentrations) for 2 min at 37 °C. A 2-μl aliquot was added to 0.3 nm FXa, 1.5 μm prothrombin, and 75 μm phospholipid vesicles (0.1 nm FXa, 0.5 μm prothrombin, and 25 μm phospholipid vesicles, final concentrations) at 37 °C for 3 min. 5 μl of ice-cold 250 mm EDTA stopped the reaction. The rate of thrombin substrate cleavage was then measured as before. Calculation of Kinetic Rate Constants for APC-mediated Cleavage at Arg506 and Arg306 of FVa—To determine the pseudo-first order rate constants for APC-mediated cleavage of FVa inactivation sites Arg506 and Arg306, inactivation of FVa-R306Q/R679Q and FVa-R506Q/R679Q was assessed over time, and curves were fitted to the data according to a previously determined equation (27Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As each variant only possesses one cleavage site, the equation was modified to reflect this, as previously described (24Norstrom E.A. Steen M. Tran S. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24904-24911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). FVa degradation curves for FVa-R306Q/R679Q were fitted to Equation 1, Vat = Va0·e-(k506)·t + B·Va0·(1 - e-(k506)·t)(Eq. 1) where Vat is the FVa cofactor activity determined at time point t, Va0 is the FVa cofactor activity derived prior to incubation with APC, B is the remaining procoagulant activity of FVa cleaved at amino acid position 506, and k506 is the rate constant for cleavage at position 506. For determination of the rate constant for Arg306 cleavage, Equation 2 was used to fit the APC-mediated FVa degradation curve for FVa-R506Q/R679Q, Vat = Va0·e-(k306)·t + C·Va0·(1 - e-(k306)·t)(Eq. 2) where C is the remaining procoagulant activity of FVa cleaved at position 306, and k306 is the rate constant for cleavage at position 306. Measurement of Endothelial Cell Barrier Protection by APC—Endothelial cell barrier permeability was determined as described previously (28Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Briefly, EAhy926 cells (kind gift of Dr. C. Edgell, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) were grown to confluence on polycarbonate membrane Transwells (Costar, 3-μm pore size, 12-mm diameter) and incubated with 20 nm APC in the presence or absence of 1 μm PF4. After 3 h, the cells were treated with thrombin in serum-free media for 10 min. The cells were washed and incubated with 0.67 mg/ml Evans Blue with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Changes in endothelial cell barrier permeability were determined by following the increase in absorbance at 650 nm in the outer chamber over time due to the transmigration of Evans Blue-BSA. Experiments were performed in triplicate and plotted as the mean ± S.E. Determination of APC-mediated Protection of Apoptotic Endothelial Cells—Confluent EAhy926 cells in 6-well plates were pre-treated with APC ± PF4 for 17 h. EAhy926 cell apoptosis was induced by staurosporine (20 μm) treatment for 4 h. Cells were then trypsinized and RNA-extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out (High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems) then Real Time PCR was performed using Bax (Hs00180269_m1), Bcl-2 (Hs00153350_m1), and β-actin (Hs99999903_m1) TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) in a Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system. Experiments were performed in triplicate and plotted as mean Bax/Bcl-2 ratio ± S.E. PF4 impairs APC Anticoagulant Function in Plasma—PF4 interacts with the protein C Gla domain, thereby significantly enhancing APC generation on endothelial cell surfaces (21Slungaard A. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Key N.S. Long J.R. Piegors D.J. Lentz S.R. Blood. 2003; 102: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Slungaard A. Key N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25549-25556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Gla domain also plays a critical role in regulating APC anticoagulant function. Preliminary experiments using an APC-specific chromogenic assay indicated that APC amidolytic activity was unaltered by the presence of PF4 concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). Consequently, calibrated automated thrombography was used to assess the impact of PF4 upon APC attenuation of tissue factor-initiated thrombin generation in protein C-deficient plasma (25Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). APC alone reduced thrombin generation (Fig. 1A). Calculation of the area under the thrombin generation curve (ETP) indicated that 10 nm APC reduced thrombin generation to 9 ± 4% of the original ETP prior to APC incubation (Fig. 1A). However, co-incubation of the same APC concentration with PF4 reduced the inhibition of thrombin generation conferred by APC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). In the presence of 1 μm PF4 (a concentration at which protein C activation on endothelial cells is significantly enhanced (21Slungaard A. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Key N.S. Long J.R. Piegors D.J. Lentz S.R. Blood. 2003; 102: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Slungaard A. Key N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25549-25556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) the anticoagulant activity of 10 nm APC was significantly impaired, as thrombin generation was reduced to only 44 ± 4% of the original ETP, compared with 9 ± 4% in the absence of PF4 (Fig. 1A). To assess whether the presence of zymogen protein C altered the inhibitory activity of exogenous APC, the same experiment was performed in the presence of normal pooled plasma. Similar results were observed in APC-incubated normal pooled plasma in the presence of 1 μm PF4 (Fig. 1B). The same experiment was performed in the presence of a higher phospholipid concentration (25 μm), to exclude the possibility that the cationic PF4 inhibited APC anticoagulant activity by binding to and blocking access to crucial anionic phospholipid binding sites. However, PF4 was found to inhibit APC function in a similar manner (data not shown). The IC50 for PF4 inhibition of APC anticoagulant function was 12 μg/ml (0.4 μm), similar to PF4 serum concentration after platelet activation (22Slungaard A. Key N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25549-25556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, PF4 in the absence of APC also mildly inhibited thrombin generation (<25% at 1 μm PF4) (data not shown). This impairment was not mediated by PF4 inhibition of contact activation, because corn trypsin inhibitor, which eliminates the contribution of contact pathway activation to thrombin generation in this system, had no effect on the observed mild reduction in thrombin generation. Cationic Polypeptides Induce Diverse Functional Effects upon APC Anticoagulant Activity—To determine whether PF4 impairment of APC anticoagulant function represented a general functional consequence of cationic molecule association with APC, we assessed APC anticoagulant response in normal platelet-poor plasma in the presence of two other well characterized cationic polypeptides, protamine sulfate and Polybrene. APC impaired thrombin generation in a dose-dependent fashion as previously described (25Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, top panel). In the absence of APC, protamine sulfate and Polybrene both altered the dynamics of thrombin generation by reducing the peak thrombin generation and extending the time over which thrombin was generated (Fig. 2A, middle and lower panels). However, overall ETP was not significantly different to that determined in the absence of either cationic molecule (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, and in direct contrast to the inhibition of APC anticoagulant activity observed in the presence of PF4, both protamine sulfate and Polybrene rapidly enhanced APC anticoagulant activity. In the presence of either protamine sulfate or Polybrene (both 30 μg/ml), thrombin generation in normal plasma was entirely ablated in the presence of 5 nm APC, whereas APC alone under the same conditions only reduced thrombin generation by 41% (Fig. 2C). These findings demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of PF4 upon APC anticoagulant function is not solely mediated by its cationic nature. PF4 Impairs Protein S-dependent APC Anticoagulant Activity—APC binds to anionic phospholipids, and in complex with its cofactor protein S, down-regulates thrombin generation by inactivation of procoagulant cofactors FVa and FVIIIa (6Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Walker F.J. Sexton P.W. Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 571: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To investigate the one or more mechanisms by which PF4 inhibit APC anticoagulant activity, APC anticoagulant function was assessed in protein S-deficient plasma reconstituted with plasma-purified protein S. 10 nm APC in protein S-deficient plasma had no effect upon thrombin generation, as previously described (29Sere K.M. Rosing J. Hackeng T.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 3624-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). However, co-incubation with protein S (6.25-100 nm) facilitated a protein S-dependent impairment of thrombin generation (IC50 = 36 nm, Fig. 3, A and B). Co-incubation of 1 μm PF4 with APC/protein S significantly impaired protein S-enhancement of APC anticoagulant activity in plasma ∼3-fold (IC50 = 96 nm, Fig. 3, A and B). These data suggest that PF4 inhibition of APC anticoagulant activity in plasma is mediated in part by impairment of protein S cofactor enhancement of APC. APC anticoagulant activity is principally determined by its ability to initiate FVa proteolysis. To gain further insight into PF4 inhibition of APC anticoagulant function, the rate of FVa proteolysis in the presence or absence of protein S and/or PF4 was determined using an APC-mediated FVa degradation reaction dependent upon the presence of anionic phospholipids for efficient APC degradation of FVa. In preliminary experiments, PF4 was shown not to influence thrombin generation by the prothrombinase reaction used in this assay (data not shown). PF4 was found to impair APC-mediated FVa proteolysis, in particular the final stage of the characteristic biphasic FVa inactivation response (Fig. 3C). A modified version of this assay was used to evaluate the ability of PF4 to inhibit FVa proteolysis by APC in the presence of protein S. PF4 inhibited APC protein S-dependent FVa proteolysis ∼5-fold (Fig. 3D), based upon the protein S concentration required to enable half-maximal FVa inactivation in the presence and absence of PF4 (6.1 nm versus 1.2 nm protein S, respectively). Collectively, these results indicate that, in both plasma and purified factor assays, PF4 impairs protein S-cofactor-enhanced APC anticoagulant activity. These data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating interaction between PF4 and the Gla domain of protein C/APC and further suggest that this interaction may involve the C-terminal portion of the APC Gla domain. PF4 Impairs Arg306 but Not Arg506 Cleavage on FVa in the Presence and Absence of Protein S—To assess the potential mechanisms by which PF4 might impair APC anticoagulant activity, the ability of APC to inactivate recombinant FVa variants in which specific APC cleavage sites (Arg506 and Arg306) were substituted to prevent cleavage was assessed. Degradation of FVa variant FVa-R306Q/R679Q, in which only Arg506 cleavage by APC can occur, was unaffected by the presence of PF4, in either the presence or absence of protein S (data not shown). However, FVa degradation of FVa-R506Q/R679Q, in which only Arg306 cleavage takes place, was impaired by the presence of 1 μm PF4 in both the presence and absence of protein S (Fig. 4, A and B). Calculation of the rate constant for Arg306 cleavage by APC in FVa-R506Q/R679Q shows that the kinetic rate of Arg306 cleavage by APC in both the presence and absence of protein S was reduced by 3-fold (Fig. 4, C and D). PF4 therefore impairs APC anticoagulant activity in both plasma and purified protein assays via inhibition of the rate of Arg306 cleavage during FVa degradation by APC. PF4 Does Not Directly Influence APC Cytoprotective Function—APC bound to EPCR via its Gla domain can activate PAR-1 on endothelial cells, triggering complex intracellular signaling that result in anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic cellular responses (28Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 30Mosnier L.O. Griffin J.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether PF4 interaction with the protein C/APC Gla domain might impair APC-EPCR-PAR-1 cytoprotective signaling, an in vitro assay of endothelial cell barrier permeability was used. As previously reported, thrombin markedly enhanced endothelial barrier permeability, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5A). However, preincubation with APC significantly attenuated this thrombin-induced increase in permeability (p < 0.05, Fig. 5A). PF4 alone (up to 1 μm) had no independent effect upon endothelial barrier permeability, and did not protect against thrombin-mediated increased permeability. Finally, in contrast to its inhibition of APC anticoagulant activity, PF4 did not significantly inhibit the endothelial barrier protective properties of APC. Previous studies have demonstrated that APC regulates expression of both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes to confer an anti-apoptotic phenotype in endothelial cells. Moreover, these effects are also mediated via APC-EPCR-PAR1 signaling. To determine whether P"

Motifs recognized by sortases of the class-B (SrtB) are defined by the consensus sequence NP(Q/K)(T/S)(N/G/S)(D/A). Evidence supporting this consensus is limited to IsdC of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis, cleaved at motifs NPQTN and NPKTG, respectively. In Listeria monocytogenes, StrB has two substrates, Lmo2185 and Lmo2186, containing NAKTN and NKVTN (or the overlapping sequence NPKSS) as putative sorting motifs. Some of these motifs do not match the consensus, because they lack either proline (P) at position 2 or glutamine/lysine (Q/K) at position 3. Here, we identified NPKSS as a sorting motif of Lmo2186 by monitoring anchoring to peptidoglycan of chimeras lacking each of its two predicted motifs. Motif-swapping experiments confirmed that NPKSS, but not NKVTN, could replace NAKTN for anchoring of an Lmo2185 chimera. Residue substitutions in the NPKSS sequence revealed the essentiality of proline at position 2 for recognition of this particular motif. Lysine at position 3 was however dispensable. Deletion of NAKTN, on the other hand, abrogated SrtB-mediated anchoring of the Lmo2185 chimera. NAKTN, therefore, represents an exception to the rule of a conserved proline in position 2 of the sorting motif. Taken together, our data indicate that proline is not absolutely required for substrate recognition by sortases of the class-B. In addition, they prove the capacity of a single sortase, as SrtB of L. monocytogenes, to recognize varied amino acids at position 2 of the sorting motif.

The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is formed by a thick layer of peptidoglycan decorated with anionic polymers such as teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, and a myriad of surface proteins (1Pucciarelli M.G.

Surface proteins can be partially embedded in the membrane via lipid modification in their N termini or hydrophobic C-terminal anchoring domains. Noncovalent association of certain surface proteins with outermost cell wall components such as teichoic acid, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan is also known (1Pucciarelli M.G. Bierne H.

Another type of association is the covalent attachment of the surface protein to the peptidoglycan, exemplified by protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (2Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O.

Sortases are enzymes conserved in Gram-positive bacteria that promote covalent anchoring of surface proteins to the peptidoglycan (2Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Sortases anchor to the peptidoglycan individual proteins and pili. In this latter case, a specialized pili-dedicated sortase together with the housekeeping sortase are involved in the anchoring of polymerized pilin (6Mandlik A. Swierczynski A. Das A. Ton-That H. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 33-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In all cases known, sortases catalyze a transpeptidation reaction that occurs upon cleavage at a specific motif present in the C-terminal sorting signal of the protein substrate (2Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The sorting signal is composed of this motif followed by a hydrophobic domain and a positively charged tail (7Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A.

Recent genomic analyses have unveiled the existence of sortase homologs, all sharing a conserved TLXTC motif and a histidine (H) involved in catalysis (9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect.

These sortases are classified in five classes or subfamilies, according to their homology in primary sequence, tridimensional structure, clustering with genes encoding protein substrates, location of the membrane anchor domain of the sortase, and sorting motifs predicted to be recognized by the enzyme (2Marraffini L.A.

Thus, sortases (Srt) 2The abbreviations used are: Srt, sortase; Inl, internalin-. of the class A (SrtA, subfamily 1) recognize motifs with the consensus sequence LPXTG and are encoded by genes often non-clustered with those encoding their substrates (2Marraffini L.A.

Clubb R.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Dramsi S. Trieu-Cuot P. Bierne H. Res. Microbiol. 2005; 156: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, the sorting motif recognized by SrtB has been experimentally tested only with the surface protein IsdC involved in iron acquisition. IsdC of S. aureus and Bacillus anthracis are recognized by SrtB at NPQTN and NPKTG motifs, respectively (17Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bioinformatic analyses performed on available bacterial genome sequences have predicted different sorting motifs for sortases of other subfamilies and new putative sortase substrates (9Comfort D.

However, with the exceptions above noted for LPXTG, NPQTN, and NPKTG motifs, experimental data supporting the recognition of other sorting motifs are lacking. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen that contains two sortases, SrtA and SrtB (12Bierne H. Mazmanian S.K. Trost M. Pucciarelli M.G. Liu G. Dehoux P. Jansch L. Garcia-del Portillo F.

L. monocytogenes, as well as other species of the genus Listeria, are among the Gram-positive bacteria containing the highest number of surface proteins, in the range of 40–45, with predicted covalent association to peptidoglycan (1Pucciarelli M.G.

Proteomic analyses of cell wall material isolated from L monocytogenes srtA and srtB mutants revealed that SrtA anchors proteins bearing LPXTG motifs, while two surface proteins, Lmo2185 and Lmo2186, are anchored to the peptidoglycan in a StrB-dependent manner (12Bierne H. Mazmanian S.K. Trost M. Pucciarelli M.G. Liu G. Dehoux P. Jansch L. Garcia-del Portillo F. Schneewind O. Cossart P. Mol.

Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Both lmo2185 and lmo2186 genes are clustered in the same operon containing srtB (21Bierne H. Garandeau C. Pucciarelli M.G. Sabet C. Newton S. Garciadel Portillo F. Cossart P. Charbit A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1972-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This feature is also observed in S. aureus for srtB and isdC (17Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Like IsdC of S. aureus and B. anthracis, Lmo2185 and Lmo2186 contain NEAT domains, implicated in iron metabolism, and are encoded by genes forming part of a large operon that encodes components of a putative iron transporter (18Maresso A.W. Chapa T.J. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8145-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Bierne H. Cossart P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 377-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This L. monocytogenes operon is induced under iron deprivation (25Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Raynaud C. Shao Y. Jiang X. Dubail I. Archer C. Frehel C. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 927-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although no evidence for a role of Lmo2185 or Lmo2186 in withstanding low iron stress has been found. Another aspect undefined is the exact motif recognized by L. monocytogenes SrtB in each of these two surface proteins. We have previously shown that SrtB anchors to the peptidoglycan chimeras consisting of an N-fragment from Internalin-B (lacking the GW domains that promote attachment to the cell envelope (26Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)) fused in its C-end to the putative sorting signals of Lmo2185 or Lmo2186 (24Pucciarelli M.G. Calvo E. Sabet C. Bierne H. Cossart P. Garciadel Portillo F. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These sorting signals of Lmo2185 and Lmo2186 initiate with the NAKTN and NKVTNPKSS sequences, respectively. Given that the Lmo2186 sequence used in this work contained two putative SrtB motifs, NKVTN or NPKSS, our study did not formally identify the motif recognized by StrB in this surface protein. Of interest, neither the putative NAKTN motif of Lmo2185 nor NKVTN of Lmo2186 contain the invariant proline (P) at position 2 of the consensus NP(Q/K)(T/S)(N/G/S)(D/A) (9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, proteomic analyses reported the presence of a Lmo2186 peptide with the sequence SDSSNKVTNPK in peptidoglycan material of L. monocytogenes containing strongly associated mature proteins (24Pucciarelli M.G. Calvo E. Sabet C. Bierne H. Cossart P. Garciadel Portillo F. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This finding provided an indirect evidence for NPKSS as the motif recognized and cleaved by SrtB. Considering that the predicted motif of Lmo2185 lacks proline (P) at position 2 (NAKTN) and that two putative motifs can be assigned in Lmo2816, we were interested in defining the identity of the motifs recognized by SrtB of L. monocytogenes. Here, we provide the identity of these motifs and uncover the capacity of this sortase for naturally recognizing motifs with varied amino acid at position 2 of the sorting motif. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions-The L. monocytogenes strains used in this study are isogenic derivates of the wild-type virulent strain EGD-e (serotype 1/2a), with the complete genome sequence known (22Glaser P.

Open table in a new tab Construction of Plasmids Expressing Variants of the InlB-CterLmo2185 and InlB-CterLmo2186 Chimeras-Plasmids expressing the InlB-CterLmo2185 and InlB-CterLmo2186 protein fusions have been previously described (24Pucciarelli M.G. Calvo E. Sabet C. Bierne H. Cossart P. Garciadel Portillo F. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Both fusions contain amino acids 1–398 of InlB (lacking GW domains) followed by residues 536–569 of Lmo2185 (InlB-CterLmo2185) or residues 170–207 of Lmo2186 (InlB-CterLmo2186). These plasmids were used as template to generate variants in which putative motifs were deleted or mutated at specific sites. Table 2 lists the complete set of plasmids constructed for this work. These variants were generated by amplification of two regions encompassing the InlB and C-terminal sorting signal sequences, respectively, followed by overlapping PCR and cloning of the resulting product in pP1 plasmid (27Trieu-Cuot P. Carlier C. Poyart-Salmeron C. Courvalin P. Gene. 1991; 102: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) using the SacI and SphI restriction sites. The ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used in the case of the plasmid pJM021, expressing a InlB-CterLmo2186-variant bearing only the putative motif NKVTN (Table 2).

Briefly, bacteria grown overnight in BHI medium (A600 = 3.0) and contained in 1 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and once in TS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m sucrose). The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (TS buffer containing 60 μg/ml mutanolysin (Sigma, catalog no. M9901), 250 μg/ml RNase, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, catalog no. 1873580)) and incubated with slow-rotating agitation at 37 °C for 1 h. Protoplast formation was monitored using optical microscopy and plating. Protoplasts were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatants (cell wall fractions) were filtered and precipitated on ice in 16% trichloroacetic acid for 45 min. Proteins present in the cell wall fraction were recovered by centrifugation at 21,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C, washed in cold-acetone and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. An appropriate volume of Laemmli sample buffer was added to both protoplast and cell wall fractions. The extracellular medium fraction was prepared from the supernatant collected after the centrifugation of the bacterial culture, which was passed through 0.22-μm pore size Millipore filters. Proteins were precipitated using a 10% trichloroacetic acid and acetone washing procedure as described (21Bierne H. Garandeau C. Pucciarelli M.G. Sabet C. Newton S. Garciadel Portillo F. Cossart P. Charbit A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1972-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the amount of each fraction loaded into the gels corresponded to a 6:4:1 ratio in the number of bacteria for the cell wall:extracellular medium:protoplast fractions, respectively. Proteins were resolved by Tris-glycine polyacrylamide electrophoresis, using 8% gels. The experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Immunoblot Analyses-The different chimeras were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-InlB antibody (29Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-InlA (30Mengaud J. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Mege R.M. Cossart P. Cell. 1996; 84: 923-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) was also used as control proteins for the cell wall fractions. Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) was used as secondary antibodies. Proteins recognized by the antibodies were visualized by chemoluminescence using the luciferin-luminol reagents. In the case of requiring more sensitivity, the ECL Western blotting detection system was used (Amersham Biosciences, catalog: RPN2209). In some cases, the relative amount of protein anchored to the peptidoglycan was assessed by quantification of specific bands corresponding to the chimera obtained in cell wall versus protoplast fractions using the Quantity One 1-D Software, v. 4.6.5, from Bio-Rad. NPKSS Is a Motif Recognized by Sortase-B (SrtB) of L. monocytogenes in Lmo2186-The surface protein Lmo2186 (207 amino acids) contains a C-terminal sorting region predicted to initiate with the motif NKVTNPKSS, followed by a stretch of 22 hydrophobic amino acids and a positively charged tail (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that an InlB-CterLmo2186 chimera containing this sorting signal is anchored to the peptidoglycan in a StrB-dependent manner (24Pucciarelli M.G. Calvo E. Sabet C. Bierne H. Cossart P. Garciadel Portillo F. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the exact identity of the motif was not investigated. To determine this, new InlB-Cter-Lmo2186 chimeras were constructed bearing either NKVTN or NPKSS as the only motif (Fig. 2A). These variants were expressed in wild-type (EGD-e) and isogenic ΔsrtA or ΔsrtB bacteria, which were grown to stationary phase in BHI nutrient medium. Upon mutanolysin digestion of peptidoglycan, bacteria were fractionated into cell wall extracts and protoplasts containing cytosol and membrane material. Proteins secreted to the growth medium were also examined as an additional fraction. InlB-CterLmo2186 chimeras containing as motifs NKVTNPKSS, NKTVN, or NPKSS were examined in these three fractions. Control assays with antibodies detecting Internalin-A (InlA), a SrtA substrate, verified the purity of the peptidoglycan fractions (Fig. 2B). Our results showed that the variants containing either NKVTNPKSS or NPKSS were efficiently anchored to the peptidoglycan (Fig. 2B). The NPKSS variant was however detected in the peptidoglycan at slightly lesser amounts than the one containing the entire NKVTNPKSS sequence (Fig. 2B). The presence of these two chimeras in the peptidoglycan was shown to require a functional SrtB and to be independent of SrtA (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the variant bearing only the NKVTN sequence was not anchored to the peptidoglycan in any of the three genetic backgrounds tested (Fig. 2C). This variant was detected in large amounts in the growth medium (data not shown). Because NPKSS shares amino acids at positions 1 and 2 with the previously validated motifs NPQTN and NPKTG, our data support a prominent role of these two positions for substrate recognition by SrtB sortases.FIGURE 2The NPKSS sequence of Lmo2186 is recognized as sorting motif by the sortase SrtB.

These chimeras were expressed in wild-type, ΔsrtA, and ΔsrtB strains. Analysis of peptidoglycan material obtained from these strains showed that NPKSS, but not NKVTN, was recognized by SrtB to promote anchoring of the InlB-Cter-Lmo2185 chimera (Fig. 3B). An InlB-Cter-Lmo2185 variant lacking the NAKTN motif was also generated for these assays. Importantly, the analysis of protoplast, cell wall, and extracellular medium fractions showed that the lack of NAKTN totally abrogated the recognition and anchoring to peptidoglycan of the chimera by SrtB, resulting in its secretion to the extracellular medium (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results confirmed the recognition of NPKSS by SrtB, even when placed in the context of the heterologous sorting signal of Lmo2185. Likewise, the data unveiled the unique capacity of L. monocytogenes SrtB for recognizing a sorting motif lacking the invariant proline at position (2Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), exemplified by NAKTN. Proline (P) at Position 2, and Not Lysine (K) at Position 3, Is Essential for the Recognition of NPKSS by SrtB-The above experiments demonstrated that NAKTN (Lmo2185) and NPKSS (Lmo2186), but not NKVTN, are recognized as sorting motifs by L. monocytogenes SrtB. These data suggested that lysine (K) at position 3 could play an important role for SrtB recognition. To test this hypothesis, we generated new variants using the NPKSS sequence as template and the C-terminal sorting signal of Lmo2186. These NPKSS variants carried changes at position 2 (NAKSS); 3 (NPQSS); and 3-4-5 (NPQTN) (Fig. 4A). The latter variant was designed to recreate the NPQTN motif recognized in IsdC by the S. aureus SrtB, which lacks lysine (K) at position 3. Analysis of cell wall, protoplast, and extracellular fractions revealed that NPKSS and NPQSS were recognized as sorting motifs since the respective chimeras were detected in the cell wall (Fig. 4B). Although the chimera harboring the NPQTN motif was expressed at lower levels than the others chimeras used, it was also detected in cell wall extracts. A densitometry analysis confirmed the recognition of the NPQTN motif to an extent comparable to those of the motif NPKSS and the NAKTNPKSS sequence present in Lmo2186 (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, we concluded that NPQTN is recognized by the L. monocytogenes sortase SrtB. On the other hand, a P → A change in the position 2 of the NPKSS motif of Lmo2186 (NAKSS variant) abrogated anchoring to the peptidoglycan (Fig. 4, B and C). Control experiments using a ΔsrtB strain revealed that in those cases in which the anchoring to peptidoglycan was detected for a particular chimera, this was SrtB-dependent (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrated that, unlike lysine (K) at position 3, proline (P) at position 2 is essential for recognition of the NPKSS sorting motif by the L. monocytogenes SrtB sortase. In this work, we have identified the sorting motifs of Lmo2185 and Lmo2186, two L. monocytogenes surface proteins that are anchored to the peptidoglycan in an SrtB-dependent manner (24Pucciarelli M.G. Calvo E. Sabet C. Bierne H. Cossart P. Garciadel Portillo F. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our previous proteomic study identified the SDSSNKVTNPK peptide, corresponding to Lmo2186, in material obtained from cell wall extracts (24Pucciarelli M.G. Calvo E. Sabet C. Bierne H. Cossart P. Garciadel Portillo F. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The detection of such peptide in the cell wall-derived extract suggested, although not proved, that NPKSS could be the sorting motif recognized by SrtB in Lmo2186. These proteomic analyses also provided evidence for a marked presence of peptides from Lmo2185 and Lmo2186 within the pool of peptides obtained upon trypsin digestion of the cell wall material (24Pucciarelli M.G.

In fact, Lmo2185 and Lmo2186 peptides were identified at a higher rate that those of other surface proteins with similar molecular weight. Lmo2185 and Lmo2186 seem therefore to be abundant among the set of proteins covalently bound to the peptidoglycan, which implies that SrtB of L. monocytogenes must be a sortase displaying high activity in vivo. Taking in account these observations, we focused on the unequivocal identification of sorting motifs recognized by SrtB in Lmo2185 and Lmo2186. To this aim, chimeras harboring natural and recombinant sequences expected to be recognized by this sortase were analyzed. This experimental design relied on predictions considering that the sequences NAKTN in Lmo2185, and NKVTN (or the overlapping NPKSS) in Lmo2186, could be recognized as sorting motifs (2Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect.

Our experiments showed that NPKSS, but not the upstream sequence NKVTN, is absolutely required for SrtB-mediated anchoring of a chimera containing the C-terminal end of Lmo2186. This result was in agreement with the consensus motif NP(Q/K)(T/S)(N/G/S)(D/A), proposed by Comfort and Clubb (9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) for the class-B sortases (StrB) upon comparison of multiple bacterial genome sequences. Next, we further explored the essentiality of the residues composing the NPKSS sorting motif of Lmo2186. The P → A substitution was shown to abrogate anchoring of the corresponding chimera bearing the NAKSS variant. This result, to our knowledge, represents the first evidence supporting the essentiality of proline (P) at position 2 of the motif for recognition by sortases of the class B (StrB). It is important to note that the relevance of proline (P) at position 2 for substrate recognition was previously shown for sortases of the class A (SrtA). In this case, a P → N substitution at position 2 of the LPETG motif of protein A resulted in impaired anchoring of this surface protein to the S. aureus cell wall (7Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The key role of proline (P) for sortase recognition is also evident in most substrates predicted for other sortases, as those of subfamilies 3 and 4 (9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genes encoding StrB homologs have been found in several bacterial genera as Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Listeria, Clostridium, and Streptococcus (2Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Dramsi S. Trieu-Cuot P. Bierne H. Res. Microbiol. 2005; 156: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, while every StrB substrate predicted in staphylococci has proline (P) at position 2, SrtB substrates with varied amino acids at position 2 have been predicted in both Bacillus and Listeria species. Thus, Bacillus spp. have substrates with either proline (P) or serine (S) at position 2, whereas those of Listeria spp. contain either proline (P) or alanine (A) at the same position. These observations, together with the data obtained for the case of the Lmo2185 motif (see below), show that proline (P) at position 2 is not an absolute requirement for substrate recognition by SrtB sortases. Similarly, the mutational analysis performed on the NPKSS motif of Lmo2186 led us also to conclude that lysine (K) at position 3 is not essential for SrtB recognition. Thus, a chimera bearing the NPQSS variant was efficiently anchored to the peptidoglycan. This result was unexpected considering the rather different chemical character of lysine (K), a charged residue, with respect to glutamine (Q), a hydrophilic uncharged residue. The apparent dispensability of lysine (K) at position 3 of the NPKSS motif of Lmo2186 contrasts with its conservation in the NAKTN motif of Lmo2185. This lysine is also conserved in most of the StrB substrates predicted by bioinformatic analyses (20Boekhorst J. de Been M.W. Kleerebezem M. Siezen R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4928-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and in the NPKTG motif of IsdC, validated in B. anthracis (18Maresso A.W. Chapa T.J. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8145-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The dispensability of the lysine (K) in position 3 of the NPKSS motif could be explained in the context of the flanking sequences. Our experiments with Lmo2186 chimeras lacking each of the two probable overlapping sorting motifs revealed that the wild-type sequence NKVTNPKSS was recognized with a slightly higher efficiently than the construction bearing only NPKSS (see Fig. 2C). Although indirectly, this observation supports the idea of residues located upstream of NPKSS contributing to the recognition of Lmo2186 by SrtB. Mutational analysis of these flanking residues might provide insights on the molecular features that ultimately determine the extent of interaction and recognition by the sortase. The concept of highly conserved amino acids that are apparently dispensable for recognition is not limited to the lysine (K) in position 3 of the NPKSS motif. Thus, the pioneering work of Schneewind et al. (7Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) revealed that, despite its high conservation, the threonine (T) present in the LPETG motif of S. aureus protein A was dispensable for anchoring of this surface protein to the peptidoglycan. Our study has also uncovered NAKTN as the genuine sorting motif of Lmo2185 recognized by SrtB of L. monocytogenes. This finding reinforces the idea of a single sortase capable of recognizing in its natural substrates distinct amino acids at position 2 of their respective motifs. Interestingly, sortases classified in the subfamily 5 (class-D) are predicted to recognize motifs with a consensus sequence NA(E/A/S/H)TG (9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which contains an invariant alanine (A) at position 2. Sortases of subfamily 5 are found in Streptomyces spp., Corynebacterium spp., Tropheryma whipplei, Thermobifida fusca, and Bifidobacterium longum. None of these Gram-positive bacteria have either SrtA or SrtB homologs. In fact, it has been proposed that sortases of the subfamily 5 could play a housekeeping role equivalent to that assigned to SrtA (9Comfort D. Clubb R.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2710-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that SrtB could have evolved by acquiring some properties inherent to sortases of the subfamily 5 and the class-A (SrtA), which recognize alanine (A) or proline (P) at position 2 of the sorting motif, respectively. Such assumption could explain the flexibility of the L. monocytogenes SrtB for recognizing varied amino acids at the position 2 of the sorting motif. To our knowledge, this property had not been shown for any sortase before this study. Data validating SrtB substrates of Bacillus species containing serine (S) at position 2 of the motif could be of high value to further support the capacity of sortases of the class B for recognizing varied amino acids at this position.

https://openalex.org/W1974380315,"The PrP gene encodes the cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPc) which has been shown to be crucial to the development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). PrP knock-out mice, which do not express endogenous PrPc, exhibit resistance to TSE disease. The regulation of PrP gene expression represents, therefore, a crucial factor in the development of TSEs. Two sequence motifs in the PrP promoter (positions –287 to –263 from transcriptional start) were previously reported as being highly conserved, and it was suggested that they represent binding sites for as yet unidentified transcription factors. To test this hypothesis, binding of nuclear proteins was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using ovine or murine cells and tissues with radiolabeled DNA probes containing the conserved motif sequences. Specific binding was observed to both motifs, and polymorphic variants of these motifs exhibited differential binding. Two proteins bound to these motifs were identified as the Yin Yang 1 (YY1) (motif 1) and E4BP4 (motif 2) transcription factors. Functional promoter analysis of four different promoter variants revealed that motif 1 (YY1) was associated with inhibitory activity in the context of the PrP promoter, whereas motif 2 (E4BP4) was linked to a slight enhancing activity. This represents the first demonstration of binding of nuclear factors to two highly conserved DNA sequence motifs within mammalian PrP promoters. The action of these factors on the PrP promoter is haplotype-specific, leading us to propose that the prion protein expression pattern and, with it, the distribution of TSE infectivity may be associated with PrP promoter genotype.

The ovine PrP gene (PRNP in human, prn-p in mice) encodes the prion protein (PrPC), 4The abbreviations used are: PrPc, cellular prion protein; TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy; YY1, Yin Yang 1 transcription factor; bZIP, basic leucine zipper transcription factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NE, nuclear extract; PAR, proline-acidic amino acid-rich transcription factors. which is a crucial component of prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). This group of diseases include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (1Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Dormont D. Hunter N. British Medical Bulletin Series of Expert Reviews. Oxford University Press, Oxford2003: 321Google Scholar). The hallmark of TSEs is the aggregation of a pathological isoform PrPSc of the cellular PrPC protein (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). PrPC is highly expressed in neurons of the brain and also found in many other tissues, especially the lymphoreticular system. Prn-p knock-out mice, which do not express endogenous PrPC, exhibit resistance to TSE disease (3Manson J.C. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Aitchison L. McConnell I. Hope J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with differing copy numbers of the prn-p gene show a clear relationship between expression level and disease progression, characterized by changes in incubation periods (4Manson J.C. Clarke A.R. McBride P.A. McConnell I. Hope J. Neurodegeneration. 1994; 3: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar). It is assumed that the TSE agent can only replicate in cells expressing PrPC, so that up- or down-regulation of the PrP promoter can have consequences for the distribution of the agent in the host and, therefore, the risk of transmission; for example, from consumption of specific animal parts or blood transfusion in humans (5Johnson R.T. Lancet Neurol. 2005; 10: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Beside its key role in disease, the physiological function of PrPC remains elusive with signal transduction, synaptic transmission, neuroprotection, and immunoregulation among the proposed properties (6Hu W. Rosenberg R.N. Stüve O. Acta Neurol. Scand. 2007; 116: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The subtle phenotypes observed in PrPC knock-out mice are as diverse as disturbance of circadian rhythm (7Zomosa-Signoret V. Arnaud J.D. Fontes P. Alvarez-Martinez M.T. Liautard J.P. Vet. Res. 2008; 39: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and abnormalities in tooth development (8Schneider K. Korkmaz Y. Addicks K. Lang H. Raab W.H. J. Endod. 2007; 33: 110-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the regulation of the ovine PrP gene expression will help to clarify its physiological and disease-related physiological role. Surprisingly, given its importance in the development of TSEs, very little is known about the DNA motifs involved in the regulation of the PrP gene. Regulatory sequences have been mapped to a region ∼90 base pairs upstream of the rat and bovine genes that appears to depend for activity on elements in intron 1 (9Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Matsumoto Y. Onodera T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Inoue S. Tanaka M. Horiuchi M. Ishiguro N. Shinagawa M. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1997; 59: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and exon 1 (11Haigh C.L. Wright J.A. Brown D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This upstream region is rich in consensus binding sites for SP1 that are highly conserved between species (12Premzl M. Gamulin V. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two polymorphisms in the bovine PrP gene promoter have been shown to alter the binding of transcription factors RP58 and SP1, thereby changing the expression of reporter genes (13Sander P. Hamann H. Drögemüller C. Kashkevich K. Schiebel K. Leeb T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37408-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There are also four highly conserved sequences, designated motifs 1–4, located within the region –220 to –290 (14Westaway D. Cooper C. Turner S. Dacosta M. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6418-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the presence of a T to C polymorphism within motif 1 (–278 to –290) of the ovine PrP promoter (15O’Neill G.T. Donnelly K. Marshall E. Cairns D. Goldmann W. Hunter N. J. Anim. Breed Genet. 2003; 120: 114-123Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16O’Neill Cairns D. Goldmann W. Toovey L. Hunter N. J. Anim. Breed. Genet. 2005; 122: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Additionally, motif 2 (–266 to –278) contains a species-specific sequence variation where the ruminant PrP promoter contains a C (TTACGTAA), whereas the non-ruminant promoter containsaTatthe same position (TTATGTAA). The aim of this study was to identify factors that bind to the ovine PrP gene promoter and to determine their role in transcriptional regulation. Our data reveal binding of the transcription factors YY1 to motif 1 and of E4BP4 to motif 2. Whereas YY1 acted as an inhibitor but only bound to one PrP haplotype, E4BP4 acted as an activator of transcription binding with different affinities to all PrP haplotypes. DNA Probes-Complimentary pairs of oligonucleotides (Eurofins MWG, Germany) containing the conserved motif sequences were annealed forming short double-stranded DNA fragments (probes) that were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Southampton, UK). The following probes (only top strand sequence given) were used: M1T, 5′-TAATCTTTCATTTTCTCCAT-3′; M1C, 5′-TAATCTTCCATTTTCTCCAT-3′; M2C, 5′-TTCTCCATTACGTAACGAGA-3′; M2T, 5′-TTCTCCATTATGTAACGAGA-3′; M1CM2C, 5′-TAATCTTCCATTTTCTCCATTACGTAACGAGA-3′; NC-1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)-DNA probes were incubated in binding assays with nuclear extracts (NEs) prepared from ovine cell cultures (cerebellar-derived cell culture IS120Cer, liver-derived cell culture IS120Liv, brain cell cultures sA80BR and pA80BR), murine neuroblastoma cell line N2a, human cervical cancer HeLa cells (Promega), or from tissues derived from C57BL mice and from sheep using the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce). EMSAs were performed using the gel shift assay kit (Promega). Reactions consisted of 2 μl of 5× binding buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.5 μg poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC)), 1–2 μl (10–20 μg) NE, and dH2O to a total volume of 10 μl incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. To the reaction mixture 1 μl of 32P labeled double-stranded DNA probe (0.035 pmol, ∼10,000–50,000 cpm/10–100 fmol) was added and further incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. For competition experiments a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor and/or non-competitor (NC-1) double-stranded DNA probes were added. The reactions were electrophoresed in a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA at 250 V at room temperature for 1 h, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Antibody Competition Assay-EMSAs were performed as before except for the addition of the antibody (1–2 μg, Transcruz™ Gel Supershift antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) immediately after the appropriate 32P-labeled probe was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 45 min before gel electrophoresis. The antibodies used were the rabbit polyclonal antibody H-414 (anti-YY1, specificity demonstrated for YY1 of mouse, rat, and human origin) and the goat polyclonal antibody V-19 (anti-E4BP4, specificity demonstrated for E4BP4 of mouse, rat, and human origin). Transcription Factor Analysis Software-Transcription factor binding sites were analyzed with the TFSEARCH program (Version 1.3) using the TRANSFAC matrix Table 2.5 (19Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Promoter Constructs-The plasmid pNPU10 as described in O’Neill et al. (15O’Neill G.T. Donnelly K. Marshall E. Cairns D. Goldmann W. Hunter N. J. Anim. Breed Genet. 2003; 120: 114-123Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) contains a sheep promoter fragment equivalent to positions 5226–5747 of the PrP sequence (GenBank™ accession number U67922). pNPU10 has the combination of C5382 in motif 1 and G5622 (SP1 site) as described in O’Neill et al. (16O’Neill Cairns D. Goldmann W. Toovey L. Hunter N. J. Anim. Breed. Genet. 2005; 122: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In vitro mutagenesis with the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit and XL1-Blue Supercompetent cells (Stratagene) was used to change C5382 to T5382 on pNPU10 to create plasmid pNPU6TC. This plasmid was used in another round of in vitro mutagenesis to change CG into AA at positions 5397/5398 to create plasmid pNPU2TAA. The promoter fragment was PCR-amplified from all three plasmids with oligonucleotides ProMluWg1 (5′-TCAGACGCGTTGACGGCAGGTGATGGCTAA-3′), ProBglWg2 (5′-AGTTAGATCTGCGGCTGTCAGCGACT-3′), and PCR products were purified with QIAquick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into pGem-T-Easy. pGemT-2TAA was then changed by in vitro mutagenesis to C in position 5382 to create pGEMT-7CAA. The four different promoter fragments were excised with restriction enzymes, MluI and BglII (New England Biolabs) and inserted into MluI and BglII sites in plasmid pGL3Basic (Promega). The promoter sequences of the four resulting plasmids (p110-1, p7CAA, p6TC, p2TAA) were verified by sequencing of both strands. Cell Culture-Ovine cell cultures sA80BR and pA80BR, derived from fetal sheep brain tissue, were grown as described (17John H.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); they contained a mixture of neuronal and glial cells. Two primary ovine cell cultures derived from the cerebellum (IS120Cer) and liver (IS120Liv) were produced from a 1.5-year-old Icelandic short-tailed sheep (Ovis brachyuran borealis pall) by standard methods (18Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells; A Manual of Basic Technique.2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). In short, tissue was recovered in ∼2-cm2 segments from brain and liver and mechanically macerated into smaller pieces. After incubation with 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min, the cell debris was pelletted, and the suspended cells (lysate) were removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh trypsin solution, and the process was repeated three times. All cells (lysates) were resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Aliquots of the lysates in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium were added to pre-gelatinized (0.1%) 25-cm2 flasks and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Growing cell colonies were occasionally dislodged to reach confluent growth before passage. Murine neuroblastoma cells (N2a, ATTC number CCL131) were provided by Dr. Herbert Baybutt, Neuropathogenesis Division, Roslin Institute. N2a cells were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s minimum essential medium glucose (1 g/liter), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Fisher) with the addition of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Fisher). N2a cells were maintained at 37 °C, and sA80Br and pA80BR cells were maintained at 33 °C; all cells were grown without antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient Transfections-N2a cells on 6-well plates at ∼90% confluence were transiently transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in a 500-μl transfection mixture containing 250 ng of plasmid DNA. Cells were incubated for 4 h in the transfection mixture, which was then replaced with 2 ml of normal growth medium. Cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. Three transfections per construct series were performed. Results were averaged, and Student’s t test was applied for statistical analysis. Luciferase Assays-N2a cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Cell lysis was carried out for 15 min with shaking, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined in extracts of transfected cells using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Motif 1 and motif 2 are highly conserved sequences (Fig. 1) located at ∼280–300 base pairs upstream of the ovine PrP promoter transcription start site (see Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Luciferase reporter gene assays.

Only the M1C probe binds with high affinity to a nuclear protein shown by the shift of the probe to a higher molecular weight (lane 8, Fig. 2A). This binding was competed out by the addition of increasing concentrations (10-, 100-, and 200-fold molar excess) of unlabeled M1C probe (competitor) (lanes 9–11, Fig. 2A). Competition with the unlabeled NC-1 probe (non-competitor) had no effect on the formation of the M1C DNA-protein complex, verifying that binding to the variant motif 1 site was sequence-specific (lane 12, Fig. 2A). In contrast, the M1T probe failed to show a band shift with the ovine sA80BR cell culture NE (lane 2, Fig. 2A), although a much weaker signal similar to the M1C probe was occasionally detectable with ovine nuclear extract. This differential binding was also observed with both the M1C and the M1T probes when this assay was performed using the pA80BR, IS120Liv, or IS120Cer NEs (data not shown). A search of transcription factor binding site databases revealed the highest similarity between the consensus motif of transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and the variant motif 1 sequence (20Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To determine whether YY1 was actually part of the motif 1 DNA-protein complex, we employed an anti-YY1 antibody in competition assays performed with the M1C probe incubated with pA80BR NE. The addition of the anti-YY1 antibody resulted in the abolition of the initial M1C DNA-protein complex (lane 3, Fig. 2B and compare with lane 2, Fig. 2B). The competition assay was repeated with murine N2a cell NE with the same result (data not shown). The M1C probe was then incubated with ovine pA80BR NE, and increasing concentrations of the anti-YY1 antibody were added (Fig. 2C). The amount of the DNA-protein complex (lane 2, Fig. 2C) gradually decreased as more anti-YY1 antibody was added until it was no longer detectable at a12 dilution of the antibody (lanes 3–12, Fig. 2C). This concentration-dependent reduction provided further evidence that it was indeed the transcription factor YY1 that was bound to the variant motif 1 site. The competition assay was repeated with the M1C probe and an unrelated anti-E4BP4 antibody with no apparent effect on the M1C DNA-protein complex, indicating that the reaction seen with the anti-YY1 antibody was likely to have been caused by the antibody itself and not a component of the antiserum. Specificity for the M1C probe was evident from the fact that no change in the M2C DNA-protein complex was observed when the ruminant motif 2 probe M2C was incubated with the anti-YY1 antibody (lane 9, Fig. 2B). Binding to the motif 1 probes was also analyzed with NEs prepared from ovine and murine brain tissue, and three specific M1C DNA-protein complexes (I, II, and III, lanes 6 and 10, Fig. 2D) were observed, the smallest of which (complex III) appeared to be similar to the YY1 complex observed with the ovine pA80BR cell culture NE (lane 2, Fig. 2D). The assay was repeated using the anti-YY1 antibody as a blocking agent as described above (lanes 9–15, Fig. 2D). Only complex III was blocked (lane 15, Fig. 2D), confirming that the YY1 transcription factor also binds to the M1C probe in the ovine brain NE. A similar blocking reaction on other promoters has been reported with the same anti-YY1 antibody (21Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although a definite supershift reaction has also been noted (22Dyer K.D. Rosenberg H.F. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The two additional complexes were not affected by the YY1 antibody added either before or after the addition of the DNA probe, evidently representing the binding of other as yet unidentified proteins. These complexes are not related to each other, as complex I is absent with the M1T probe, whereas complex II binds to both the M1C and M1T probes equally (data not shown). In addition, complex I appears to be absent in nuclear extracts prepared from murine spleen (Fig. 2D, lanes 9–12) and liver tissue (data not shown), indicating that this factor may be brain-specific. Motif 2-The ruminant (sheep, goat, cattle, deer) motif 2 core sequence (TTACGTAA) differs from the non-ruminant (mouse, Syrian hamster, human, and rat) motif 2 sequence by a single base change of C to T (TTATGTAA) (Fig. 1). EMSAs showed that the ruminant motif 2 (M2C) probe was bound with high affinity by protein(s) present in the ovine pA80BR cell culture NE as well as in the murine N2a cell culture NE (lanes 2 and 10, respectively, Fig. 3A). In contrast, the non-ruminant motif 2 (M2T) probe was bound with much less affinity by what may be the same protein(s) based on comparisons of their electrophoretic mobilities (lanes 6 and 14, respectively, Fig. 3A). Binding was competed out by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor probe (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15, Fig. 3A). In contrast, binding was not affected by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NC-1 probe (non-competitor) (lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16, Fig. 3A), indicating that the complexes are sequence-specific. The same results were observed with both the M2C and M2T probes when this assay was performed using the ovine sA80BR, IS120Liv, and IS120Cer NEs (data not shown). A strong candidate for motif 2 binding was the E4BP4 transcription factor, which recognizes the palindromic motif of TTACGTAA (23Cowell I.G. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether the protein bound to motif 2 was E4BP4 we employed an anti-E4BP4 antibody in a supershift assay with ovine pA80BR nuclear extract. The supershift assays were carried out by adding the antibody either before (data not shown) or immediately after the addition of the radiolabeled probe (lanes 1–5, Fig. 3B). In addition, two different sets of incubation conditions were used, either for 45 min at room temperature (lanes 1–5, Fig. 3B) or overnight at +4 °C (data not shown). No supershift of the original M2C DNA-protein complex was observed with ovine pA80BR NE under any of the conditions tested (lanes 1–5, Fig. 3B). To verify that the conditions for a supershift were correct, the anti-E4BP4 antibody was incubated with murine N2a cell NE in combination with the M2C probe (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the ovine pA80BR cell NE experiments, a supershift occurred with the murine N2a cell NE (lane 3, Fig. 3C), and no supershift reaction was observed when the NE was omitted (lane 4, Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the initial shift and the supershift were both competed out by the addition of unlabeled M2C probe (competitor) but not with unlabeled NC-1 probe (non-competitor) (lanes 5 and 6, respectively, Fig. 3C). A similar supershift was observed for the M2T probe with the murine N2a cell NE, indicating that the E4BP4 transcription factor is able to bind to both the ruminant and non-ruminant forms of motif 2 in mouse cell NE (lane 9, Fig. 3C). In addition, a supershift was seen for the M2T probe with the human HeLa NE (lane 15, Fig. 3C). A complex similar in electrophoretic mobility to E4BP4 was observed with NEs derived from ovine and murine brain tissues and the M2C probe (lanes 2 and 10, respectively, Fig. 3D). A slight difference in electrophoretic mobilities was observed between the complexes from the murine brain and liver NEs (lanes 2 and 6, respectively, Fig. 3D) and also between the IS120Cer and IS120Liv NEs (lanes 18 and 22, respectively, Fig. 3D). The significance of these differences remains to be established; however, they may represent the binding of tissue-specific homo- and heterodimers to the same motif. Analysis of Potential Interactions between Motif 1 and Motif 2 Binding Factors-In the ovine PrP promoter, motifs 1 and 2 are contiguous, and their proximity may influence the pattern of transcription factor binding. The ability of both factors to bind at the same time was investigated using a series of double-motif probes that contained the different combinations of motifs 1 and 2 and their variants. Based on the results from the single motif probe experiments, the strongest binding for both factors is predicted for the combination of the C-haplotype motif 1 and the ruminant motif 2 (M1CM2C probe). Two individual complexes were observed with the M1CM2C probe and pA80BR NE, which were consistent with the separate formation of a M1C or a M2C DNA-protein complex (lane 2, Fig. 4). Both complexes were competed out by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled M1CM2C competitor probe (lane 3, Fig. 4) but were not affected by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NC-1 non-competitor probe (lane 7, Fig. 4). Competition with either one of the single motif probes M1C or M2C at a 100-fold molar excess led as expected to the inhibition of the formation of the motif 1 or motif 2 complexes, respectively, but not of both together (lanes 4 and 6, respectively, Fig. 4). In addition, only the smaller complex was specifically blocked after the addition of anti-YY1 antibody, demonstrating that this complex represented the binding of the YY1 transcription factor (lane 5, Fig. 4). At no time was an additional shift complex seen (indicative of the binding of both complexes to the promoter sequence at the same time), suggesting that the binding of these factors is mutually exclusive, most likely caused by steric hindrance with this close sequence motif arrangement. Promoter-Reporter Gene Assays-To verify that both motifs can modulate transcription, we generated four constructs in which the luciferase open reading frame was under the control of the PrP promoter. As shown in Fig. 5, ovine motif 2 was present or absent in combination with T-haplotype or C-haplotype motif 1 both in the arrangement and distance to each other as found normally in the ovine PrP promoter. N2a cells were transfected, and luciferase activity was measured for each construct (Fig. 5C). The activity for p2TAA (T-haplotype motif 1 without motif 2) was set to 100%. A relative reduction was observed in two of the other three combinations of motifs 1 and 2. A highly significant reduction to 64% (S.D. ± 6) (p = 0.001) was seen with construct p7CAA (C-haplotype motif 1 without motif 2), indicating that factor YY1 repressed transcription. In contrast, a significant increase to 136% (S.D. ± 10) was seen for construct p6TC (T-haplotype motif 1 with motif 2) which appears to reveal the activator role of, probably, E4BP4. There was no significant difference between p110/1 (C-haplotype motif 1 with motif 2) and p2TAA, which can be interpreted as an indication of interference of the transcription factors binding to motif 1 and 2. The high conservation of short sequence motifs in the ruminant, rodent, and human PrP gene promoters was first described by Westaway et al. (14Westaway D. Cooper C. Turner S. Dacosta M. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6418-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but has never been investigated properly. Here we tested the hypothesis that motif 1 and motif 2 are transcription factor binding sites. Special emphasis was given to the fact that the affinity for these potential factors may be associated with ovine C- and T-haplotypes of motif 1 (15O’Neill G.T. Donnelly K. Marshall E. Cairns D. Goldmann W. Hunter N. J. Anim. Breed Genet. 2003; 120: 114-123Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and a species-specific sequence variation in motif 2. The YY1 Transcription Factor Binds to the Variant Motif 1 Site-Our experiments with nuclear extract from cell cultures have shown that the motif 1 sequence (CTTTCATTTTCT), as published for human PRNP, mouse prn-p, and sheep PrP promoters, does not form a stable protein-DNA complex under the conditions used in the mobility shift assays. However, a single base pair change from T to C in motif 1, whic"
