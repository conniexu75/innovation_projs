https://openalex.org/W2020978880,"IT has long been known that certain species of marine animals contain arsenic in their tissues at concentrations up to 100 p.p.m. (ref. 1), and there is little doubt that this arsenic is naturally acquired and does not reflect environmental pollution. The toxicity of arsenic is dependent on its chemical environment and valency state2,3. Since the demonstration of the rapid and complete excretion by the human kidney of arsenic consumed in fish and shellfish1,4, it has been accepted that such arsenic is in an organic and nontoxic form5. Clearly full toxicological evaluation of the arsenic in marine animals awaits the elucidation of the precise chemical nature of that arsenic. We have found that mussels (Mytilus edulis planulatus Lamarck), western rock lobster (Panulirus longipes cygnus George), and stingray (Dasyatis thetidis Waite) contain dimethylated and trimethylated arsenic together with a small proportion of inorganic arsenic."

https://openalex.org/W1978958006,"THE possible use of nonspecific immunity to control Babesia infections has not been much examined. Cattle treated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (1.25 µg per kg live weight) immediately before infection with B. argentina ( =B. bovis) were slightly more resistant than controls1. An interferon inducer, a double stranded RNA, slightly delayed death in mice infected with B. rodhaini2. The question has been reopened by some work with B. microti and B. rodhaini in which mice injected intravenously (i.v.) with 2×107 Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG (Glaxo strain) became completely immune to intraperitoneal challenge with 106 Babesia parasites3. These remarkable results suggested that the method should be examined in domestic animals. We decided to assess it in calves and report here that BCG fails to protect against infection with B. divergens, the common cause of redwater in the UK."
