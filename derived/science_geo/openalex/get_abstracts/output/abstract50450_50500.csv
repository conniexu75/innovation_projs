https://openalex.org/W1495376651,"Quantitative studies of MCF-7 cells (derived from human breast adenocarcinoma) and CV-1 cells (from normal African green monkey kidney epithelium), using the permeant cationic compound tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy using rhodamine 123 (Rh123), indicate that the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials affect both uptake and retention of these compounds. Under conditions that depolarize the plasma membrane, uptake and retention of TPP and Rh123, driven only by the mitochondrial membrane potential, is greater in MCF-7 than in CV-1. An ionophore that dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential of MCF-7 cells causes them to resemble CV-1 cells by decreasing uptake and retention. Hyperpolarizing the mitochondrial membrane of CV-1 increases accumulation and prolongs retention; hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane further heightens this effect, causing the uptake of CV-1 cells to resemble that of MCF-7 cells even more closely. The greater uptake and retention by MCF-7 appears to be a consequence of elevated mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials. The plasma membrane potential affects mitochondrial retention of TPP and Rh123 and its role in enhancing the effect of a difference in mitochondrial membrane potential is explained."
https://openalex.org/W2092954099,"When Drosophila cells are heat shocked, the translation of normal cellular mRNAs is repressed, while mRNAs encoding the heat-shock proteins are translated at high rates. We have found that the hsp70 message is not translated at high temperatures when its leader sequence is deleted. This message is translated when the cells are allowed to recover at 25 degrees C, but the translation ceases when the cells are given a second heat shock. A message with an extra 39 bases added onto the 5' end of the leader behaves in the same way. However, if either of two conserved sequence elements in the leader is deleted, the message is still translated during heat shock. Although the specific feature responsible for the preferential translation of heat-shock messages is not yet identified, we conclude that it must reside in the 5' untranslated leader."
https://openalex.org/W2092716257,"Chemical probes sensitive to alterations in DNA conformation, especially Z-DNA, have been identified. These permit cleavage of DNA at sites of unusual structure, the results of which can be displayed on a sequencing gel. Using supercoiled plasmids containing inserts of d(C-G)16 and d(C-A)31 X d(T-G)31, it was found that hydroxylamine and osmium tetraoxide react preferentially with cytosines and thymines, respectively, near B-DNA-Z-DNA junctions; diethylpyrocarbonate reacts more strongly with purines within Z-DNA regions; and dimethylsulfate and diethylsulfate react more strongly with guanines in Z-DNA that are out of phase with the usual pattern of purine-pyrimidine alternation. Our results show that B-Z boundaries are mobile and that with increasing torsional strain, the Z-DNA regions can expand to include nonalternating nucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1520440482,"Cofilin, a 21,000 molecular weight actin-regulatory protein (Nishida, E., Maekawa, S., and Sakai, H. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5307-5313), was here shown to be capable of reversibly controlling actin polymerization and depolymerization in a pH-sensitive manner. When cofilin was reacted with F-actin at different pH, the depolymerized actin concentration (= monomeric actin concentration) was higher at elevated pH. At pH less than 7.3, the monomeric actin concentrations did not exceed approximately 1 microM even in the presence of excess amounts of cofilin, whereas at pH greater than 7.3 it increased in proportion to the concentration of cofilin added, and complete depolymerization of F-actin occurred by the addition of an excess amount of cofilin. Moreover, in the presence of cofilin, rapid interconversion of monomeric and polymeric forms of actin can be induced by simply changing the pH of the medium. Thus, this study provides a new possible mechanism regulating actin polymerization, pH control."
https://openalex.org/W1584529073,"Treatment of rabbits with 1% (v/v) acetone for 1 week resulted in the appearance in blood serum of 88 +/- 14 14 nmol/ml 1-hydroxyacetone (acetol) and 70 +/- 9 nmol/ml 1,2-propanediol. Untreated rabbits had no detectable 1,2-propanediol or acetol. Hepatic microsomes from control, ethanol-, and acetone-treated rabbits catalyzed the hydroxylation of acetone at rates of 0.32 +/- 0.01, 2.01 +/- 0.43, and 3.64 +/- 0.23 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The same microsomal preparations catalyzed the hydroxylation of acetol at rates of 0.33 +/- 0.04, 0.94 +/- 0.20, and 1.08 +/- 0.12 nmol/min/ mg of microsomal protein, respectively. Isozyme 3a purified from acetone- or ethanol-treated rabbits was identical as judged by comparison of the high performance liquid chromatographic profiles of tryptic digests of the two proteins. Antibody to isozyme 3a inhibited greater than 90% of the acetone monooxygenase activity from untreated, acetone-, or ethanol-treated rabbits. In contrast, the antibody only inhibited 30% of the acetol monooxygenase activity of microsomes from untreated rabbits. The inhibition was increased to about 70% after acetone or ethanol treatment. Although the activities were inhibited to different extents, a comparison of the rates attributable to isozyme 3a from antibody inhibition experiments indicated that both activities were induced to a similar extent by ethanol. Similarly, acetone also increased both activities to the same extent but was more effective than ethanol. In a reconstituted system, isozyme 3a was the only isozyme of six forms from rabbit liver to exhibit acetone monooxygenase activity. Isozyme 3a was the most active enzyme in the hydroxylation of acetol, but isozymes 2, 3b, and 4 also were able to catalyze the reaction. Antibody to isozyme 3a also inhibited greater than 90% of the acetone hydroxylase activity and 70% of the acetol hydroxylase activity of microsomes from acetone-treated rats. Two proteins were immunochemically stained on Western blots of microsomes from untreated and acetone-treated rats, one of which was increased by acetone treatment. These results suggest that isozyme 3a in rabbit and an immunochemically homologous enzyme in rat are responsible for acetone and acetol hydroxylation, the initial steps in the proposed gluconeogenic pathways for acetone."
https://openalex.org/W1544314658,"The amount of light scattered by a mitochondrial suspension depends on matrix volume (Tedeschi, H., and Harris, D.L. (1955) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 58, 52-67), a correlation which has been extensively exploited for qualitative studies of solute transport across the inner membrane. To obtain reliable, quantitative estimates of solute transport, it is first necessary to characterize the factors determining mitochondrial light scattering. We show that the dependence of absorbance on mitochondrial concentration can be linearized, resulting in an intrinsic light scattering parameter which is independent of the concentration and source of mitochondria. We show that the absorbance osmotic curve is segmentally linear, exhibiting discontinuities which disappear irreversibly following preswelling. In contrast, direct measurements reveal matrix volume to be reversibly and linearly dependent on inverse osmolality. This divergence is a consequence of the fact that the optical technique samples total particle volume, including contributions from folded membranes and trapped medium. These contributions are minimized by structural components, such as intermembrane connections and the outer membrane, which contribute to efficient packaging of the mitochondrion. When these structures are broken, the mitochondrion cannot return to its native state. We observe that the swelling-induced, irreversible transition from efficient packaging to a random packing state begins at a matrix volume of 1.9 microliter/mg and is complete at 3.1 microliter/mg. These findings complicate the interpretation of light scattering results but do not appear to present an insurmountable obstacle to the quantitative application of this technique to transport kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2160345282,"Intracellular free calcium (Ca2+ i) is thought to be an important second messenger for phagocyte functions. The fluorescent indicator Quin2 was used to measure and visualize [Ca2+]i in human neutrophils during chemotaxis toward, and phagocytosis of, opsonized zymosan. In neutrophils migrating toward zymosan, [Ca2+]i was highest in the lamellipodium. Neutrophils ingesting opsonized zymosan had the highest [Ca2+]i in the pseudopods and periphagosomal cytoplasm. Most of the increase in [Ca2+]i was from extracellular sources. Regional increments in [Ca2+]i are strategically located to modulate such cellular functions as chemotaxis, oxidative activity, and degranulation."
https://openalex.org/W2118977407,"Rat liver microsomes and mitochondria contain an amidohydrolase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acylethanolamine to ethanolamine and fatty acid. The enzyme is active over a wide range of pH, does not require divalent cations, and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-reactive agents. The detergents Triton X-100, sodium cholate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate are also inhibitory, but sodium taurodeoxycholate has little effect and was therefore used to solubilize the enzyme. The solubilized enzyme exhibits high substrate specificity for long-chain amides of ethanolamine. Amides of propanolamine or higher homologs are hydrolyzed at a drastically slower rate, and isomers prepared from long-chain amine and short-chain hydroxy acid are neither substrates nor inhibitors of the enzyme. Neither ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) nor N,O-diacylethanolamine is hydrolyzed. Both particulate and soluble enzyme preparations also catalyze the synthesis of N-acylethanolamine from ethanolamine and fatty acid, probably by the amidohydrolase acting in reverse."
https://openalex.org/W2033288103,"Barn owls raised with one ear plugged make systematic errors in auditory localization when the earplug is removed. Young owls correct their localization errors within a few weeks. However, such animals did not correct their auditory localization errors when deprived of vision. Moreover, when prisms were mounted in front of their eyes, they adjusted their auditory localization to match the visual error induced by the prisms, as long as the visual and auditory errors were within the same quadrant of directions. The results demonstrate that, during development, the visual system provides the spatial reference for fine-tuning auditory localization."
https://openalex.org/W1616860068,"Oxidative phosphorylation catalyzed by bovine heart submitochondrial particles appears to exhibit negative cooperativity with respect to [ADP] and positive cooperativity in catalysis. Eadie-Hofstee plots (v/[S]versus v) of the kinetics of oxidative phosphorylation at the variable ADP concentration range of 1-1200 microM were curvilinear and could be analyzed for two apparent KmADP values differing by one order of magnitude, and two apparent Vmax values. The KmADP values with either NADH or succinate as the respiratory substrate were in the ranges of 10 and 100 microM, and the Vmax values in nmol of ATP formed X min-1 (mg of protein)-1 were, respectively, 500 and 1840 when NADH was the oxidizable substrate, and 550 and 100 when succinate was the energy source. Site-site cooperativity of the ATP synthase, which is a central feature of current theories for the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation, has been well-documented for ATP hydrolysis by isolated F1-ATPase, but never before demonstrated for mitochondrial ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1525081901,"We have previously shown that rat cultured cells contain five isoforms of tropomyosin (Matsumura, F., Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., and Lin, J. J.-C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6636-6644) and that these tropomyosins are differentially expressed upon cell transformation (Matsumura, F., Lin, J. J.-C., Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., Thomas, G. P., and Topp, W. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13954-13964). To examine functions of tropomyosin in microfilament organization, we have purified and partially separated the multiple isoforms of tropomyosin by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. Analyses of cross-linked dimers produced by air oxidation have revealed that all isoforms except the tropomyosin isoform with apparent Mr of 35,000 form homodimers. Although these tropomyosins share many properties characteristic of tropomyosin, structural analyses at a peptide level and immunological analyses have shown that the five isoforms can be classified into two groups, i.e. tropomyosins with higher apparent Mr (Mr = 40,000, 36,500, and 35,000) and tropomyosins with lower apparent Mr (Mr = 32,400 and 32,000). The low Mr tropomyosins show less ability for head-to-tail polymerization and lower affinity to actin than the high Mr tropomyosins. We suggest that these differences in properties may be related to the changes in microfilament organization observed in transformed cells."

After 2 weeks of incubation, approximately 25 percent of the vectors contained new virus genotypes as the result of RNA segment reassortment. New viruses were transmitted when the mosquitoes fed on mice. Viruses ingested more than 2 days after the initial infecting virus did not cause superinfection of the mosquito vectors."
https://openalex.org/W1608553881,"Previously we showed that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol is formed from acetate, via squalene 2,3(S),22(S),23-dioxide and 24(S),25-oxidolanosterol, during the normal course of cholesterol biosynthesis in S10 rat liver homogenate (Nelson, J. A., Steckbeck, S. R., and Spencer, T. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1067-1068; Nelson, J. A., Steckbeck, S. R., and Spencer, T. A. (1981) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 6974-6975). Herein we demonstrate that the nonsaponifiable extract from human liver tissue contains 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol in an amount approximately 10(-3) relative to cholesterol. We show that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, like many other oxygenated sterols, represses hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity in cultured cells and binds to the cytosolic oxysterol-binding protein. Furthermore, we show that this epoxide is not rapidly metabolized in cultured cells. These results suggest that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol may participate in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol metabolism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1568866708,"alpha-Hemocyanin of Helix pomatia is a copper-containing glycoprotein which serves as an oxygen carrier in the hemolymph. Its carbohydrate moiety has as constituents fucose, xylose, 3-O-methylgalactose, mannose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and N-acetyl-glucosamine residues. Alkaline borhydride did not split off any carbohydrate material, suggesting the absence of O-glycosidic chains. The N-glycosidic carbohydrate chains of this glycoprotein were liberated by hydrazinolysis of a Pronase digest then fractionated as alditols on Bio-Gel P-4. The fractions containing the low-molecular-weight glycans were investigated by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with sugar and methylation analysis. The largest, and most abundant, compound was established to be: (Formula: see text). Another compound was characterized as the afuco analogue of this structure. H. pomatia alpha-hemocyanin is the first example of an animal glycoprotein having xylose as a constituent of N-glycosidic carbohydrate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1523596570,"The relationship between matrix volume and the amount of light scattered by a mitochondrial suspension has been characterized for equilibrium measurements and shown to depend in a complex but predictable manner on native structure of the mitochondrion (Beavis, A. D., Brannan, R. D., and Garlid, K. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13424-13433). In the present report, we show that this characterization also applies to kinetic measurements of salt and nonelectrolyte transport. We derive and evaluate quantitative methods for determining permeability constants from light scattering kinetics. We apply these equations to the problem of whether matrix swelling itself induces permeability changes secondary to membrane stretching or changes in surface available for transport. A study of erythritol transport over a 7-fold range of matrix volume reveals dramatic changes in light scattering rates, as previously observed (Tedeschi, H. (1959) J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 6, 241-252). These transitions correspond exactly to structure-dependent transitions in the relationship between absorbance and matrix volume. When this is taken into account, erythritol permeability is found to be constant over the entire volume range. Factors affecting intrinsic membrane porters, such as Mg2+ depletion and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, are also found to be without effect on erythritol permeability. The broader significance of this study is that the light scattering technique is shown to be capable of providing quantitative answers to important questions about solute transport across the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1561552296,"The regulation of vertebrate muscle contraction with respect to the role of the different subunits of myosin remains somewhat uncertain. One approach to gaining a better understanding of the molecular basis of contraction is to study developing muscle which undergoes changes in myosin isozyme composition and contractile properties during the normal course of maturation. The present study utilizes single fibers from psoas muscles of rabbits at several ages as a model system for fast-twitch muscle development. This approach eliminates the inherent problems of interpreting results from studies on whole muscles which usually contain heterogeneous fiber types with respect to contractile properties and isoenzyme composition. Maximum velocity of shortening and tension-generating ability of individual fibers were measured and the myosin heavy chain composition of the same fibers was examined using an ultrasensitive sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel system. The results indicate that 1) with regard to contractile properties, there is a transitional period from slow to fast shortening velocities within the first postnatal month; 2) a strong, positive correlation exists between the speed of shortening and tension-generating ability of individual postnatal day 7 fibers, suggesting that as more myosin is incorporated in these developing fibers it is of the fast type; and 3) there is a wide variation in maximum velocity of shortening among postnatal day 7 psoas fibers which is also a time when a mixture of heavy chain isoforms characterizes the myosin composition of single muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2148828258,"Somatic 5S RNA genes are transcribed preferentially over oocyte 5S RNA genes by 25- to greater than 200-fold when mixtures of cloned genes are injected into cleaving Xenopus embryos. This preference is an order of magnitude greater than that observed in cell-free extracts. Mutations that decrease the binding of the 5S RNA gene-specific transcription factor TFIIIA to the 5S RNA genes' internal control regions are exaggerated when assayed by embryo injection compared to in vitro transcription. Injection of TFIIIA into cleaving embryos greatly increases endogenous oocyte 5S RNA synthesis at midblastula even when DNA replication is inhibited. Much, but not all, of the preference for somatic over oocyte 5S RNA gene transcription in somatic cells can thus be attributed to the concentration of TFIIIA and to differences in binding constants of TFIIIA to the internal control regions of the two types of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1500639331,"Clostridium propionicum converts lactate to propionate (Cardon, B.P., and Barker, H.A. (1947) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 12, 165-171). We have obtained a soluble system that carries out this conversion as well as the hydration of acrylate to lactate and the reduction of acrylate to propionate. 3-Pentynyl-CoA inhibits reduction of acrylate and lactate to propionate, but not hydration of acrylate to lactate by cell extracts. The conversion probably involves CoA esters. When [beta-2H3] lactate is used as a substrate, the rate of propionate formation is reduced 1.8-fold, and the methyl group of the resulting propionate has lost 1.4 deuterium atoms. These results are consistent with the intermediate formation of acrylate (acrylyl-CoA) in the conversion of D-lactate to propionate. Two proteins, which we designate E I and E II, were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity. Together, they catalyze the hydration of acrylyl-CoA to lactyl-CoA. E I has an apparent molecular mass of 27,000 daltons and is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by O2. E II consists of two subunits of molecular mass 41,000 and 48,000 daltons and contains equal amounts of riboflavin and flavin mononucleotide. Hydration of acrylyl-CoA to lactyl-CoA requires Mg2+ and catalytic quantities of ATP. GTP can replace ATP, but ADP and adenylyl imidodiphosphate cannot. We were unable to detect any stable intermediate during acrylyl-CoA hydration. Finally, we proposed a mechanism for this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1508788836,"The ability of adriamycin to complex cardiolipin was used to determine the distribution of cardiolipin across the inner membrane of rat liver and heart mitochondria. In both mitochondrial types, about 57 +/- 5% of the total cardiolipin was found to be located in the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane. Mitochondria and mitoplasts were used to study the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, purified submitochondrial vesicles with inverted membrane orientation for the matrix face. The cardiolipin amount titrated by adriamycin in the latter was found to be complementary to the amount titrated in the cytoplasmic face. The adriamycin association constant determined for the first saturation level of mitochondria was in good agreement with the value published by Goormaghtigh et al. (Goormaghtigh, E., Chatelain, P., Caspers, J., and Ruysschaert, J. M. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 597, 1-14) for cardiolipin in artificial membranes. Two binding plateaus were observed when increasing amounts of adriamycin were added to mitochondria. The plateau at higher concentrations is conveniently explained by the penetration of adriamycin into mitochondria and the titration of cardiolipin in the matrix face. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding curves leading to the two plateaus produced almost identical association constants. The total amount of cardiolipin in mitochondria calculated from curves of this type corresponded to the total amount of cardiolipin determined by phosphate analysis of extracts, analyzed by thin layer chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1580274065,"The effect of fatty acids, palmitoyl-CoA, and N',N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide on the ion conductance of the reconstituted brown adipose tissue mitochondria uncoupling protein was investigated. 1, 5, and 10 microM palmitic acid induced a specific, GDP inhibited, increase in proton conductance in proteoliposomes containing the uncoupling protein but not in proteoliposomes prepared with purified protein extracts of liver mitochondria. 10 microM oleic acid, like palmitic acid, increased proton conductance in proteoliposomes prepared with the uncoupling protein. Palmitoyl-CoA and caprylic acid had no effect on increasing proton conductance. Similar to the observation in mitochondria, there was no effect of palmitic acid on Cl-conductance, but unlike mitochondria its activation by palmitoyl-CoA or inhibition by N',N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was lost. The results, obtained in an isolated system, provide support for the contention that long chain fatty acids act as an acute physiological activator of the uncoupling protein."
https://openalex.org/W1486973439,"We have studied the hepatic uptake of retinol bound to the circulating retinol binding protein-transthyretin complex. Labeled complex was obtained from the plasma of donor rats that were fed radioactive retinol. When labeled retinol-retinol binding protein-transthyretin complex was injected intravenously into control rats, about 45% of the administered dose was recovered in liver after 56 h. Parenchymal liver cells were responsible for an initial rapid uptake. Perisinusoidal stellate cells initially accumulated radioactivity more slowly than did the parenchymal cells, but after 16 h, these cells contained more radioactivity than the parenchymal cells. After 56 h, about 70% of the radioactivity recovered in liver was present in stellate cells. For the first 2 h after injection, most of the radioactivity in parenchymal cells was recovered as unesterified retinol. The radioactivity in the retinyl ester fraction increased after a lag period of about 2 h, and after 5 h more than 60% of the radioactivity was recovered as retinyl esters. In stellate cells, radioactivity was mostly present as retinyl esters at all time points examined. Uptake of retinol in both parenchymal cells and stellate cells was reduced considerably in vitamin A-deficient rats. Less than 5% of the injected dose of radioactivity was found in liver after 5-6 h (as compared to 25% in control rats), and the radioactivity recovered in liver from these animals was mostly in the unesterified retinol fraction. Studies with separated cells in vitro suggested that both parenchymal and stellate cells isolated from control rats were able to take up retinol from the retinol-retinol binding protein-transthyretin complex. This uptake was temperature dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1566885967,"The effect of individual bile acids on bile acid synthesis was studied in primary hepatocyte cultures. Relative rates of bile acid synthesis were measured as the conversion of lipoprotein [4-14C]cholesterol into 4-14C-labeled bile acids. Additions to the culture media of cholate, taurocholate, glycocholate, chenodeoxycholate, taurochenodeoxycholate, glycochenodeoxycholate, deoxycholate, and taurodeoxycholate (10-200 microM) did not inhibit bile acid synthesis. The addition of cholate (100 microM) to the medium raised the intracellular level of cholate 10-fold, documenting effective uptake of added bile acid by cultured hepatocytes. The addition of 200 microM taurocholate to cultured hepatocytes prelabeled with [4-14C]cholesterol did not result in inhibition of bile acid synthesis. Taurocholate (10-200 microM) also failed to inhibit bile acid synthesis in suspensions of freshly isolated hepatocytes after 2, 4, and 6 h of incubation. Surprisingly, the addition of taurocholate and taurochenodeoxycholate (10-200 microM) stimulated taurocholate synthesis from [2-14C]mevalonate-labeled cholesterol (p less than 0.05). Neither taurocholate nor taurochenodeoxycholate directly inhibited cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in the microsomes prepared from cholestyramine-fed rats. By contrast, 7-ketocholesterol and 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol strongly inhibited cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity at low concentrations (10 microM). In conclusion, these data strongly suggest that bile acids, at the level of the hepatocyte, do not directly inhibit bile acid synthesis from exogenous or endogenous cholesterol even at concentrations 3-6-fold higher than those found in rat portal blood."
https://openalex.org/W130271162,"We have measured the redox potentials for the flavin cofactor of native Old Yellow Enzyme and for a series of chemically modified flavin derivatives bound to the apoprotein. These flavin derivatives have midpoint potentials ranging from -120 to -300 mV in free solution. For the native enzyme, the midpoint potential of the first one-electron couple EFMNox + e- in equilibrium EFMN-. is E1 = -245 +/- 5 mV and that for the second one-electron couple EFMN-. + e- in equilibrium EFMN red is E2 = -215 +/- 5 mV in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C. Thus, the apoprotein lowers the two-electron midpoint potential of FMN below its value in free solution (Emid,bound = -230 mV, Emid,free = -210 mV). A similar effect on the two-electron midpoint potentials of most of the chemically modified flavins is observed upon binding to the apoprotein. Therefore, the relative order of the respective midpoint potentials of this series of flavins is maintained upon binding to the apoenzyme. However, the effect of the apoprotein on the separation between E1 and E2 varies considerably over this series of flavin derivatives, resulting in quite different levels of thermodynamic stability for the one-electron-reduced (semiquinone) forms of the flavin-substituted enzymes. The optical absorption spectra of these flavin-substituted enzymes were determined in the presence of several phenolic compounds which are known to bind to the native enzyme and to give characteristic long wavelength transitions. We have found that the positions of the wavelength maxima of these transitions are shifted to longer wavelengths as the measured redox potentials of the enzyme-bound flavins are increased. The relationship between the energy of these long wavelength transitions (expressed as vCT = 1/lambda max) and the redox potential of the enzyme-bound flavin is interpreted as further evidence that these transitions arise from charge-transfer complexes between the phenolic compounds and the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1526727222,"The copper complex of 3-ethoxy-2-oxobutyraldehyde bis(thiosemicarbazone) or CuKTS is reduced and dissociated upon reaction with Ehrlich cells. Titration of the cells with the complex leads to the specific binding of copper to metallothionein with 1 to 1 displacement of its complement of zinc. Under conditions of complete titration of metallothionein, 1.25-2.5 nmol CuKTS/10(7) cells, cellular DNA synthesis is rapidly inhibited but no long term effects on cell proliferation are observed. The kinetics of redistribution of Cu and Zn in Ehrlich cells in culture and in animals were studied after pulse reaction of CuKTS with cells. After exposure of cells to the noncytotoxic concentration of 2.5 nmol of CuKTS/10(7) cells, nonmetallothionein bound copper is lost rapidly from the cells, after which copper in metallothionein decays. New zinc metallothionein is made as soon as exposed cells are placed in culture. New synthesis stops when the level of zinc in metallothionein reaches control levels. A second pulse treatment of cells with CuKTS to displace zinc from metallothionein again stimulates new synthesis of the protein to restore its normal concentration. The kinetics of metal metabolism in Ehrlich cells exposed to 5.5 nmol of CuKTS/10(7) cells, which inhibits cell proliferation, are qualitatively similar except there is a pronounced lag before new zinc metallothionein is synthesized. The Ehrlich ascites tumor in mice responds to CuKTS similarly to cells in culture. It is also shown that cultured Ehrlich cells do not make extra zinc metallothionein in the presence of high levels of ZnCl2, and fail to accumulate copper in the presence of large concentrations of CuCl2."
https://openalex.org/W1527048835,"The molecular weight of bovine alpha-crystallin, isolated at 37 degrees C, was studied and found to be about 800,000. This contrasts with the results of Thomson and Augusteyn (Thomson, J. A., and Augusteyn, R. C. (1983) Exp. Eye Res. 37, 367-377) who isolated a species of about half this molecular weight. We show here that this form of alpha-crystallin can only be isolated under unphysiological conditions with regard to buffer pH and ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1500159081,"Treatment of intact GH1 cells with sodium molybdate inhibits the subsequent rate of nuclear accumulation of hormone-occupied glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors. Cells were incubated at 23 degrees C for 1 h with 30 mM molybdate and then for up to 30 min with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide or [3H]estradiol in the continued presence of molybdate. Although molybdate did not affect the rate of receptor occupancy with either steroid, cells treated with molybdate had more occupied cytosolic and fewer occupied nuclear receptors than control cells. For the glucocorticoid receptor, cells treated with molybdate had more 10 S and fewer 4 S cytosolic receptors than control cells. In low salt cytosol molybdate inhibits the temperature-mediated subunit dissociation of occupied 10 S glucocorticoid receptor. These results suggest that a hormone-mediated dissociation of an intracellular 10 S oligomeric glucocorticoid receptor form to its 4 S subunits is required prior to accumulation of occupied receptors in the nuclear fraction. In cells incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h or longer with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide, molybdate shifts the steady state intracellular distribution of receptor toward the 10 S cytosolic receptor form, consistent with the interpretation that molybdate affects the rapidly exchanging subunit equilibrium between the 10 S and 4 S cytosolic forms by slowing the rate of 10 S receptor dissociation. Molybdate prevents loss of glucocorticoid-occupied 10 S but not 4 S receptors in heated cytosol by stabilizing the relatively protease-resistant 10 S receptor. Since molybdate stabilizes 10 S oligomeric steroid receptors in vitro, the effects of molybdate on nuclear accumulation of occupied receptors in intact cells support the intracellular existence and physiological relevance of 10 S glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors. These results support a general model for steroid receptor activation in which binding of hormone promotes dissociation of intracellular 8-10 S oligomeric receptors to their DNA-binding subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1558015885,"It has been suggested that the cap-binding protein complex is involved in ATP-mediated melting of 5'-mRNA secondary structure to facilitate ribosome binding during initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells (Edery, I., Lee, K. A. W., and Sonenberg, N. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 2456-2462). Consequently, we have studied the interaction of dATP/ATP with the eukaryotic cap-binding protein complex by UV photoaffinity labeling. UV irradiation of the cap-binding protein complex in the presence of [alpha-32P]dATP/ATP resulted in the cross-linking of this compound to the 50-kDa polypeptide of the complex. This polypeptide is almost identical to the previously characterized eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A. We examined the ability of dATP/ATP to cross-link to eIF-4A and found that it cross-links less efficiently (approximately 60-fold on a molar basis) compared to the cross-linking obtained for the eIF-4A component of the cap-binding protein complex. Irradiation of purified eIF-4A together with the cap-binding protein complex in the presence of [alpha-32P]dATP resulted in greater than additive labeling of the eIF-4A component of the cap-binding protein complex and purified eIF-4A, suggesting a synergistic interaction between purified eIF-4A, the cap-binding protein complex, and dATP/ATP. We also report that photoaffinity labeling of eIF-4A and the eIF-4A component in the cap-binding protein complex is stimulated by eIF-4B, but not by other initiation factors or mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1643870387,"The cobalamin-dependent enzyme, methionine synthetase, has been purified approximately 1000-fold to apparent homogeneity from human placenta with a 19% recovery. The final two steps of the purification utilized two different affinity columns. The first was a N5-methyltetrahydrofolate-cystamine-agarose column, and the second was a S-adenosylhomocysteine-agarose column. The enzyme was eluted from the first affinity column by buffer containing reducing agent which released the folate and the enzyme while elution from the second affinity column was accomplished with buffer containing 0.5 M sodium chloride. Criteria for purity were the observations that single peaks of enzyme activity, protein, and cobalamin with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000 were obtained by gel filtration and that holomethionine synthetase contained 1 mol of cobalamin/mol of protein. Furthermore, analysis by high performance liquid chromatography using a molecular weight sizing column demonstrated a single peak of protein with a corresponding cobalamin peak. This single peak of protein was progressively converted to a second protein peak that was enzymatically inactive, and this conversion was associated with a directly proportional loss of enzyme activity and cobalamin from the first peak. Methionine synthetase appeared to have a molecular weight of 160,000 on unreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and subunits of Mr 90,000, 45,000, and 35,000 on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W2147596152,"The boundaries of gene conversion in variant-specific antigen genes have been determined in six clones of Trypanosoma brucei. In each clone, antigenic switching involved interaction between two telomeric members of the AnTat 1.1 multigene family, which share extensive homology throughout their coding regions. All conversion events occurred by substitution of faithful copies of donor sequences. Conversion endpoints were nonrandomly distributed. In four clones, the 5' conversion limit was near the antigen translation initiation codon, while in three clones, the 3' conversion limit was located at the ""hinge"" between the two major antigen domains. In one case, two segmental conversions were involved in antigen switching. These observations reveal that antigen gene conversion can occur without generating point mutations, and suggest that postrecombinational selection may impose a limit on the number of possible rearrangements within antigen genes."
https://openalex.org/W1585069387,"Human complement receptor type 2 (CR2) was biosynthetically labeled by pulsing SB B lymphoblastoid cells for 25 min with [35S]methionine followed by chase in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine. An Mr 134,000 polypeptide represented the major form of the receptor at the end of the pulse period, and within 1 h of chase this disappeared coincident with the appearance of the Mr 145,000 mature form of CR2. Precursor, but not mature, CR2 was sensitive to endoglycosidase H, indicating that maturation of CR2 represented processing of N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides to the complex type. The processing of precursor CR2 was impaired by monensin. In the presence of tunicamycin an Mr 111,000 form of CR2 was synthesized by SB cells, and this did not chase into either precursor or mature CR2. This Mr 111,000 form of CR2 did not incorporate [3H]glucosamine, indicating that it lacked both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide. The half-lives of mature CR2 and nonglycosylated CR2 pulse-labeled in the presence of tunicamycin were 13.8 and 2.8 h, respectively; the turnover rate of B1, a membrane protein normally lacking carbohydrate, was unaffected by the presence of the antibiotic. The percentage of pulse-labeled, nonglycosylated CR2 that was expressed at the cell surface after 1 h of chase in the presence of tunicamycin was 30%, identical to that of mature CR2 in cells chased in the absence of the antibiotic. However, after 6 h of chase there was no additional net accumulation of nonglycosylated CR2 at the plasma membrane, while the proportion of pulse-labeled mature CR2 at this site had risen to 81%. Therefore, N-linked oligosaccharides are essential for the stability of CR2 and have some role in its plasma membrane expression. In contrast, the observation that all three forms of CR2 bound to Sepharose C3 indicates that oligosaccharides are not necessary for the interaction between CR2 and its complement ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1545989348,"A photoaffinity analog of colchicine, 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoyldeacetylcolchicine, was synthesized by reacting deacetylcolchicine or [3H]deacetylcochicine with N-succinimidyl-6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate. Homogeneity of the photoaffinity analog was established by thin-layer chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The structure of the photoaffinity analog was determined by 1H and 13C NMR, infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopies, and elemental analysis. Binding of 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoyldeacetylcolchicine to bovine renal tubulin was measured by competition with [3H]colchicine. The value of the apparent Ki for the photoaffinity analog was 0.28 microM in the concentration range of 0.8-1.2 microM of the analog. A value of 0.50 microM for the apparent Kd was measured by the direct binding of the tritiated photoaffinity analog to tubulin. The analog is slightly more potent an inhibitor of microtubule formation than colchicine. The photoaffinity analog reacted with renal tubulin upon irradiation with a mercury lamp equipped with a 420-nm cutoff filter. Spectral and radiochemical analyses of the tubulin after photolysis and dialysis have demonstrated a stoichiometric incorporation of the photoaffinity analog in the alpha-subunit of the tubulin. Covalent labeling of tubulin with the photoaffinity analog decreases the extent of [3H]colchicine binding by more than 90%."
https://openalex.org/W1509541226,"The conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate to (-)-endo-fenchol is considered to proceed by the initial isomerization of the substrate to (-)-(3R)-linalyl pyrophosphate and the subsequent cyclization of this bound intermediate. To test this stereochemical scheme, phosphatase-free preparations of (-)-endo-fenchol cyclase from fennel (Foeniculum vulgare M.) fruit were repeatedly incubated with a sample of (3RS)-[1-3H2]linalyl pyrophosphate until approximately 50% of this precursor was converted to the bicyclic monoterpenol end product. The residual linalyl pyrophosphate was isolated and enzymatically hydrolyzed to the free alcohol, linalool, which was resolved by chiral phase capillary gas-liquid chromatography of the derived threo and erythro mixture of 1,2-epoxides. The predominance of the (3S)-enantiomer in the residual substrate indicated that the (3R)-enantiomer was preferred for the cyclization to (-)-(1S)-endo-fenchol. This conclusion was subsequently confirmed by the preparation and direct testing of (3R)-1Z-[1-3H] linalyl pyrophosphate, which afforded a Km value lower than that observed for geranyl pyrophosphate and a relative velocity nearly three times higher. (3S)-1Z-[1-3H]Linalyl pyrophosphate was not an effective substrate for (-)-endo-fenchol biosynthesis but did, by an anomalous cyclization, give rise to low levels of the enantiomeric (+)-(1R)-endo-fenchol as well as to other products. These results support the proposed stereochemical model and also suggest that the isomerization step is rate limiting in the coupled isomerization-cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to (-)-endo-fenchol."
https://openalex.org/W1511082471,"Limited proteolysis has been used to probe the subunit structure (Mr = 52,000) of the dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) component of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex from bovine liver. Digestion of the complex at 0 degrees C with a low concentration of trypsin produces an inner E2 core that retains the activity for the transacylation reaction and is completely dissociated from the decarboxylase (E1) component. The trypsinized E2 maintains the highly assembled structure and migrates faster than the native E2 in the Sepharose 4B column. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the inner E2 core consists of two lipoate-free tryptic fragments, i.e. fragment A and fragment B with Mr = 26,000 and 22,000, respectively. Both fragments apparently fail to bind the E1 component. Fragment A is converted into fragment B by increasing trypsin concentrations. Fragment B is a stable limit polypeptide containing the intersubunit-binding sites for E2. The assemblage of fragment B confers the cubelike appearance of the inner E2 core in electron micrographs. Activity measurements indicate that the larger fragment A, but not fragment B, possesses transacylation activity. It is likely that a critical portion of the active site is present in the 4,000-dalton fragment that is lost during the conversion of fragment A to B."
https://openalex.org/W84396783,"A dermatan sulfate proteoglycan has been isolated from a murine parietal yolk sac cell line, which in culture synthesizes basement membrane components. The proteoglycan has a molecular weight of 200,000-300,000 with 10-15 dermatan sulfate chains of Mr = 14,000-16,000. The glycosaminoglycan chains carry sulfate residues predominantly attached to C-4 of the galactosamine unit; less than 10% of the sulfate groups occur as 6-sulfated galactosamine units. About 60% of the uronic acid residues are of the glucuronic configuration, the rest being iduronic acid. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of chondroitinase ABC-treated 125I-labeled proteoglycan reveals two polypeptides with molecular weights of 34,000 and 27,000. Results from papain digestion of the proteoglycan suggest that most of the polysaccharide chains are clustered at a papain-resistant segment of the core protein (Mr = 8,000). This proteoglycan is distinctly different from the large cartilage proteoglycan in the smaller size of its core protein, and its relationship to other small chondroitin and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans and to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan recently located in rat tissue basement membranes will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1907463941,"Abstract An 80-kDa glycoprotein of Dictyostelium discoideum, designated contact site A, has been implicated in EDTA-stable cell adhesion. This protein is known to be the major sulfated protein of aggregation-competent cells and has been shown to contain two types of carbohydrate, sulfated type 1 and unsulfated type 2 carbohydrate moieties. Here we investigate the cell-free sulfation of this protein. In the homogenate of developing cells, [35S]sulfate was transferred by endogenous sulfotransferase from [35S]3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate to the contact site A glycoprotein and to various other endogenous proteins. The sulfate was transferred to carbohydrate rather than to tyrosine residues. After differential centrifugation of the homogenate, the capacity for sulfation of the contact site A glycoprotein was barely detected in the plasma membrane-enriched 10,000 X g pellet fraction which contained the bulk of this glycoprotein, but was largely recovered in the 100,000 X g pellet fraction which contained only a small portion of this glycoprotein. After sucrose gradient centrifugation, the membranes containing the sulfation capacity were found to have a density characteristic for Golgi membranes. In immunoblots, monoclonal antibodies raised against the contact site A glycoprotein recognized not only this 80-kDa protein, but also a sulfatable 68-kDa protein found in the 100,000 X g pellet fraction. The 68-kDa protein did not react with monoclonal antibodies against type 2 carbohydrate but was converted by endoglycosidases F and H into a 53-kDa protein, indicating that it was a partially glycosylated form of the 80-kDa glycoprotein containing only type 1 carbohydrate. Isoelectric focusing showed that a substantial portion of the 68-kDa glycoprotein was unsulfated, even after cell-free sulfation. The 68-kDa glycoprotein was not found in the plasma membrane-enriched 10,000 X g pellet fraction and did not accumulate in parallel with the 80-kDa contact site A glycoprotein during cell development. We conclude that the 68-kDa glycoprotein is a precursor that is converted by attachment of type 2 carbohydrate and sulfation of type 1 carbohydrate into the mature 80-kDa glycoprotein. The precursor nature of the 68-kDa glycoprotein was supported by results obtained with mutant HL220 which is defective in glycosylation (Murray, B. A., Wheeler, S., Jongens, T., and Loomis, W. F. (1984) Mol. Cell. Biol. 4, 514-519). This mutant specifically lacks type 2 carbohydrate and produces a 68-Kda glycoprotein instead of the 80-kDa contact site A glycoprotein (Yoshida, M., Stadler, J., Bertholdt, G., and Gerisch, G. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 2663-2670).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1618474895,"Abstract Rhodotorulic acid (RA), a dihydroxamate siderophore produced by Rhodotorula pilimanae, forms 3:2 complexes with ferric and chromic ions (M2RA3) at pH 7. Kinetically inert chromic complexes of RA have been separated into geometrical isomers and for the first time partially resolved into optical isomers. The three isomers delta-cis, delta-trans, and lambda-trans were characterized by their visible and circular dichroism spectra. Inhibition by both delta-isomers of radiolabeled ferric RA uptake in R. pilimanae was equally effective. However the lambda-cis isomer was significantly less effective as an inhibitor. Concentration-dependent uptake kinetics were performed with ferric RA and the ferric complex of synthetic enantio-RA, which form predominantly delta and lambda complexes, respectively. The lambda-enantio-Fe2RA3 was 50% less effective in supplying iron to R. pilimanae than was Fe2RA3. An additional synthetic analog of RA, which lacks a carbonyl group at the diketopiperazine ring, exhibited the same uptake rates as ferric RA. We conclude that stereoselective recognition of optical isomers takes place during iron uptake mediated by RA and that this recognition primarily involves the right-handed delta coordination propellor of the metal center and its adjacent functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W1660543772,"Proton NMR spectra of met-aquo-myoglobin have been recorded in whole dark muscle from yellowfin tuna for the first time; in addition, spectra of the met-aquo, met-cyano, and deoxy forms were recorded in solution. The number of resolved methyl resonances in the met-aquo and met-cyano derivatives of the purified protein indicates a molecular heterogeneity, with the two species present in a ratio of approximately 3:2. These same two species, in very similar environments, are found in whole muscle. Upon reconstitution of the protein, the ratio of the two species is approximately 1:1. Specific isotope labeling in the met-cyano form reveals an interchange of 5-methyl and 8-methyl environments that is characteristic of heme orientational disorder about the alpha, gamma-meso axis. Incubation of the met-cyano protein at 37 degrees C shows that the two species are interconvertible, with the minor component declining to about one-eighth of that of the major component. This indicates that one of the two orientations is favored thermodynamically. The rate of equilibration for the met-aquo protein is exceedingly slow (half-life greater than 30 days), some 10(2) slower than for the analogous sperm whale derivative. The reversed heme orientation is therefore present in muscle as a kinetically trapped or metastable species, suggesting that the last step in the biosynthesis of myoglobin is similar to that of in vitro reconstitution. The presence of both heme orientations in myoglobin in whole muscle proves that heme orientational disorder is a physiological phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1575458839,"In order to define the influence of skeletal protein organization on transmembrane phospholipid movement in erythrocyte membranes, we measured the translocation rate of lysophosphatidylcholine in pathologic red cells. A simple method based on the differential extraction of lysophosphatidylcholine from the red cell membrane by saline and albumin solutions was used to quantitate the translocation rate. Two groups of pathologic red cells were chosen for these studies: red cells with quantitative deficiencies of the skeletal proteins, spectrin and protein 4.1, and sickle erythrocytes in which controlled reorganization of the membrane was induced by hemoglobin polymerization. Marked increase in lipid translocation rate was seen in red cells having quantitative deficiencies of spectrin and protein 4.1. The magnitude of the increase in translocation rate in spectrin-deficient red cells was related to the magnitude of protein deficiency. Translocation rate in sickle erythrocyte membranes increased by 50% upon deoxygenation as a result of sickle hemoglobin polymerization. No increase in translocation rate was seen in normal cells upon deoxygenation. By manipulating the extent of membrane reorganization that occurred following deoxygenation of sickle cells, we have been able to show that skeletal reorganization induced by hemoglobin polymerization and not hemoglobin polymerization per se is responsible for the increase in translocation rate. Together, these findings imply that the structural organization of membrane skeletal proteins plays an important role in regulating the rate of transbilayer movement of lipids across the erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1533758817,"The electrostatic free energy contribution to the stability of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin was evaluated according to the static accessibility modified Tanford-Kirkwood model. The electrostatic free energy contribution of each distinct structural element was divided into one term arising from interactions between it and other elements (interelemental) and another from interactions within the particular element itself (intraelemental). At pH 7 the majority of the terms were found to be stabilizing. The interelemental terms are the dominant ones for most structural elements. The small interelemental terms of the C and D helices are compensated by large intraelemental interactions which stabilize these short helices. Perturbations in pH can be accommodated by the structural elements through a redistribution of stabilizing and destabilizing interactions. The electrostatic potentials calculated at the surface of the protein indicate that the internal compensation of local potentials achieved during folding results in a generally neutral protein-solvent interface save for two distinct areas of nonzero potential. The accessibility of each charged atom to solvent was analyzed in terms of the surface area lost to charged, polar and nonpolar atoms separately. The net solvent accessibility lost parallels closely that lost to nonpolar atoms alone, indicating a specific role for nonpolar atoms in defining dielectric shielding of charged atoms, aside from their participation in the well-known hydrophobic interactions."

The DSC heating curves of intact lipophorins showed endothermic peaks between -3 and 40 degrees C for lipophorins which contain hydrocarbons, whereas no such peaks were observed for lipophorins which do not contain this lipid. Hydrocarbon fractions isolated from the lipophorins showed endothermic peaks similar to those obtained from intact lipophorin in terms of the transition temperatures, the shapes, and the enthalpy changes. 13C spin lattice relaxation times of the (CH2)n resonance of hydrocarbons of intact lipophorin were measured as a function of temperature and revealed that the motions of hydrocarbon chains changed coincidentally with the onset and offset of phase transition. These data suggest the presence of a hydrocarbon-rich region within the lipophorin particles."
https://openalex.org/W1584205036,"We investigated the regulation of synthesis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in cultured luteinized human granulosa cells using a monoclonal antibody recognizing the human LDL receptor (IgG-C7). Cells cultured under serum-free conditions were treated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 8-bromo-cAMP alone or in combination with aminoglutethimide (to block conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones) and 5-cholesten-3 beta, 25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol, a potent suppressor of LDL receptor expression in human fibroblasts) and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine. A labeled protein immunoisolated with IgG-C7 was identified as the mature LDL receptor in 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels on the basis of an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa, absence of the protein from immunoisolates prepared with a monoclonal antibody against an irrelevant antigen, and an apparent decrease in molecular weight of the mature receptor upon treatment with neuraminidase or electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. hCG and 8-bromo-cAMP consistently increased the incorporation of radioactivity into the mature LDL receptor by 2-6-fold. The effect of hCG on LDL receptor synthesis was observed with as little as 10 mIU of hCG/ml and was apparent within 2 h of addition of the hormone. A combination of 25-hydroxycholesterol and aminoglutethimide resulted in a 60% suppression of label incorporation into mature LDL receptor compared to untreated cells. This would suggest some regulation of LDL receptor synthesis by negative feedback of sterol. However, both hCG and 8-bromo-cAMP increased label incorporation into the LDL receptor in the face of these agents. We conclude that in human granulosa cells, hCG, through the intermediacy of cAMP, rapidly increases LDL receptor synthesis by a mechanism which is, at least in part, independent of alterations in cellular cholesterol balance."
https://openalex.org/W1542250359,"35Cl NMR, which enables observation of chloride binding to the anion transport site on band 3, is used in the present study to determine the minimal structure containing the intact transport site. Removal of cytoskeletal and other nonintegral membrane proteins, or removal of the 40-kDa cytoskeletal domain of band 3, each leave the transport site intact. Similarly, cleavage of the 52-kDa transport domain into 17- and 35-kDa fragments by chymotrypsin leaves the transport site intact. Extensive proteolysis by papain reduces the integral red cell membrane proteins to their transmembrane segments. Papain treatment removes approximately 60% of the extramembrane portion of the transport domain and produces small fragments primarily in the range 3-7 kDa, with 5 kDa being most predominant. Papain treatment damages, but does not destroy, chloride binding to the transport site; thus, the minimal structure containing the transport site is composed solely of transmembrane segments. In short, the results are completely consistent with a picture in which the transport site is buried in the membrane where it is protected from proteolysis; the transmembrane segments that surround the transport site are held together by strong attractive forces within the bilayer; and the transport site is accessed by solution chloride via an anion channel leading from the transport site to the solution."

The small activity in mitochondria is not due to contamination by the cytosolic activity as evidenced by several rigorous approaches. The mitochondrial enzyme is located in the matrix and appears to be effective in protection from NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidative damage of cytochrome P-450 and succinic dehydrogenase, which are located exclusively in the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1541554549,"The mechanism of acyl enzyme formation from acyl-CoA derivatives was studied for chicken liver fatty acid synthase in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 1 mM EDTA at 23 degrees C. Three mechanistically important acyl-binding sites exist: a cysteine, 4'-phosphopantetheine, and a hydroxyl (serine). The cysteine was specifically labeled with iodoacetamide, and chemical modification of this labeled enzyme with chloroacetyl-CoA resulted in additional covalent labeling of 4'-phosphopantetheine. Reaction of the enzyme with acetyl-CoA results in 47% oxyester formation, whereas with malonyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA, 57 and 80% are oxyesters, respectively, as judged by treatment of the denatured enzyme with hydroxylamine. Limited proteolysis with trypsin followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the reactive hydroxyl and cysteine are on the same peptide. Butyryl-CoA is a relatively poor primer for steady state fatty acid synthesis, probably because transfer from the hydroxyl-binding site to 4'-phosphopantetheine is inefficient. Quenched flow studies indicate that the rate constants for transfer of acetyl from enzyme-bound acetyl-CoA to native, iodoacetamide-labeled, and iodoacetamide-chloroacetyl-labeled enzyme are 43, 110, and 150 s-1. These results can be interpreted in terms of a random acylation of the hydroxyl, 4'-phosphopantetheine, and cysteine by enzyme-bound acetyl-CoA with rate constants of 150 s-1, less than 110 s-1, and less than 43 s-1, respectively. Alternatively the latter two rate constants could be characteristic of intramolecular transfer between enzyme acylation sites. Structural constraints apparently prevent all three acylation sites from being occupied simultaneously. The rate of deacetylation of the acetylated enzyme by enzyme-bound CoA also is most rapid for the iodoacetamide-chloroacetyl-labeled enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2122575187,"The fermentation of 13C-labeled ethanol and acetate into butyrate and caproate by Clostridium kluyveri has been studied by using 13C NMR. The pathway involves the conversion of both ethanol and acetate into acetyl coenzymes A, two of which condense to form CoA-linked precursors of butyrate. If butyryl-CoA is involved in the condensation, caproate is the ultimate product. ATP is produced from acetyl-CoA via the reactions catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase with acetate, a required carbon source, as a co-product. In spectra of whole cells incubated with the labeled carbon sources, label from ethanol appears rapidly in acetate, which then reaches a lower, steady-state concentration due to its re-entry into the pathway. The rapid initial production of acetate indicates equally rapid production of ATP. Label from acetate appears in ethanol only if ethanol is already present, indicating that this process is one of isotopic equilibration rather than net synthesis of ethanol from acetate. The ratio of butyrate to caproate produced depends strongly on the initial ratio of ethanol to acetate in the medium. The relative rates of utilization of ethanol and acetate vary as the fermentation proceeds. 13C-13C coupling in the butyrate and caproate produced from [1-13C]ethanol and [2-13C]acetate can be used to determine if the acetyl-CoA molecules arising from ethanol and acetate enter the same pool or if they remain separated. The data are consistent with random mixing of the acetyl-CoA produced from the two carbon sources."
https://openalex.org/W1606157698,"X-ray intensity data from the native orthorhombic crystals of peanut lectin have been collected using oscillation photography. Rotation function studies using data up to a resolution of 4.5 A indicate that the four subunits in the molecule, which constitute the asymmetric unit in the crystals, are related to one another by three mutually perpendicular noncrystallographic 2-fold axes. Chemical cross-linking experiments in solution followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, carried out in parallel, suggest that there is more than one type of intersubunit approach in the molecule. Rotation function and cross-linking studies thus show that the tetrameric molecule of peanut lectin is a dimer of a dimer. The two monomers in a dimer are related by a 2-fold axis. The two dimers are in turn related by another 2-fold axis perpendicular to the one that relates the two monomers in the dimer, endowing the molecule with 222 (D2) symmetry."
https://openalex.org/W1508484389,"Chick embryo chondrocyte microsomes containing intact Golgi vesicles took up 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phospho[35S]sulfate ([35S]PAPS) in a time- and temperature-dependent, substrate-saturable manner. When [35S]PAPS and p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminide (pNP-GalNAc) were added to the incubation in the absence of detergent, the microsomes catalyzed the transfer of sulfate from [35S]PAPS to pNP-GalNAc to form pNP-GalNAc-6-35SO4. The apparent Km values for PAPS in the uptake and the pNP-GalNAc sulfation reactions were 2 X 10(-7) and 2 X 10(-6) M, respectively. The sulfation of pNP-GalNAc by the microsomal preparation was inhibited by detergent. The microsomal fraction also catalyzed the transfer of sulfate from [35S]PAPS to oligosaccharides prepared from chondroitin. However, in contrast to the sulfation of pNP-GalNAc, the rate of sulfation of these oligosaccharides was low in the absence of detergent and was markedly stimulated when detergent was added. Sulfation of pNP-GalNAc by the freeze-thawed microsomes was inhibited when the octasaccharide prepared from chondroitin was present in the reaction mixture. As the PAPS that had been internalized in the microsomal vesicles was consumed in the sulfation of pNP-GalNAc, more [35S]PAPS was taken up and the sulfated pNP-GalNAc was released from the vesicles. These observations suggest that pNP-GalNAc may serve as a model membrane-permeable substrate for study of the 6-sulfo-transferase reaction involved in sulfation of chondroitin sulfate in intact Golgi vesicles."

Since total creatine levels remained nearly the same in brain, N-methyl-3-guanidinopropionate-P provided brain with a supplemental reservoir of high energy phosphate. Tissues of rats fed 2% N-ethylguanidinoacetate (N-amidino-N-ethylglycine) accumulated large amounts of N-ethylguanidinoacetate-P, which has thermodynamic properties similar to creatine-P and is the kinetically most reactive synthetic phosphagen yet described. N-Ethylguanidinoacetate derivatives replaced creatine derivatives mole-for-mole, and the fraction of synthetic to total phosphagen after 19 days was 60% in heart, 54% in slow oxidative muscle, 42% in fast glycolytic muscles, and 22% in brain. N-Ethylguanidinoacetate served as a false end product co-repressor of liver arginine:glycine amidinotransferase levels in both chicks and chick embryos; N-methyl-3-guanidinopropionate and N-propylguanidinoacetate were relatively inactive. Creatinine amidohydrolase reversibly cyclized both N-ethylguanidinoacetate and N-propylguanidinoacetate with even lower Km values than for creatine derivatives, but it did not react significantly with N-methyl-3-guanidinopropionate, 3-guanidinopropionate, or 1-carboxy-methyl-2-imino-imidazolidine (cyclocreatine). Creatine amidinohydrolase also hydrolyzed N-acetimidoylsarcosine, but was relatively unreactive toward N-ethylguanidinoacetate, N-methyl-3-guanidinopropionate, 3-guanidinopropionate, and cyclocreatine. Amidinohydrolase can therefore be used to remove interfering creatine in assays of tissues for coexisting N-ethylguanidinoacetate or N-methyl-3-guanidinopropionate. Assays are now available to follow changes during metabolic stresses of any combination or all of the following phosphagens accumulated by the same tissue: creatine-P, N-ethylguanidinoacetate-P, cyclocreatine-P, N-methyl-3-guanidinopropionate-P, and homocyclocreatine-P."

Under these conditions, the related complement protein C5 does not show any tendency to form dimers. This is shown by x-ray and neutron scattering at 9 degrees C and 0.15 M ionic strength. The radii of gyration of the C3 and C4 dimers are very similar, 7.7 and 7.4 nm, and the cross-sectional radii of gyration are the same, 3.4 nm. The scattering curves of the C3 and C4 dimers as well as their Fourier transforms, the p(r)-curves, can be explained by scattering from a model consisting of an elongated elliptic cylinder with semiaxes 6.5 and 2.1 nm and length of 23 nm. This elongated elliptic cylinder model is consistent with the elliptic cylinder model of C4 (Osterberg, R., Eggertsen, G., Lundwall, A., and Sjoquist, J. (1984) Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 6, 195-198) provided that the protein molecules dimerize via their cross-sectional surfaces. Also, the model is consistent with the model of the related protein, alpha 2-macroglobulin, where the four subunits are supposed to form pairwise dimers of an elliptic cylindrical form (Osterberg, R., and Malmensten, B. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 143, 541-544)."
https://openalex.org/W1966851885,"Leeches are useful for studying embryogenesis. As members of the phylum Annelida, they are organized into a discrete number of metameric units called segments, akin to those of insects and other members of the closely related phylum Arthropoda. For several reasons, developmental studies of the leech often complement those of insects. Leeches have fewer segment-specific specializations and far fewer cells than do insects. Moreover, many of the cells in the mature animal-most notably the neurons-are individually identifiable and often physiologically accessible. Finally, embryogenesis in the leech proceeds via complete cleavages, so that individual cells can be identified from the start, whereas the insect egg undergoes several rounds of nuclear division without cytokinesis, forming a syncytial blastula with several thousand, apparently uncommitted, nuclei. The general pathway of events in leech embryogenesis is presented in the figure. Cells comprising the segments arise by stereotyped lineages from ten columns (bandlets) of blasts cells, longitudinally arrayed in an embryonic structure called the germinal plate. The blast cells in each bandlet are the birth-ranked (first born at the rostra1 end) progeny of a defined embryonic stem cell called a teloblast, which lies at the caudal end of the bandlet. There are five bilateral pairs of teloblasts: one mesodermal pair (M) and four ectodermal pairs (N, O/P, O/P and Q). The teloblasts themselves arise by stereotyped, holoblastic cleavages from the egg. Genesis of Tissue Type Based on the results of pioneering lineage studies with numerous invertebrates, it was predicted that each bilateral pair of teloblasts in the leech would generate only one tissue type. This hypothesis has recently been disproven (as have analogous dogmas for nematode and ascidian embryos). All leech teloblasts, including the mesodermal precursors, give rise to some neurons (traditionally regarded as ectodermal derivatives); all four ectodermal precursors generate epidermal cells and one even contributes to the ducts of nephridia (traditionally regarded as a mesodermal derivative). However, these contributions to tissue type are not made randomly (Kramer and Weisblat, J. Neurosci. 5, 388-407, 1985; We&blat et al., Dev. Biol. 704, 65-85, 1984). Corresponding to the five teloblasts on each side of the early embryo are five distinct groups of cells in each half-segment of the late embryo, called the M, N, 0, P, and CI kinship groups. The stereotyped spatial pattern of each kinship group invariably contains certain identified cells and not others. At present, there is no obvious morphological, biochemical, or functional explanation for the assignment of cells to particular kinship groups. Minireview"
