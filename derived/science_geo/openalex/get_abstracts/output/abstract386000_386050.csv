So far, successful efforts have been limited to chromatin modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic ‘writers’ and ‘erasers’. Potent inhibitors of histone binding modules have not yet been described. Here we report a cell-permeable small molecule (JQ1) that binds competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, or bromodomains. High potency and specificity towards a subset of human bromodomains is explained by co-crystal structures with bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, revealing excellent shape complementarity with the acetyl-lysine binding cavity. Recurrent translocation of BRD4 is observed in a genetically-defined, incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma. Competitive binding by JQ1 displaces the BRD4 fusion oncoprotein from chromatin, prompting squamous differentiation and specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein–protein interactions of epigenetic ‘readers’, and provide a versatile chemical scaffold for the development of chemical probes more broadly throughout the bromodomain family. Small molecules that perturb chromatin proteins are an emerging focus of current biomedical research. Two groups reporting in this issue have targeted bromodomain-containing BET proteins that bind acetylated lysine residues during gene activation, arriving at cell-permeable small molecule compounds with similar structures based on fused triazole-diazepine rings. James Bradner and colleagues report the development of a compound named JQ1. The BET protein BRD4, with two bromodomains, is implicated in human squamous cell carcinoma. JQ1 inhibits the growth of BRD4-dependent tumours in mouse models. Alexander Tarakhovsky and colleagues' inhibitor, I-BET, is shown to interfere with the binding of certain BET family members to acetylated histones. It inhibits activation of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages and has immunomodulatory activity in a mouse model of inflammatory disease. A new approach is used to target BET family bromodomains which are found in transcriptional regulators where they mediate the recognition of acetyl-lysine chromatin marks. Structural data reveal how the compound JQ1 binds to the bromodomain of BRD4. BRD4 has been implicated in a subtype of human squamous carcinomas, and JQ1 is found to inhibit the growth of BRD4 dependent tumours in mouse models."

Reducing tau levels improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, but the mechanisms regulating the turnover of pathogenic tau are unknown. We found that tau is acetylated and that tau acetylation prevents degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). We generated two antibodies specific for acetylated tau and showed that tau acetylation is elevated in patients at early and moderate Braak stages of tauopathy. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was involved in tau acetylation and the class III protein deacetylase SIRT1 in deacetylation. Deleting SIRT1 enhanced levels of acetylated-tau and pathogenic forms of p-tau, probably by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibiting p300 with a small molecule promoted tau deacetylation and eliminated p-tau associated with tauopathy. Modulating tau acetylation could be a new therapeutic strategy to reduce tau-mediated neurodegeneration.

Tau is acetylated and tau acetylation is elevated at early stage of tauopathy SIRT1 deacetylates tau, whereas p300 mediates tau acetylation Tau acetylation slows down its degradation Enhancing tau deacetylation abolishes pathogenic forms of phosphorylated tau The microtubule binding protein tau (MAPT) promotes the assembly and stabilization of microtubules (Kar et al., 2003Kar S.

Identification of tau mutations in frontotemporal dementia patients with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17 (FTDP-17) provides evidence that tau malfunction can trigger neurodegeneration (Hutton et al., 1998Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A.

In the brains of neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and FTDP-17, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a diagnostic hallmark of late-stage disease (Cairns et al., 2007Cairns N.J.

Neurol. 2009; 16: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of soluble forms of aberrantly phosphorylated tau (p-tau) may underlie tau-mediated neurodegeneration by disrupting the ability of tau to bind microtubules and promoting tau aggregation and fibrillization (Ballatore et al., 2007Ballatore C. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Suppression of endogenous soluble tau or transgenic tau improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, respectively (Roberson et al., 2007Roberson E.D. Scearce-Levie K. Palop J.J. Yan F. Cheng I.H. Wu T. Gerstein H. Yu G.Q. Mucke L.

McGowan E. et al.Tau suppression in a neurodegenerative mouse model improves memory function.Science. 2005; 309: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Thus, reducing tau accumulation, especially aberrant p-tau, is a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative tauopathies. However, the molecular mechanisms of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau are unclear. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau could reflect insufficient clearance. Degradation of tau, especially p-tau, may involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Soluble tau isolated from paired helical filaments (PHF) from AD brains is polyubiquitinated (Cripps et al., 2006Cripps D. Thomas S.N. Jeng Y. Yang F. Davies P. Yang A.J. Alzheimer disease-specific conformation of hyperphosphorylated paired helical filament-Tau is polyubiquitinated through Lys-48, Lys-11, and Lys-6 ubiquitin conjugation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10825-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein) is involved in polyubiquitination and degradation of p-tau (Petrucelli et al., 2004Petrucelli L. Dickson D. Kehoe K. Taylor J. Snyder H. Grover A. De Lucia M. McGowan E. Lewis J. Prihar G. et al.CHIP and Hsp70 regulate tau ubiquitination, degradation and aggregation.Hum. Mol.

CHIP-Hsc70 complex ubiquitinates phosphorylated tau and enhances cell survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4869-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Deletion of CHIP significantly increased p-tau levels in the brain (Dickey et al., 2006Dickey C.A. Yue M. Lin W.L. Dickson D.W. Dunmore J.H. Lee W.C. Zehr C. West G. Cao S. Clark A.M. et al.Deletion of the ubiquitin ligase CHIP leads to the accumulation, but not the aggregation, of both endogenous phospho- and caspase-3-cleaved tau species.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6985-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of lysines can be precluded by lysine acetylation, which inhibits proteasome-mediated degradation of numerous proteins, including p53 (Ito et al., 2002Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. MDM2-HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of p53 is required for its degradation.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), Runx (Jin et al., 2004Jin Y.H. Jeon E.J. Li Q.L.

It is unknown whether tau is acetylated and whether tau acetylation contributes to tau accumulation. Lysine acetylation rivals phosphorylation in regulating diverse cellular functions, including energy metabolism, signaling from the plasma membrane, and cytoskeleton dynamics (Choudhary et al., 2009Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M.

Enzymes that add an acetyl group to the protein are called histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or lysine acetyltransferase. Of four major classes of HATs, p300/CBP (protein of 300 kDa and CREB-binding protein) and pCAF (p300-associated and CBP-associated factor) are exclusively present in metazoans (Goodman and Smolik, 2000Goodman R.H. Smolik S. CBP/p300 in cell growth, transformation, and development.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymes that remove an acetyl group from the protein are called histone deacetylases (HDACs) or lysine deacetylases. There are three classes of HDACs. The activities of HDACs in classes I and II (HADC1–11) depend on zinc as a cofactor; the activities of class III HDACs (sirtuins) depend on the relative levels of NAD+ and NADH (Haigis and Guarente, 2006Haigis M.C. Guarente L.P. Mammalian sirtuins—emerging roles in physiology, aging, and calorie restriction.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, Michan and Sinclair, 2007Michan S. Sinclair D. Sirtuins in mammals: Insights into their biological function.Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Of the seven members of mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1–7), SIRT1 is the most studied and is strongly implicated in aging-related diseases, including AD (Gan and Mucke, 2008Gan L. Mucke L. Paths of convergence: Sirtuins in aging and neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2008; 58: 10-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). SIRT1 levels are reduced in AD brains, and the reduction correlates with the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates (Julien et al., 2009Julien C. Tremblay C. Emond V. Lebbadi M. Salem Jr., N. Bennett D.A. Calon F. Sirtuin 1 reduction parallels the accumulation of tau in Alzheimer disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2009; 68: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Overexpressing SIRT1 protects against neuronal loss in the inducible p25 transgenic mouse, a model of AD and tauopathy (Kim et al., 2007Kim D. Nguyen M.D. Dobbin M.M. Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Rodgers J.T. Delalle I. Baur J.A. Sui G. Armour S.M. et al.SIRT1 deacetylase protects against neurodegeneration in models for Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3169-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). It is unclear how SIRT1 protects against tau-mediated neurodegeneration. In the current study, we investigated tau acetylation in primary neurons, tauopathy mouse models, and AD brains by generating two specific antibodies against acetylated-tau (ac-tau). Using gene-silencing and pharmacological approaches, we show that p300 acetylates and SIRT1 deacetylates tau. Our study also provided evidence that SIRT1 deficiency leads to hyperacetylation of tau and accumulation of p-tau. In contrast, promoting tau deacetylation eliminates p-tau. To demonstrate that tau is acetylated, we incubated recombinant tau with recombinant acetyltransferase p300 or pCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) with 14C-acetyl-coenzyme A. Incubation with p300, not pCAF, led to tau acetylation, whereas both p300 and pCAF were active in transferring acetyl groups to histones as expected (Figure 1A ). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry identified multiple lysines that were acetylated by p300 in vitro. A total of 23 putatively acetylated lysines were detected out of 383 residues (∼86.8% coverage; Table S1 available online) throughout the tau sequence (2N4R, 441 amino acids). A few putative acetylated lysines were in the N- and C-terminal regions; 13 were in microtubule-binding domains (Figure 1B and Table S1). Putative acetylated N-terminal lysines (e.g., lysines 163, 174, and 180) appeared to be acetylated in all MS analyses. Those in the microtubule-binding domains appeared to be acetylated in a subset of MS analyses, suggesting variable acetylation at these sites in vitro (Table S1). To examine tau acetylation in vivo, we generated a polyclonal antibody (anti-ac-tau, Ab708) with a synthetic tau peptide (amino acids 160–182 for 2N4R tau isoform) containing acetylated lysines at positions 163 and 174 and 180 (see Figure S1 for MS spectra). A control antibody was generated (anti-tau, Ab707) with the same peptide with nonacetylated lysines. To test the specificity of Ab708 against ac-tau, we incubated recombinant human tau (441; 2N4R isoform) with glutathione S-transferase (GST) alone or GST-p300. Immunoblotting with Ab708 detected strong tau signals after incubation with GST-p300, but not with GST alone (Figure 1C). In contrast, Ab707 or Tau 5 antibody detected similar levels of total tau (t-tau) with either GST or GST-p300 (Figure 1C). Thus, Ab708 specifically recognizes tau acetylated by p300 under cell-free conditions. In HEK293T cells transfected with tau, overexpression of p300 markedly elevated the levels of ac-tau detected with Ab708 while the increase in the levels of t-tau was modest, suggesting that Ab708 preferentially recognizes p300-induced ac-tau in cultured cells (Figure 1D). Mutation of lysines 163, 174, and 180 (Tau3KR) reduced ac-tau levels relative to t-tau levels in HEK293T cells (Figure 1E). A smaller yet still significant reduction was also observed when two lysines were mutated in Tau2KR(K174R/K180R) (Figure 1E). These findings suggest that Ab708 recognizes human tau acetylated at positions 163, 174, or 180 and possibly other acetylated lysines on tau, but not nonacetylated tau. To detect ac-tau in vivo, we performed Western blots with brain lysates from transgenic mice expressing human tau cDNA (1N4R) with P301S mutation (PS19) (Yoshiyama et al., 2007Yoshiyama Y. Higuchi M. Zhang B. Huang S.M. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Maeda J. Suhara T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Synapse loss and microglial activation precede tangles in a P301S tauopathy mouse model.Neuron. 2007; 53: 337-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) or from transgenic mice expressing the entire human wild-type MAPT (hT-PAC-N) with 0N3R and 0N4R as the two predominant tau isoforms (McMillan et al., 2008McMillan P. Korvatska E. Poorkaj P. Evstafjeva Z. Robinson L. Greenup L. Leverenz J. Schellenberg G.D. D'Souza I. Tau isoform regulation is region- and cell-specific in mouse brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 511: 788-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Human and mouse tau differ at three positions in the region used to generate Ab708 and Ab707 (Figure S2). Ab708 detected specific signals in lysates from PS19 and hT-PAC-N mice, but not those from nontransgenic (NTG) littermates (Figure 1F). These findings suggest that Ab708 recognizes various isoforms of human ac-tau, but not mouse ac-tau. The control antibody Ab707, which recognizes human t-tau, does not recognize mouse tau either. Endogenous tau in NTG mice was detected with Tau 5 antibody (Figure 1F). Rat tau is more similar to human tau than mouse tau in the region used to generate Ab708 (Figure S2). Ab708 detected endogenous ac-tau in rat primary cortical neurons (Figure 1G). Levels of ac-tau/t-tau gradually increased as neurons matured from 5–12 days in vitro (DIV), suggesting that tau acetylation is regulated developmentally (Figure 1G). However, the isoforms of rat tau detected by Ab708 remain to be defined. To determine the role of endogenous p300 or pCAF in tau acetylation, we transfected HEK293T cells expressing human tau cDNA (2N4R) with siRNAs targeting p300 or pCAF (Figure 2A ) and assessed the effects on ac-tau or t-tau. Reducing p300 significantly lowered levels of ac-tau, but not t-tau (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, inhibiting pCAF had no effects (Figures 2B and 2C). These findings are consistent with the results of in vitro studies (Figure 1A). Next, we treated primary neurons with C646, a pyrazolone-containing small-molecule inhibitor of p300 (Bowers et al., 2010Bowers E.M. Yan G. Mukherjee C. Orry A. Wang L. Holbert M.A. Crump N.T. Hazzalin C.A. Liszczak G. Yuan H. et al.Virtual ligand screening of the p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase: Identification of a selective small molecule inhibitor.Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 471-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Under cell-free conditions, C646 at 10 μM inhibits p300 in a highly selective manner (86% inhibition versus < 10% for the six other acetyltransferases) (Bowers et al., 2010Bowers E.M. Yan G. Mukherjee C. Orry A. Wang L. Holbert M.A. Crump N.T. Hazzalin C.A. Liszczak G. Yuan H. et al.Virtual ligand screening of the p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase: Identification of a selective small molecule inhibitor.Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 471-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p300 with C646 (20 μM) drastically reduced levels of ac-tau in primary neurons within 8 hr. The levels of t-tau remained unchanged (Figure 2D). p300 is a transcriptional coactivator (Goodman and Smolik, 2000Goodman R.H. Smolik S. CBP/p300 in cell growth, transformation, and development.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). However, C646 treatment for 8 hr did not suppress tau transcripts as quantified with real-time RT-PCR (data not shown). Thus short-term (8 h) inhibition of p300 deacetylates tau without affecting t-tau levels. Extended treatment with C646 for 20 hr lowered the levels of ac-tau relative to the t-tau (ac-tau/t-tau), but also those of t-tau (Figure 2E). To investigate the enzymes that deacetylate tau, we transfected an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged SIRT1, SIRT2, HDAC5, or HDAC6 into HEK293T cells expressing human tau. All HDACs were expressed at high levels (Figure 3A ). Although expressed at lower levels than SIRT1 and SIRT2, HDAC6 eliminated tubulin acetylation (Hubbert et al., 2002Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. HDAC6 is a microtubule-associated deacetylase.Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), suggesting sufficient expression (Figure 3B). Overexpression of SIRT1 reduced levels of Ab708-positive ac-tau. SIRT2 and HDAC6 overexpression also lowered ac-tau, although to lesser extents (Figures 3B and 3C). Levels of t-tau were also reduced in cells overexpressing SIRT1 and HDAC6. Nevertheless, the ac-tau/t-tau ratio was significantly reduced by SIRT1 overexpression (Figure 3D). The modest reduction in ac-tau/t-tau induced by HDAC6 or SIRT2 overexpression was not statistically significant (Figure 3D). To examine the effects of endogenous HDACs on ac-tau, we inhibited expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, or HDAC6 with siRNAs (Figure 3E). Relative to control siRNA, target siRNAs significantly reduced levels of SIRT1, SIRT2, and HDAC6. Despite modest inhibition, HDAC6 increased ac-tubulin levels (Figure 3F). However, only inhibition of SIRT1 increased ac-tau levels, suggesting the involvement of endogenous SIRT1 in deacetylating tau (Figure 3G). Consistent with the observation that SIRT1 overexpression reduced t-tau, SIRT1 inhibition led to a trend of increase in t-tau (Figure 3G). Nevertheless, inhibition of SIRT1, not SIRT2 or HDAC6, significantly elevated levels of ac-tau relative to t-tau (ac-tau/t-tau) (Figure 3H). These results provided direct support that SIRT1 is involved in tau deacetylation. Our findings so far do not support a prominent role of SIRT2 or HDAC6, which both deacetylate tubulin (Hubbert et al., 2002Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. HDAC6 is a microtubule-associated deacetylase.Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, North et al., 2003North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T.

Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), in tau deacetylation. However, their involvement cannot be ruled out given that only partial silencing of SIRT2 or HDAC6 was achieved with siRNA transfections. To further investigate the role of SIRT1 in tau deacetylation, we transfected low-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with (SIRT1+/+) or without SIRT1 (SIRT1−/−) with human tau cDNA (Figure S3). Deleting SIRT1 significantly raised ac-tau levels. The increase in t-tau did not reach statistical significance, suggesting SIRT1 deacetylates tau in MEFs. In HEK293T cells, when lysines 163, 174, and 180 were mutated to arginines (Tau3KR), levels of ac-tau were significantly reduced (Figure 3I). SIRT1 overexpression reduced ac-tau in TauWT cells, but the reduction was much attenuated in Tau3KR cells (Figure 3I). These results implicate SIRT1 in deacetylating lysines 163, 174, and 180. However, SIRT1 reduced ac-tau to lower levels in Tau3KR cells than in TauWT cells, indicating that SIRT1 could deacetylate additional lysine residues besides those at positions 163, 174, and 180 (Figure 3I). In primary neurons, ac-tau/t-tau increased as the neurons matured (Figure 1G), but levels of full-length SIRT1 decreased (Figure 4A ). Consistent with the notion that SIRT1 deactylates tau, levels of SIRT1 negatively correlated with levels of ac-tau/t-tau in primary neurons during development (Figure 4B). To investigate whether SIRT1 negatively regulates tau acetylation in neurons, we deleted SIRT1 in neurons by infecting neurons from SIRT1 conditional knockout mice (SIRT1F/F) (Chua et al., 2005Chua K.F. Mostoslavsky R. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W. Saito S. Franco S. Kaushal D. Cheng H.L. Fischer M.R. Stokes N. et al.Mammalian SIRT1 limits replicative life span in response to chronic genotoxic stress.Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with a lentiviral vector expressing cre recombinase (Lenti-cre) (Figure 4C). Controls were infected with an empty vector (Lenti-con). SIRT1F/F neurons were also infected with a lentiviral vector expressing human tau. Deleting SIRT1 significantly elevated levels of acetylated human tau relative to t-tau (Figure 4C), indicating that SIRT1 deacetylates tau in neurons. To examine the effects of SIRT1 deletion on the acetylation of mouse tau in vivo, we developed another ac-tau-specific antibody targeting the microtubule-binding region (264–287), which is 100% conserved between mouse and human (Figure 4D). Recombinant tau was incubated with p300 to induce acetylation. Like Ab708, antibody 9AB recognized recombinant tau acetylated by GST-p300, but not tau incubated with GST alone, suggesting that 9AB does not cross-react with non-ac-tau. In HEK293T cells, overexpression of p300 markedly elevated levels of ac-tau detected with 9AB, but only modestly those of t-tau. Thus, 9AB also preferentially recognizes p300-induced ac-tau in cultured cells (Figure 4E). In mouse brains, 9AB detected low levels of ac-tau, which was absent in tau−/− mice. To delete SIRT1, we crossed SIRT1+/− mice on an outbred background, which partially rescued the embryonic lethality of SIRT1 null mice on the inbred background (Cheng et al., 2003Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Developmental defects and p53 hyperacetylation in Sir2 homolog (SIRT1)-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Deleting SIRT1 significantly enhanced levels of ac-tau in the brain, providing direct evidence that SIRT1 deacetylates tau in vivo (Figure 4F). Although mainly localized in the nucleus, SIRT1 can be shuttled to the cytoplasm (Hisahara et al., 2008Hisahara S. Chiba S. Matsumoto H. Tanno M. Yagi H. Shimohama S. Sato M. Horio Y.

Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6823-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To determine whether SIRT1 directly deacetylates tau, we performed in vitro deacetylation assays. Recombinant tau acetylated by p300 was incubated with SIRT1 immunoprecipitated from SIRT1-overexpressing HEK293T cells. Ac-tau/t-tau levels were significantly lower in the presence of immunoprecipitated SIRT1 (Figure 5A ). To confirm that SIRT1 interacts with tau directly in vivo, we performed GST pull-down assays. Bead-bound GST-tau, not GST alone, interacted with FLAG-SIRT1 expressed in HEK293T cells or endogenous SIRT1 in nontransfected cells (Figure 5B). Moreover, in coimmunoprecipitation assays, after immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody, endogenous SIRT1 was detected with an anti-SIRT1 antibody, and tau was detected with a pan-tau antibody (Tau 5) in HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged tau (Figure 5C). As a class III lysine deacetylase, SIRT1 supports and promotes longevity in diverse organisms. Besides regulating endocrine and behavioral responses to caloric restriction (Cohen et al., 2009Cohen D.E. Supinski A.M. Bonkowski M.S. Donmez G. Guarente L.P. Neuronal SIRT1 regulates endocrine and behavioral responses to calorie restriction.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), SIRT1 has been strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in Gan and Mucke, 2008Gan L. Mucke L. Paths of convergence: Sirtuins in aging and neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2008; 58: 10-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In AD brains, SIRT1 levels are significantly reduced, and the reduction appears to correlate with tau accumulation and aggregation (Julien et al., 2009Julien C. Tremblay C. Emond V. Lebbadi M. Salem Jr., N. Bennett D.A. Calon F. Sirtuin 1 reduction parallels the accumulation of tau in Alzheimer disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2009; 68: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, deficient SIRT1 activity may contribute to tauopathy. In primary neurons, inhibiting SIRT1 with a specific inhibitor EX527 (Napper et al., 2005Napper A.D. Hixon J. McDonagh T. Keavey K. Pons J.F. Barker J. Yau W.T. Amouzegh P. Flegg A. Hamelin E. et al.Discovery of indoles as potent and selective inhibitors of the deacetylase SIRT1.J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 8045-8054Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) markedly increased ac-tau, AT8-positive p-tau, as well as t-tau (Figure 6A ). Levels of ac-tau or p-tau relative to t-tau were significantly increased with EX527 treatments (Figure 6A). Thus, the increase in ac-tau induced by SIRT1 deficiency is accompanied by accumulation of pathogenic p-tau in primary neurons. In mouse brains, deleting SIRT1, which elevated ac-tau, also increased AT8-positive p-tau (Figure 6B). How might elevated tau acetylation lead to higher levels of p-tau? Acetylation of lysines can preclude its ubiquitination and stabilize proteins that are normally degraded by the UPS, including p53 (Ito et al., 2002Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2109062476,"Classical studies have related the spiking of selected neocortical neurons to behavior, but little is known about activity sampled from the entire neural population. We recorded from neurons selected independent of spiking, using cell-attached recordings and two-photon calcium imaging, in the barrel cortex of mice performing an object localization task. Spike rates varied across neurons, from silence to >60 Hz. Responses were diverse, with some neurons showing large increases in spike rate when whiskers contacted the object. Nearly half the neurons discriminated object location; a small fraction of neurons discriminated perfectly. More active neurons were more discriminative. Layer (L) 4 and L5 contained the highest fractions of discriminating neurons (∼63% and 79%, respectively), but a few L2/3 neurons were also highly discriminating. Approximately 13,000 spikes per activated barrel column were available to mice for decision making. Coding of object location in the barrel cortex is therefore highly redundant."
https://openalex.org/W2050935187,"The peripheral nervous system has astonishing regenerative capabilities in that cut nerves are able to reconnect and re-establish their function. Schwann cells are important players in this process, during which they dedifferentiate to a progenitor/stem cell and promote axonal regrowth. Here, we report that fibroblasts also play a key role. Upon nerve cut, ephrin-B/EphB2 signaling between fibroblasts and Schwann cells results in cell sorting, followed by directional collective cell migration of Schwann cells out of the nerve stumps to guide regrowing axons across the wound. Mechanistically, we find that cell-sorting downstream of EphB2 is mediated by the stemness factor Sox2 through N-cadherin relocalization to Schwann cell-cell contacts. In vivo, loss of EphB2 signaling impaired organized migration of Schwann cells, resulting in misdirected axonal regrowth. Our results identify a link between Ephs and Sox proteins, providing a mechanism by which progenitor cells can translate environmental cues to orchestrate the formation of new tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2027764467,"Scott and colleagues show that expression of the transcription factor Sox9 is closely correlated with the transition from neuroepithelial cell to neural stem cell (NSC) during embryogenesis. Expression of Sox9 in early neuroepithelium elicited premature generation of NSCs. In the adult brain, Sox9 was necessary for the maintenance of NSCs and ependymal cells. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are uncommitted cells of the CNS defined by their multipotentiality and ability to self renew. We found these cells to not be present in substantial numbers in the CNS until after embryonic day (E) 10.5 in mouse and E5 in chick. This coincides with the induction of SOX9 in neural cells. Gain- and loss-of-function studies indicated that SOX9 was essential for multipotent NSC formation. Moreover, Sonic Hedgehog was able to stimulate precocious generation of NSCs by inducing Sox9 expression. SOX9 was also necessary for the maintenance of multipotent NSCs, as shown by in vivo fate mapping experiments in the adult subependymal zone and olfactory bulbs. In addition, loss of SOX9 led ependymal cells to adopt a neuroblast identity. These data identify a functional link between extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of NSCs specification and maintenance, and establish a central role for SOX9 in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2114538750,"Complete reconstructions of vertebrate neuronal circuits on the synaptic level require new approaches. Here, serial section transmission electron microscopy was automated to densely reconstruct four volumes, totaling 670 μm(3), from the rat hippocampus as proving grounds to determine when axo-dendritic proximities predict synapses. First, in contrast with Peters' rule, the density of axons within reach of dendritic spines did not predict synaptic density along dendrites because the fraction of axons making synapses was variable. Second, an axo-dendritic touch did not predict a synapse; nevertheless, the density of synapses along a hippocampal dendrite appeared to be a universal fraction, 0.2, of the density of touches. Finally, the largest touch between an axonal bouton and spine indicated the site of actual synapses with about 80% precision but would miss about half of all synapses. Thus, it will be difficult to predict synaptic connectivity using data sets missing ultrastructural details that distinguish between axo-dendritic touches and bona fide synapses."

For transient knockdown, U2OS were transfected with two rounds of SMYD2 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool (l-020291–00-0005) or ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting siRNA1 (d-001810–01-05) using DharmaFECT 1 (Thermo Scientific). RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were performed using the DyNAmo cDNA synthesis kit and the SybrGreenER Mastermix (Invitrogen), respectively. Primer sequences are available upon request. T98G cells were serum starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine growth serum and then stimulated with DMEM supplemented with 20% bovine growth serum for 0, 9, and 18 h. For flow cytometry, T98G cells were collected and fixed with 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with 10 µg/ml propidium iodide and 100 µg/ml RNase. DNA damage assays were performed in NIH3T3 cells treated with 10 µm etoposide. C2C12 myoblasts were induced to differentiate by growing cells to confluency in medium with 2% horse serum for 0, 1, 2, and 7 days. Peptide pull-down assays were performed as previously described (37Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Peña P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F.

Briefly, 1 µg of biotinylated peptide was incubated with 1 µg of protein in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) overnight at 4 °C with rotation before incubation with streptavidin beads (Amersham Biosciences) and immunoblot analysis. ITC assays were conducted with a MicroCal VPITC Calorimeter as recently described (43Burke J.R. Deshong A.J. Pelton J.G. Rubin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16286-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with the Origin calorimetry software package assuming a one site binding model. N-values, reflecting the stoichiometry of the RB-3xMBT complex, were between 0.8 and 1.2. Experiments were repeated 2–4 times, and the reported error is the standard deviation of each set of measurements. 2 × 107 cells were incubated in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm PMSF) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1,300 × g at 4 °C for 5 min and the supernatant (S1) was further clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min to yield a cytoplasmic fraction (S2). The nuclei were washed once in Buffer A and then lysed in Buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm PMSF) for 15 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 1,700 g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant (S3) consisting of nucleoplasm was removed and the pellet (P3) was resuspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 20 min to yield the chromatin fraction (Chr). Student's t-tests were conducted to determine statistical significance. * denotes p value of <0.05. The SMYD2 methyltransferase was originally identified as an enzyme whose activity could suppress cell proliferation (35Brown M.A. Sims 3rd, R.J. Gottlieb P.D. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and directly regulate p53 function (19Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). We tested whether SMYD2 could also methylate the RB protein, a major regulator of cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. We found that recombinant SMYD2 could methylate a C-terminal fragment of RB and had minimal or no activity against the N-terminal and large pocket fragments of the protein (Fig. 1, A and B, left, and data not shown). We next identified lysine 860 (Lys-860 or K860) as the residue of RB that was methylated in vitro by SMYD2 (Fig. 1B, right). In contrast, SET9 methylated RB within the large RB pocket and not in the C-terminal fragment containing Lys-860 (Fig. 1C), suggesting a certain level of specificity for the methylation of RB by SMYD2 at Lys-860. The conservation of RB K860 and surrounding sequences in multiple species and the fact that this region does not seem to be important in maintaining the structure of RB (44Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) suggest that this amino acid may have an important functional role (Fig. 1D). To determine if RB K860 was mono-, di-, or trimethylated by SMYD2, an RB C-terminal fragment methylated in vitro by SMYD2 was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. While several methylated peptides were identified using this sensitive detection method, this analysis identified peptides containing monomethylated RB K860 (Fig. 2), indicating that SMYD2 monomethylates RB at Lys-860 in vitro, similar to its activity on p53 (19Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To test if SMYD2 methylates RB at Lys-860 in cells, we developed polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize monomethylated Lys-860 in the RB protein (RBK860me1). The specificity of these antibodies was verified in vitro against non-methylated, mono-, di-, and tri-methylated RB K860 and histone H4K20 peptides (Fig. 3A). Using these antibodies in immunoblot experiments, we were able to detect RB methylation in 293T cells that had been transfected with tagged HA-RB and MYC-SMYD2 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, this methylation was dependent on the methyltransferase catalytic domain of SMYD2 because RB methylation was not detected in similar conditions where MYC-SMYD2 was substituted by MYC-SMYD2(Y290F), a catalytically inactive derivative of SMYD2 (Fig. 3B). Methylation was specific to lysine 860 as MYC-SMYD2 failed to methylate HA-RB(K860R), a form of RB where lysine 860 is mutated to arginine, arguing for a preferential activity of SMYD2 at Lys-860 (Fig. 3B). As an additional control, we expressed a form of RB with lysine to arginine substitutions in residues close to lysine 860 (HA-RB(K870,873, 874R)), two of which can be acetylated in cells (6Markham D. Munro S. Soloway J. O'Connor D.P. La Thangue N.B. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Leduc C. Claverie P. Eymin B. Col E. Khochbin S. Brambilla E. Gazzeri S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4147-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Nguyen D.X. Baglia L.A. Huang S.M. Baker C.M. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Chan H.M. Krstic-Demonacos M. Smith L. Demonacos C. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We found that these mutations did not affect the capacity of MYC-SMYD2 to methylate RB (Fig. 3B). Thus, RB is monomethylated at lysine 860 by SMYD2 in cells when both proteins are overexpressed. Similarly, we found that endogenous RB molecules were methylated by MYC-SMYD2 (Fig. 3C). To test whether endogenous RB methylation at lysine 860 was dependent on endogenous SMYD2 expression, we used shRNA constructs to knockdown SMYD2 in U2OS cells and found that a decrease of ∼80% in SMYD2 mRNA levels resulted in a visible decrease in the amount of methylated RB that could be immunoprecipitated with the antibody against RBK860me1 (Fig. 3D). Similar experiments using stable knockdown in 293T cells and transient knockdown in U2OS cells produced similar results (supplemental Fig. S1). Together, these experiments indicate that endogenous RB is monomethylated by SMYD2 at Lys-860 in cells. Because RB normally inhibits the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (2Burkhart D.L. Sage J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RB methylation at Lys-860 may be regulated during G1 arrest. To test this idea, we performed a cell cycle re-entry experiment. Cell cycle re-entry from quiescence upon serum stimulation was confirmed by increased RB phosphorylation, as judged by a shift in migration, increased levels of the E2F target p107, and cell cycle profiles (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the amount of RB immunoprecipitated with the antibody to RBK860me1 was higher in quiescent cells compared with cells re-entering the cell cycle while RB levels remained constant (Fig. 4A), indicating that RB methylation at Lys-860 is regulated during cell cycle re-entry. We next tested whether RB methylation at Lys-860 is affected when cells exit the cell cycle during differentiation. To this end, we grew mouse C2C12 muscle cells under differentiation conditions. Differentiation was monitored by visual inspection of the culture and the appearance of fused myotubes and hypophosphorylation of RB (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions, RB levels and acetylated RB levels have been shown to increase transiently as cells enter the differentiation program (8Nguyen D.X. Baglia L.A. Huang S.M. Baker C.M. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found a concomitant increase in total RB levels and methylated RB levels as C2C12 cells differentiated (Fig. 4B). This increase was not observed when RB levels were normalized (Fig. 4B), indicating that there is an increase in both the total pool of RB and methylated RB in C2C12 cells as they exit the cell cycle and undergo the first stages of muscle differentiation. Finally, we tested whether RB methylation by SMYD2 was affected by DNA damage, as was shown for p53 (19Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). We treated NIH 3T3 cells with the DNA damaging agent etoposide and verified the induction of DNA damage by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γH2AX) (Fig. 4C). We found that the amount of RB that could be immunoprecipitated with the antibody to RBK860me1 increased after etoposide treatment while RB levels remained constant, indicating that RB methylation at Lys-860 is induced by DNA damage (Fig. 4C). Thus, RB methylation at Lys-860 is dynamic and regulated during several cellular processes, suggesting that it may play a functional role in mammalian cells. The observation that the amount of methylated RB increases under cytostatic conditions, and the fact that co-expression of SMYD2 and RB in RB mutant Saos-2 cells causes further repression of E2F target genes when compared with RB alone (supplemental Fig. S2), raised the question of how methylation of RB might affect its function. One possibility was that RB methylation may change its binding to specific cellular partners. Whereas E2F1 binds to the C terminus of RB (6Markham D. Munro S. Soloway J. O'Connor D.P. La Thangue N.B. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Lys-860 contributes a weak interaction with E2F1 (44Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and we found no reproducible differences in the RB/E2F1 interaction with or without SMYD2, in cells and in vitro (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3 and data not shown). This observation did not exclude that the binding to other partners may be affected by the methylation event. L3MBTL1 is a histone methyl-binding protein that can condense chromatin and repress gene expression, including the expression of RB targets (45Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N.

The MBT domain of L3MBTL1 has been found to bind methyl groups, with a preference for mono- and dimethylated lysines (45Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N. Boccuni P. Lee D.

Whereas there is no published evidence that RB and L3MBTL1 directly interact, we hypothesized that RB methylation may serve as a signal to increase a potential interaction between RB and L3MBTL1. We found that a recombinant 3xMBT domain from L3MBTL1 bound more efficiently to RB peptides mono- and dimethylated at Lys-860 than it did to non- and trimethylated peptides (Fig. 5A). In addition, mutations in amino acids of L3MBTL1 predicted to alter its ability to recognize methylated peptides (46Min J. Allali-Hassani A. Nady N. Qi C. Ouyang H. Liu Y. MacKenzie F. Vedadi M.

PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) decreased its ability to bind to monomethylated RB at Lys-860 (Fig. 5B). Isothermal titration calorimetry assays further confirmed the specificity of L3MBTL1 for mono- and dimethylated RB K860 (Fig. 5, C and D), with an affinity slightly higher than what was described with mono- and dimethylated histone peptides (46Min J. Allali-Hassani A. Nady N. Qi C. Ouyang H. Liu Y. MacKenzie F. Vedadi M. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1229-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine if methylated RB associates with L3MBTL1 in cells, we first determined if we could detect methylated RB in chromatin where L3MBTL1 has been shown to function as a repressor (45Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N. Boccuni P. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nimer S.D. Wang Y.H. Reinberg D. Cell. 2007; 129: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Indeed, the analysis of different cellular fractions from 293T cells transfected with HA-RB and MYC-SMYD2 revealed monomethyl RB at Lys-860 in the cytoplasmic (S2), nuclear (S3), and most importantly, chromatin (Chr) fractions (Fig. 6A). Next we investigated the binding of methylated RB to L3MBTL1 in cells through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We found that FLAG-L3MBTL1 co-immunoprecipitated more HA-RB in the presence of MYC-SMYD2 (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, similar to the observations with recombinant peptides (Fig. 5), the interaction between RB and L3MBTL1 was dependent on an intact 3xMBT domain (Fig. 6C). Finally, this interaction was decreased in cells expressing MYC-SMYD2 and HA-RB(K860R) compared with cells expressing wild-type HA-RB, indicating that methylation at lysine 860 was required for the optimal binding of L3MBTL1 to RB (Fig. 6D). Regulation of RB activity in cells is thought to be largely, although not entirely (51Burkhart D.L. Ngai L.K. Roake C.M. Viatour P. Thangavel C. Ho V.M. Knudsen E.S. Sage J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1729-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), due to post-translational modifications. Here we describe a previously unidentified post-translational modification of RB, methylation of Lys-860 by SMYD2. We also show that RB K860 methylation facilitates a direct interaction between RB and the methyl-binding protein L3MBTL1. The identification of this modification provides further evidence for the existence of an “RB code” whereby specific patterns of modifications affect one another and dictate the myriad of RB cellular functions. Our data indicate that SMYD2 methylates RB at Lys-860 in vitro and in cells but does not exclude the possibility that SMYD2 may methylate RB at different sites under specific conditions. It is also possible that SMYD2, or another methyltransferase, may generate K860me2 and/or K860me3 residues. Furthermore, other methyltransferase activities could control the functions of RB in distinct cellular contexts, an idea supported by our finding that SET9 can also methylate RB in vitro, albeit at a different site than SMYD2. Future experiments will continue to examine the spectrum of RB methylation in relation to cellular context and other post-translational modifications. Early studies of SMYD2 described its ability to inhibit cell cycle progression (35Brown M.A. Sims 3rd, R.J. Gottlieb P.D. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The identification of RB as a SMYD2 substrate, and the accumulation of methylated RB molecules during conditions where RB represses cell cycle genes, may provide a mechanism for this effect, perhaps in conjunction with the effects of SMYD2 on p53 (19Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, additional experiments will be required to test this model. In particular, the genetic interactions between SMYD2, RB, and p53 during embryonic development at a time when many cells exit the cell cycle remain to be tested. In addition, a clear role for SMYD2 in tumorigenesis has yet to be identified. L3MBTL1 is a mono- and dimethyl histone-binding protein that has the ability to condense chromatin and repress transcription (52Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A possible biochemical link between L3MBTL1 and RB has been suggested by the fact that both proteins have been found in the same large complexes in flies and human cells (45Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N. Boccuni P. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nimer S.D. Wang Y.H. Reinberg D.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2929-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, L3MBTL1 has the ability to bind to and repress the transcription of some E2F target genes (45Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N. Boccuni P. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nimer S.D. Wang Y.H. Reinberg D. Cell. 2007; 129: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not determine if RB and L3MBTL1 directly interacted. Our studies indicate that RB can bind directly to the 3xMBT domain of L3MBTL1. Moreover, this direct interaction is facilitated by RB methylation at Lys-860. These associations between RB and L3MBTL1 suggest a model whereby RB methylation by SMYD2 may serve to recruit L3MBTL1 to the promoters of specific RB/E2F target genes to repress their transcription. Similar observations were recently made with p53, which indicate that the L3MBTL1/p53 interaction serves to control the repression of p53 target genes in the absence of cellular stress (55West L.E. Roy S. Lachmi-Weiner K. Hayashi R. Shi X. Appella E. Kutatelodze T.G. Gozani O. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because L3MBTL1 has been shown to homodimerize (54Boccuni P. MacGrogan D. Scandura J.M. Nimer S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15412-15420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), future studies will determine if L3MBTL1 bound to methylated RB (and p53) also has the potential to bind methylated histones on the same monomer or as a dimer. This would provide a direct physical link between the “RB code,” the “histone code,” and structurally repressed chromatin. Because L3MBTL1 is the homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein dL(3)MBT (52Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), future experiments should also investigate the tumor suppressor function of L3MBTL1 in mammals.

We here show that genetic ablation of keratin 17 (Krt17) protein, which is induced in basaloid skin tumors and co-polymerizes with Krt5 in vivo, delays basaloid follicular hamartoma tumor initiation and growth in mice with constitutive Hh signaling in epidermis. This delay is preceded by a reduced inflammation and a polarization of inflammatory cytokines from a Th1- and Th17-dominated profile to a Th2-dominated profile. Absence of Krt17 also attenuates hyperplasia and inflammation in models of acute dermatitis. Re-expression of Krt17 in Gli2(tg); Krt17(-/-) keratinocytes induces select Th1 chemokines that have established roles in BCC. Our findings establish an immunomodulatory role for Krt17 in Hh driven basaloid skin tumors that could impact additional tumor settings, psoriasis and wound repair."
https://openalex.org/W2071689359,"The characterization of miR-380-5p–driven p53 repression provides a new mechanism for downmodulation of stress-induced antiproliferative responses in wild-type p53 contexts, including embryonic stem cells and neuroblastoma tumors. miR-380-5p potentiates Ras-induced mammary gland tumorigenesis and is frequently elevated in human neuroblastomas. miR-380-5p inactivation induces tumor cell death and shows therapeutic efficacy in orthotopic neuroblastoma models. Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway allows cell survival in times of stress and occurs in many human cancers; however, normal embryonic stem cells and some cancers such as neuroblastoma maintain wild-type human TP53 and mouse Trp53 (referred to collectively as p53 herein). Here we describe a miRNA, miR-380-5p, that represses p53 expression via a conserved sequence in the p53 3′ untranslated region (UTR). miR-380-5p is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and neuroblastomas, and high expression correlates with poor outcome in neuroblastomas with neuroblastoma derived v-myc myelocytomatosis viral-related oncogene (MYCN) amplification. miR-380 overexpression cooperates with activated HRAS oncoprotein to transform primary cells, block oncogene-induced senescence and form tumors in mice. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-380-5p in embryonic stem or neuroblastoma cells results in induction of p53, and extensive apoptotic cell death. In vivo delivery of a miR-380-5p antagonist decreases tumor size in an orthotopic mouse model of neuroblastoma. We demonstrate a new mechanism of p53 regulation in cancer and stem cells and uncover a potential therapeutic target for neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2030868502,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) play a central role in development, synaptic plasticity, and neurological disease. NMDAR subunit composition defines their biophysical properties and downstream signaling. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates the NR2B subunit within its PDZ-binding domain; however, the consequences for NMDAR localization and function are unclear. Here we show that CK2 phosphorylation of NR2B regulates synaptic NR2B and NR2A in response to activity. We find that CK2 phosphorylates NR2B, but not NR2A, to drive NR2B-endocytosis and remove NR2B from synapses resulting in an increase in synaptic NR2A expression. During development there is an activity-dependent switch from NR2B to NR2A at cortical synapses. We observe an increase in CK2 expression and NR2B phosphorylation over this same critical period and show that the acute activity-dependent switch in NR2 subunit composition at developing hippocampal synapses requires CK2 activity. Thus, CK2 plays a central role in determining the NR2 subunit content of synaptic NMDARs."
https://openalex.org/W2069454459,"In the Drosophila antennal lobe, excitation can spread between glomerular processing channels. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of lateral excitation. Dual recordings from excitatory local neurons (eLNs) and projection neurons (PNs) showed that eLN-to-PN synapses transmit both hyperpolarization and depolarization, are not diminished by blocking chemical neurotransmission, and are abolished by a gap-junction mutation. This mutation eliminates odor-evoked lateral excitation in PNs and diminishes some PN odor responses. This implies that lateral excitation is mediated by electrical synapses from eLNs onto PNs. In addition, eLNs form synapses onto inhibitory LNs. Eliminating these synapses boosts some PN odor responses and reduces the disinhibitory effect of GABA receptor antagonists on PNs. Thus, eLNs have two opposing effects on PNs, driving both direct excitation and indirect inhibition. We propose that when stimuli are weak, lateral excitation promotes sensitivity, whereas when stimuli are strong, lateral excitation helps recruit inhibitory gain control."
https://openalex.org/W2000647702,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent used for the treatment of high-grade gliomas. Acquired chemoresistance is a severe limitation to this therapy with more than 90% of recurrent gliomas showing no response to a second cycle of chemotherapy. Efforts to better understand the underlying mechanisms of acquired chemoresistance to TMZ and potential strategies to overcome chemoresistance are, therefore, critically needed. TMZ methylates nuclear DNA and induces cell death; however, the impact on mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial bioenergetics is not known. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that TMZ-mediated alterations in mtDNA and respiratory function contribute to TMZ-dependent acquired chemoresistance. Using an in vitro model of TMZ-mediated acquired chemoresistance, we report 1) a decrease in mtDNA copy number and the presence of large heteroplasmic mtDNA deletions in TMZ-resistant glioma cells, 2) remodeling of the entire electron transport chain with significant decreases of complexes I and V and increases of complexes II/III and IV, and 3) pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of cytochrome c oxidase, which restores sensitivity to TMZ-dependent apoptosis in resistant glioma cells. Importantly, human primary and recurrent pairs of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) biopsies as well as primary and TMZ-resistant GBM xenograft lines exhibit similar remodeling of the ETC. Overall these results suggest that TMZ-dependent acquired chemoresistance may be due to a mitochondrial adaptive response to TMZ genotoxic stress with a major contribution from cytochrome c oxidase. Thus, abrogation of this adaptive response may reverse chemoresistance and restore sensitivity to TMZ, providing a strategy for improved therapeutic outcomes in GBM patients. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent used for the treatment of high-grade gliomas. Acquired chemoresistance is a severe limitation to this therapy with more than 90% of recurrent gliomas showing no response to a second cycle of chemotherapy. Efforts to better understand the underlying mechanisms of acquired chemoresistance to TMZ and potential strategies to overcome chemoresistance are, therefore, critically needed. TMZ methylates nuclear DNA and induces cell death; however, the impact on mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial bioenergetics is not known.

Chemotherapeutics play an important role in the combined treatment of gliomas, but ultimately chemotherapy generally fails to demonstrate a sustainable beneficial clinical outcome due to the acquired chemoresistance to drugs such as temozolomide (TMZ). 2The abbreviations used are: TMZtemozolomideOCRoxygen consumption rateECARextracellular acidification rateMGMTO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferaseCcOcytochrome c oxidaseNMPN-methyl mesoporphyrin IXGBMglioblastoma multiformeFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazonePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseETCelectron transport chain. This compound is an alkylating agent that has shown significant initial benefit in the treatment of high-grade gliomas, especially when combined with radiotherapy. Although TMZ is commonly used in the adjunctive treatment of gliomas, eventually chemotherapy becomes impaired by development of chemoresistance. This phenomenon presents the most challenging barrier in the successful treatment of cancer and is the principal reason of chemotherapy failure (1Stupp R. Mason W.P. van den Bent M.J. Weller M.

TMZ is known to target nuclear DNA (nDNA) and generate several nuclear DNA adducts that block the cell cycle and lead to cell death through apoptosis. Mitochondria contain their own extra-nuclear DNA (mtDNA). This DNA is potentially a prime target for mutagens due to 1) the lack of protective histones associated with mtDNA (3Eshaghian A.

Wallace D.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4647-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) although mitochondrial nucleoids provide some protection (5Spelbrink J.N. IUBMB Life. 2010; 62: 19-32PubMed Google Scholar), 2) the fact that mtDNA polymerase γ replicates the DNA with poor fidelity (6Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Science. 1981; 213: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), 3) the presence of respiratory chain enzymes that can generate reactive oxygen species in close proximity to the mtDNA (7Oberley L.W. Buettner G.R. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 1141-1149PubMed Google Scholar), and 4) the high lipid content of mitochondria, which makes the organelle particularly sensitivity to lipophilic xenobiotics and lipid peroxidation products that modify DNA (8Ledoux S.P. Shen C.C. Grishko V.I. Fields P.A. Gard A.L. Wilson G.L. Glia. 1998; 24: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mutation rate of mtDNA is much higher when compared with nuclear DNA (4Brandon M. Baldi P. Wallace D.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4647-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 9Wei Y.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although mtDNA mutations have been suggested as factors in carcinogenesis, little is known about their role in the acquisition of chemoresistance in glioma. Recently, several lines of evidence obtained from mtDNA-depleted cancer cells (i.e. ρ0 cells) have revealed that mitochondrial DNA deletion results in resistance to apoptosis (10Biswas G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Avadhani N.G. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Park S.Y. Chang I. Kim J.Y. Kang S.W. Park S.H. Singh K. Lee M.S. J. Biol.

Schumaker L.M. Egorin M.J. Zuhowski E.G. Guo Z. Cullen K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 5817-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) as is the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and vincristine for ρ0 colon cancer cells (13Amuthan G. Biswas G. Ananadatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Shephard H.M. Avadhani N.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7839-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this study we tested whether TMZ targets mtDNA and modifies mitochondrial function using TMZ-resistant glioma cells and xenografts. We showed that TMZ reduced mtDNA copy number, increased mitochondrial heteroplasmy, and induced profound changes in the activities of the mitochondrial ETC and cellular bioenergetic function. Most strikingly, these changes are likely to be clinically relevant since they were recapitulated in patient biopsies after adjuvant therapy with TMZ. TMZ-sensitive U251 cells and their TMZ-resistant counterparts (UTMZ) were grown in DMEM F-12 medium plus l-glutamine supplemented with 7% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The resistant cell line was obtained by progressive adaptation of the parental sensitive cells (U251) to increasing concentrations of TMZ (see supplemental Fig. 1A). The establishment and maintenance of the Mayo GBM xenograft panel has been described (14Giannini C. Sarkaria J.N. Saito A. Uhm J.H. Galanis E. Carlson B.L. Schroeder M.A. James C.D. Neuro. Oncol. 2005; 7: 164-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). TMZ resistance models were developed by subjecting mice with established flank tumors to successively higher doses of TMZ until tumor growth was no longer inhibited by 120 mg/kg/day TMZ for 5 days. The resulting TMZ-resistant lines were maintained by serial passage. The efficacy of TMZ (66 mg/kg/day x 5 days) in orthotopic xenografts was evaluated as described (15Carlson B.L. Grogan P.T. Mladek A.C. Schroeder M.A. Kitange G.J. Decker P.A. Giannini C. Wu W. Ballman K.A. James C.D. Sarkaria J.N. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2009; 75: 212-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All animal studies were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mitochondria were prepared according to Higuchi and Linn (16Higuchi Y. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7950-7956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in PBS. The pellet was resuspended in MgRSB buffer (10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and then disrupted with a Dounce glass homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted with 1.3 volumes of MSB buffer (0.525 m mannitol, 175 mm sucrose, 12.5 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The mitochondrial pellets were then digested with DNase I (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min to digest nuclear DNA. After digestion, the mitochondrial pellets were washed 3 times with MSB, deep-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Mitochondrial complex activities were determined as previously described (17Darley-Usmar V.M. Capaldi R.A. Takamiya S. Millett F. Wilson M.T. Malatesta F. Sarti P. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach.

IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar). All activities were normalized to citrate synthase activity. Protein expression levels of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) subunits in mitochondria extracts from U251 and UTMZ cells were determined by Western blot analysis. Ten μg of mitochondrial protein was loaded on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blot were performed as we previously described (19Griguer C.E. Oliva C.R. Gobin E. Marcorelles P. Benos D.J. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Gillespie G.Y. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Griguer C.E. Oliva C.R. Kelley E.E. Giles G.I. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Gillespie G.Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the catalytic subunits of CcO were from Mitosciences (Eugene, OR). All the antibodies against the nuclear-encoded subunits were from Proteintech Group Inc. (Chicago, IL) except the monoclonal antibody against COX-IV-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) was used to determine the bioenergetic profile of intact cells as previously described (21Hill B.G. Dranka B.P. Zou L. Chatham J.C. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22Ferrick D.A. Neilson A. Beeson C. Drug Discov.

Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C125-C136Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Cellular conditions were first optimized independently for both U251 and UTMZ cells. Cells were seeded at increasing densities (20,000–60,000 cells/well) and allowed to recover for 24 h, and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were determined. A seeding density of 20,000 cells/well was selected for both cell lines and used in all other bioenergetics experiments, as it gives reproducible base-line ECAR and OCR values of 50–75 mpH/min ECAR and 300–500 pmol O2/min, respectively. The mitochondrial function assay was then used to assess bioenergetic function for both U251 and UTMZ cells (21Hill B.G. Dranka B.P. Zou L. Chatham J.C. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this analysis sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A were added to the cells to define a basal OCR, ATP-linked OCR, proton leak, maximal respiratory capacity, reserve respiratory capacity, and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. To calculate these parameters we have assumed that the oligomycin-insensitive OCR is attributable to proton leak; however, oligomycin has been shown to hyperpolarize the mitochondrial membrane (24Jekabsons M.B. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32989-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and therefore, the resulting OCR is likely an upper estimate of the contribution from proton leak. All reagents were purchased from Sigma. Isolation and purification of genomic DNA from U251 and UTMZ cells was performed as previously described (25Hu M. Jex A.R. Campbell B.E. Gasser R.B. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). mtDNA copy number was determined by semiquantitative PCR as previously described (26Chiaratti M.R. Meirelles F.V. Genet. Mol. Res. 2006; 5: 55-62PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, products amplified were the nuclear-encoded 18 S rRNA gene and a fragment of the catalytic subunit 1 of CcO. The primers were as follows: 18 S sense, AAGCTTGCGTTGATTAAGTCC; 18 S antisense, TAATGATCCTTCCGCAGGTTC; CcO-1 sense, GCCGACCGTTGACTATTCTC; CcO-1 antisense, GGGTTCTTCGAATGTGTGGT. The PCR products for 18 S rRNA and CcO-1 were then submitted to electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with EtBr. Arbitrary density was plotted against PCR cycles for the two amplification products. One cycle in each curve was selected for quantification. The relative quantification of mtDNA/nDNA ratio was determined by mtDNA CcO-1/nDNA 18 S rRNA densitometry. The plasmids carrying shRNAs specific for human COX-IV-1 were purchased from Open Biosystems (ATCC Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression (IMAGE) catalog no. RHS4533). To generate stable cell lines, 5 μg of TRCN0000046288, 0000046289, 0000046290, 0000046291, and 0000046292 or empty vector (pLKO.1) were transfected into UTMZ cells with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Two days after transfection, cells were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks. Clones were assayed for protein expression by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against COX-IV-1 (Abcam, clone ab14744). Several positive clones were expanded, and clone 15 was chosen for further use in this study. Data were evaluated using GraphPad program. Statistical differences were determined using the Wilcoxon test. All reported p values are two-sided, and p values of less than 0.01 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Experiments were performed by triplicate and were performed twice or more to verify the results except for human tissues biopsies. Data are shown as the means ± S.E. To understand the mechanisms underlying TMZ chemoresistance, we generated and characterized a TMZ-chemoresistant stable glioma cell line for use as a model; we induced TMZ resistance in an established human glioma cell line, U251. We isolated TMZ-resistant clones via stepwise selection of U251 glioma cells as previously described (27Watson M.B. Lind M.J. Cawkwell L. Anticancer Drugs. 2007; 18: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Resistant clones were isolated at an early stage of drug treatment (2.5 μm TMZ) and then successively exposed them to incremental doses of TMZ (up to 1 mm) (supplemental Fig. 1A) to yield clones that were operationally resistant to doses of TMZ that would uniformly kill all U251 parental cells; these clones were designated as UTMZ. UTMZ cells were maintained in 160 μm TMZ. For more than 50 passages, the resistance to TMZ was retained. TMZ is known to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (28Günther W. Pawlak E. Damasceno R. Arnold H. Terzis A.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Hirose Y. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we carried out cell cycle analysis of U251 (TMZ-sensitive) and UTMZ (TMZ-resistant clone) cells by using DNA flow cytometric analysis. Cell-cycle distributions after 48 h of exposure to 500 μm TMZ were analyzed. Acute exposure to TMZ decreased the number of cells in G1 from 53 to 15% and increased cells in S phase from 34 to 58% and in G2/M from 12 to 27%. As predicted, TMZ did not affect cell cycle profile and distribution in UTMZ cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). The effect of TMZ on the induction of apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry. Two-color flow cytometric analysis using phycoerythrin-annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D discriminated viable cells (live), early apoptotic cells (apoptotic), and both late apoptotic and necrotic cells (dead) (supplemental Fig. 1C). Compared with treatment with vehicle, U251 cells treated with 500 μm TMZ exhibited a time-dependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic and non-viable cells. After 7 days of TMZ treatment, the percentage of apoptotic and non-viable cells increased to 37 and 50%, respectively. In contrast, neither apoptosis nor cell death was induced in UTMZ cells (supplemental Fig. 1D). The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) plays an important role in cellular resistance to alkylating agents, including TMZ (30Gerson S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 296-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Because more than 70% of gliomas express MGMT (31Silber J.R. Mueller B.A. Ewers T.G. Berger M.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3416-3420PubMed Google Scholar), we compared MGMT expression in U251 and UTMZ cells by Western blot. supplemental Fig. 1E shows that MGMT expression is down-regulated in UTMZ, indicating that MGMT status is not associated with response to TMZ in UTMZ cells. The cytotoxicity of TMZ is mediated by the addition of methyl groups in genomic DNA (32Middlemas D.S. Stewart C.F. Kirstein M.N. Poquette C. Friedman H.S. Houghton P.J. Brent T.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 998-1007PubMed Google Scholar, 33Plummer E.R. Middleton M.R. Jones C. Olsen A. Hickson I. McHugh P. Margison G.P. McGown G. Thorncroft M. Watson A.J. Boddy A.V. Calvert A.H.

Graziani G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among the lesions produced in DNA by TMZ, the most common is methylation at the N7 position of guanine followed by methylation at the O3 position of adenine and the O6 position of guanine (35Denny B.J. Wheelhouse R.T. Stevens M.F. Tsang L.L. Slack J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9045-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Because mtDNA lacks the protective effects of histones and is less efficiently repaired compared with nuclear DNA (36Singh K.K. Russell J. Sigala B. Zhang Y. Williams J. Keshav K.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6641-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Richard S.M. Bailliet G. Páez G.L. Bianchi M.S. Peltomäki P. Bianchi N.O. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4231-4237PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that mtDNA may be susceptible to damage by chronic TMZ treatment. To test this, we isolated total DNA from U251 and UTMZ cells and analyzed mtDNA integrity and mtDNA copy number. Quantitative PCR was performed to assess mtDNA copy number. Segments from both mtDNA and nDNA were amplified, and the relative mtDNA to nDNA ratio was assessed in UTMZ cells compared with that of U251 controls. MtDNA copy number in UTMZ cells was reduced by 75% compared with levels in U251 (p > 0.01) (Fig. 1A). To compare mtDNA integrity, mitochondrial DNA from U251 and UTMZ cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3) was amplified using primers oriented in opposite directions in the cytochrome b gene using long-extension PCR (3Eshaghian A. Vleugels R.A. Canter J.A. McDonald M.A. Stasko T. Sligh J.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 336-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine whether deleted mtDNA species are present. Full-length mtDNA is indicated by the amplification of a 16.3-kb product, and mtDNAs harboring deletions are indicated by the presence of shorter fragments. Although it appears that U251 parental cells contain predominantly full-length mtDNA, deleted mtDNAs were the only species detected in this assay in UTMZ cells (Fig. 1B). Because UTMZ cells were cultured under the continuous presence of TMZ and to exclude the possibility that the failure to obtain full-length mtDNA amplification was due to PCR inhibition by TMZ, two controls were performed. mtDNA isolated from U251 cells exposed to acute treatment with TMZ (160 μm, 18 h) contained predominantly full-length mtDNA after long-extension PCR, whereas PCR amplification of mtDNA from UTMZ cells cultured for more than 30 passages without TMZ displayed only species of deleted mtDNAs (data not shown). We found that the profile of ETC activities was significantly different in the TMZ-resistant glioma cells (UTMZ) when compared with the parental, TMZ-sensitive glioma cell line (U251) (Fig. 2A). The activity of complex I was significantly lower in UTMZ cells (53.2 ± 5.1 nmol/min/mg) than for U251 cells (154.4 ± 8.2 nmol/min/mg) (p = 0.0005). Similarly, complex V activity was decreased by 2-fold in UTMZ cells (472.6 ± 0.6 versus 834.6 ± 35 nmol/min/mg, p = 0.0005). In contrast, complexes II-III activity was significantly increased in the TMZ-resistant cell line (587.1 ± 33.3 nmol /min/mg) when compared with U251 glioma cells (140.3 ± 40.1 nmol/min/mg) (p = 0.001). The activity of CcO was also increased by long term TMZ treatment. For example, the activity of CcO in U251 cells was 264.4 ± 12.2 nmol/min/mg compared with 1438 ± 65.6 nmol/min/mg for the UTMZ cells (p = 0.003). Because there have been several demonstrations of the reactions of alkylating agents with thiol groups (38Craddock V.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Roberts J.J. Warwick G.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1963; 12: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it is possible that the reduced activities of Complexes I and V are due to direct inhibition by TMZ. To exclude this possibility, we measured mitochondrial complex activities from U251 cells exposed to acute treatment with TMZ (160 μm for 24 h). There were no significant differences in the specific activities of the complexes after acute TMZ treatment related to control, untreated cells (supplemental Fig. 2). These results suggest that resistance to TMZ is associated with the remodeling of all ETC complexes, including the ATP synthase. Because CcO activity influences the overall rates of mitochondrial respiration and electron transport and CcO activity is elevated in TMZ-resistant glioma cells, we carried out analyses of the expression of CcO subunits. Western blots of the subunits involved in the catalytic activity of CcO (I, II, and III) showed similar expression of COXI in both cells lines. However, using monoclonal antibodies, we were not able to detect COXII in UTMZ cells or COXIII in U251 cells (Fig. 2B). Because the catalytic subunits are essential for CcO activity, our data would be consistent with a selective loss of epitopes necessary for the recognition by the antibodies or that the epitopes are affected by posttranslational modifications. Analysis of the 10 nuclear-encoded subunits that are important for the regulation of CcO (40Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) indicated that the other major change between cell lines is the switch in COX-IV isoforms. Fig. 2B shows that COX-IV-1 is the main isoform detected in UTMZ cells (41Fukuda R. Zhang H. Kim J.W. Shimoda L. Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Cell. 2007; 129: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). In contrast, U251 cells express mostly the COX-IV-2 isoform. Because the relative activities of the major respiratory chain complexes are altered in TMZ resistance, we next tested whether this has a significant impact on cellular bioenergetics. The bioenergetic profile of U251 and UTMZ cells was determined according to a previously developed mitochondrial function assay represented schematically in Fig. 3A (24Jekabsons M.B. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32989-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, after a base-line OCR was established, oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A were injected sequentially, and measurements of OCR were made after the addition of each specific inhibitor. Using this mitochondrial function assay, we have determined the basic bioenergetic profile of U251 parental and UTMZ cells (Fig. 3B). There was no significant difference between the two cell lines in basal OCR, suggesting that each cell possesses sufficient mitochondrial capacity to satisfy basic the energy demands of the cell (Fig. 3C). In addition, there were no significant differences with respect to ATP-linked oxygen consumption or proton leak between the two cell lines (data not shown). The addition of the uncoupler FCCP induces electron transport unconstrained by the requirement to synthesize ATP. The resulting OCR is then an estimation of the maximal respiratory capacity that can be sustained with available cellular substrates and the respiratory chain. Interestingly, the reserve respiratory capacity was significantly increased in UTMZ cells when compared with the parental U251 cells (Fig. 3D). In addition to the OCR, the ECAR of the medium was also determined. As shown in Fig. 3E, ECAR decreased in UTMZ cells when compared with the parental U251 cells. These findings suggested that TMZ-resistant glioma cells are less glycolytic than the sensitive U251 cells. Based on the results showing increased activities of complexes II-III and IV in chemoresistant UTMZ cells, we hypothesized that suppression of the activities of one or more of these two complexes should restore susceptibility to TMZ. To examine whether enhanced CcO activity is linked to TMZ resistance to cell killing, we treated UTMZ cells with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMP), an inhibitor of ferrochelatase that decreases the activity of CcO by preferentially inhibiting heme a synthesis (42Atamna H. Liu J. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48410-48416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 43Campian J.L. Qian M. Gao X. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46580-46587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Heme a is an essential component of CcO assembly and function with inhibition-blocking CcO activity. Inhibition of heme a was established by treating UTMZ with 5 μm NMP for 3 days. NMP treatment of UTMZ cells decreased CcO activity by 98% (p < 0.0001) without any associated cell death (data not shown). Complex II-III activities were also decreased by 60%. As expected the activities of complexes I and V were unchanged (Fig. 4A). It is important to note that NMP-treated UTMZ cells lost resistance to TMZ and progressively died after 6 days of exposure to TMZ. After 4 days of treatment with 300 μm TMZ, the percentage of annexin V-positive cells was 34.7 ± 2.4% for the NMP-treated UTMZ cells, but almost no apoptotic cells were found in UTMZ cells not treated with NMP (Fig. 4B). Apoptosis in NMP-treated UTMZ cells was accompanied by PARP cleavage (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that pharmacological alteration of ETC in UTMZ cells reversed chemoresistance. We used shRNA stable transfections to test whether COX-IV-1 expression is responsible of the overall increase in CcO activity in UTMZ cells. Western blots revealed significantly decreased (60%) of COX-IV-1 expression in UTMZ cells transfected with expression vector encoding a short-hairpin RNA that blocks the expression of COX-IV-1 (Fig. 5, A and B). If the protection against the cytotoxic effect of TMZ is mediated by expression of COX-IV-1, then genetic inhibition of this subunit should de"

This mutation confers toxic function to AR through unknown mechanisms. Mutant AR toxicity requires binding of its hormone ligand, suggesting that pathogenesis involves ligand-induced changes in AR. However, whether toxicity is mediated by native AR function or a novel AR function is unknown. We systematically investigated events downstream of ligand-dependent AR activation in a Drosophila model of SBMA. We show that nuclear translocation of AR is necessary, but not sufficient, for toxicity and that DNA binding by AR is necessary for toxicity. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that a functional AF-2 domain is essential for toxicity, a finding corroborated by a genetic screen that identified AF-2 interactors as dominant modifiers of degeneration. These findings indicate that SBMA pathogenesis is mediated by misappropriation of native protein function, a mechanism that may apply broadly to polyglutamine diseases.

Nuclear translocation of mutant AR is insufficient to initiate neurodegeneration DNA binding by mutant AR is necessary to initiate neurodegeneration AR coregulators are genetic modifiers of mutant AR-related neurodegeneration A functional AF-2 domain is essential for mutant AR to initiate neurodegeneration Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known as Kennedy's disease) is a progressive late-onset degenerative disorder of the motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord that affects only men (Kennedy et al., 1968Kennedy W.R. Alter M. Sung J.H. Progressive proximal spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy of late onset. A sex-linked recessive trait.Neurology. 1968; 18: 671-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SBMA is a member of the polyglutamine repeat disease family, which includes at least eight other disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and six forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). All of these diseases are caused by gain-of-function mutations characterized by expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeats in exonic regions of DNA, and all result in late-onset, progressive neurodegeneration (Zoghbi and Orr, 2000Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Glutamine repeats and neurodegeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In SBMA, the CAG repeat site is located in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and causes disease when the number of repeats is 40 or greater (La Spada et al., 1991La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H. Androgen receptor gene mutations in X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.Nature. 1991; 352: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). Patients often display signs of mild feminization, likely due to partial loss of AR function. Although loss of AR function may contribute to disease (Thomas et al., 2006Thomas Jr., P.S. Fraley G.S. Damian V. Damien V. Woodke L.B. Zapata F. Sopher B.L. Plymate S.R. La Spada A.R.

Genet. 2006; 15: 2225-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it is not sufficient for degeneration, as loss-of-function mutations to AR result in androgen insensitivity syndrome without signs of neuronal degeneration (Quigley et al., 1992Quigley C.A.

Metab. 1992; 74: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A central mystery in the field of polyglutamine disease research arises from the observation that the same mutation in nine different proteins results in nine different diseases; yet in each disease, different subsets of neurons are affected. This pattern occurs despite widespread and overlapping expression of the disease proteins, suggesting that the inherent toxicity of the expanded polyglutamine is not the sole basis of toxicity. Indeed, in SBMA mouse models, expression of polyglutamine-expanded fragments of AR results in widespread neuronal degeneration, a phenotype that is not dissimilar from that observed in transgenic animal models expressing fragments of other polyglutamine-expanded proteins (Abel et al., 2001Abel A. Walcott J. Woods J. Duda J. Merry D.E. Expression of expanded repeat androgen receptor produces neurologic disease in transgenic mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, models employing full-length polyglutamine-expanded AR protein more accurately reflect the human disease, displaying restricted symptoms, lower motor neuron specificity in degeneration, and gender specificity (Chevalier-Larsen et al., 2004Chevalier-Larsen E.S.

These findings highlight the importance of protein context in polyglutamine disease, and raise the question of the role of protein domains other than the polyglutamine tract in toxicity. It is not clear whether the mutation results in the formation of novel, toxic interactions, or whether the mutation alters the normal, native interactions of the polyglutamine-containing protein in such a way as to result in neurotoxicity. Though these possibilities are not mutually exclusive, recent studies in SCA1, SCA7, and SCA17 have provided evidence in favor of a model in which the normal function of the disease protein is tied to the mechanism of pathogenesis (Emamian et al., 2003Emamian E.S.

More direct evidence that native interactions may mediate toxicity comes from animal models in which overexpression of nonexpanded ataxin-1 or AR results in pathology resembling SCA1 and SBMA, respectively (Fernandez-Funez et al., 2000Fernandez-Funez P. Nino-Rosales M.L. de Gouyon B. She W.C. Luchak J.M. Martinez P. Turiegano E. Benito J. Capovilla M.

Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18259-18264Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the majority of polyglutamine diseases, neither the primary function nor the native interactors of the disease proteins are well known. SBMA is an exception in that the disease protein has a well-characterized role as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. AR is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily and resides in the cytoplasm when inactive. A number of events occur upon ligand binding, the final result of which is AR-mediated activation or repression of target genes. These ligand-induced events include several posttranslational modifications, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. These changes occur in concert with conformational changes that result in the exposure of two coregulator interaction surfaces, termed activation function-1 (AF-1) and activation function-2 (AF-2). Ligand binding to polyglutamine-expanded AR is a requisite step in disease pathogenesis. Indeed, there is now incontrovertible evidence from animal model studies as well as human studies that gender specificity in SBMA is due to higher levels of circulating androgens in males (Katsuno et al., 2002Katsuno M. Adachi H. Kume A. Li M. Nakagomi Y. Niwa H. Sang C. Kobayashi Y. Doyu M. Sobue G. Testosterone reduction prevents phenotypic expression in a transgenic mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.Neuron. 2002; 35: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, Takeyama et al., 2002Takeyama K. Ito S. Yamamoto A. Tanimoto H. Furutani T. Kanuka H. Miura M. Tabata T. Kato S. Androgen-dependent neurodegeneration by polyglutamine-expanded human androgen receptor in Drosophila.Neuron. 2002; 35: 855-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although the basis of the toxic gain of function imparted by the polyglutamine expansion remains unknown, the ligand dependence of SBMA implies that ligand-induced alterations of AR play important roles in toxicity. In this study, we used a Drosophila model to test the hypothesis that SBMA is mediated by ligand-induced alterations in native AR interactions. First, we present evidence that nuclear translocation of AR is necessary, but not sufficient, for toxicity, demonstrating that ligand-induced modifications of AR (beyond nuclear translocation) are required for pathogenesis. Second, we show that DNA binding of polyglutamine-expanded AR is required for toxicity, indicating that the native DNA-binding function of AR is critical to pathogenesis. Third, we use a genetic screen to identify modifiers of SBMA toxicity, which reveal a pattern of AF-2-based coregulators that genetically interact with polyglutamine-expanded AR. Pursuing this finding, we show rescue of polyglutamine-expanded AR toxicity through two independent point mutations designed to disrupt the AF-2 coregulator interaction surface. To more precisely define the degenerative phenotype associated with polyglutamine-expanded AR toxicity, we used expression profile analysis. This analysis confirmed that interruption of either the AF-2 or DNA binding domains robustly suppressed this molecular phenotype. In addition, analysis of the molecular phenotype of flies expressing wild-type AR revealed the same (albeit weaker) molecular phenotype as polyglutamine-expanded AR, indicating that amplification of normal AR function may underlie the toxicity of polyglutamine-expanded AR. Finally, we investigated the AR coregulator ortholog limpet, a gene identified in our genetic screen, as proof of principle that polyglutamine-expanded AR toxicity is mediated via native function of the AF-2 binding surface following DNA binding. In order to investigate the contributions of AR interactions to polyglutamine-expanded AR toxicity, we used a Drosophila model of SBMA. Although human AR has no direct ortholog in flies, the NHR system is well conserved (King-Jones and Thummel, 2005King-Jones K. Thummel C.S. Nuclear receptors—a perspective from Drosophila.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This conservation is reflected in the domain architecture of Drosophila nuclear receptors, including AF-1 and AF-2 coregulator interaction domains that bind to conserved motifs in nuclear receptor coregulators. It was previously demonstrated that human AR expressed in Drosophila tissues translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of an ARE-GFP reporter transgene in response to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Takeyama et al., 2002Takeyama K. Ito S. Yamamoto A. Tanimoto H. Furutani T. Kanuka H. Miura M. Tabata T. Kato S. Androgen-dependent neurodegeneration by polyglutamine-expanded human androgen receptor in Drosophila.Neuron. 2002; 35: 855-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This cross-species transactivational capacity reflects the fact that human AR interacts with endogenous Drosophila coactivators and corepressors; indeed, genetic modulation of Drosophila homologs of mammalian AR coregulators can modify the transactivational capacity of AR in vivo (Takeyama et al., 2004Takeyama K. Ito S. Sawatsubashi S. Shirode Y. Yamamoto A. Suzuki E. Maki A. Yamagata K. Zhao Y. Kouzmenko A. et al.A novel genetic system for analysis of co-activators for the N-terminal transactivation function domain of the human androgen receptor.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When human AR of varying polyglutamine lengths is expressed using the GAL4-UAS system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), flies develop polyglutamine length- and ligand-dependent degenerative phenotypes, thus recapitulating two fundamental features of SBMA (Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B.

To assess toxicity in an externally visible neuronal tissue, we expressed AR in the eye using the glass multimer reporter driver (GMR-GAL4), which leads to transgene expression in photoreceptor neurons and accessory pigment cells in developing eye discs (Moses and Rubin, 1991Moses K. Rubin G.M. Glass encodes a site-specific DNA-binding protein that is regulated in response to positional signals in the developing Drosophila eye.Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Whereas flies expressing AR show no eye phenotype when reared on normal food, flies reared on food containing DHT exhibit a degenerative phenotype that is limited to the posterior margin of the eye (Figure 1A ). The severity of the phenotype is also polyglutamine-length dependent, with AR52Q-expressing flies showing severe ommatidial pitting, disorganization, and fusion, as well as abnormal and supernumerary interommatidial bristles. In contrast, AR12Q-expressing flies show only mild ommatidial and bristle phenotypes when the transgene is expressed at equivalent levels (Figures 1A–1C). Confocal imaging of eye discs confirmed that AR undergoes DHT-dependent nuclear translocation in vivo. This analysis also revealed diffuse nuclear accumulation of AR and the formation of small nuclear and cytoplasmic puncta that were particularly prominent with polyglutamine-expanded AR (Figure 1D). The polyglutamine length- and DHT-dependence of SBMA is recapitulated in several larval tissues. For example, using the larval salivary gland driver (fkh-GAL4) (Andrew et al., 2000Andrew D.J. Henderson K.D. Seshaiah P. Salivary gland development in Drosophila melanogaster.Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), expression of polyglutamine-expanded AR results in a dramatic reduction of salivary gland cell size (Figures 1E and 1F). Larvae expressing AR in motor neurons under the control of the D42-GAL4 driver (Yeh et al., 1995Yeh E. Gustafson K. Boulianne G.L. Green fluorescent protein as a vital marker and reporter of gene expression in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) also show polyglutamine length- and DHT-dependent defects in locomotor ability as measured by larval crawling assay, indicating a significant functional deficit (Figure 1G). In addition, the number of type 1B boutons at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is significantly decreased in a DHT-dependent manner when polyglutamine-expanded AR is expressed using the motor neuron driver OK371-GAL4 (Mahr and Aberle, 2006Mahr A. Aberle H. The expression pattern of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter: a marker protein for motoneurons and glutamatergic centers in the brain.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2006; 6: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Figures 1H and 1I). Importantly, we noticed that expression of wild-type polyglutamine-length AR at high levels results in a degenerative phenotype that is indistinguishable from that caused by polyglutamine-expanded AR (Figures 1J and 1K). This is reminiscent of the SBMA-like phenotype associated with high-level expression of wild-type AR in mice (Monks et al., 2007Monks D.A. Johansen J.A. Mo K. Rao P. Eagleson B. Yu Z. Lieberman A.P. Breedlove S.M. Jordan C.L. Overexpression of wild-type androgen receptor in muscle recapitulates polyglutamine disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18259-18264Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent toxicity of wild-type AR suggests the possibility that amplification of native AR function may contribute to the toxicity of polyglutamine-expanded AR. The observation that ligand binding to AR is required for pathogenesis suggests a model in which nontoxic AR is converted to a proteotoxin through ligand-induced events. The first major event to occur upon ligand binding is translocation of AR to the nucleus. In most polyglutamine diseases, the primary site of cellular toxicity is thought to be the nucleus (Klement et al., 1998Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y.

In the case of SBMA, whether nuclear translocation of polyglutamine-expanded AR is both necessary and sufficient for toxicity has not been examined in vivo. AR has three major domains (Figure 2A ): (1) an N-terminal transactivation domain (NTD) that contains AF-1 and serves as a coregulator interaction surface, (2) a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that binds regulatory elements in AR-regulated promoters, and (3) a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds testosterone or DHT and also harbors a second coregulator interaction surface (AF-2). Bridging the DBD and LBD is a flexible hinge domain that harbors a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS). To address the necessity of nuclear translocation, we generated two AR constructs designed to remain in the cytoplasm even in the presence of DHT (Figure 2A). In the first construct, we used phosphomimetic substitutions of serines 210 and 790 (AR65Q SS/DD) that prevent DHT binding to AR (Palazzolo et al., 2007Palazzolo I. Burnett B.G. Young J.E. Brenne P.L. La Spada A.R. Fischbeck K.H. Howell B.W. Pennuto M. Akt blocks ligand binding and protects against expanded polyglutamine androgen receptor toxicity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the second construct, we mutated residues K632 and K633 (AR73Q KK/AA) in the NLS of AR; these substitutions markedly alter DHT-induced nuclear translocation (Thomas et al., 2004Thomas M. Dadgar N. Aphale A. Harrell J.M. Kunkel R. Pratt W.B. Lieberman A.P. Androgen receptor acetylation site mutations cause trafficking defects, misfolding, and aggregation similar to expanded glutamine tracts.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8389-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with these constructs showed that the SS/DD and KK/AA mutations each caused AR to remain in the cytoplasm even in the presence of DHT (Figures S1A and S1B available online). In order to investigate whether these cytoplasmic AR mutants cause toxicity in vivo, we generated transgenic Drosophila lines that express these proteins under the control of the GAL4-UAS system. We first confirmed that these modified AR proteins resist DHT-induced nuclear translocation in vivo in Drosophila by expressing the AR transgenes with the larval salivary gland driver fkh-GAL4. Salivary glands provide an ideal model to assess subcellular localization of proteins in Drosophila due to their highly ordered histoarchitecture and high ratio of cytoplasm to nucleus. Using fkh-GAL4, we found that whereas AR52Q showed nuclear localization, AR65Q SS/DD and AR73Q KK/AA remained in the cytoplasm despite the presence of DHT in the larval medium (Figure 2C). In order to test the toxicity of these constructs in a neuronal tissue, we next expressed the AR transgenes using GMR-GAL4. As previously shown, expression of AR52Q in the eye resulted in a degenerative phenotype in a DHT-dependent manner (Figures 2B and 2D). In contrast, eyes expressing AR65Q SS/DD or AR73Q KK/AA showed no degenerative phenotype even in the presence of DHT, despite high expression of AR (Figures 2B, 2D, and S2A). Consistent with prior reports (Montie et al., 2009Montie H.L. Cho M.S. Holder L. Liu Y. Tsvetkov A.S. Finkbeiner S. Merry D.E. Cytoplasmic retention of polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor ameliorates disease via autophagy in a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.Hum. Mol.

Androgen-dependent neurodegeneration by polyglutamine-expanded human androgen receptor in Drosophila.Neuron. 2002; 35: 855-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), these results indicate that nuclear translocation of polyglutamine-expanded AR is necessary for toxicity. In order to address whether nuclear translocation of polyglutamine-expanded AR is sufficient for toxicity, we designed AR constructs that translocate to the nucleus in a DHT-independent manner, thereby dissociating nuclear translocation from ligand binding. To this end, we fused the SV40 NLS to either the C or N terminus of AR (Figure 2A). As an additional control, we fused an NLS to the AR65Q SS/DD protein that is unable to bind DHT. COS-1 cells transfected with AR65Q-NLS or NLS-AR65Q SS/DD show AR localized to the nucleus even in the absence of DHT (Figures S1C and S1D). In addition, AR65Q-NLS retained its transactivation ability in response to DHT as measured by an ARE-luciferase reporter, though only at about 50% of AR65Q (Figure S1E). As expected, NLS-AR65Q SS/DD did not activate transcription, due to its inability to bind DHT. We next made transgenic Drosophila carrying UAS-AR65Q-NLS and UAS-NLS-AR65Q SS/DD. After confirming that AR65Q-NLS and NLS-AR65Q SS/DD translocate to the nucleus in the absence of DHT in vivo using fkh-GAL4 (Figure 2E), we expressed these transgenes in the eye using GMR-GAL4 (Figures 2F and S2B). Expression of AR65Q-NLS or NLS-AR65Q SS/DD did not cause toxicity in the absence of DHT, indicating that nuclear translocation of polyglutamine-expanded AR is not sufficient for toxicity. However, once the AR65Q-NLS animals were exposed to DHT, they developed the characteristic SBMA eye phenotype, demonstrating that DHT binding to AR provides the critical step in the conversion of polyglutamine-expanded AR from a nontoxic to a toxic molecule (Figures 2B and 2F). Having determined that the role of DHT in SBMA is not simply to effect translocation of AR to the nuclear compartment, but also to modify nuclear AR, we hypothesized that AR's function as a DNA-binding transcription factor might play a role in pathogenesis. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduced a mutation to the AR DBD (A574D) that blocks the ability of AR to bind DNA without disrupting its ligand-binding ability (Brüggenwirth et al., 1998Brüggenwirth H.T. Boehmer A.L. Lobaccaro J.M. Chiche L. Sultan C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Substitution of Ala564 in the first zinc cluster of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-binding domain of the androgen receptor by Asp, Asn, or Leu exerts differential effects on DNA binding.Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 103-110PubMed Google Scholar). AR65Q A574D showed normal DHT-induced nuclear translocation in vitro (Figure S3), although transactivation capacity was severely disrupted, as predicted due to the inability of the mutated AR to bind DNA (Figure 3"

In SCA1, phosphorylation of ATXN1 at Ser776 is thought to be key for pathogenesis. Here, we show that replacing Ser776 with a phosphomimicking Asp converted ATXN1 with a wild-type glutamine tract into a pathogenic protein. ATXN1[30Q]-D776-induced disease in Purkinje cells shared most features with disease caused by ATXN1[82Q] having an expanded polyglutamine tract. However, in contrast to disease induced by ATXN1[82Q] that progresses to cell death, ATXN1[30Q]-D776 failed to induce cell death. These results support a model where pathogenesis involves changes in regions of the protein in addition to the polyglutamine tract. Moreover, disease initiation and progression to neuronal dysfunction are distinct from induction of cell death. Ser776 is critical for the pathway to neuronal dysfunction, while an expanded polyglutamine tract is essential for neuronal death.

Glutamine expansion and D776 act synergistically to shape Ataxin-1-induced disease D776 converts wt Ataxin-1 with 30Qs to a pathogenic protein Disease initiation and neural dysfunction can occur without subsequent cell death Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), typically a late-onset fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by loss of motor coordination and balance. A prominent feature of SCA1 pathology is atrophy and loss of Purkinje cells (PCs) from the cerebellar cortex (Schut, 1950Schut J.W. Hereditary ataxia: clinical study through six generations.Arch. Neurol. Psychiatry. 1950; 63: 535-568Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Besides SCA1 the polyglutamine disorders include spinobulbar muscular atrophy, Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and SCAs 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 (Orr and Zoghbi, 2007Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Trinucleotide repeat disorders.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 575-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). A leading model of pathogenesis holds that the expanded polyglutamine tract alone triggers disease through an aggregation-based mechanism (Bates, 2003Bates G.

Various data from studies on HD exemplify this concept; for example, the presence of inclusions containing mutant huntingtin N-terminal fragments including the polyglutamine stretch that correlates with disease in patients and animal models (DiFiglia et al., 1997DiFiglia M.

Such findings support the idea that proteolysis and the generation of a polyglutamine fragment underlies the pathogenesis of HD as well as other polyglutamine disorders (Ross et al., 2003Ross C.A.

Recently we found that ATXN1 interacts with the RNA-binding motif protein 17 (RBM17) in a Ser776 and polyglutamine length-dependent fashion (Lim et al., 2008Lim J. Crespo-Barreto J. Jafar-Nejad P. Bowman A.B. Richman R. Hill D.E. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Opposing effects of polyglutamine expansion on native protein complexes contribute to SCA1.Nature. 2008; 452: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, replacing Ser with an Asp at residue 776 increased the interaction of wild-type ATXN1[30Q] with RBM17 to a level comparable to that seen with ATXN1[82Q]-S776. Thus, by this biochemical parameter, D776 in wild-type ATXN1 generated a protein with a biochemical property of mutant ATXN1[82Q]. This raises an interesting question, what is the effect of D776 on the ability of ATXN1 to cause neurodegeneration in vivo? To examine the biological relevance of D776 in ATXN1 in a mammalian model of SCA1, we generated transgenic mice expressing either ATXN1[30Q]-D776 or ATXN1[82Q]-D776 in cerebellar PCs (see Figures S1A and S1B available online), a major cellular site of pathology in SCA1. Since disease severity varies with levels of ATXN1 expression (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. SCA1 transgenic mice: a model for neurodegeneration caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat.Cell. 1995; 82: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), quantitative RT-PCR and western blots were used to assess SCA1 transgene expression in the cerebellum (Figures S1C and S1D). The ATXN1[82Q]-D776 line with the highest level of transgene expression, line 5, was selected for detailed analysis. This line expressed ATXN1 mRNA at 50% of that seen in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 line B05. ATXN1[30Q]-D776 line 2, selected for study, expressed SCA1 levels comparable to ATXN1[82Q]-S776 line B05 and twice the level seen in hemizygous ATXN1[30Q]-S776 line A02. Thus, homozygous ATXN1[30Q]-S776 mice were used as controls for ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice. Figures S1D and S1E shows that transgenic protein expression in ATXN1[30Q]-D776 and ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice is consistent with RNA expression levels with ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice expressing slightly more than ATXN1[30Q]-D776 and ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice expressing slightly more ATXN1 than ATXN1[30Q]-D776. We first examined whether ATXN1[30Q]-D776 induced pathology in vivo by calbindin immunostaining. In the cerebellum, calbindin is specifically expressed throughout PCs (Nakagawa et al., 1998Nakagawa S. Watanabe M. Isobe T. Kondo H. Inoue Y. Cytological compartmentalization in the staggerer cerebellum, as revealed by calbindin immunohistochemistry for Purkinje cells.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 395: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PCs from 12-week-old ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice showed considerable dendritic atrophy compared to age-matched homozygous control ATXN1[30Q]-S776 mice (Figure 1). While the molecular layer was reduced in overall thickness to a similar degree in all of the SCA1 mice, atrophy of the finer dendritic branches was noticeably more extensive in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice. Figure 1A shows the dense deposition of PC dendrites in the molecular layer of a WT/FVB cerebellum. In the molecular layer of ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice there was evidence of some PC dendritic atrophy, notably some pruning of the finer dendritic branches (Figure 1B). In ATXN1[82Q]-S776 and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice, pruning of PC dendrites was even more extensive (Figures 1C and 1D, respectively), with the PC dendritic atrophy in ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice similar to that seen in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice. As a further pathological assessment, we examined placement of excitatory synaptic terminals onto PCs in SCA1 mice. The two major excitatory projections to PCs, parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs), segregate the sites of their terminals (Ito, 1984Ito M. The Cerebellum and Neural Control. Raven Press, New York1984Google Scholar). While PF-PC synapses localize to the distal portions of the PC dendritic arbor, CF-PC synapses are confined to the apical dendrite and the proximal portion of the dendritic tree. Each presynaptic terminal can be defined by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). PF terminals express VGLUT1 while CF terminals express VGLUT2 (Fremeau et al., 2001Fremeau Jr., R.T. Troyer M.D. Pahner I. Nygaard G.O. Tran C.H. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Fortin D. Storm-Mathisen J. Edwards R.H. The expression of vesicular glutamate transporters defines two classes of excitatory synapse.Neuron. 2001; 31: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). No detectable difference in the immunostaining pattern for VGLUT1 in cerebellar sections from WT/FVB, ATXN1[82Q]-S776, and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice was found (data not presented). Strong VGLUT1-immunoreactive puncta representing PF boutons filled the molecular layer of all three genotypes. To assess the spatial distribution of CF terminals on PCs in the SCA1 mice, cerebellar sections were immunostained for VGLUT2. Figure 2A shows that in 12-week-old WT/FVB mice the distribution of VGLUT2 staining extended along the primary and secondary dendrites of PCs to a mean relative height of 0.86 of the molecular layer. In 12-week-old ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice (Figure 2B), the mean relative height of CF terminals along PC dendrites was reduced to 0.81. In age-matched ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice the mean relative height of the CF terminal extension was reduced further to 0.78 (Figure 2C). Interestingly, in 12-week-old ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice the extension of CF terminals on PC dendrites was considerably more compromised where the CF terminals extended into the molecular layer to a mean relative height of 0.69 (Figure 2D). Morphology of CF innervation of PCs was assessed directly by anterograde labeling of olivocerebellar projections. Injection of biotinylated dextran-amine into the contralateral inferior olive was used to visualize individual CFs and their terminals on PCs. In WT/FVB mice, as the CFs reached the inner portion of the molecular layer they gave off numerous branches that coursed along PC dendrites and extended to positions near the pial surface (Figure 2E). CFs in ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice had a modest level of CF pruning compared to WT/FVB animals (Figure 2F). Labeled CFs in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice failed to branch to an extent seen in either WT/FVB or in ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice (Figures 2G and 2H, respectively). Thus, anterograde labeling of inferior olivary neurons supported the conclusion that CF arborization and extension along PC dendrites was diminished in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice. The neurological status of ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice was determined by measuring balance/motor coordination and gait performance. Figure 3A shows that at 6 and 12 weeks of age, ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice were significantly impaired on the accelerating Rotarod compared to WT/FVB and ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice to a degree similar to that for ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice (Figure 3A). Using the DigiGait system, hind stance width was evaluated since it corresponds to the broad-based gait typical of SCA1 specifically and ataxia generally in humans (Manto, 2005Manto M.-U. The wide spectrum of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs).Cerebellum. 2005; 4: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3B, at 12 weeks of age the hind stance width did not significantly differ between the two control strains (WT/FVB and ATXN1[30Q]-S776 homozygous mice). In contrast, age-matched mice from the two affected SCA1 lines, ATXN1[82Q]-S776 and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 animals, had a significantly wider hind stance than age-matched littermate controls (Figure 3B). Thus, by two measures of motor performance, the ataxia in ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice was as severe as the ataxia in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice. A feature of disease in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice is that the neurological deficit progresses with age (Clark et al., 1997Clark H.B. Burright E.N. Yunis W.S. Larson S. Wilcox C. Hartman B. Matilla A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Purkinje cell expression of a mutant allele of SCA1 in transgenic mice leads to disparate effects on motor behaviors, followed by a progressive cerebellar dysfunction and histological alterations.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7385-7395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By 30 weeks of age, disease in both ATXN1[82Q]-S776 and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice progressed such that animals of both genotypes were essentially unable to perform the accelerating Rotarod task (Figure 3C). Thus, like ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice also have a progressive neurological disease. In ATXN1[82Q]-S776 animals, pathology eventually progresses to where PCs die (Clark et al., 1997Clark H.B. Burright E.N. Yunis W.S. Larson S. Wilcox C. Hartman B. Matilla A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Purkinje cell expression of a mutant allele of SCA1 in transgenic mice leads to disparate effects on motor behaviors, followed by a progressive cerebellar dysfunction and histological alterations.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7385-7395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess ATXN1-D776-induced disease at a late stage, we examined pathology in 1-year-old ATXN1[30Q]-D776 and compared it to pathology in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 animals. The molecular layer in 1-year-old WT/FVB mice was on average 170 μm thick (Figure S2A). Year-old ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice showed severe atrophy of PCs as quantified by molecular layer thickness as well as PC loss. The thickness of the molecular layer in these mice decreased to 123 μm in year-old animals (Figure S2B). In contrast, PC atrophy in one-year ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice was noticeably less severe. The thickness of the molecular layer of ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice showed little further atrophy from that seen at 12 weeks of age, decreasing from 159 μm at 12 weeks (see Figure 1D) to 148 μm at one year (Figure 4A ). Thus, even though ATXN1[30Q]-D776 was able to induce neuronal dysfunction and initial dendritic atrophy similar to ATXN1[82Q]-S776, in absence of an expanded polyglutamine tract progression of dendritic atrophy was reduced considerably and disease failed to advance to neuronal cell death. Failure of disease to induce PC death in ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice could be due to either the absence of an expanded polyglutamine tract or the presence of a D776. To address this, we characterized disease and its progression in animals expressing ATXN1[82Q]-D776. In these mice, immunostaining with the anti-ATXN1 antibody 11750 (Servadio et al., 1995Servadio A. Koshy B. Armstrong D. Antalffy B. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Expression analysis of the ataxin-1 protein in tissues from normal and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 individuals.Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) showed that ATXN1[82Q]-D776 protein was expressed in nuclei of PCs in a spatial fashion similar to the ATXN1[82Q]-S776 protein in mice from the B05 line. Consistent with the mRNA expression analysis (Figure S1C), immunostaining revealed that the expression level of ATXN1[82Q]-D776 (Figure S2C) was considerably less than ATXN1[82Q]-S776 (Figure S2D). Yet, as assessed by measuring the thickness of the molecular layer, ATXN1[82Q]-D776 induced a similar amount of PC dendritic atrophy as did ATXN1[82Q]-S776. At 12 weeks of age, the molecular layer was considerably reduced from a mean of 184 μm in age-matched wild-type mice to 147 μm in ATXN1[82Q]-D776 mice and to 157 μm in ATXN1[82Q]-S776 animals (Figures 4B and 4C). Neurological assessment by the accelerating Rotarod indicated that ATXN1[82Q]-D776 mice were severely affected by 12 weeks of age (Figure 4D). Thus, it took less ATXN1[82Q]-D776 than ATXN1[82Q]-S776 to induce a similar level of disease, indicating that D776 enhanced the pathogenicity of ATXN1[82Q]. Importantly, progression of Purkinje cell atrophy was more severe in year-old ATXN1[82Q]-D776 cerebella. The molecular layer of year-old ATXN1[82Q]-D776 mice was on average 97 μm (Figure 4E), considerably less than 123 μm in year-old ATXN1[82Q]-S776 cerebella (Figure S2B). Clearly, a D776 did not prevent induction of cell death and, if anything, enhanced pathology with age given that these mice expressed less ATXN1 than ATXN1[82Q]-S776 animals. Here, we show that a single amino acid substitution outside of the polyglutamine tract converted wild-type ATXN1 into a protein, which in a mammalian model of SCA1 has many of the pathogenic capabilities of the protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract. Prior studies showed that amino acids outside of the polyglutamine tract influence toxicity of a mutant polyglutamine protein (Klement et al., 1998Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H.

This study demonstrates that a D776 substitution enhanced pathogenicity of ATXN1[82Q], revealing that an expanded polyglutamine tract and S776 phosphorylation have a synergistic effect on toxicity. Moreover, a D776 converted ATXN1[30Q] into a highly pathogenic protein. Thus, placing an Asp at position 776 in ATXN1 mimics pathogenic affects of polyglutamine expansion, strongly supporting a model where polyglutamine expansion has its pathogenic effect largely by altering a property associated with another region of the protein. In particular, we argue that D776 promotes the formation of ATXN1-RBM17-containing complexes that underlie some of the toxic gain of functions (Lim et al., 2008Lim J. Crespo-Barreto J. Jafar-Nejad P. Bowman A.B. Richman R. Hill D.E. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Opposing effects of polyglutamine expansion on native protein complexes contribute to SCA1.Nature. 2008; 452: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea is the observation of an increase in the amount of RBM17 in high molecular weight complexes in both ATXN1[82Q]-S776 and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice (Figure S3). ALS nicely illustrates the concept of initiation and progression as being distinct stages of neurodegenerative disease, where evidence indicates that mutant SOD1 damage within motor neurons is linked to initiation and early stages of progression (Boillée et al., 2006Boillée S.

A mechanistically divergent later phase encompassing the progression to complete paralysis is coupled to the inflammatory response of microglia and mutant SOD1 toxicity within these cells (Boillée et al., 2006Boillée S. Yamanaka K. Lobsiger C.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kassiotis G. Kollias G. Cleveland D.W. Onset and progression in inherited ALS determined by motor neurons and microglia.Science. 2006; 312: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, Beers et al., 2006Beers D.R. Henkel J.S.

USA. 2006; 103: 16021-16026Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Thus, in SOD1-induced ALS the distinct phases of disease are due to the actions of mutant protein in different cell types to produce a non-cell-autonomous killing of motor neurons. In the case of SCA1, we show that within one neuronal cell type, disease initiation and progression to neurological dysfunction can also be distinct from later phases of disease. ATXN1[30Q]-D776 induced disease initiation and PC dysfunction. However, only in mice expressing ATXN1 with an expanded polyglutamine tract was the late-stage feature PC death seen. These results illustrate that PC death is not the cause of the neurological phenotype in SCA1 mice. The ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice become as neurologically compromised as ATXN1[82Q] mice without induction of PC death. It is worth noting that ATXN1[30Q]-D776-expressing PCs showed no sign of ATXN1 nuclear inclusions out to 1 year of age (Figure 4A). This is in contrast to ATXN1[82Q]-D776 mice that showed PC nuclear inclusions similar to ATXN1[82Q]-S776 animals (Figures 4E and S2B, respectively), suggesting that inclusion formation and induction of cell death require the polyglutamine expansion. Two hypotheses for pathogenicity in the polyglutamine disorders involve (1) the generation of a toxic polyglutamine fragment (Ross et al., 2003Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Wanker E.E. Amzel M. Polyglutamine fibrillogenesis: the pathway unfolds.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and (2) a toxic role of the expanded CAG repeat containing RNA (Li et al., 2008Li L.-B. Yu Z. Teng X. Bonini N.M. RNA toxicity is a component of ataxin-3 degeneration in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 453: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The finding in the ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice that a protein is pathogenic in absence of an expanded polyglutamine tract argues against either proteolytic cleavage and the generation of a toxic polyglutamine-containing fragment or an RNA with an expanded CAG repeat as general mechanisms for polyglutamine pathogenesis. We suggest that pathogenesis can involve changes in regions of the protein in addition to the polyglutamine tract. In the case of SCA1 and ATXN1, placing an Asp at residue 776 mimics one such change. Our finding that a phosphomimetic D776 promotes disease, combined with previous data showing that S776 is an endogenous site of phosphorylation and a phosphoresistant A776 prevents development of ataxia (Emamian et al., 2003Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T. Tousey S.K. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T. Serine 776 of ataxin-1 is critical for polyglutamine-induced disease in SCA1 transgenic mice.Neuron. 2003; 38: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), support the concept that S776 phosphorylation in ATXN1 drives disease initiation and development of neuronal dysfunction. Finding an inhibitor of S776 phosphorylation that suppresses disease will test this model directly as well as provide an important step toward a treatment for SCA1. It is worth noting that pathogenesis correlates with disease protein phosphorylation in other neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., α-synuclein (Fujiwara et al., 2002Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. alpha-Synuclein is phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and tau (Ballatore et al., 2007Ballatore C. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). More recently, substitution of phosphomimetic Asp for a Ser at residues 13 and 16 of mutant huntingtin abolished the ability of the protein to induce disease in vivo (Gu et al., 2009Gu X. Greiner E.R. Mishra R. Kodali R. Osmand A. Finkbeiner S. Steffan J.S. Thompson L.M. Wetzel R. Yang X.W. Serines 13 and 16 are critical determinants of full-length human mutant huntingtin induced disease pathogenesis in HD mice.Neuron. 2009; 64: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, targeting phosphorylation for therapeutic development may be applicable to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Lastly, it is worth emphasizing that beyond showing that one amino acid change can make a wild-type protein toxic we show that disease initiation and late-stage induction of neuron death are distinct phases. Obviously, the two are linked in that initiation is a prerequisite of later stages. Thus, a treatment targeted at initiation, perhaps S776 phosphorylation, is likely to have a major impact. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal use protocols. Mice were housed and managed by Research Animal Resources under SPF conditions in an AAALAC-approved facility. ATXN1[30Q]-S776 mice were from the A02 line and ATXN1[82Q]-S776 mice from line B05 (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A.

SCA1 transgenic mice: a model for neurodegeneration caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat.Cell. 1995; 82: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The ATXN1[30Q]-D776 and ATXN1[82Q]-D776 transgenes were generated by adding a point mutation in the original construct used to make the ATXN1[30Q]-S776 mice. These transgenes were linearized with BamHI, gel isolated, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation, and suspended in injection buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0]; 0.1 mM EDTA) at a concentration of 4 ng/μl. Embryo injections were performed by the Mouse Genetics Laboratory, University of Minnesota. PCR and Southern blot analyses were used to identify transgene positive animals. For ATXN1[82Q]-D776, eight lines were generated with five expressing the transgene all of which developed signs of disease. In the case of ATXN1[30Q]-D776, six lines were obtained with three expressing the transgene. Animals were perfused with 10% formalin and 50 μm sections were cut on a vibratome as previously described (Zu et al., 2004Zu T. Duvick L.A. Kaytor M.D. Berlinger M.S. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T.

Epitopes were unmasked by boiling three times for 15 s each in 0.01 M urea. The sections were blocked for 1 hr in 2% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS. After blocking, the sections were incubated for 48 hr at 4°C in blocking solution containing primary antibody, rabbit ATXN1 11750 or 12NQ antibody at 1:2000 (Servadio et al., 1995Servadio A. Koshy B. Armstrong D. Antalffy B. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Expression analysis of the ataxin-1 protein in tissues from normal and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 individuals.Nat.

The sections were washed 4 times in PBS and incubated for 48 hr in blocking solution containing secondary antibody. Donkey secondary Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 were used at 1:500 (Jackson Immunoresearch). Sections were washed and mounted onto microscope slides with glycerol-gelatin (Sigma) containing 4 mg/ml n-propyl gallate. Fluorescent images were scanned using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 IX2 inverted microscope as previously described (Klement et al., 1998Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B.

Ataxin-1 nuclear localization and aggregation: role in polyglutamine-induced disease in SCA1 transgenic mice.Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). To assess the height the CF extends along the PC dendrite and the thickness of the molecular layer, 20× images were measured using Fluoview Viewer 1.7 software. Measurements of molecular layer thickness were taken on calbindin immunostained sections by measuring the distance from the base of the PC body to the end of the dendrite at the pial surface. Six measurements at the primary fissure from three cerebellar sections per animal were averaged. VGLUT2 staining was used to determine CF terminal deposition. A minimum of three animals was measured for each time point. The extension of CF terminals was depicted relative to the molecular layer thickness. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. The p value was calculated using Student's t test (two-tailed equal variance). Animals were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (100 mg ketamine and 10 mg xylazine per kg body WT) by intramuscular injection and placed into a stereotaxic frame (Model 963LS, David Kopf Instruments). The dorsal surface of the brainstem was exposed and a glass micropipette was inserted into the inferior olive. Three hundred nanoliters of 5% dextran conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (10,000 MW, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in water was bilaterally injected using a microinjector (Model 5000, David Kopf Instruments). Five to seven days later, mice were transcardially exsanguinated with PBS (pH 7.4) and perfused with 10% formalin (25 ml). Brains were removed and fixed overnight in 10% formalin at room temperature, and placed in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C. Cerebella were sectioned (50 μm) using a freezing sliding microtome. Purkinje cells were immunostained with anti-calbindin as described above, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and examined using a fluorescent microscope. Accelerating Rotarod analysis was performed on 12-week-old FVB and ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice as described (Clark et al., 1997Clark H.B. Burright E.N. Yunis W.S. Larson S. Wilcox C. Hartman B. Matilla A.

Purkinje cell expression of a mutant allele of SCA1 in transgenic mice leads to disparate effects on motor behaviors, followed by a progressive cerebellar dysfunction and histological alterations.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7385-7395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gait performance, as assessed by hind stance width, was determined using DigiGait (Mouse Specifics inc., Boston MA, USA) as described (Pallier et al., 2009Pallier P.N. Drew C.J. Morton A.J. The detection and measurement of locomotor deficits in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease are task- and protocol-dependent: influence of non-motor factors on locomotor function.Brain Res. Bull. 2009; 78: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Twelve-week-old transgenic and wild-type littermates were run at 35 cm/s. The DigiGait system consists of Plexiglas housing over a clear treadmill belt. A video camera captures mice walking and 5–6 s are used for analysis. Analysis software plots the individual paws as they contact the treadmill and calculates gait parameters. A student t test was used to show statistical significance.

https://openalex.org/W1986154944,"Local interneurons in the Drosophila antennal lobe are thought to play important roles in shaping odor responses. However, the physiological properties of excitatory local interneurons (eLNs) and their connectivity in the antennal lobe remain unclear. We first characterized the firing patterns of krasavietz-Gal4-labeled eLNs (krasavietz eLNs) in response to depolarizing currents. Paired recordings of krasavietz eLNs and PNs showed reciprocal excitatory connections mediated by dendrodendritic cholinergic synapses and gap junctions. Reciprocal connections were also found between two krasavietz eLNs but were rare between krasavietz eLNs and inhibitory LNs. Analysis of response onset latencies showed that krasavietz eLNs received monosynaptic inputs from ORNs. Furthermore, each eLN responded with distinct patterns to different odors, and each odor elicited distinct responses in different eLNs, with specific temporal patterns of spiking, indicating that eLNs serve specific coding functions in addition to global excitation in Drosophila olfactory processing."

https://openalex.org/W2013387085,"Cell adhesion molecules are well characterized for mediating synapse initiation, specification, differentiation, and maturation, yet their contribution to directing dendritic arborization during early brain circuit formation remains unclear. Using two-photon time-lapse imaging of growing neurons within intact and awake embryonic Xenopus brain, we examine roles of β-neurexin (NRX) and neuroligin-1 (NLG1) in dendritic arbor development. Using methods of dynamic morphometrics for comprehensive 3D quantification of rapid dendritogenesis, we find initial trans-synaptic NRX-NLG1 adhesions confer transient morphologic stabilization independent of NMDA receptor activity, whereas persistent stabilization requires NMDA receptor-dependent synapse maturation. Disrupting NRX-NLG1 function destabilizes filopodia while reducing synaptic density and AMPA receptor mEPSC frequency. Altered dynamic growth culminates in reduced dendritic arbor complexity as neurons mature over days. These results expand the synaptotropic model of dendritogenesis to incorporate cell adhesion molecule-mediated morphological stabilization necessary for directing normal dendritic arborization, providing a potential morphological substrate for developmental cognitive impairment associated with cell adhesion molecule mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1999629742,"Humans have reduced the abundance of many large marine vertebrates, including whales, large fish, and sharks, to only a small percentage of their pre-exploitation levels. Industrial fishing and whaling also tended to preferentially harvest the largest species and largest individuals within a population. We consider the consequences of removing these animals on the ocean's ability to store carbon.Because body size is critical to our arguments, our analysis focuses on populations of baleen whales. Using reconstructions of pre-whaling and modern abundances, we consider the impact of whaling on the amount of carbon stored in living whales and on the amount of carbon exported to the deep sea by sinking whale carcasses. Populations of large baleen whales now store 9.1×10(6) tons less carbon than before whaling. Some of the lost storage has been offset by increases in smaller competitors; however, due to the relative metabolic efficiency of larger organisms, a shift toward smaller animals could decrease the total community biomass by 30% or more. Because of their large size and few predators, whales and other large marine vertebrates can efficiently export carbon from the surface waters to the deep sea. We estimate that rebuilding whale populations would remove 1.6×10(5) tons of carbon each year through sinking whale carcasses.Even though fish and whales are only a small portion of the ocean's overall biomass, fishing and whaling have altered the ocean's ability to store and sequester carbon. Although these changes are small relative to the total ocean carbon sink, rebuilding populations of fish and whales would be comparable to other carbon management schemes, including ocean iron fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W1973836515,"We easily recognize objects and faces across a myriad of retinal images produced by each object. One hypothesis is that this tolerance (a.k.a. ""invariance"") is learned by relying on the fact that object identities are temporally stable. While we previously found neuronal evidence supporting this idea at the top of the nonhuman primate ventral visual stream (inferior temporal cortex, or IT), we here test if this is a general tolerance learning mechanism. First, we found that the same type of unsupervised experience that reshaped IT position tolerance also predictably reshaped IT size tolerance, and the magnitude of reshaping was quantitatively similar. Second, this tolerance reshaping can be induced under naturally occurring dynamic visual experience, even without eye movements. Third, unsupervised temporal contiguous experience can build new neuronal tolerance. These results suggest that the ventral visual stream uses a general unsupervised tolerance learning algorithm to build its invariant object representation."

CD38 is a widely expressed mammalian ecto-enzyme CD38, involved in many functions as diverse as cell proliferation and social behavior (22Lee H.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

From in vitro experiments, NAADP and the related Ca2+-mobilizing messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) can be synthesized by CD38 using alternate substrates and with different pH dependences (24Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). NAADP synthesis occurs by base exchange of the nicotinamide moiety of NADP with nicotinic acid with a pH optimum of between 4 and 5. However, surprisingly, only one study has linked the in vivo production of endogenous NAADP to any member of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family (25Rah S.Y. Mushtaq M. Nam T.S. Kim S.H. Kim U.H. J. Biol.

In mammalian and human pancreatic acinar cells, cholecystokinin (CCK) and acetylcholine (ACh) are two important secretagogues that induce specific Ca2+ signals and stimulate digestive enzyme and fluid secretion (26Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2008; 70: 273-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, these agonists appear to be coupled to different combinations of Ca2+-mobilizing messengers to exert their effects (27Cancela J.M. Van Coppenolle F. Galione A. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 909-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All three major Ca2+-mobilizing messengers, IP3, cADPR, and NAADP have been shown to play a role in stimulus-secretion coupling in these cells (27Cancela J.M. Van Coppenolle F. Galione A.

In accordance with this, CCK mobilizes Ca2+ from both acidic and ER stores, whereas ACh mobilizes Ca2+ from the ER alone (4Menteyne A. Burdakov A. Charpentier G. Petersen O.H. Cancela J.M. Curr.

Using pancreatic acinar cells derived from CD38−/− mice, we provide the first physiological evidence for the requirement of CD38 in CCK-mediated Ca2+ signaling by NAADP. In pancreatic AR42J cells, which lack CD38, we found that expression of this new member of the Ca2+ signaling tool kit (32Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar), was sufficient to remodel Ca2+-signaling pathways in these cells, so that now CCK receptor activation was linked to NAADP-mediated Ca2+ mobilization from lysosomes. Furthermore, in agreement with our previous work, our data suggest that CCK may enhance the endocytosis of plasma membrane CD38 into endosomal vesicles, thus creating an intracellular site for messenger synthesis (4Menteyne A.

These results reveal that CD38 is an NAADP synthase in mammalian cells coupling receptor activation to NAADP-dependent Ca2+ release from lysosomal stores. Male C57BL6 mice (CD38 sufficient) were purchased from CER Janvier and male C57BL/6 CD38−/− mice, which have a deletion of exons 2 and 3 and consequently exhibit no residual enzymatic activity in vitro (34Partida-Sánchez S. Cockayne D.A. Monard S. Jacobson E.L. Oppenheimer N. Garvy B. Kusser K. Goodrich S. Howard M. Harmsen A. Randall T.D. Lund F.E. Nat.

For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated from mice tails using the Nucleospin tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel). Exon 2 was amplified by PCR, and products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. CD38−/− mice were bred in our animal house and used at 8–26 weeks of age for all experiments. Cells were prepared as described previously (27Cancela J.M. Van Coppenolle F. Galione A. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 909-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The rat pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J was cultured in 40% of HAM-F12 and DMEM containing 4.5 g liter−1 glucose and 2 mm glutamine, supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were loaded with Fluo4-AM (5 μm) and stimulated at room temperature with CCK at 5 and 50 pm. Imaging are performed with a conventional microscope (Leica microscope, CCD camera) or using a confocal microscope (Leica SP2 RS). For imaging studies, cells were incubated in culture medium with Fura-2/AM (2 μm final and incubated 25 min at 37 °C). Lysosomes are stained 5 min at room temperature with 200 nm LysoTracker Red. Cells were homogenized and incubated at pH 4.5 with 200 μm NADP and 14 mm nicotinic acid. Reactions were stopped with 10% (v/v) perchloric acid (4 °C). Samples were then neutralized with 2.5 m K2CO3 and analyzed on a Poros HQ column (Applied Biosystems) using HPLC (Beckman) coupled to a UV detector. Pancreatic acinar cells were prepared as above but with protease inhibitor mixture and rinsed in extracellular buffer under agitation during 30 min to regenerate calcium stores. Suspensions were stimulated with 50 pm CCK. Reactions were stopped with perchloric acid (20%) at an appropriate time, sonicated, and placed on ice for 30 min. Then, the homogenates were centrifuged (11,000 × g, 1 min), supernatants were neutralized with 1 mm K2CO3 and centrifuged for 10 min as before. Supernatants were kept for binding analyses (storage at −80 °C). [32P]NAADP was synthesized as described previously (35Yamasaki M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4598-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); sea urchin microsomes were prepared as described (16Yamasaki M. Thomas J.M. Churchill G.C. Garnham C. Lewis A.M. Cancela J.M.

NAADP binding reactions were initiated by adding microsomes to a mixture of 32[P]NAADP and cells extractions during 30 min as described (16Yamasaki M. Thomas J.M. Churchill G.C. Garnham C. Lewis A.M.

Total RNA was extract from rat pancreatic acinar cells with Tri Reagent (Sigma) using a standard protocol. mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a poly(A) primer. The PCR product is digested with AgeI and NotI at the appropriate digestion sites, purified, and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which contains EGFP downstream of its multiple cloning sites. Immunostaining was performed on cells fixed with paraformaldehyde. After blocking with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, cells were probed with monoclonal anti-LAMP1 (1:200; Sigma), mouse anti-GFP (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-amylase (1:500; Sigma), rabbit anti-EEA1 (early endosomal antigen 1; 1:200, Abcam), and rabbit anti-a1 (1:500, kind gift of Dr Morel). CD38 immunostaining was performed after methanol fixation with monoclonal anti-CD38 (1:50, Sigma). Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa 568 anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Molecular Probes) were used for visualization. All imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal spectrophotometer using a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope (63× water immersion objective). Data represent means ± S.E. of at least four independent experiments in each case. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test. p values are summarized as not significant (not significant, >0.05), significant (*, <0.05), or highly significant (***, <0.001). To elucidate the role of CD38 in agonist-evoked intracellular Ca2+ signaling, we used video imaging and confocal microscopy. Pancreatic acinar cells isolated from CD38−/− mice were found having normal secretory pole features and were not distinguishable from wild type cells. As agonist-evoked Ca2+ signals mostly originate from intracellular stores, we have performed experiments in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. In wild type cells, CCK evokes typical oscillatory Ca2+ responses (Fig. 1A), which persist in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). In the case of cells derived from CD38−/− mice, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, the number of cells responding to CCK (Fig. 1C) was similar to the wild type. However, in the absence of Ca2+ in the external solution, CD38−/− cells no longer responded to CCK (Fig. 1D). The CD38−/− cells appear to have remodeled their Ca2+-signaling mechanisms so that agonist-evoked Ca2+ responses may largely depend on Ca2+ entry to maintain functional agonist-secretion coupling. A detailed quantitative analysis of CCK-evoked Ca2+ spiking is summarized in supplemental Table S1. We also investigated whether the inability of the agonists to evoke Ca2+ mobilization in cells from CD38−/− mice was due to loss of responsiveness to intracellular messengers. We used the patch clamp technique in whole cell configuration to perfuse cells with the messengers and to record the Ca2+-dependent currents as an index of cytosolic Ca2+ changes. As shown in Fig. 1E, NAADP, IP3, and cADPR all elicited repetitive short-lasting Ca2+ spikes in CD38−/− pancreatic acinar cells and were equivalent to those evoked by these messengers in pancreatic acinar cells extracted from wild type mice (7Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 27Cancela J.M. Van Coppenolle F. Galione A. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 909-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These data indicate that NAADP, IP3, and cADPR receptors are present and functional in CD38−/− cells, and lack of responsiveness to messengers is not a factor in the changes in sensitivity to agonist-evoked Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores in these cells. To identify the enzyme involved in CCK-evoked NAADP synthesis, we examined whether CD38 was required for the synthesis of endogenous NAADP in response to agonist using a standard competitive binding assay (16Yamasaki M. Thomas J.M. Churchill G.C. Garnham C. Lewis A.M. Cancela J.M. Patel S. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 874-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Lewis A.M. Masgrau R. Vasudevan S.R. Yamasaki M. O'Neill J.S. Garnham C. James K. Macdonald A. Ziegler M. Galione A. Churchill G.C. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 371: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In wild type pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with CCK at 50 pm, endogenous NAADP levels were increased ∼4-fold more than basal levels. However, in CD38−/− cells, the transient increase in NAADP synthesis in response to CCK stimulation was completely abolished, indicating that CD38 is essential for NAADP synthesis in response to CCK (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, in unstimulated CD38−/− cells, endogenous levels of NAADP were detected at similar levels to those measured in wild type pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that in addition to CD38, another NAADP synthase may exist that is unmasked in CD38−/− cells. It is unlikely that this activity is related to the base-exchange mechanism for NAADP synthesis as proposed for CD38 (21Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), because such activity was not detected in homogenates prepared from CD38−/− cells, although robust NAADP synthesis was evident in wild type cell preparations (Fig. 2C). We investigated the localization of CD38 in primary pancreatic acinar cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 3A) and by expression of a fluorescently tagged rat EGFP-CD38 construct in the rat AR42J pancreatic cell line, which does not endogenously express this protein (Fig. 3B). CD38-EGFP appears to be mostly targeted to the plasma membrane but also has a prominent distribution in vesicular structures in the secretory pole (Fig. 3C) similar to the staining we observed with an anti-CD38 antibody in primary pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 3A). Overlap of the immunostaining of CD38 with the a1 subunit of the vaculoar H+-ATPase (Fig. 3D) suggested its presence in acidic vesicles of the endolysosomal pathway. Co-localization of EEA1 with CD38-EGFP revealed that CD38 is present in early endosomes (Fig. 3E). In contrast, CD38-containing vesicles do not co-localize with amylase secretory granules (Fig. 3F), and lysosomal Lamp1 staining showed that although CD38-containing vesicles and lysosomes are in close proximity, they also do not co-localize (Fig. 3G). Importantly, we found that in unstimulated cells, CD38 is already present in preformed endosomes, and therefore, the acidic environment and the substrate accumulation required for NAADP synthesis could be achieved in these vesicles as suggested for cADPR synthesis in sea urchin eggs (33Davis L.C. Morgan A.J. Ruas M. Wong J.L. Graeff R.M. Poustka A.J. Lee H.C. Wessel G.M. Parrington J. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1612-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, in a previous study, we have implicated endocytosis in the maintenance of Ca2+ oscillations evoked by physiological CCK concentrations in pancreatic acinar cells (4Menteyne A. Burdakov A. Charpentier G. Petersen O.H. Cancela J.M. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1931-1937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have also previously reported that CCK from 5 to 500 pm stimulates NAADP synthesis in these cells (16Yamasaki M. Thomas J.M. Churchill G.C. Garnham C. Lewis A.M. Cancela J.M. Patel S. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 874-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In agreement with these previous findings, we observed that CCK (200 pm) stimulation promoted endocytosis of CD38 so that this enzyme translocates inside the cell, where it is better placed to synthesize intracellular messengers (Fig. 3H). Thus, the endosomal localization of CD38 could, in principle, bring the synthesis of NAADP in close proximity to lysosomes, the target for this Ca2+-mobilizing messenger. We next investigated CCK-evoked Ca2+ signaling in AR42J cells and those expressing EGFP-CD38 to compare responses with cells from the CD38−/− and wild type mice. Homogenates from AR42J cells, like those from CD38−/− cells, also showed an inability to synthesize NAADP by base-exchange as seen for wild type primary cells (Fig. 4A). At a physiological concentration of CCK (25 pm), oscillatory Ca2+ responses of similar amplitude and frequency were observed in both AR42J and AR42J-CD38 cells (Fig. 4B), and the concentration-response response curves superimpose regardless of CD38 expression (Fig. 4C). We next compared the pharmacological properties of CCK-evoked Ca2+ signaling in AR42J cells and those expressing CD38 in presence of 1 mm Ca2+ in the extracellular solution. To investigate whether CCK-evoked Ca2+ response involved the NAADP pathway in the pancreatic AR42J cells, we first used the propensity of NAADP receptors to inactivate to high concentrations of NAADP to dissect the contribution of the NAADP signaling pathway to the agonist response (7Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Remarkably, incubation of cells with a high desensitizing concentration of NAADP (100 μm for 30 min) essentially blocked the CCK response (25 pm) in EGFP-CD38 expressing cells, as also observed in primary wild type cells (Fig. 4G), while having little effect on the control AR42J cells (Fig. 4, D–F). Our findings suggest that in AR42J cells, the high affinity CCK receptor is not linked to the NAADP signaling pathway, and that CD38 expression alone is sufficient to switch the CCK receptor coupling mechanism in AR42J cells to one similar to that observed in wild type primary acinar cells (Fig. 4F) (7Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We subsequently examined which Ca2+ stores were recruited during CCK stimulation in both primary and AR42J cells. As we and others have previously shown, in many cells including pancreatic acinar cells, NAADP releases Ca2+ from acidic stores, likely endolysosomal related organelles (2Churchill G.C. Okada Y.

In concert with Ca2+ release from lysosomes, NAADP has also been shown to cause an increase in lumenal pH of these organelles (5Morgan A.J. Galione A. J. Biol.

More recently, Vpr has been postulated to enhance infection by mediating the degradation of unknown cellular defense factors (1Andersen J.L. Le Rouzic E. Planelles V. Exp. Mol.

To date, three of the four HIV-1 accessory proteins, including Vpr, have been found to interact with cullin-RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). E3 ligases are multisubunit complexes that include a cullin (CUL), a RING H2 finger protein (RBX1), an adaptor, and a substrate recognition subunit (20Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). More specifically, Vpr interacts with the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, assembled with cullin 4A (CUL4A), RBX1, DDB1 (DNA damage-binding protein 1), and DCAF1 (DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 1) (1Andersen J.L. Le Rouzic E. Planelles V. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2008; 85: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Morellet N. Roques B.P. Bouaziz S. Curr. HIV Res. 2009; 7: 184-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The substrate recognition subunit of this CRL4, DCAF1, previously known as Vpr-binding protein (VprBP), was originally identified via co-precipitation with Vpr (22Zhao L.J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the present time, substantial evidence suggests that Vpr usurps CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligases to ubiquitinate (ubiquitylate) and degrade unknown cellular proteins required for cell cycle progression (23DeHart J.L.

Emerman M. Virology. 2004; 318: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), WEE1 kinase (33Kamata M. Watanabe N. Nagaoka Y. Chen I.S. J.

In addition, Vpr activates ATM and Rad3-related checkpoint kinase (ATR)-dependent DNA damage signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of the histone 2A variant-X and BRCA1 (36Roshal M. Kim B. Zhu Y. Nghiem P. Planelles V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25879-25886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 37Zimmerman E.S. Chen J. Andersen J.L. Ardon O. Dehart J.L.

However, whether Vpr interactions with these proposed host cellular factors result in their degradation via CRL4DCAF1-Vpr E3 ubiquitin ligases had not been established. One potential target of Vpr is uracil-DNA glycosylase-2 (UNG2), which removes uracil lesions from single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in the base excision repair pathway. Initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen (38Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), UNG2 has been implicated as a Vpr-dependent substrate of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase (39Schröfelbauer B. Yu Q. Zeitlin S.G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10978-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 40Schröfelbauer B. Hakata Y. Landau N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4130-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, a number of studies investigating the roles of UNG2 in HIV replication resulted in opposing views regarding HIV biology. For example, some studies found that virion-associated UNG2 modulates the innate mutation rate of HIV-1 in primary monocyte-derived macrophages as well as actively dividing cells (8Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 41Chen R. Le Rouzic E. Kearney J.A. Mansky L.M. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28419-28425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and that UNG2 is required for replication in macrophages (41Chen R. Le Rouzic E. Kearney J.A. Mansky L.M. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28419-28425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, control of dUTP misincorporation into viral DNA by host-derived UNG2, in concert with reverse transcriptase, was shown to be essential to HIV replication (42Priet S. Gros N. Navarro J.M. Boretto J. Canard B. Quérat G. Sire J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 479-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Other reports suggested that UNG2 exerts a negative effect on HIV-1 replication by influencing HIV-1 long terminal repeat-directed transcription (43Fenard D. Houzet L. Bernard E. Tupin A. Brun S. Mougel M. Devaux C. Chazal N. Briant L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 6008-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, UNG2 was also shown to trigger the degradation of nascent viral DNA, previously modified by APOBEC3G (44Yang B. Chen K. Zhang C. Huang S. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As a counteraction of HIV-1 against the antiviral activity of UNG2, Vpr is proposed to down-regulate UNG2. For example, Vpr-mediated proteasomal degradation of UNG2 was shown to be associated with viral replication when APOBEC3G levels are low (39Schröfelbauer B. Yu Q. Zeitlin S.G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10978-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Further, the level of UNG2 has also been shown to be negatively influenced by transcriptional effects of Vpr (45Langevin C. Maidou-Peindara P. Aas P.A. Jacquot G. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 10256-10263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Another group of studies, however, suggested that UNG2 does not contribute at all to the degradation of retroviral DNA, mediated by APOBEC3G (46Kaiser S.M. Emerman M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 47Schumacher A.J. Haché G. Macduff D.A. Brown W.L. Harris R.S. J.

Engelman A. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7099-7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and plays no role in HIV-1 biology. In particular, using a natural human UNG−/− cell line as producer or target cells, viral infectivity was not impaired (46Kaiser S.M. Emerman M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and cell lines that stably express the UNG inhibitor, Ugi, also exhibited no effect. In support of the above, APOBEC3G-mediated retroviral degradation was shown to be independent of uracil DNA glycosylase activity in chicken cells devoid of SMUG1, another abundant uracil DNA glycosylase (49Langlois M.A. Neuberger M.S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4660-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the interplay between Vpr, the proteasomal pathway, and the cellular host protein UNG2, we set out to reconstitute the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase in complexes with DCAF1 and Vpr. We show that Vpr facilitates ubiquitination of UNG2 by recruiting the protein to DCAF1, the substrate recognition subunit of CRL4DCAF1. Our results suggest that Vpr hijacks CRL4DCAF1 and targets UNG2 for degradation, using the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, similar to how Vif causes APOBEC3G degradation by hijacking the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase (50Yu X.

Ayyavoo at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) and residues 1–102 (Vpx-ΔC) of SIVmac Vpx (provided by J. Skowronski at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) were cloned into pET43 vectors (EMD Chemicals) modified to include a tobacco etch virus protease site at the C terminus of a NusA fusion protein. N-terminally HA- or Myc-tagged full-length Vpr WT (Vpr-FL), HA-tagged Vpr-ΔC WT, W54R, and H71R (mutants were provided by J. Skowronski) were cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The cDNAs for UNG2, DCAF1, UBA1, and UbcH5b were purchased from Open Biosystems. The cDNA coding for full-length UNG2 and ΔN-UNG2 (residues of 99–313) were cloned into the pE-SUMO vector (LifeSensors) and the pCDNA3.1 vector, encoding proteins with a Myc tag at the N terminus. DCAF1 constructs coding for residues, 817–1507 (DCAF1A), 987–1396 (DCAF1B), and 1057–1396 (DCAF1C) were amplified and cloned into the pENT-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The HA-tagged full-length DCAF1 (DCAF1-FL) and FLAG-tagged DCAF1B were cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector. The C-terminally His6-tagged UBA1 and UbcH5b were cloned into the pET21, and the N-terminally His6- and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (provided by C. Prives, Columbia University, New York, NY) was cloned into the pET28 expression vector (EMD Chemicals). The His6-tagged ubiquitin was cloned into pCDNA3.1 vector. The N-terminally His10-tagged RBX1 (Open Biosystems) was amplified and cloned into the pBlueBac4.5 plasmid. Cloning of CUL4A and DDB1 into the pBlueBac4.5 plasmid was performed as described previously (55Kapetanaki M.G. Guerrero-Santoro J. Bisi D.C. Hsieh C.L. Rapić-Otrin V. Levine A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The HA-tagged DDB1 was cloned into pCDNA3.1, and the HA-tagged CUL4A and RBX1 were cloned into the pIRES vector (Clontech). Proteins including His6-tagged NusA-Vpr-ΔC, NusA-Vpx-ΔC, SUMO-UNG2, UBA1, UbcH5b, and ubiquitin were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3), cultured in Luria-Bertani medium, using 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction at 18 °C for 16 h. Soluble forms of His-tagged proteins were first purified using a 5-ml Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare). Aggregated material was removed by gel filtration column chromatography using a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% sodium azide. NusA-Vpr-ΔC and NusA-Vpx-ΔC were further purified over a 5-ml Hi-Trap QP column (GE Healthcare) at pH 7.5 using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. UNG2 was purified over a 5-ml Hi-Trap SP column (GE Healthcare) at pH 7.5 using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient after digestion with ubiquitin-like-protein specific protease (ULP1) (LifeSensors). Baculoviruses expressing C-terminally His6-tagged DCAF1A, -B, and -C were prepared using BaculoDirect C-term (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant baculovirus encoding N-terminally His10- and FLAG-tagged DDB1 was prepared as described previously (57Wittschieben B.Ø. Iwai S. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39982-39989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses expressing N-terminally His10-tagged RBX1 and CUL4A were prepared utilizing the Bac-N-Blue transfection kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. Proteins were expressed in SF21 cells (Invitrogen) after infection with a multiplicity of infection of 2 for 40 h. DCAF1A and DCAF1B were co-expressed with DDB1, whereas DCAF1C was expressed alone in SF21 cells. CUL4A and RBX1 were also co-expressed. Cells were harvested, and proteins were purified over a 5-ml Ni-NTA column followed by a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column, equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% sodium azide. Proteins were further purified over a 5-ml Hi-Trap QP column at pH 7.5 using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. For preparation of the multiprotein complexes, each component was mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1, and the protein complexes were purified over an 8-ml Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) at pH 7.5 using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK293 from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 6-well or 10-cm plates 24 h prior to transient transfection and grown to about 95% confluency. The cells were transfected with either 4 µg or 24 µg of the indicated pCDNA3.1 plasmids encoding specific cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were treated with 10–15 µm MG132 after 42 h and at 6 h prior to harvesting when indicated. Transiently transfected cells were harvested and treated with 240 µl of a lysis buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1% Tween 20, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was incubated with 40 µl of anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel for 4 h, and the beads were washed four times with 500 µl of the lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 µl of FLAG peptides at a concentration of 100 µg/ml in the lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. When purified recombinant proteins were used for immunoprecipitation, bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in the lysis buffer. Protein complexes captured by anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel (Sigma) were directly treated with 50 µl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. Proteins were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and subsequently identified either by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or by immunoblotting. For detection of proteins, anti-HA (Covance), anti-Myc (Sigma), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-actin (Sigma), and anti-UNG (Abnova) antibodies were used. Typically, E1 (UBA1, 0.2 µm), E2 (UbcH5b, 2.5 µm), and appropriate E3 complexes (RBX1-CUL4A-DDB1-DCAF1B or RBX1-CUL4A-DDB1-DCAF1B-Vpr-ΔC, 0.2 µm) were incubated with 1 µm UNG2 and 2.5 µm His6-FLAG-tagged ubiquitin in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 units/ml pyrophosphatase, 2 mm DTT, and 5 mm ATP at 37 °C for 2 h. The degree of ubiquitination was detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-UNG antibodies after separation of protein mixtures on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Transiently transfected cells were harvested and lysed as described as above. The lysate was incubated with 50 µl of Ni-NTA agarose beads (GE Healthcare) for 12 h, and the beads were washed four times with 500 µl of the lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 50 µl of lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteins or protein mixtures (50 µl) at a concentration of 12 or 24 µm in PBS buffer with 5% glycerol and 0.02% sodium azide were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and injected into a 24-ml analytical Superdex 200 column at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Peak fractions were collected at 0.5-ml intervals and concentrated 10-fold with Amicon concentrators (Millipore). Proteins in each fraction were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for visualization. Data were obtained using an analytical Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm, GE Healthcare) with in-line multi-angle light scattering (HELEOS, Wyatt Technology), variable wavelength UV (Agilent 1100 Series, Agilent Technology), and refractive index detectors (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology). About 100 µl of 10 µm protein solutions were injected into the pre-equilibrated column in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature and then eluted with the same buffer. The molecular masses of eluted species were determined using the ASTRA program (Wyatt Technology). Analytical gel filtration column chromatography was carried out to assess any protein-protein interactions between Vpr, UNG2, and DCAF1. The individual proteins, ΔN-UNG2 (residues 99–313), NusA-Vpr-ΔC (residues 1–79), and DCAF1C (residues 1057–1396), were injected into a Superdex 200 column, and their retention volumes were determined (Fig. 1, A–C). Each protein was found to elute at a distinct volume. Protein peaks were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1M, lanes 1–3). Different protein pairs were then analyzed for co-elution. Consistent with the previous in vivo result that showed an interaction between Vpr and the C-terminal WD40 domain of DCAF1 (residues 1041–1377) (24Le Rouzic E. Belaïdouni N. Estrabaud E. Morel M. Rain J.C. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Cell cycle. 2007; 6: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), NusA-Vpr-ΔC co-eluted with DCAF1C at an elution volume of 12.5 ml (Fig. 1D). The DCAF1C elution peak at 16.0 ml was absent in the DCAF1C-NusA-Vpr-ΔC mixture, and the peak at 12.5 ml contained both NusA-Vpr-ΔC and DCAF1C (Fig. 1M, lane 4). ΔN-UNG2 and DCAF1C did not interact, eluting at the same volumes as when analyzed individually (Fig. 1, E, and M, lanes 5 and 6). Instead, ΔN-UNG2 was found to co-elute with NusA-Vpr-ΔC (Fig. 1, F, and M, lanes 7 and 8), confirming the previous yeast-two hybrid results (38Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether DCAF1 binds UNG2 in the presence of Vpr, all three proteins were mixed and injected into the column. A peak eluting at 12.3 ml (Fig. 1G) was found to contain all three proteins (Fig. 1M, lane 10), indicating that a triple complex of DCAF1C-NusA-Vpr-ΔC-ΔN-UNG2 was formed. The NusA-Vpr-ΔC-ΔN-UNG2 peak eluting at 11 ml (Fig. 1F) was not observed in this experiment, suggesting that DCAF1C formed protein complexes with all of NusA-Vpr-ΔC-ΔN-UNG2. In these two experiments (Fig. 1, F and G), free ΔN-UNG2 was observed at 17.9 ml because a 2-fold excess molar concentration of ΔN-UNG2 was used over NusA-Vpr-ΔC and DCAF1C. After tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage, the triple complex eluted at 14.8 ml, and the cleaved NusA eluted at 13.4 ml (Fig. 1, H, and N, lanes 12 and 13). These data suggest that the NusA protein, fused to the N terminus of Vpr, does not influence the observed DCAF1-Vpr-UNG2 complex formation. Full-length UNG2 exhibited a similar binding behavior toward NusA-Vpr-ΔC and NusA-Vpr-ΔC-DCAF1C when analyzed by analytical gel filtration column (data not shown). Neither NusA nor NusA-Vpx-ΔC interacted with UNG2 (Fig. 1, I–L, and N, lanes 14–19). Taken together, the analytical gel filtration data suggest that DCAF1 binds to the Vpr-UNG2 complex, but not UNG2 alone. Because DCAF1 is a substrate recognition subunit protein, interacting with the DDB1 adaptor protein associated with CUL4A-RBX1, we tested whether Vpr can load UNG2 onto the DDB1-DCAF1 complex. Each individual recombinant protein was purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1A). In immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FLAG antibodies, UNG2 was pulled down to a similar extent with either DDB1-DCAF1A (residues 817–1507) or DDB1-DCAF1B (residues 987–1396) only in the presence of NusA-Vpr-ΔC, but not NusA (supplemental Fig. 1B, compare lanes 9 and 14 with lanes 10 and 15). UNG2 was not detected when only DDB1 was used as pulldown bait (supplemental Fig. 1B, lanes 19 and 20). The above data suggest that DCAF1 interacts with DDB1 as well as the Vpr-UNG2 complex. To determine whether the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ligase targets UNG2 for ubiquitination in a Vpr-dependent manner, we carried out ubiquitination assays in vitro. For these experiments, the CRL4 E3 ligase was first purified by mixing CUL4A-RBX1 with DDB1-DCAF1B and then subjected to ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2, A and B). Analytical gel filtration of the purified complex showed that the E3 ligase complex was homogeneous and eluted as a single peak at 11.10 ml (data not shown). Further, CUL4A-RBX1, DDB1-DCAF1B, and the mixture of these two protein complexes were analyzed by in-line multi-angle light scattering after elution from the analytical gel filtration column (Fig. 2C). The molecular mass of the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase was estimated to be 300 kDa, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 281 kDa. The estimated molecular masses of CUL4A-RBX1 and DDB1-DCAF1B were 120 and 180 kDa, respectively. The theoretical molecular masses of each complex are 101 and 180 kDa, respectively. Using these protein complexes, we tested whether full-length UNG2 can be ubiquitinated via the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ligase in a Vpr-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). CUL4A was autoubiquitinated only in the presence of both E1 and E2 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). Neither NusA nor NusA-Vpr-ΔC mediated ubiquitination of full-length UNG2 when only E3 was present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6). Ubiquitinated UNG2 was readily observed in the presence of E1, E2, and E3 with NusA-Vpr-ΔC, but not with NusA alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–11). When the same blot was probed with anti-UNG antibody, UNG2-Ub was prominently detected in the reaction mixture containing NusA-Vpr-ΔC, E1, E2, and E3 (Fig. 3A, lane 11). Because NusA, fused to the N-terminal part of Vpr, may sterically interfere with poly-Ub chain formation on UNG2 by the E3 ligase, we purified the CRL4DCAF1-Vpr E3 ligase (Fig. 3B) and tested its activity toward ubiquitination of UNG2. The E3 ligase complexed with Vpr-ΔC was confirmed to be homogeneous by analytical gel filtration column chromatography and light scattering (data not shown). Polyubiquitination of UNG2 was apparent with the E3 ligase complexed with Vpr-ΔC (Fig. 3C, both panels, compare lane 1 with"
https://openalex.org/W2165766152,"Background Experiencing acute pain can affect the social behaviour of both humans and animals and can increase the risk that they exhibit aggressive or violent behaviour. However, studies have focused mainly on the impact of acute rather than chronic painful experiences. As recent results suggest that chronic pain or chronic discomfort could increase aggressiveness in humans and other mammals, we tested here the hypothesis that, in horses, aggression towards humans (a common source of accidents for professionals) could be linked to regularly reported vertebral problems of riding horses. Methodology/Principal Findings Vertebral examination and standardized behavioural tests were made independently on the same horses. Here we showed that most horses severely affected by vertebral problems were prone to react aggressively towards humans (33/43 horses, chi-square test, df = 1, χ2 = 12.30, p<0.001), which was not the case for unaffected or slightly affected horses (9/16 horses, chi-square test, df = 1, χ2 = 0.25, p>0.05). The more affected they were, the fewer positive reactions they exhibited (rs = −0.31, p = 0.02). Conclusions/Significance This is to our knowledge the first experimental evidence of such a link between chronic discomfort/potential pain (inferred from the presence of vertebral problems) and aggression, suggesting that chronic painful experiences may act in ways similar to those of acute experiences. Chronic discomfort or pain may often be overlooked when facing “bad tempered” individuals, whether humans or animals. This experimental study confirms the importance of including chronic discomfort or pain as a major factor in interpersonal relations and models of aggression."

This appears to represent a new strategy for forming hard tissue in animals. The interplay between covalent cross-linking and dehydration on the graded properties of the beaks is discussed. Cephalopods such as squids, cuttlefish, and octopods are equipped with a hard beak that is as sharp as a knife and crucial for disabling prey and feeding. Beak chemistry has attracted much recent attention in materials science: in contrast to mammalian hard tissues, the beak is devoid of minerals, consisting instead of a composite of proteins and chitin fibers with varying degrees of hydration along the beak structure. In animals, this is a unique material design for hard tissues that function in biting. The Dosidicus beak biocomposite possesses a stiffness (elastic modulus, E) of 5 GPa at the distal tip that decreases incrementally to 50 MPa (wet conditions) in the proximal wing, which is tightly embedded within the muscular buccal mass (1Uyeno T.A.

A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which beaks are sclerotized is also likely to reveal novel chemical paradigms for the fabrication of robust and biocompatible composites for a variety of restorative applications. Furthermore, synthesis of such polymer-based composite materials could inspire environmentally friendly routes as Dosidicus beak is formed under ambient seawater conditions and is wholly nontoxic. From a biochemical perspective the biomaterial most similar to Dosidicus beak is hard insect cuticle. Both are predominantly composed of chitin fibers, protein, and polyphenolic compounds (10Vincent J.F.V. Composites Part A: Appl. Sci.

In insect cuticle, the contribution of dehydration and cross-linking to sclerotization is notably controversial (12Andersen S.A. J.

Hence, the common view that protein cross-linking itself is the major mechanism leading to hardening and stiffening (12Andersen S.A. J.

Ablett S. J. Insect Physiol. 1987; 33: 973-979Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Vincent J. Buschow K.H. Flemings M.C. Kramer E.J. Cahn R.W. Ilschner B. Mahajan S. Encyclopedia of Materials Science and Technology. Elsevier, New York2001: 1924-1928Crossref Google Scholar). Most probably, the formation of a dense cross-linked network and dehydrated composite both contribute to hardening (15Andersen S.A. Insect Biochem. 2010; 40: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and, therefore, a detailed identification of cross-links formed during beak maturation is essential. In both scenarios, chemical bonds play a crucial role in the beak mechanics by increasing the load carried by the proteins or by providing an efficient hydrophobic “coating” around chitin nanofibers, thus preventing softening of the latter by water adsorption.

D. gigas beaks (including the surrounding buccal mass) were dissected from animals collected off the coast of Ventura, California, in June 2007 and stored at −80 °C until needed. Beaks were separated from their buccal tissue (and the latter stored). The tanned regions were cut from the soft, untanned regions, and ground into a fine powder with mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Beak was triturated by a mortar and pestle, and the powder was hydrolyzed in vacuo in 1-ml hydrolysis tubes using a standard hydrolysis solution consisting of 6 m HCl and 5% phenol. Hydrolysis was conducted at 110 °C for 24 h, after which the hydrolysates were flash-evaporated and washed thoroughly in Milli Q-water and methanol. Washed samples were then resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the soluble supernatant was passed through a phenylboronate affinity column (Affi-Gel boronate; Bio-Rad). Phenylboronate affinity chromatography captures cis-diols (e.g. catecholic compounds) by a pH-dependent complexation to boronate groups in the resin (21Barnes H.H. Ishimaru C.A. BioMetals. 1999; 12: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This technique has previously been utilized for separation and analysis of catecholic compounds in other extracellular tissues or marine adhesives (22Zhao H. Sun C. Stewart R.J. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 23Zhao H. Waite J.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15915-15923Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After loading the supernatant, the column was desalted with 2.5 mm NH4HCO3 and Milli-Q water, and the bound ligands were eventually released by eluting with ∼3 column volumes of 5% acetic acid. Ligands captured were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C prior to subsequent separation. Confirmation of catecholic-based compounds was initially done using the Arnow colorimetric assay, in which mono- or unsubstituted catechols turn a pink to red color (24Waite J.H. Tanzer M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Fetterer R.H. Hill D.E. J. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Preliminary mass spectrometric analyses (see “Tandem Mass Spectrometry”) detected multiple catecholic ligands after phenyl affinity chromatography. These were further isolated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using a Varian Galaxie (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) system equipped with a dual wavelength diode array UV-visible detector set at 220 nm and 280 nm, the first for the polypeptide backbone and the second for detection of catecholic compounds. The lyophilized powder was resuspended in 5% acetic acid and applied to a Brownlee OD-300 C18 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A water/acetonitrile (with 1% trifluoroacetic acid) linear gradient system was employed with the following gradient steps: (i) 100% water for 5 min; (ii) 100 to 90% water in 40 min; (iii) 90 to 0% water in 5 min; (iv) 0% water for 5 min (column cleaning). It was particularly critical to keep a shallow gradient in step (ii) to ensure adequate separation of the catecholic compounds. The collected fractions were lyophilized and redissolved in a 50:50 water/acetonitrile solution with 0.3 vol % formic acid for mass spectrometry analyses. Once purity of the fractions was verified, the remaining solution after affinity chromatography was separated into three additional HPLC runs. The fractions of interest were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in deuterium H2O for 1H NMR analyses. Peaks detected in HPLC spectra were analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) MS/MS using an Micromass QTOF2 quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Samples were injected into the electrospray source through a fused silica tubing attached to a syringe pump that continuously injected the sample at a rate of 5 μl/min. Typical settings were a capillary tension of 3.5 kV, a cone tension of 45 V, and a collision voltage of 10 V for the MS mode. Once cross-links of interest were detected, they were subsequently fragmented at collision voltages of 20 and 35 V to obtain large or small molecular weight fragments, respectively. Fragmentation patterns were processed with the MassLynx software package and later manually analyzed for final cross-link determination. Isolated cross-links as well as pure histidine (Sigma) were resuspended in D2O, and solution phase 1H NMR was recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500-MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Fremont, CA) with tetramethylsilane as an external standard. Data acquisition time was dependent on sample concentration. Thin sections were carefully cut from partially frozen buccal masses. Buccal mass slices were then assayed using Arnow stain. Two small Arnow reactive glands were dissected and extracted in a 15-ml Kontes (Vineland, NJ) tissue grinder with 80% ethanol in water at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet. The pellet was then reextracted in 0.5 m HCl, and the supernatant was separated using a size-exclusion column (Shodex KW 803) on a Gilson (Middleton, WI) HPLC system, using 5% acetic acid as the mobile phase. A peak with significant 280 nm absorbance was collected and assayed with the Arnow stain. Following capture by phenylboronate affinity chromatography, catecholic compounds were identified by their Arnow reactivity (24Waite J.H. Tanzer M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). HPLC chromatograms of the resuspended compounds indicate the presence of multiple peaks that absorbed at both 220 and 280 nm (a typical spectrum is presented in Fig. 1). Each peak (P1–P6) was subjected to ESI-TOF MS. Six major catecholic compounds (A, m/z = 278; B, m/z = 351; C, m/z = 400; D, m/z = 431; E, m/z = 473; F, m/z = 553) were detected (chemical structures are described below), but most of the HPLC peaks contained mixtures of these compounds to varying degrees. Two of the HPLC peaks, P3 and P6, however, were homogeneous, as seen from the ESI-TOF MS chromatograms (P3 = A, Fig. 2b, and P6 = C, Fig. 2c, note that compound A in this chromatogram is also a fragment of C, as explained in the next section), but these compounds were also detected within other HPLC fractions. For instance, P2 contained 5 compounds (A, B, D, E, and F; Fig. 2a). In some cases, the peaks contained sodiated ions. The letters on each peak represent the catecholic cross-links subsequently identified by fragmentation. Mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios are presented in Table 1. P3 and P6 were the peaks that were also purified in yields sufficient for 1H NMR characterization.FIGURE 2ESI-MS spectra of HPLC peaks. a, P2; b, P3; and c, P6. Peak 2 is a mixture of most catecholic compounds isolated by phenylboronate affinity chromatography, whereas P4 and P6 contain nearly pure compounds with m/z = 278 and 400, respectively. The smaller peaks in b and c arise from fragmentation occurring at low acceleration voltage during ESI-MS (i.e. m/z = 278 is a fragment ion from m/z = 400; see Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Cross-link as identified by MS/MS Open table in a new tab To test which strategy Dosidicus employs, we attempted extraction of catecholic precursor compounds from the buccal tissues producing the beaks, which were initially screened using the Arnow stain (26Rubin D. Miserez A. Waite J.H. Casas J. Advances in Insect Physiology. Elsevier, New York2010: 75-133Google Scholar). Preliminary results using gel-filtration chromatography and PAGE on extracted buccal tissues confirm that the major catecholic precursor of beak has a low molecular weight and that Arnow reactive substance is mostly not protein-bound (data not shown). Fragmentation patterns of the major compounds detected by ESI-MS are presented in Fig. 3. It has been established elsewhere (see supplementary on-line materials of Ref. 20Miserez A. Schneberk T. Sun C. Zok F.W. Waite J.H. Science. 2008; 319: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) that fragmentation patterns of (m/z) = 278 (Fig. 3a) and 351 peaks correspond to (His)-4-methylcatechol (4MC) and His-dopa couplings, respectively, both of which exhibit the m/z = 156 (His + H+) ion fragment reported earlier (27Kerwin J.L. Turecek F. Xu R. Kramer K.J. Hopkins T.L. Gatlin C.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fragmentation pattern of (m/z) = 400 (Fig. 3b) shows that it is closely related to (m/z) = 278, plus an added mass of 122 Da consistent with the presence of another methylcatechol (or quinone-methide) perhaps bound to the second imidazolic nitrogen. Fragmentation patterns of (m/z) = 431 and 553 also show striking similarities with those of (m/z) = 278 and 400 (Fig. 3c). For (m/z) = 553, there is an initial mass loss of 122 Da, with the resulting ion (m/z) = 431. The additional mass loss of 153 Da can then be attributed to dehydrohistidine, resulting in the cross-link dimer (>The additional mass loss of 153 Da can then be attributed to dehydrohistidine, resulting in the cross-link dimer (m/z) = 278. The fragmentation pattern of (m/z) = 431 (not shown here) was identical to that of (m/z) = 553 from (m/z) = 0 to (m/z) = 431. Hence, all of the detected cross-links after hydrolysis can be deconstructed from the initial tetramer (m/z) = 553, which corresponds to His-4MC-His-4MC. Removing one His gives rise to (m/z) = 400, whereas removing a 4MC yields (m/z) = 431. Extra loss of either 4MC or His, respectively, finally results in the initial building block (m/z) = 278 in both cases. 1H NMR spectra of the dimeric cross-link compound (His-4MC) purified by C18 HPLC is presented in Fig. 4, and assigned peaks are given in Table 2. The aromatic region of the spectrum (enlarged in Fig. 4b) contains a pair of doublets, with J-coupling constants between 8 and 10. These values are consistent with ortho-pairing of hydrogen groups on the ring. The aromatic region also contains a peak at 7.3 ppm assigned to the δ2 ring H of imidazole histidine (Creighton system). A peak farther from the aromatic region at 8.62 is attributed to the second hydrogen of the imidazole ring (ϵ1). The o-placement of ring hydrogens hence suggests that the linkage between the catechol and histidine must occur at the sterically encumbered 2-position of the catechol ring. The additional peak at 5.19 ppm cannot be attributed to any hydrogen atom of the His-4MC cross-link. However, its location is in the region of vinylic hydrogen and is consistent with the coexistence of quinone-methide tautomer with cross-linked (His-4MC) in solution. 4Strictly speaking, the quinone methide is not a tautomer of 4-methyl catechol but of the o-quinone, a facile oxidation product of 4MC by the loss of 2 hydrogens. As such, the term “tautomer” is used throughout to emphasize the co-existence of 4MC, quinone-methide and orthoquinone. In addition, the larger peak height of the vinylic H versus that of the methyl H suggests that the equilibrium is shifted toward the quinone-methide tautomer.TABLE 2H NMR peak assignment for cross-links m/z = 278 (left) and m/z = 400 (right) Open table in a new tab The 1H NMR spectrum for catechol-His-catechol adduct (m/z) = 400 (see Fig. S1), contains a total of seven signals between 6.9119 ppm and 6.7080 ppm, including two doublet peaks, implying that the orthohydrogens of the dimer adduct remain present with J-coupling values of 8. The additional three peaks are not coupled and must correspond to the protons of the second catechol. The absence of coupling indicates that the protons are paraoriented (as opposed to ortho on the first catechol). Had the second catechol contained ortho- or metahydrogens, a second set of coupled doublets would be present in this region of the spectrum. The presence of three peaks (as opposed to two) is again attributed to tautomerization, which slightly affects the local environment and hence yields two distinct peaks. Additionally, the two peaks corresponding to the imidazole ring protons (7.402 and 8.586 ppm) are confirmed. Therefore, one catechol is attached to the histidine via the 2-position of the aromatic ring whereas the other catechol is attached via the 6-position. As in the (m/z) = 278 spectrum, the vinylic hydrogens of the quinone-methides are present, with two distinct peaks (5.1879/5.1545 ppm) and an integration that approximates to four protons, suggesting that both catechols are partially oxidized. The extracted HPLC compound is thus deemed to be a mixture of tautomers with various levels of oxidation of the catecholic/quinone rings. Although all adducts described are present in hydroylsates, their concentration relative to one another is unknown, making it difficult to infer whether there is a prevailing cross-link or whether they all derive from the degradation of the tetrameric cross-link (His-4MC-His-4MC). Our previous work (20Miserez A. Schneberk T. Sun C. Zok F.W. Waite J.H. Science. 2008; 319: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), however, did establish that the total cross-link content in the hard rostrum of the beak is as much as 15 weight %, which is an extremely high value compared with any natural or synthetic polymer. Jumbo squid beaks (and the beaks of other cephalopods such as octopus and cuttlefish) represent an intriguing paradigm of composite materials processing for several reasons. Beaks are produced in a wet environment, grow continuously during the lifespan of the animal (28Kear A.J. J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U.K. 1994; 74: 801-822Crossref Google Scholar, 29Hernandez-Garcia V. Coleid Cephalopods through Time.in: Warnke K. Jeupp H. Boletzky S.V. Proceedings of Conference, Berlin, Germany. Berliner Paläobiology Abhandlung, Berlin, Germany2003Google Scholar), and are fabricated with macroscopic biochemical gradients resulting in a wide range of mechanical properties, namely a flexible proximal region attached to the buccal mass and a hard, stiff rostrum at the distal end. Previous investigations established the presence of His-dopa adducts in squid beak and proposed them to be stabilizing cross-links of the composite proteinaceous matrix. The His-4MC detected by MS/MS (m/z = 278) was assumed to result from the fragmentation-induced cleavage of the bond between the α and β side chain carbons of dopa in the His-dopa cross-link during ionization in the source region (20Miserez A.

In addition to the dimeric His-dopa cross-link, trimeric and tetrameric 4MC-His derivative adducts are released from the beak during hydrolysis. The absence of dopa in any of these multimers suggests that 4MC arises instead from a low molecular weight precursor. In insect cuticle, a variety of catecholic agents, such as N-acetyldopamine or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, among others (30Sugumaran M. Binnington K. Retnakaran A. Physiology of the Insect Epidermis. CSIRO Publications, Melbourne, Australia1991: 141-168Google Scholar, 31Hopkins T.L. Kramer K.J. Binnington K. Retnakaran A. Physiology of the Insect Epidermis. CSIRO Publications, Melbourne, Australia1991: 213-239Google Scholar) and including their quinone-methide tautomers (32Sugumaran M. Semensi V. Kalyanaraman B. Bruce J.M. Land E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are known to interact covalently with proteins during sclerotization. Quinone-methide tautomer formation (as detected by both MS/MS and H NMR) could be occurring during postisolation processing or appears in situ as an intermediate cross-linking agent as reported in some cuticles (32Sugumaran M. Semensi V. Kalyanaraman B. Bruce J.M. Land E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After an initial oxidation step, which converts the catechol to a quinone, the latter is coupled to nucleophilic protein side chains, particularly histidine and cysteine, when present (33Schaefer J. Kramer K.J. Garbow J.R. Jacob G.S. Stejskal E.O. Hopkins T.L. Speirs R.D. Science. 1987; 235: 1200-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The tendency of His to undergo nucleophilic addition to o-quinone was further confirmed in synthetic self-assembling polymers (34Liu B. Burdine L. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 15228-15235Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with the additional important insight that cross-linking efficiency was only high when reactive functionalities were brought together by the formation of complementary secondary structures; cross-linking in disordered isotropic solutions was negligible. Tri- and tetrameric cross-links involving covalent bonding of both nitrogens of the imidazole moiety have not been previously reported. In insect cuticles, the nucleophilic attack of phenolic rings by His residues usually occurs at the 5- and 6-positions (19Kramer E.J. Kanost M.R. Hopkins T.L. Jiang H. Zhu Y.C. Xu R. Kerwin J.L. Turecek F. Tetrahedron. 2001; 57: 385-392Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 27Kerwin J.L. Turecek F. Xu R. Kramer K.J. Hopkins T.L. Gatlin C.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) whereas the C2 carbon is also targeted in model studies (35Xu R. Huang X. Morgan T.D. Prakash O. Kramer K.J. Hawley M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the C2 carbon is coupled to the His imidazole in the hydrolyzed dimer. Although this seems a sterically less favorable position for a dimeric cross-link, the catecholic ring is also bound to a second His residue through the 6-position in the larger cross-links. It is plausible that the C2 site is detected simply because it is more stable during hydrolysis than the 5- or 6-position, or that in situ, the quinone is presented to His residues in such a way that the 2-adduct is favored. Regardless of the details of cleavage during acid hydrolysis, the strategy of using tri- and tetrameric cross-links is unique and is probably related to the high cross-link density in the mature beak (as much as 15% dry weight) (20Miserez A. Schneberk T. Sun C. Zok F.W. Waite J.H. Science. 2008; 319: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The engineered juxtaposition of reactive groups such as quinone and histidine is known to promote cross-linking reactions (34Liu B. Burdine L. Kodadek T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 15228-15235Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In insect cuticular proteins, a consensus sequence (“R&R consensus”) involved with chitin binding (11Iconomidou V.A. Willis J.H. Hamodrakas S.J. Insect Biochem. 2005; 35: 533-560Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 36Hamodrakas S.J. Willis J.H. Iconomidou V.A.

Insect Biochem. 2001; 31: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) has been identified: in addition to the ideal location of His residues in the R&R consensus for subsequent cross-linking reactions, the consensus is predicted to form β-pleated sheets (36Hamodrakas S.J. Willis J.H. Iconomidou V.A. Insect Biochem. 2002; 32: 1577-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Provided that His-rich domains in the beak proteins are also arranged according to a β-sheet conformation, they might play a role of stiff elements with a highly packed configuration, in which His residues are strategically presented by one or both faces of a series of sheets to be joined by reaction with the catecholic cross-linkers, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5. As cross-linking reactions ensue, water molecules are squeezed out, thereby leading to chitin desolvation. To test this hypothesis, a full sequence of beak proteins will be necessary, a task that has so far been precluded by the intractability of cross-linked proteins in the tip region. Bioprocessing of the chitin/water/protein composite shares parallels with the impregnation processes by which many thermoset polymer matrix composites are fabricated. In this"

We previously found that monomethylation of p53 at lysine 382 (p53K382me1) by the protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT) SET8/PR-Set7 represses p53 transactivation of target genes. However, the molecular mechanism linking p53K382 monomethylation to repression is not known. Here we show in biochemical and crystallographic studies the preferential recognition of p53K382me1 by the triple malignant brain tumor (MBT) repeats of the chromatin compaction factor L3MBTL1. We demonstrate that SET8-mediated methylation of p53 at Lys-382 promotes the interaction between L3MBTL1 and p53 in cells, and the chromatin occupancy of L3MBTL1 at p53 target promoters. In the absence of DNA damage, L3MBTL1 interacts with p53K382me1 and p53-target genes are repressed, whereas depletion of L3MBTL1 results in a p53-dependent increase in p21 and PUMA transcript levels. Activation of p53 by DNA damage is coupled to a decrease in p53K382me1 levels, abrogation of the L3MBTL1-p53 interaction, and disassociation of L3MBTL1 from p53-target promoters. Together, we identify L3MBTL1 as the second known methyl-p53 effector protein, and provide a molecular explanation for the mechanism by which p53K382me1 is transduced to regulate p53 activity."

However, the manner in which feedforward inhibitory circuits emerge is unclear, despite this being a critical step for neocortical development and function. We found that sensory experience drove plasticity of the feedforward inhibitory circuit in mouse layer 4 somatosensory barrel cortex in the second postnatal week via two distinct mechanisms. First, sensory experience selectively strengthened thalamocortical-to-feedforward interneuron inputs via a presynaptic mechanism but did not regulate other inhibitory circuit components. Second, experience drove a postsynaptic mechanism in which a downregulation of a prominent thalamocortical NMDA excitatory postsynaptic potential in stellate cells regulated the final expression of functional feedforward inhibitory input. Thus, experience is required for specific, coordinated changes at thalamocortical synapses onto both inhibitory and excitatory neurons, producing a circuit plasticity that results in maturation of functional feedforward inhibition in layer 4."

We and others have previously identified three serine residues on the integrin β4 cytoplasmic domain that play a critical role in the regulation of HD disassembly.

EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of β4 increased keratinocyte migration, and reduced the number of stable HDs. Furthermore, mutation of the two serines in β4 to phospho-mimicking aspartic acid decreased its interaction with the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin, as well as the strength of α6β4-mediated adhesion to laminin-332.

IntroductionHemidesmosomes (HDs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDhemidesmosomeABDactin binding domainCSconnecting segmentFnIIIfibronectin type IIIMSPmacrophage-stimulating proteinp90RSKp90 ribosomal S6 kinase. are specialized junctional complexes that mediate firm adhesion of epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane. Two types of HDs have been characterized: type I and II (1Uematsu J. Nishizawa Y. Sonnenberg A. Owaribe K. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Type I (classical) HDs are present in squamous and complex epithelia, such as the skin and the bladder. They contain integrin α6β4, plectin, the bullous pemphigoid antigens 180 (BP180) and 230 (BP230), and the tetraspanin CD151 (2Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Type II HDs lack BP180 or BP230 and are present in simple epithelia, such as the intestine (3Orian-Rousseau V. Aberdam D. Fontao L. Chevalier L. Meneguzzi G. Kedinger M. Simon-Assmann P. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As the integrin α6β4 binds to Ln-332 in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and associates intracellularly with plectin, which in turn interacts with the keratin filament system, a protein complex is formed that protects the cell against mechanical stress. The importance of this linkage for epidermal-dermal cohesion is substantiated by the finding that in both humans and genetically modified mice, mutations in the genes for these proteins that either prevent their expression or function, result in a skin blistering disorder known as epidermolysis bullosa (2Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 4Chung H.J. Uitto J. Dermatol. Clin. 2010; 28: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The primary interaction between plectin and β4 occurs through the first pair of fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains and a small part of the connecting segment (CS) of β4 and the actin binding domain of plectin (plectin-ABD) (5Niessen C.M. Hulsman E.H. Oomen L.C. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1705-1716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Geerts D. Fontao L. Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Purkis P.E. Wheeler G.N. Lane E.B.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice carrying a specific deletion of the C-terminal portion of the β4 cytoplasmic domain, which still contains the plectin-ABD binding site, can still form normal HDs (8Nikolopoulos S.N. Blaikie P. Yoshioka T. Guo W. Puri C. Tacchetti C. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6090-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, binding of β4 to the plectin-ABD is stabilized by adjacent binding sites in the CS and the C-tail of the β4 subunit that interact with the plakin domain of plectin (9Rezniczek G.A. de Pereda J.M. Reipert S. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Koster J. van Wilpe S. Kuikman I. Litjens S.H. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1211-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In type I HDs, the interaction of β4 with plectin is further reinforced through additional interactions with BP180 and BP230 (11Litjens S.H. de Pereda J.M. Sonnenberg A. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 376-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As a result, type I HDs are believed to be less dynamic and more stable than type II HDs. Whereas type I HDs mediate firm adhesion of the epidermis to the underlying basement membrane, the presence of type II HDs in migrating intestinal epithelial cells suggests that these structures are dynamically regulated. One factor implicated in the regulation of type II HD stability is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (12Rabinovitz I. Tsomo L. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). EGF is one of many cytokines produced during wound healing, stimulating both keratinocyte proliferation and migration (13Barrientos S. Stojadinovic O. Golinko M.S. Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. Wound Rep. Reg. 2008; 16: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). Whether EGF also regulates type I HDs has not been investigated.Previous studies have shown that activation of pathways downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR) or protein kinase C (PKC) result in phosphorylation of three serines (Ser-1356, Ser-1360, and Ser-1364) located within the CS of β4 (12Rabinovitz I. Tsomo L. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Substitution of the serines by phospho-mimicking aspartic acid residues destabilized the interaction between β4 and plectin and partially prevented the assembly of HDs (14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the contrary, substitution of the serines by phosphorylation-resistant alanines resulted in a more stable association between β4 and plectin. PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the β4 cytoplasmic tail was also observed in keratinocytes stimulated with macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), and was suggested to create a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins (15Santoro M.M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P.C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Although it has been suggested that at least two of the aforementioned serines are substrates for PKCα phosphorylation downstream of EGFR, bioinformatic analysis showed that only Ser-1360 is part of a consensus sequence for PKC (pSXK/R). Furthermore, this consensus sequence is not evolutionarily conserved, unlike the three serine residues (16Margadant C. Frijns E. Wilhelmsen K. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether phosphorylation of these residues downstream of EGFR is directly dependent on phosphorylation by PKCα. Therefore, we decided to reinvestigate the phosphorylation of residues downstream of the EGFR and PKC and determine their role in HD regulation in more detail.Our results show that EGFR and PKC activation leads to phosphorylation of the β4 subunit on Ser-1356 and Ser-1364 in keratinocytes. Furthermore, we present evidence that ERK1/2 and p90RSK1/2 phosphorylate β4 at these sites, resulting in a destabilization of the binding of β4 to plectin, a reduction in the number of type I and type II HDs formed and in α6β4-mediated strength of adhesion, while it leads to an increased migration speed. Finally, we demonstrate that β4 is phosphorylated on Ser-1356 during mitosis by an as yet unidentified kinase.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified ERK1/2 and p90RSK1/2 as the kinases that phosphorylate the integrin β4 subunit at Ser-1356 and Ser-1364 in response to stimulation of keratinocytes with EGF or PMA. We show that the phosphorylation of Ser-1356 and Ser-1364 leads to a reduced number of type I and II HDs in keratinocytes by hindering the association between β4 and the plectin-ABD. Furthermore, we present data that suggest that phosphorylation of these two serine residues downstream of the EGFR decreased α6β4-Ln332-mediated adhesion strength, whereas it increased cell migration. Finally, β4 phosphorylation at Ser-1356 was shown to take place during mitosis.Rabinovitz et al. (12Rabinovitz I. Tsomo L. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have previously reported that β4 is phosphorylated on three serine residues, Ser-1356, Ser-1360, and Ser-1364 after EGFR activation and suggest that at least two of these residues are directly phosphorylated by PKCα by in vitro analysis. As we previously mentioned, the only serine of these three residues present in a PKC phosphorylation consensus site is Ser-1360; however, in this study we were unable to obtain evidence that β4 is phosphorylated on Ser-1360 downstream of the EGFR. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the phosphorylation of Ser-1356 and Ser-1364 downstream of the EGFR is PKC-independent. Additionally, we were also unable to detect phosphorylation of Ser-1360 after PMA addition in these studies, contrary to our previously published results obtained from in vivo phosphopeptide mapping experiments (14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We are unable to definitively explain this discrepancy except that we now believe that the reduced phosphorylation of β4 in the phosphopeptide experiment was due to a low expression level of S1360A mutant subunit. Consistent with this revised conclusion, it is of note that in the original mapping experiments mutation of Ser-1360 resulted in the loss of two phosphopeptides, and not just of one as would have been expected. These considerations, combined with the consistent non-reactivity of our phosphospecific antibodies against Ser-1360 with β4 from EGF- and PMA-stimulated lysates, led us to modify our initial conclusion that Ser-1360 is phosphorylated by PKC. We now conclude that this residue is not phosphorylated in keratinocytes stimulated with either PMA or EGF. Our data, however, do not rule out the possibility that Ser-1360 becomes phosphorylated after treatment with other stimuli (e.g. growth factors and cytokines that are released during wound healing).Several reports document the activation of PKC downstream of EGFR activation. Rabinovitz et al. (12Rabinovitz I. Tsomo L. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) argued that the activation of a PKCα-dependent pathway downstream of the EGFR is responsible for the phosphorylation of the β4 subunit. However, this conclusion was based on in vitro phosphopeptide mapping experiments. We have been unable to verify that any of the three aforementioned serine residues are phosphorylated by PKC in vitro, and in fact, we have even witnessed the nonspecific phosphorylation of extracellular β4 peptides in these assays (data not shown). Moreover, a role of PKC in the phosphorylation of either Ser-1356 or Ser-1364 downstream of the EGFR could be excluded by the fact that in the presence of the PKC inhibitor Gö6983, as well as after depletion of PKC by overnight incubation with PMA, EGF was still able to induce the phosphorylation of β4 on these residues. It is interesting to note that the pan-pPKC (βII Ser-660) antibody we used in our previous studies to monitor PKC activation downstream of the EGFR is directed against the phosphorylated serine residue in the hydrophobic loop (bulky ring motif, FXXFSF) of PKCβII (14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This epitope also happens to be present in the C-terminal kinase of p90RSK1/2 and therefore, it most likely recognizes activated p90RSK1/2 kinase as well.In line with previous work, we confirmed that PKA may phosphorylate β4 at Ser-1364 in vivo (14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, we found no evidence that this kinase is activated downstream of PKC or the EGFR. Therefore, it is not likely to be responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser-1364 in cells that have been stimulated with either PMA or EGF. In fact, our data clearly show that two different kinase classes, ERK1/2 and p90RSK1/2, phosphorylate β4 on Ser-1356 and Ser-1364, respectively. There is precedent in the literature for the phosphorylation of proteins by both ERK1/2 and p90RSK1/2, including that of c-Fos and LKB1 (33Chen R.H. Abate C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10952-10956Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 34Zheng B. Jeong J.H. Asara J.M. Yuan Y.Y. Granter S.R. Chin L. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 237-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the cooperation between ERK1/2 and p90RSK1/2 in protein regulation serves to ensure that they are selectively activated by the ERK/RSK signaling pathway and not by another kinase that has a substrate specificity overlapping with that of either ERK1/2 or p90RSK1/2 (35Hauge C. Frödin M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 30210-33023Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar).CDK1 recognizes the same phosphorylation motif as ERK1/2 (36Lindqvist A. Rodríguez-Bravo V. Medema R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This kinase is active at the transition of G2 to M during mitosis and therefore might well be the kinase that phosphorylates β4 at Ser-1356 at this stage of the cell cycle. We previously have shown that the phosphorylation of only one serine residue in the CS is not sufficient to prevent the interaction between β4 and plectin, and therefore, for the disassembly of HDs in mitotic cells other phosphorylation events might be necessary (14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is interesting to mention that Geramin et al. (37Germain E.C. Santos T.M. Rabinovitz I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have recently identified a novel phosphorylation site, Ser-1424, on the β4 subunit that plays a role in the disassembly of HDs. Although this site is constitutively phosphorylated and is modestly intensified after EGF stimulation, we do not believe that it is involved in the EGF- or PMA-mediated regulation of HDs since our previous phosphopeptide mapping experiments show that only the two phosphopeptides containing phospho-S1356 and/or Ser-1364 increase in intensity after PMA- or EGF-stimulation of keratinocytes. However, a role of this site in the disassembly of HDs during mitosis cannot be excluded.In a previous article, we reported that there was no difference in the migration rates of keratinocytes expressing the wild-type β4 subunit and those expressing the S1356A/S1360A/S1364A or S1356D/S1360D/S1364D triple mutants (14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although double mutants were used in this report, we believe that the discrepancy in the results can be explained as follows. The surface expression levels of the β4 mutants were not assessed in the first report and we now have evidence suggesting they were not equivalent. Additionally, the new data were obtained using tissue culture plates pre-coated with collagen-1 and the cells were stimulated to migrate with ten times more EGF (i.e. 5 ng/ml versus 50 ng/ml). Therefore, the added effects of these differences may account for the observed differences in migration rates.Despite the fact that PMA induces the phosphorylation of β4 at Ser-1356 and Ser-1364, it did not stimulate migration of PA-JEB/β4 keratinocytes. This suggests that phosphorylation of β4 by itself is not sufficient to induce migration and that other signaling events, e.g. those that are activated downstream of the EGFR but not of PKC, are essential. Alternatively, PKC activation may negatively regulate a signaling pathway that is critical for supporting cell migration. Indeed, we have observed that PMA stimulation of PA-JEB/β4 keratinocytes leads to the inactivation of basal PI-3 kinase signaling in these cells, as evidenced by a diminution of Akt phosphorylation. PI3-kinase signaling supports cell migration by Rac-dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and focal contacts (38Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3773) Google Scholar).Before epithelial cells can migrate during wound healing, type I HDs have to be completely disassembled. However, the disassembly of type II HDs is likely to be part of a more dynamic process. These structures are found in rapidly migrating intestinal epithelial cells and their dynamic regulation may allow for rapid adhesion and de-adhesion necessary for an efficient migration. The disassembly of HDs in wounds occurs under the influence of many cytokines and growth factors, including EGF, which are released by different cell types present in the wound milieu (13Barrientos S. Stojadinovic O. Golinko M.S. Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. Wound Rep. Reg. 2008; 16: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). However, because EGF only partially prevents the formation of HDs, it is anticipated that other cytokines also play a role in the prevention of their formation, and/or the disruption of these structures. These cytokines may induce the phosphorylation of β4 on other residues than those whose phosphorylation is induced by EGF, thereby augmenting the disruptive effects of EGF on the interaction between β4 and the plectin-ABD. For example, they may phosphorylate residues important for the binding of β4 to the plakin domain of plectin. Binding of β4 to this domain of plectin is not sufficient to mediate the recruitment of plectin by β4 into HDs, but it may nevertheless facilitate and stabilize the binding of the plectin-ABD to β4 (9Rezniczek G.A. de Pereda J.M. Reipert S. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Koster J. van Wilpe S. Kuikman I. Litjens S.H. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1211-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Other phosphorylation events may interfere with the binding of β4 to either BP180 or BP230, and/or the binding between BP180, B230, and plectin, and the intermediate filament system (39Kitajima Y. Aoyama Y. Seishima M. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1999; 4: 137-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40Malecz N. Foisner R. Stadler C. Wiche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8203-8208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Several reports have suggested that β4 is also phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Although most of these studies involved the use of carcinoma cells overexpressing the EGF receptor, data have also been presented that tyrosine phosphorylation may occur in normal keratinocytes (41Mainiero F. Pepe A. Yeon M. Ren Y. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have not observed tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 in PA-JEB/β4 keratinocytes after EGF stimulation and therefore have excluded a role of such kinases in the regulation of HD disassembly. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 in carcinoma cells has been well documented and is likely to contribute to a more efficient disruption of HDs in these cells (16Margadant C. Frijns E. Wilhelmsen K. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Cell.

IntroductionHemidesmosomes (HDs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDhemidesmosomeABDactin binding domainCSconnecting segmentFnIIIfibronectin type IIIMSPmacrophage-stimulating proteinp90RSKp90 ribosomal S6 kinase. are specialized junctional complexes that mediate firm adhesion of epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane. Two types of HDs have been characterized: type I and II (1Uematsu J. Nishizawa Y. Sonnenberg A. Owaribe K. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Type I (classical) HDs are present in squamous and complex epithelia, such as the skin and the bladder. They contain integrin α6β4, plectin, the bullous pemphigoid antigens 180 (BP180) and 230 (BP230), and the tetraspanin CD151 (2Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Type II HDs lack BP180 or BP230 and are present in simple epithelia, such as the intestine (3Orian-Rousseau V. Aberdam D. Fontao L. Chevalier L. Meneguzzi G. Kedinger M. Simon-Assmann P. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As the integrin α6β4 binds to Ln-332 in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and associates intracellularly with plectin, which in turn interacts with the keratin filament system, a protein complex is formed that protects the cell against mechanical stress. The importance of this linkage for epidermal-dermal cohesion is substantiated by the finding that in both humans and genetically modified mice, mutations in the genes for these proteins that either prevent their expression or function, result in a skin blistering disorder known as epidermolysis bullosa (2Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 4Chung H.J. Uitto J. Dermatol. Clin. 2010; 28: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The primary interaction between plectin and β4 occurs through the first pair of fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains and a small part of the connecting segment (CS) of β4 and the actin binding domain of plectin (plectin-ABD) (5Niessen C.M. Hulsman E.H. Oomen L.C. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1705-1716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Geerts D. Fontao L. Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Purkis P.E. Wheeler G.N. Lane E.B.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice carrying a specific deletion of the C-terminal portion of the β4 cytoplasmic domain, which still contains the plectin-ABD binding site, can still form normal HDs (8Nikolopoulos S.N. Blaikie P. Yoshioka T. Guo W. Puri C. Tacchetti C. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6090-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, binding of β4 to the plectin-ABD is stabilized by adjacent binding sites in the CS and the C-tail of the β4 subunit that interact with the plakin domain of plectin (9Rezniczek G.A. de Pereda J.M. Reipert S. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Koster J. van Wilpe S. Kuikman I. Litjens S.H. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1211-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In type I HDs, the interaction of β4 with plectin is further reinforced through additional interactions with BP180 and BP230 (11Litjens S.H. de Pereda J.M. Sonnenberg A. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 376-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As a result, type I HDs are believed to be less dynamic and more stable than type II HDs. Whereas type I HDs mediate firm adhesion of the epidermis to the underlying basement membrane, the presence of type II HDs in migrating intestinal epithelial cells suggests that these structures are dynamically regulated. One factor implicated in the regulation of type II HD stability is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (12Rabinovitz I. Tsomo L. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). EGF is one of many cytokines produced during wound healing, stimulating both keratinocyte proliferation and migration (13Barrientos S. Stojadinovic O. Golinko M.S. Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. Wound Rep. Reg. 2008; 16: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). Whether EGF also regulates type I HDs has not been investigated.Previous studies have shown that activation of pathways downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR) or protein kinase C (PKC) result in phosphorylation of three serines (Ser-1356, Ser-1360, and Ser-1364) located within the CS of β4 (12Rabinovitz I. Tsomo L. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Substitution of the serines by phospho-mimicking aspartic acid residues destabilized the interaction between β4 and plectin and partially prevented the assembly of HDs (14Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the contrary, substitution of the serines by phosphorylation-resistant alanines resulted in a more stable association between β4 and plectin. PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the β4 cytoplasmic tail was also observed in keratinocytes stimulated with macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), and was suggested to create a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins (15Santoro M.M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P.C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Although it has been suggested that at least two of the aforementioned serines are substrates for PKCα phosphorylation downstream of EGFR, bioinformatic analysis showed that only Ser-1360 is part of a consensus sequence for PKC (pSXK/R). Furthermore, this consensus sequence is not evolutionarily conserved, unlike the three serine residues (16Margadant C. Frijns E. Wilhelmsen K. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether phosphorylation of these residues downstream of EGFR is directly dependent on phosphorylation by PKCα. Therefore, we decided to reinvestigate the phosphorylation of residues downstream of the EGFR and PKC and determine their role in HD regulation in more detail.Our results show that EGFR and PKC activation leads to phosphorylation of the β4 subunit on Ser-1356 and Ser-1364 in keratinocytes. Furthermore, we present evidence that ERK1/2 and p90RSK1/2 phosphorylate β4 at these sites, resulting in a destabilization of the binding of β4 to plectin, a reduction in the number of type I and type II HDs formed and in α6β4-mediated strength of adhesion, while it leads to an increased migration speed. Finally, we demonstrate that β4 is phosphorylated on Ser-1356 during mitosis by an as yet unidentified kinase. Hemidesmosomes (HDs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDhemidesmosomeABDactin binding domainCSconnecting segmentFnIIIfibronectin type IIIMSPmacrophage-stimulating proteinp90RSKp90 ribosomal S6 kinase. are specialized junctional complexes that mediate firm adhesion of epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2036510075,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are critically involved in early development and cell differentiation. In humans, dysfunction of the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR-II) is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and neoplasia. The ability of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiologic agent of Kaposi sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma, to down-regulate cell surface receptor expression is well documented. Here we show that KSHV infection reduces cell surface BMPR-II. We propose that this occurs through the expression of the viral lytic gene, K5, a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Ectopic expression of K5 leads to BMPR-II ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation with a consequent decrease in BMP signaling. The down-regulation by K5 is dependent on both its RING domain and a membrane-proximal lysine in the cytoplasmic domain of BMPR-II. We demonstrate that expression of BMPR-II protein is constitutively regulated by lysosomal degradation in vascular cells and provide preliminary evidence for the involvement of the mammalian E3 ligase, Itch, in the constitutive degradation of BMPR-II. Disruption of BMP signaling may therefore play a role in the pathobiology of diseases caused by KSHV infection, as well as KSHV-associated tumorigenesis and vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1992436832,"Ataxin-3, the disease protein in the neurodegenerative disorder Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 or Machado Joseph disease, is a cysteine protease implicated in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. It contains multiple ubiquitin binding sites through which it anchors polyubiquitin chains of different linkages that are then cleaved by the N-terminal catalytic (Josephin) domain. The properties of the ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) in the C-terminus of ataxin-3 are well established. Very little is known, however, about how two recently identified ubiquitin-binding sites in the Josephin domain contribute to ubiquitin chain binding and cleavage. In the current study, we sought to define the specific contribution of the Josephin domain to the catalytic properties of ataxin-3 and assess how the topology and affinity of these binding sites modulate ataxin-3 activity. Using NMR we modeled the structure of diUb/Josephin complexes and showed that linkage preferences are imposed by the topology of the two binding sites. Enzymatic studies further helped us to determine a precise hierarchy between the sites. We establish that the structure of Josephin dictates specificity for K48-linked chains. Site 1, which is close to the active site, is indispensable for cleavage. Our studies open the way to understand better the cellular function of ataxin-3 and its link to pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2085826035,"Background The adaptation of pyrosequencing technologies for use in culture-independent diversity surveys allowed for deeper sampling of ecosystems of interest. One extremely well suited area of interest for pyrosequencing-based diversity surveys that has received surprisingly little attention so far, is examining fine scale (e.g. micrometer to millimeter) beta diversity in complex microbial ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the patterns of fine scale Beta diversity in four adjacent sediment samples (1mm apart) from the source of an anaerobic sulfide and sulfur rich spring (Zodletone spring) in southwestern Oklahoma, USA. Using pyrosequencing, a total of 292,130 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained. The beta diversity patterns within the four datasets were examined using various qualitative and quantitative similarity indices. Low levels of Beta diversity (high similarity indices) were observed between the four samples at the phylum-level. However, at a putative species (OTU0.03) level, higher levels of beta diversity (lower similarity indices) were observed. Further examination of beta diversity patterns within dominant and rare members of the community indicated that at the putative species level, beta diversity is much higher within rare members of the community. Finally, sub-classification of rare members of Zodletone spring community based on patterns of novelty and uniqueness, and further examination of fine scale beta diversity of each of these subgroups indicated that members of the community that are unique, but non novel showed the highest beta diversity within these subgroups of the rare biosphere. Conclusions/Significance The results demonstrate the occurrence of high inter-sample diversity within seemingly identical samples from a complex habitat. We reason that such unexpected diversity should be taken into consideration when exploring gamma diversity of various ecosystems, as well as planning for sequencing-intensive metagenomic surveys of highly complex ecosystems."

To this end, the HNF4A gene was knocked down by transfecting Caco-2 cells with a pGFP-V-RS lentiviral vector containing an shRNA against HNF4α. Inactivation of HNF4α in Caco-2 cells resulted in the following: (a) an increase in oxidative stress as demonstrated by the levels of malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes; (b) a reduction in secondary endogenous antioxidants (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and heme oxygenase-1); (c) a lower protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor that controls the antioxidant response elements-regulated antioxidant enzymes; (d) an accentuation of cellular inflammatory activation as shown by levels of nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and leukotriene B4; (e) a decrease in the output of high density lipoproteins and of their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative components apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and A-IV; (f) a diminution in cellular lipid transport revealed by a lower cellular secretion of chylomicrons and their apoB-48 moiety; and (g) alterations in the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, and liver X receptor α and β.

These findings indicate that HNF4α is critical for intestinal tissue development and the maintenance of a number of metabolic pathways.To gain more insight into the physiological and biological significance of HNF4α in the intestine, molecular strategies were devised in the Caco-2 cell line, a reliable human intestinal model, to thoroughly examine the specific role of HNF4α in oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid transport and metabolism, apobiogenesis, and lipoprotein assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureCaco-2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal bovine serum (Flow, McLean, VA). Caco-2 cells (passages 30–40) were maintained with 5% CO2 in T-75-cm2 flasks (Corning Glass). Cultures were split (1:6) when they reached 70–90% confluence using 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA (Invitrogen). For individual experiments, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well on 24.5-mm polycarbonate Transwell filter inserts with 0.4-μm pores (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in minimum essential medium (as above) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The inserts were placed into 6-well culture plates, permitting separate access to the upper and lower compartments of the monolayers.Generation of a Stable shRNA Expressing Caco-2 Cell LineExponentially growing 293FT cells were transiently infected with pGFP-V-RS vectors (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD), allowing stable delivery of the shRNA expression cassette against HNF4α into host cells via a replication-deficient lentivirus. Upon transient transfection of the plasmids into the packaging cell line, replication-deficient viruses were obtained and used to infect target Caco-2 cells. Forty eight hours post-infection, cells were transferred to flasks and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 7 days to establish stable shRNA-expressing Caco-2 cells. Thereafter, cells were cultivated until 10 days post-confluence and used only following the validation of suppression of the gene of interest by RT-PCR and Western blot assays. The medium was refreshed every 2nd day.Estimation of Lipid PeroxidationConjugated DienesThe levels of conjugated dienes were analyzed by extraction of cells with heptane/isopropyl alcohol (2:1) and measured spectrophotometrically in heptane layer (27Ward P.A.

Invest. 1985; 76: 517-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Malondialdehyde (MDA)The amount of MDA was determined by HPLC as described previously (28Courtois F. Suc I. Garofalo C. Ledoux M. Seidman E. Levy E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G12-G19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were first precipitated with a 10% sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) (Aldrich) solution, and protein-free supernatant was then reacted with an isovolume of 0.5% thiobarbituric acid (Sigma) solution at 90 °C for 60 min. After cooling to room temperature, the chromogene ((thiobarbituric acid)2-MDA) was extracted with 1-butanol and dried over a stream of nitrogen at 37 °C. The dry extract was then resuspended in KH2PO4/methanol (70:30, pH 7.0) mobile phase before MDA detection by HPLC.Iron-Ascorbate ExposureTo determine infected and untreated cell response to oxidative stress, they were exposed to iron (0.2 mm)-ascorbate (2 mm) (1:10) system-mediated lipid peroxidation (29Marcil V. Delvin E. Sané A.T. Tremblay A. Levy E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 72: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Precourt L.P. Seidman E. Delvin E. Amre D. Deslandres C. Dominguez M. Sinnett D. Levy E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At the end of a 6-h culture period, the degree of lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring MDA in cells.Endogene Antioxidant ActivityThe activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured in cell homogenates, and the activity of SOD1 (Cu,Zn-SOD), the major superoxide dismutase isoform, was estimated in the cytosol prepared by centrifuging the cell lysate at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (StressGen). For CAT and GPx, a substrate specific for each enzyme was added to the cell homogenates, and rates of disappearance of the substrate were measured by spectrophotometry. The method for enzyme quantification was adapted from the protocol reported by Pippenger et al. (31Pippenger C.E. Browne R.W. Armstrong D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 299-313PubMed Google Scholar). For CAT activity, aliquots of cell homogenates were mixed with 10 mm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a substrate, and absorbance was read at 240 nm for 3 min. For seleno-dependent GPx activity, cell homogenates were mixed with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-based working solution, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm glutathione (Sigma), 0.6 units of glutathione reductase (Sigma), and 100 mm β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′-phosphate-reduced tetrasodium salt (Sigma) with a small quantity of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (Sigma) (1.5%) to initiate the reaction. To obtain nonseleno-dependent GPx activity, the reaction was initiated with 0.5 mm cumene hydroperoxide (Sigma). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity assay was performed as described previously by Kutty and Maines (32Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9944-9952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, scraped from the dishes, and centrifuged (13,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended with PBS, subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing, and sonicated on ice before centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of 1 mg of protein was added to a reaction mixture containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, rat liver cytosol as a source of biliverdin reductase, and the substrate hemin. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform. After vigorous vortexing and centrifugation, the extracted bilirubin in the chloroform layer was measured by the difference in absorbance between 464 and 530 nm (ϵ = 40 mm−1 cm−1).Western Blot for Protein AnalysisTo determine the protein expression of HNF4α, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, NFE2L2), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), IκB, SOD1, and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT-1), cells were homogenized, and proteins (30 μg) were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS/dithiothreitol- and β-mercaptoethanol-containing sample buffer, separated on a 4–7.5% gradient SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk for 60 min at room temperature. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution with the antibodies for HNF4α (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Nrf2 (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IκB (1:1000) (Sigma), NF-κB (1:2000) (Sigma), SOD1 (1:1500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), DMT-1 (1:500) (Sigma), and β-actin (1:5000) (Sigma). The relative amount of primary antibody was detected with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were developed, and the protein mass was quantified using an HP® Scanjet scanner equipped with a transparency adapter and the UN-SCAN-IT gel 6.1 software.Quantitative RT-PCR Expression AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted from Caco-2 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications, repurified, checked for integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The cDNA was used as template for RT-PCR analysis. Quantitative RT-PCRs were performed using Quantitect SYBR Green kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. The RT-PCRs were carried in 96-well plates with a final volume of 25 μl per well; 12.5 μl of SYBR Green mix (2×) were added to a well containing 25 pmol of the forward and reverse primers and 0.5 μg of cDNA template in a total of 12.5 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate/H2O. Subsequently, negative controls without cDNA were prepared. The reaction of amplification was carried out using 40 cycles. To normalize the different cDNA sample amounts, the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was employed as a reference gene. The analyses were performed in triplicate for each gene and for GAPDH in the same plate. The relative mRNA fold changes between groups were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101469) Google Scholar).Semi-quantitative RT-PCRIn an attempt to study HNF4α isoform expression in Caco-2 cells, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described by Eeckhoute et al. (34Eeckhoute J. Moerman E. Bouckenooghe T. Lukoviak B. Pattou F. Formstecher P. Kerr-Conte J. Vandewalle B. Laine B. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcripted into cDNA. The PCR amplification was performed in a 50-μl volume using 5 μl of PCR Buffer (10×), 1.5 μl of MgCl2 Solution, 2 μl of dNTPs (2.5 mm), 0.2 μm of each corresponding primer, and 2.5 units of TAQ™ platinum polymerase (Qiagen). The PCR amplifications were carried out using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) under the following profile: 28–35 cycles of amplification were used at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Amplicons were visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained 2.5% Metaphor®-agarose (Lonza) gel. We analyzed the expression of P1-driven isoforms (containing exon 1A) and P2-driven isoforms (containing exon 1D). Moreover, we discriminated between the α1 and α7 isoforms versus the α2 and α8 isoforms by distinguishing the 30-bp insertion in exon 9. The experiments were performed in Caco-2 cells and HepG2 cells with GAPDH as a housekeeping gene.Pro-inflammatory BiomarkersInterleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 (RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross GA), and LTB4 (Invitrogen) in the basolateral medium were measured by ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.Measurement of Lipid Synthesis and SecretionCaco-2 cell lipid synthesis and secretion were assayed as we described previously (35Mehran M. Seidman E. Marchand R. Gurbindo C. Levy E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G953-G960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Spalinger J.H. Seidman E.G. Lepage G. Ménard D. Gavino V. Levy E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G652-G659PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled [14C]oleic acid (specific activity of 53.9 mCi/mmol, 2.04 GBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added to unlabeled oleic acid and then solubilized in FA-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (BSA/oleic acid 1:5 (mol/mol)). The final oleic acid concentration was 0.7 mm (0.45 μCi)/well. Cells were first washed with PBS (Invitrogen), and the [14C]oleic acid-containing medium was added to the upper compartment. At the end of a 24-h incubation period, cells were washed and then scraped with a rubber policeman in a PBS solution containing antiproteases (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, EDTA, aminocaproic acid, chloramphenicol, leupeptin, glutathione, benzamidine, dithiothreitol, sodium azide, and Trasylol, all at a final concentration of 1 mm). An aliquot was taken for lipid extraction by standard methods (37Levy E. Thibault L. Ménard D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1607-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of unlabeled carrier phospholipids (PL), monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides (TG), free FA, free cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester (CE).The various lipid classes synthesized from [14C]oleic acid were next separated by thin layer chromatography using the solvent mixture hexane/ether/acetic acid (80:20:3 (v/v)) as described previously (37Levy E. Thibault L. Ménard D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1607-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Loirdighi N. Ménard D. Levy E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The area corresponding to each lipid was scratched off of the thin layer chromatography plates, and the silica powder was placed in a scintillation vial with Ready Safe counting fluid (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (Beckman LS 5000 TD, Ontario, Canada). Cell protein was quantified by the Bradford method, and results were expressed as dpm/mg cell protein. Lipids secreted in the basolateral compartment were analyzed and quantified, as above, after centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 30 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris.Lipid CarrierBlood (20 ml) was collected by venipuncture 2–3 h after the ingestion of a high fat meal (50 g per 1.73 m2) from two healthy human volunteers. This procedure was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. After a 1000 × g centrifugation to pellet red blood cells, postprandial plasma was supplemented with 1 mm aprotinin and 0.1% sodium azide and was mixed with basolateral media to serve as a carrier for the isolation of labeled chylomicron (CM) as described previously (39Mailhot G. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Moreau A. Berthiaume Y. Levy E. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10446Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Isolation of LipoproteinsFor the determination of secreted lipoproteins, Caco-2 cells were incubated with the lipid substrate as described previously. The medium supplemented with antiproteases (as mentioned above) was first mixed with a plasma lipid carried (4:1 (v/v)) to efficiently isolate de novo synthesized lipoproteins. The lipoproteins were then isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation using a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) as described previously (39Mailhot G. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Moreau A. Berthiaume Y. Levy E. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10446Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, CMs were isolated following an ultracentrifugation (25,000 × g, 20 min). Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), 1.006 g/ml, and low density lipoprotein (LDL), 1.063 g/ml, were separated at 100,000 × g for 2.26 h with a tabletop ultracentrifuge 100.4 rotor at 4 °C. The high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction was obtained by adjusting the LDL infranatant to density at 1.21 g/ml and centrifuging for 6.5 h at 100,000 × g. Each lipoprotein fraction was exhaustively dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 0.001 m EDTA, pH 7.0, at 4 °C for 24 h. Lipids from each lipoprotein were extracted with chloroform/methanol, and the free FA fraction was analyzed as described in detail above.De Novo Apolipoprotein SynthesisThe synthesis and secretion of apolipoproteins (A-I, A-IV, B-48, B-100, and E) was assessed as described previously (40Marcil V. Delvin E. Seidman E. Poitras L. Zoltowska M. Garofalo C. Levy E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G340-G346Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To first induce apolipoprotein synthesis, cells were incubated apically with unlabeled oleic acid bound to albumin in serum-free medium for 24 h before [35S]methionine incubation. The concentration of the unlabeled lipid was equivalent to the labeled substrate described above. Thereafter, cells as well as the outer chambers were rinsed twice with PBS. The apical compartment was replaced with 1.5 ml of methionine-free medium containing the unlabeled substrate, 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol, 37 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). After a 20-h incubation period at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the medium was collected from the basolateral compartment, and cells were scraped off the inserts in cell lysis buffer supplemented with the antiprotease mixture, as above. Aliquots were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were then washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) before the radioactivity was determined in a Beckman liquid scintillation spectrometer.Immunoprecipitation of ApolipoproteinsImmunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of excess polyclonal antibodies to human apolipoproteins (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight (41Levy E. Thibault L. Delvin E. Ménard D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 42Levy E. Sinnett D. Thibault L. Nguyen T.D. Delvin E. Ménard D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Samples were then washed with 0.05% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) and subsequently centrifuged, resuspended in sample buffer (1.2% SDS, 12% glycerol, 60 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 1.2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue), and analyzed by a linear 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient preceded by a 3% stacking gel, as described previously (41Levy E. Thibault L. Delvin E. Ménard D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 42Levy E. Sinnett D. Thibault L. Nguyen T.D. Delvin E. Ménard D.

Radioactive molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) were run with the same conditions. Gels were sectioned into 2-mm slices and counted after an overnight incubation with 1 ml of BTS-450 (Beckman Instruments) and 10 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (Ready Organic, Beckman Instruments).Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein Enzymatic Activity AssayThe microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity assay was performed as described previously (44Levy E. Stan S. Delvin E. Menard D. Shoulders C. Garofalo C. Slight I. Seidman E. Mayer G. Bendayan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16470-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The activity was determined by evaluating the transfer of radiolabeled triacylglycerol between two populations of unilamellar vesicles as described previously (45Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 46Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The donor and receiver vesicles were prepared by adding the appropriate amount of lipids to 500 μl of chloroform followed by drying under a stream of nitrogen, rehydration, and probe sonication in 1.25 ml of 15:35 buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 35 mm NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 3 mm sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA). Donor vesicles contained, per assay, 4 nmol of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, 0.33 nmol of cardiolipin, and 0.024 nmol of [3H]trioleylglycerol (Amersham Biosciences). Receptor vesicles contained 24 nmol of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, 0.048 nmol of trioleylglycerol, and 4000 cpm of [14C]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Amersham Biosciences). Both categories of vesicles included 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Various amounts of semi-purified MTP were incubated with 5 μl of donor and receptor vesicles in a final volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 400 μl of ice-cold 15:35 buffer (without BSA). The negatively charged (because of the presence of cardiolipin) donor vesicles were removed from the reaction mixture by adsorption onto DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52). The supernatant (containing the receptor vesicles) was collected after a low speed centrifugation (13,000 × g) and recentrifuged (13,000 × g) to ensure a total removal of the DEAE-cellulose before scintillation counting.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are associated with AL fibrils and have been successfully targeted in the treatment of other forms of amyloidosis. We investigated the role of GAGs in LC fibrillogenesis. Ex vivo tissue amyloid fibrils were extracted and examined for structure and associated GAGs. The GAGs were detected along the length of the fibril strand, and the periodicity of heparan sulfate (HS) along the LC fibrils generated in vitro was similar to that of the ex vivo fibrils. To examine the role of sulfated GAGs on AL oligomer and fibril formation in vitro, a κ1 LC purified from urine of a patient with AL amyloidosis was incubated in the presence or absence of GAGs. The fibrils generated in vitro at physiologic concentration, temperature, and pH shared morphologic characteristics with the ex vivo κ1 amyloid fibrils. The presence of HS and over-O-sulfated-heparin enhanced the formation of oligomers and fibrils with HS promoting the most rapid transition. In contrast, GAGs did not enhance fibril formation of a non-amyloidogenic κ1 LC purified from urine of a patient with multiple myeloma. The data indicate that the characteristics of the full-length κ1 amyloidogenic LC, containing post-translational modifications, possess key elements that influence interactions of the LC with HS. These findings highlight the importance of the variable and constant LC regions in GAG interaction and suggest potential therapeutic targets for treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2074738549,"Upon illumination, visual arrestin translocates from photoreceptor cell bodies to rhodopsin and membrane-rich photosensory compartments, vertebrate outer segments or invertebrate rhabdomeres, where it quenches activated rhodopsin. Both the mechanism and function of arrestin translocation are unresolved and controversial. In dark-adapted photoreceptors of the fruitfly Drosophila, confocal immunocytochemistry shows arrestin (Arr2) associated with distributed photoreceptor endomembranes. Immunocytochemistry and live imaging of GFP-tagged Arr2 demonstrate rapid reversible translocation to stimulated rhabdomeres in stoichiometric proportion to rhodopsin photoisomerization. Translocation is very rapid in normal photoreceptors (time constant <10 s) and can also be resolved in the time course of electroretinogram recordings. Genetic elimination of key phototransduction proteins, including phospholipase C (PLC), Gq, and the light-sensitive Ca2+-permeable TRP channels, slows translocation by 10- to 100-fold. Our results indicate that Arr2 translocation in Drosophila photoreceptors is driven by diffusion, but profoundly accelerated by phototransduction and Ca2+ influx.

In addition to well-described “classical” mechanisms of light adaptation (Pugh et al., 1999Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Molecular mechanisms of vertebrate photoreceptor light adaptation.Curr.

Although molecular details may differ, this strategy is conserved from flies to mammals. For example, visual arrestin is predominantly cytoplasmic in dark-adapted photoreceptors of both flies and mammals, but on illumination translocates to photosensory membrane-rich compartments, where it quenches ongoing photosignaling by binding to activated rhodopsin (Broekhuyse et al., 1985Broekhuyse R.M.

Drosophila phototransduction, a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated Ca2+ influx cascade, is initiated by photoisomerization of rhodopsin (R) to metarhodopsin (M), which is inactivated by binding to the dominant arrestin isoform Arr2 (Dolph et al., 1993Dolph P.J.

A current, influential model for Arr2 translocation in Drosophila proposes that a myosin III motor (NINAC) powers Arr2 translocation by delivery of PIP3-enriched vesicles to the rhabdomere (Lee et al., 2003Lee S.J.

An alternative hypothesis, proposed for vertebrate rods, is that light transforms the photosensory compartment into a “light sink,” a diffusional trap that concentrates Arr2 via high-affinity binding to activated metarhodopsin (Mangini et al., 1994Mangini N.J. Garner G.L. Okajima T.I. Donoso L.A. Pepperberg D.R. Effect of hydroxylamine on the subcellular distribution of arrestin (S-antigen) in rod photoreceptors.Vis.

Such a passive diffusional model predicts that arrestin translocation should be driven by stoichiometric binding to activated M. To study arrestin translocation in Drosophila photoreceptors, we used genetics, in vivo imaging of GFP-tagged arrestin, electrophysiology, and confocal immunolocalization to investigate light-induced redistribution of Arr2. To investigate stoichiometry, we exploited the bistable, photointerconvertible pigment system of Drosophila, in which the number of M molecules can be accurately and reversibly controlled by the wavelength of illumination, with short wavelength (blue) light favoring R to M photoisomerization and long wavelength (e.g., orange) light photoreconverting M to R (see Figure 3A; reviewed in Hillman et al., 1983Hillman P.

Our results support a diffusion model for Drosophila by showing that translocation is rapidly and reversibly driven by stoichiometric binding to M without requirement for NINAC. We also show that, while not being absolutely required, phototransduction profoundly accelerates arrestin translocation, suggesting a novel regulatory role for PLC-mediated Ca2+ influx. In order to study the dark-adapted localization of Arr2, flies were dark-reared and dark-dissected and fixed under infrared illumination. As previously described, in the dark, ∼20%–30% of immunopositive Arr2 staining localizes to the rhabdomere (Alloway et al., 2000Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J.

The remainder (∼70%–80%) localizes to the cell body cytoplasm, a reserve that can be drawn upon when M out-titrates the rhabdomeric first responders. As previously reported (Alloway et al., 2000Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J.

In eyes dark-dissected immediately following 10 min of saturating blue illumination, Arr2 was concentrated in the rhabdomeres, and the adjacent apical membrane, the stalk, which contains rhodopsin at levels ∼5% that of the rhabdomere (Arikawa and Matsushita, 1994Arikawa K. Matsushita A. Immunogold localization of opsin and actin in Drosophila photoreceptors that undergo active rhabdomere morphogenesis.Zool. Sci. 1994; 11: 391-398Google Scholar). Bright Arr2 crescents at the rhabdomere base are not dissimilar to rhabdomere base crescents sometimes highlighted by anti-Rh1 immunostaining (Chinchore et al., 2009Chinchore Y. Mitra A. Dolph P.J. Accumulation of rhodopsin in late endosomes triggers photoreceptor cell degeneration.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000377Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and like them may indicate reduced antibody access to the core of the dense microvillar field (Figure S1A). Residual weak Arr2 staining was detected in cytoplasmic puncta and at the plasma membrane (Figure 1A). Exposure of blue-illuminated eyes to orange light reversed Arr2 translocation (Figure 1A), showing that a continuing presence of M is required for Arr2 concentration in rhabdomeres. Orange light alone, although evoking a near maximal electrical response in photoreceptors (e.g., Figure 4A), did not cause detectable Arr2 translocation (Figure 1A). The first-responder pool of Arr2 resident in dark-adapted rhabdomeres presumably suffices to quench the limited M produced (see also Figure 3, Figure 4). When M is not photoreconverted, Arr2 remains rhabdomeric, even in the dark, for more than 12 hr, after which it begins to be removed by endocytosis; photoreceptors return to normal by 3 days (Figure S1B). Translocation of Arr2 in response to blue, but not orange, light would be consistent with binding to high-affinity M generated in the apical, rhabdomeric membrane. Arr2 in dark-adapted cytoplasm colocalized strongly, but not exclusively, with the HDEL endomembrane marker (Figure 1B) and the photoreceptor ER chaperone, NinaA (Figure S1C), in a textured cytoplasmic network. Notably, Arr2, HDEL, and NinaA all highlighted the subrhabdomeric cisternae (SRC), a specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum of anastomosing tubules applied to the base of the rhabdomere (Matsumoto-Suzuki et al., 1989Matsumoto-Suzuki E.

An Arr2-poor band, corresponding to the actin-rich cytoplasm of the rhabdomere terminal web, typically sets the SRC apart from cytoplasm generally. Arr2 is largely absent from the nucleus. Distinct from vertebrate rod visual arrestin (Nair et al., 2005Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Gurevich V.V.

The identity of putative endomembrane binding target(s) will be the subject of future investigation; candidates include phosphoinositide components of the lipid bilayer, and/or the NINAC myosin III, both of which have been reported to interact, directly or indirectly, with Arr2 (Lee et al., 2003Lee S.J.

To track arrestin movements in vivo, we expressed GFP-tagged Arr2 in photoreceptors R1-R6. Arr2-GFP appeared to function normally because it rescued the response deactivation defect in arr2 mutants and showed a similar immunolocalization pattern to endogenous Arr2. Overall Arr2 expression in our transgenic lines was similar to wild-type (Figures S1 and S2). We monitored Arr2-GFP concentration in the rhabdomeres in real time by imaging rhabdomere fluorescence in intact flies from the deep pseudopupil (DPP: Franceschini et al., 1981Franceschini N. Kirschfeld K. Minke B. Fluorescence of photoreceptor cells observed in vivo.Science. 1981; 213: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a virtual image that sums rhabdomere fluorescence from ∼20–50 ommatidia with the optics used. The blue excitation light simultaneously served as the stimulus for translocation and was sufficiently bright to convert the majority of R to M within ∼100 ms (see Experimental Procedures). In eyes preilluminated with long wavelength (≥560 nm) light and then dark-adapted, the DPP showed weak, but obvious GFP fluorescence in the first image captured by a 100 ms blue flash (Figures 2A–2C ; Movie S1). In subsequent images repeated at 1 Hz, DPP fluorescence rapidly brightened 2- to 3-fold (2.52 ± 0.10; mean ± SEM, n = 19) with an approximately single exponential time course with time constant of 6.8 s in flies dark-adapted for 1 min and 11.3 s when dark-adapted for 10 min (Figure 2C). Optical neutralization of corneal lenses allows the distal tips of individual rhabdomeres to be visualized in live flies (Franceschini and Kirschfeld, 1971Franceschini N. Kirschfeld K. Etude optique in vivo des elements photorecepteurs dans l'oeil compose de Drosophila.Kybernetik. 1971; 9: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and these likewise brightened rapidly in response to blue light, confirming the rapid translocation from cell body to rhabdomere at the single cell level (Figure S3; Movie S2). For some experiments, it was more convenient to measure DPP fluorescence using a photomultiplier (PMT), which also allows much faster sampling rates. The first increase in fluorescence indicative of translocation was detected within ∼50 ms and the overall time course was similar to that determined using imaging (Figure 2D). Because the blue light used for measuring Arr2-GFP fluorescence rapidly converts R to M, the return of Arr2-GFP to cytoplasm after reconversion of M to R with long wavelength light could not be observed directly. In order to measure the time course of this reverse translocation, we used a two flash paradigm. Starting with a fly preexposed to blue light to induce maximum translocation, M was rapidly photoreconverted to R with a brief (500 ms) intense long wavelength stimulus and the extent of translocation was then probed by PMT measurements at varying intervals with a blue test flash. The reduction in DPP fluorescence indicative of reverse translocation was even more rapid than movement into the rhabdomere, and could be fitted with a single exponential time constant of 2.4 s (Figures 2E and 2F). Overall, these results are fully consistent with results from confocal immunocytochemistry, while revealing the surprisingly rapid kinetics of translocation in vivo and in real time. Ideally, a passive diffusional model in which translocation is driven by binding of M to arrestin predicts a stoichiometric 1:1 relationship between the number of Arr2 molecules translocated and the number of photoisomerized M molecules in the rhabdomere. The bistable, photointerconvertible pigment system of invertebrates provides an excellent opportunity to measure this relationship in Drosophila. In particular, the fraction of M molecules (fM) can be rapidly and accurately controlled by illumination with defined spectral content according to the photoequilibrium spectrum (Figure 3A; Minke and Kirschfeld, 1979Minke B.

Neural. Behav. Physiol. 2010; 196: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and can always be reset to effective zero (100% R) by long wavelength illumination. Although well established, we measured the photoequilibrium spectrum, fM(λ), with our equipment by measuring M fluorescence in wild-type (w1118) flies after photoequilibration to different wavelengths, and obtained essentially identical results to published data (Figure 3A). We estimated the extent of translocation as a function of fM in vivo by measuring DPP fluorescence from flies expressing one copy of Rh1-Arr2-GFP, which have levels of Rh1 and Arr2 indistinguishable from wild-type flies (Figure S2). We used photoequilibrating illumination at different wavelengths to vary fM and then measured DPP fluorescence immediately (50–100 ms) after the onset of a blue test flash, before any additional translocation had time to occur (Figure 3B). Measurements made following prolonged (20 s) exposure to wavelengths of 550 nm (fM = 0.09) or longer showed minimal increase in DPP fluorescence above the basal, dark-adapted signal (e.g., 10 min dark adaptation after 570 nm), even though such illumination causes a saturating electrical response in the photoreceptors (e.g., Figure 4A). Significant translocation (increase in DPP fluorescence) was first detected following photoequilibration with 545 nm light (fM = 0.12), and then increased steeply with decreasing wavelength, saturating at wavelengths of ∼515 nm (fM = 0.41). The extent of translocation could be rapidly (<30 s), repeatedly and stably adjusted to the same level by any given wavelength indefinitely (many hours), and irrespective of whether the direction of movement was into or out of the rhabdomere (Figure 3B). When the results were replotted as function of fM, using the photoequilibrium spectrum, they yielded a sigmoidal function that was approximately linear over much of the operational range (Figure 3D), indicating that the number of translocated Arr2 molecules is proportional to the number of M molecules generated. We also explored the spectral dependence of translocation of endogenous Arr2 by immunolocalization in “wild-type” white-eyed flies dissected and fixed under infrared illumination after 10 min illumination at different wavelengths. The results showed a very similar spectral dependence with no detectable translocation in flies exposed to 560 nm light, but a progressively greater fraction of Arr2 localizing to the rhabdomeres at shorter wavelengths (Figures 3B and 3C). The slope of the translocation versus fM plot ([Arr2]/fM) represents the ratio between translocated Arr2 and M molecules. Because the data were normalized, the stoichiometry can be simply derived by dividing the slope (3.8 ± 0.1 n = 12 for the linear region of the control data set in Figure 3D) by the ratio between total Rh1 and Arr2 available for translocation (e.g., a 1:1 stoichiometry would result if this Rh1/Arr2 ratio were also 3.8:1). The ratio between Rh1 and total available Arr2 is generally accepted as between ∼3 or 4:1 on the basis of the amount of R to M conversion required to out-titrate Arr2 leading to persistent activation of the transduction cascade and a “prolonged depolarizing after-potential,” or PDA (Minke and Kirschfeld, 1979Minke B.

[corrected] How do such vectorial constraints impact the folding pathway? Here, we combine single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulations to examine protein folding in the presence of one-dimensional constraints that are similar to those imposed on the nascent polypeptide chain. The simulations exquisitely reproduced the experimental unfolding and refolding force extension relationships and led to the full reconstruction of the vectorial folding pathway of a large polypeptide, the 253-residue consensus ankyrin repeat protein, NI6C. We show that fully stretched and then relaxed NI6C starts folding by the formation of local secondary structures, followed by the nucleation of three N-terminal repeats. This rate-limiting step is then followed by the vectorial and sequential folding of the remaining repeats. However, after partial unfolding, when allowed to refold, the C-terminal repeats successively regain structures without any nucleation step by using the intact N-terminal repeats as a template. These results suggest a pathway for the co-translational folding of repeat proteins and have implications for mechanotransduction."

One of these genes is matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), which is involved in bone remodeling and early stages of endochondral bone formation. We have previously shown that Mmp-13 gene expression is highly induced by PTH treatment in osteoblastic UMR 106-01 cells, as well as primary osteoblasts. Here, we show that p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), in addition to p300 and Runx2, is required for PTH activation of Mmp-13 transcription. PCAF was increasingly recruited to the MMP-13 proximal promoter region after PTH treatment, and this was associated with an increase in RNA polymerase II recruitment and histone acetylation. In addition, PTH treatment increased the acetylation of PCAF, a process that required p300. Knockdown of PCAF, p300, or Runx2 by siRNA decreased Mmp-13 mRNA expression after PTH treatment in both UMR 106-01 cells and primary osteoblasts. We found that there is a mutual dependence between p300 and PCAF to be recruited to the Mmp-13 promoter after PTH treatment. In promoter-reporter assays, p300 and PCAF had an additive effect on PTH stimulation of MMP-13 promoter activity, and this required their histone acetyltransferase activity.

Secreted from the parathyroid glands in response to low serum calcium levels, PTH has two primary sites of action, bone and kidney. In bone, PTH stimulates the release of calcium and phosphate ions from the bone mineral matrix, leading to bone degradation such that PTH is classically known as a catabolic agent in bone remodeling. However, when administered intermittently, PTH has an anabolic effect that leads to increased bone mass. Binding of PTH to its receptor, PTH1R, on the surface of osteoblasts leads to the activation of many different signaling pathways, including protein kinase A (PKA)- and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathways, as well as calcium ion channels (reviewed in Ref. 1Lee M.

In addition, these mice do not express MMP-13, which demonstrates the regulatory role of Runx2 in the transcription of Mmp-13 (21Jiménez M.J. Balbín M. López J.M. Alvarez J. Komori T. López-Otín C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4431-4442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Runx2 can function as a coactivator or corepressor of transcription depending on which factors it binds with at promoter regions. At the MMP-13 promoter in osteoblastic cells, we have shown that Runx2 binds HDAC4, resulting in a repression of transcription under basal conditions (22Shimizu E. Selvamurugan N. Westendorf J.J. Olson E.N. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9616-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After PTH treatment, HDAC4 dissociates from Runx2, which is then free to recruit p300 to activate transcription (23Boumah C.E. Lee M. Selvamurugan N. Shimizu E. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase p300 functions as a transcriptional coactivator through several different mechanisms. First, p300 is able to loosen the chromatin structure by directly acetylating histones via its intrinsic HAT activity, thus making the DNA more accessible to other transcriptional machinery (24Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar, 25Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). In some cases, p300 acetylates non-histone proteins as well, such as p53 and Runx2, and regulates their transcriptional activity (26Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 27Jeon E.J. Lee K.Y. Choi N.S. Lee M.H. Kim H.N. Jin Y.H. Ryoo H.M. Choi J.Y. Yoshida M.

In other cases, the HAT activity of p300 is not necessary at all, and instead, it acts as a scaffold for binding additional transcription factors to promoter regions (18Sierra J. Villagra A. Paredes R. Cruzat F. Gutierrez S. Javed A. Arriagada G. Olate J. Imschenetzky M. Van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Montecino M. Mol. Cell.

This mainly occurs through the CH1 and CH3 domains of p300, which are necessary for interacting with other transcription factors, such as c-Jun and PCAF (28Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J.

Brown D. Ureña P. Ardaillou N. Ardaillou R. Deeds J. Segre G.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F186-F191PubMed Google Scholar). PCAF also has an intrinsic HAT domain and is able to acetylate nucleosomal and free H3 and H4 histones (30Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 31Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The HAT activity of PCAF is stimulated by the acetylation of lysine residues in the C terminus, which can occur via autoacetylation or by p300 but not by CBP (32Santos-Rosa H. Valls E. Kouzarides T. Martínez-Balbás M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4285-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Before it was discovered that p300 and its functional homologue CBP had HAT activity, PCAF was considered to be the primary HAT involved in histone acetylation, whereas p300 and CBP were thought to act as adaptor molecules for PCAF and other transcription factors (24Ogryzko V.V.

Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Previous reports from our laboratory have shown that p300 associates with the MMP-13 proximal promoter through Runx2 after PTH treatment in UMR 106-01 cells and that both factors are necessary for PTH activation of MMP-13 transcription (23Boumah C.E. Lee M. Selvamurugan N. Shimizu E. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we report that PCAF is a downstream transcriptional coactivator of PTH that is required for Mmp-13 transcription after PTH treatment in both UMR 106-01 cells and primary rat osteoblasts. In addition, PTH stimulation of Mmp-13 promoter activity requires the HAT activity of both p300 and PCAF. These collectively suggest a model for PTH regulation of genes that have a Runt domain in their promoter region. Synthetic rat PTH-(1–34) was purchased from Sigma. Inhibitors H-89 and bisindolylmaleimide I were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies for PCAF (sc-8999), normal mouse IgG (sc-2025), and normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies for p300 (05-257), acetyl-histone H3 (06-599), acetyl-histone H4 (06-598), and RNA pol II (05-623) were purchased from Millipore. Anti-acetylated lysine (9411) and anti-Runx2 (D130-3) were purchased from Cell Signaling and MBL International, respectively. pGL2-MMP13, rat Mmp-13 promoter region (−148/+14), was amplified using primers 5′-AAGGTACCACTCAGGTTCTGCCACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGAGCTCCCTGGAGTCTCTCCTT-3′ (reverse) and then cloned into the KpnI and SacI sites of pGL2-basic vector (Promega). HA-PCAF was generated by subcloning the PCAF sequence from pcDNA3-PCAF-FLAG, kindly provided by Dr. Marian Martínez-Balbás (Instituto de Biología Molecular de Barcelona), into the HindIII and NotI sites of pHM6 vector (Roche Applied Science). HA-PCAF-A616/A617 was generated using the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Residues 616 and 617 were substituted with alanine using primers 5′-GCAGATGAATATGCAATTGGAGCCGCTAAGAAACAGGGTTTCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAGAAACCCTGTTTCTTAGCGGCTCCAATTGCATATTCATCTGC-3′ (reverse). Expression plasmids for p300, pCI-FLAG-p300 and pCI-FLAG-p300ΔHAT, were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University) (28Puri P.L. Sartorelli V.

All plasmids were sequenced and confirmed. UMR 106-01 cells were maintained in normal growth medium consisting of Eagle's minimal essential medium (1× non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin-streptomycin) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For treatment with PTH or inhibitors, cells were grown to 80% confluency in normal growth medium and then subjected to serum starvation in minimal essential medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, UMR 106-01 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/12 wells or 2 × 105 cells/6 wells 24 h prior to transfection. Plasmids were transfected using GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene), and the amount of total DNA per well was normalized by adding pFLAG and pHM6 empty vectors. For siRNA transfection and cotransfection of siRNA and plasmids, X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA oligoduplexes targeting rat p300 were purchased from Ambion and Sigma. RNA sequences targeting rat Runx2 and PCAF were purchased from Sigma. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection for RNA analysis and 72 h after transfection for protein analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Rat primary osteoblasts were isolated by the method of Shalhoub et al. (33Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The cells were derived from postnatal day 1 rat calvariae by sequential digestions of 20, 40, and 90 min at 37 °C in 2 mg/ml collagenase A, 0.25% trypsin in Dulbecco's PBS solution. Cells from the first and second digests were discarded. Cells from the final digest were collected and plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The following day, cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent at a final concentration of 100 nm. Cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 48–72 h after transfection. Then, cells were treated with 10−8 m PTH-(1–34) for 2 h and collected for RNA analysis. Forty-eight hours after transfection, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with PTH-(1–34) for 6 h and collected in 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). After at least 1 freeze-thaw cycle, luciferase activity of lysates was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was measured using the OptocompTM II luminometer (MGM Instruments). Twenty μl of lysate was used per reading, and each sample was read in duplicate. Total firefly luciferase activity was normalized against total mg of protein used per sample. UMR 106-01 cells were collected in Tri Reagent (Sigma), and RNA was subsequently isolated following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems), and the cDNA obtained was then amplified via real-time PCR using the SYBR Green PCR reagent (Applied Biosystems) with the indicated primers. Primer sequences used for real-time PCR are shown in Table 1. Real-time PCR data were normalized to β-actin, and -fold change in gene expression was obtained using the formula 2((Ctctrl − Ctβ-actin) − (CtPTH − Ctβ-actin)), where Ct is the threshold cycles and ctrl is the control.TABLE 1Primer sequences for real-time PCRGenePrimers (5′–3′)Rat Mmp-13 proximal promoter (−204/−34)Forward, CAGATGCGTTTTGATATGCCReverse, AATAGTGATGAGTCACCACTTRat Mmp-13Forward, ACAGTTCAGGCTCAACCTGCTGReverse, GCCCTATCCCTTGATGCCATTRat PcafForward, ATTCATGGCGGACTTACAGCGAReverse, CTTGTCCATCAAGCCTGCTTCCTTRat p300Forward, AGCGAGCTTATGCTGCTCTCReverse, GGCACTCATGTTGTTCATGGRat Runx2Forward, TAAAGTGACAGTGGACGGTCCCReverse, TGCGCCCTAAATCACTGAGGRat c-fosForward, CTGCCTCTTCTCAATGACCCTGReverse, GCCGGAAACAAGAAGTCATCAARat β-actinForward, TCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGTGReverse, CGGACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTT Open table in a new tab UMR 106-01 cells were collected and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) after the indicated treatments. Lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants were then collected for overnight immunoprecipitation with the antibodies of interest. Normal rabbit or mouse IgG was used as a negative control depending on the origin of the antibody of interest. The next day, immunocomplexes were collected with protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in protein sample buffer. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in 5% low fat milk in TBS buffer. The following day, after washing, membranes were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). All Western blots were quantified through densitometry using ImageQuant 5.0 software. UMR 106-01 cells were grown to confluency and treated with 10−8 m PTH-(1–34) for 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h and subsequently incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then collected in SDS-lysis buffer and sonicated on ice with four 10-s pulses with 20-s intervals. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, the supernatants were collected and diluted with ChIP dilution buffer. After preclearing with protein G-agarose beads/salmon sperm DNA, the supernatants were collected for overnight incubation at 4 °C with the antibodies of interest. The following day, immunocomplexes were collected with protein G-agarose beads/salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 4 °C and were subsequently washed with the following: once with low salt washing buffer, high salt washing buffer, LiCl washing buffer and twice with Tris-EDTA buffer. To elute DNA, samples were incubated twice in 150 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) for a total of 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant from each elution was collected and incubated at 65 °C for at least 5 h to reverse cross-linking after the addition of 12 μl of 5 m NaCl. The next day, following treatment with RNase A and proteinase K, DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. DNA was then amplified using real-time PCR using the primers for the rat Mmp-13 proximal promoter region (−204/−34) (Table 1). The data obtained were analyzed using the formula 2((CtIgG − Ct Input) − (CtAb − CtInput)), where Ct is the threshold cycles, IgG is the normal IgG, Ab is the specific antibody, and Input is the input genomic DNA (34Caretti G. Di Padova M. Micales B. Lyons G.E. Sartorelli V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Data are shown as the average ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. For luciferase assays and RNA analyses, each independent experiment was performed in triplicate, and each sample was measured in duplicate. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that p300 is recruited to the Mmp-13 proximal promoter region after PTH treatment in osteoblastic UMR 106-01 cells (23Boumah C.E. Lee M. Selvamurugan N. Shimizu E. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the HAT activity of p300-immunoprecipitated complexes increased with PTH treatment (23Boumah C.E. Lee M. Selvamurugan N. Shimizu E. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we were not able to identify a change in post-translational modification in p300 that could explain the increase in HAT activity (data not shown). In the process of identifying another candidate that could be responsible for the increase in HAT activity, we found that PCAF, another well defined HAT, coimmunoprecipitated with p300 in UMR 106-01 cells with and without PTH treatment (Fig. 1A). PCAF is an acetylated protein, and acetylation of PCAF has been reported to augment its HAT activity (32Santos-Rosa H. Valls E. Kouzarides T. Martínez-Balbás M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4285-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We found that after 1 h of PTH treatment, PCAF acetylation increased 50% in UMR 106-01 cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether PCAF is involved in the transcriptional regulation of Mmp-13, we performed ChIP assays using UMR 106-01 cells treated with PTH for 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h (Fig. 1C). ChIP DNA samples were amplified using primers for the proximal promoter region of Mmp-13 (−204/−34). Results from these experiments demonstrate that recruitment of PCAF and p300 to the Mmp-13 promoter increases with PTH treatment when compared with control sets, and this is associated with an increase in histone acetylation and a significant increase in Mmp-13 mRNA (Fig. 1D). Inhibition of PKA signaling by 5 μm H-89 completely blocked the binding of p300, PCAF, and RNA pol II after 2 h of PTH treatment. The binding of RNA pol II, which we used in ChIP assays as a positive control for active promoters, was somewhat affected by the inhibition of PKC by 5 μm bisindolylmaleimide-1 (Fig. 1E). However, this decrease was statistically insignificant, most likely due to the large degree of variation in the -fold change of RNA pol II. This may be because the amount of pol II associated with the promoter changes rapidly and highly with time, thus giving greater variation from one experiment to the next. PCAF acts as a transcriptional coactivator for many genes (18Sierra J. Villagra A. Paredes R. Cruzat F. Gutierrez S. Javed A. Arriagada G. Olate J. Imschenetzky M. Van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B.

Blood. 2004; 103: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although it has not yet been reported to be involved downstream of PTH signaling or in MMP-13 transcription. To determine whether PCAF plays a critical role in the PTH activation of Mmp-13 transcription, PCAF expression was transiently knocked down in UMR 106-01 cells via siRNA transfection. Knockdown of PCAF was confirmed at both the RNA and the protein level; an average of 45% knockdown in PCAF mRNA (Fig. 2A) and an average of 90% knockdown in protein expression (Fig. 2B) were observed. In whole cell lysates, the PCAF antibody detects two additional bands. These may be different isoforms of PCAF that are expressed in rat. However, these additional bands are not detected after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). Analysis of RNA collected from these cells shows that targeting of PCAF siRNA is specific, demonstrated by the mRNA expression of p300 (Fig. 2A), which was not affected by the transfection of PCAF siRNA. In cells transfected with PCAF siRNA, the increase in Mmp-13 mRNA in response to PTH was diminished by 70% when compared with those cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 2A), confirming that PCAF is necessary for PTH-dependent MMP-13 transcription. The expression of c-fos, another PTH-responsive gene, was not affected, which indicates that this requirement for PCAF does not apply to all genes that are regulated by PTH. We next performed ChIP assays with PCAF siRNA-transfected cells to examine the role of PCAF in p300 recruitment and histone acetylation at the Mmp-13 promoter. Surprisingly, knockdown of PCAF resulted in the abolition of p300 recruitment (Fig. 2C), implying that PCAF is required for p300 association with the MMP-13 promoter. In addition, recruitment of transcriptional machinery such as RNA pol II and histone acetylation decreased as well, which accounts for the decrease in Mmp-13 transcription. We have previously shown that p300 association with the Mmp-13 proximal promoter requires Runx2 (23Boumah C.E. Lee M. Selvamurugan N. Shimizu E. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because PCAF was found to coimmunoprecipitate with p300, we examined whether PCAF was also binding to the Mmp-13 promoter through Runx2 in a similar manner. Using siRNA, the expression of Runx2 was knocked down an average of 51% at the mRNA level and 40% at the protein level in UMR 106-01 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). RNA analysis showed that cells with a significant knockdown of Runx2 mRNA had an 86% decrease in Mmp-13 transcription after 2 h of PTH treatment (Fig. 3C). We also performed ChIP assays using cells transfected with Runx2 siRNA. Results from these experiments demonstrate that cells expressing less Runx2 were not able to recruit PCAF or p300 to the Mmp-13 proximal promoter after 2 h of PTH treatment (Fig. 3C).

In endosymbiont-containing trypanosomatids, like Crithidia deanei, this process is more complex, as each daughter cell contains only a single symbiotic bacterium, indicating that the prokaryote must replicate synchronically with the host protozoan. In this study, we used light and electron microscopy combined with three-dimensional reconstruction approaches to observe the endosymbiont shape and division during C. deanei cell cycle. We found that the bacterium replicates before the basal body and kinetoplast segregations and that the nucleus is the last organelle to divide, before cytokinesis. In addition, the endosymbiont is usually found close to the host cell nucleus, presenting different shapes during the protozoan cell cycle. Considering that the endosymbiosis in trypanosomatids is a mutualistic relationship, which resembles organelle acquisition during evolution, these findings establish an excellent model for the understanding of mechanisms related with the establishment of organelles in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012803502,"Even though it is increasingly evident that post-transcriptional events like mRNA processing and splicing may regulate gene expression and proteome diversity of malaria parasite Plasmodium, molecular mechanisms that regulate events like mRNA splicing in malaria parasite are poorly understood. Protein kinases control a wide variety of cellular events in almost all eukaryotes, including modulation of mRNA splicing, transport, and stability. We have identified a novel splicing-related protein kinase from Plasmodium falciparum, PfSRPK1. PfSRPK1 when incubated with parasite nuclear extracts inhibited RNA splicing, suggesting that it may control mRNA splicing in the parasite. PfSR1, a putative splicing factor from P. falciparum, was identified as a substrate of PfSRPK1. PfSR1 interacts with RNA and PfSRPK1 modulates its RNA binding. Early in the parasite development, PfSRPK1 and PfSR1 are present in the nucleus. These studies provide useful insights into the function of two potentially key components of P. falciparum mRNA splicing machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1991281576,"We examined the interaction of ECM1 (extracellular matrix protein 1) using yeast two-hybrid screening and identified the type II transmembrane protein, PLSCR1 (phospholipid scramblase 1), as a binding partner. This interaction was then confirmed by in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and additional pull-down experiments with GST-tagged ECM1a fragments localized this interaction to occur within the tandem repeat region of ECM1a. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining revealed a partial overlap of ECM1 and PLSCR1 in human skin at the basal epidermal cell layer. Moreover, in human skin equivalents, both proteins are expressed at the basal membrane in a dermal fibroblast-dependent manner. Next, immunogold electron microscopy of ultrathin human skin sections showed that ECM1 and PLSCR1 co-localize in the extracellular matrix, and using antibodies against ECM1 or PLSCR1 cross-linked to magnetic immunobeads, we were able to demonstrate PLSCR1-ECM1 interaction in human skin extracts. Furthermore, whereas ECM1 is secreted by the endoplasmic/Golgi-dependent pathway, PLSCR1 release from HaCaT keratinocytes occurs via a lipid raft-dependent mechanism, and is deposited in the extracellular matrix. In summary, we here demonstrate that PLSCR1 interacts with the tandem repeat region of ECM1a in the dermal epidermal junction zone of human skin and provide for the first time experimental evidence that PLSCR1 is secreted by an unconventional secretion pathway. These data suggest that PLSCR1 is a multifunctional protein that can function both inside and outside of the cell and together with ECM1 may play a regulatory role in human skin.

https://openalex.org/W2042650545,"Maintenance and regulation of the asymmetric lipid distribution across eukaryotic plasma membranes is governed by the concerted action of specific membrane proteins controlling lipid movement across the bilayer. Here, we show that the miltefosine transporter (LdMT), a member of the P4-ATPase subfamily in Leishmania donovani, and the Cdc50-like protein LdRos3 form a stable complex that plays an essential role in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in the parasite plasma membrane. Loss of either LdMT or LdRos3 abolishes ATP-dependent transport of NBD-labelled phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine from the outer to the inner plasma membrane leaflet and results in an increased cell surface exposure of endogenous PE. We also find that promastigotes of L. donovani lack any detectable amount of phosphatidylserine (PS) but retain their infectivity in THP-1-derived macrophages. Likewise, infectivity was unchanged for parasites without LdMT-LdRos3 complexes. We conclude that exposure of PS and PE to the exoplasmic leaflet is not crucial for the infectivity of L. donovani promastigotes."

Although several groups showed that TNF can promote osteoclastogenesis independently of the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL), others demonstrated that TNF-mediated osteoclastogenesis needs permissive levels of RANKL. Here, we independently reveal that although TNF cannot stimulate osteoclastogenesis on bone slices, it can induce the formation of functional osteoclasts on bone slices in the presence of permissive levels of RANKL or from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) pretreated by RANKL. TNF can still promote the formation of functional osteoclasts 2 days after transient RANKL pretreatment. These data have confirmed that TNF-mediated osteoclastogenesis requires priming of BMMs by RANKL. Moreover, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the dependence of TNF-mediated osteoclastogenesis on RANKL. RANK, the receptor for RANKL, contains an IVVY535–538 motif that has been shown to play a vital role in osteoclastogenesis by committing BMMs to the osteoclast lineage. We show that TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis depends on RANKL to commit BMMs to the osteoclast lineage and RANKL regulates the lineage commitment through the IVVY motif. Mechanistically, the IVVY motif controls the lineage commitment by reprogramming osteoclast genes into an inducible state in which they can be activated by TNF.

This strategy identified 17 in-frame PIMT target proteins, including a cupin-family protein similar to those identified previously using on-blot methylation. All recovered phage had at least one susceptible Asp or Asn residue. Five targets were recovered independently. Two in-frame targets were produced in Escherichia coli as recombinant proteins and shown by on-blot methylation to acquire isoAsp, becoming a PIMT target.

In the present study, we examined protein B2-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial complex II activity, which results in ATP depletion and thereby in a bioenergetic crisis in vitro and in vivo. Expression of protein B2 was detected early at 24 h postinfection with red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus in the cytoplasm.

IntroductionBetanodaviruses cause viral nervous necrosis, an infectious neuropathological condition in fish that is characterized by necrosis of the central nervous system, including the brain and retina and by clinical signs (e.g. abnormal swimming behavior and development of a darker body color) (1Bovo G. Nishizawa T. Maltese C. Borghesan F. Mutinelli F. Montesi F. De Mas S. Virus Res. 1999; 63: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This disease can cause mass mortality in larval and juvenile populations of several teleost species and is of global economic importance (2Tan C. Huang B. Chang S.F. Ngoh G.H. Munday B. Chen S.C. Kwang J. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The family Nodaviridae is comprised of the genera Alphanodavirus and Betanodavirus. Alphanodavirus predominantly infects insects, whereas Betanodavirus predominantly infects fish (3Ball L.A. Johnson K.L. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 53: 229-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schneemann A.

Evol. 2007; 43: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nodaviruses are small, non-enveloped, spherical viruses with bipartite positive-sense RNA genomes (RNA1 and RNA2) that are capped but not polyadenylated (3Ball L.A. Johnson K.L. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 53: 229-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA1 encodes an ∼110-kDa non-structural protein that has been designated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or protein A. This protein is vital for replication of the viral genome. RNA2 encodes a 42-kDa capsid protein (6Delsert C. Morin N. Comps M. Arch.

Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2008; 24: 436-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nodaviruses also synthesize RNA3, a sub-genomic RNA species from the 3′ terminus of RNA1. RNA3 contains two putative open reading frames that potentially encode an 111-amino acid protein B1 and a 75-amino acid protein B2 (3Ball L.A. Johnson K.L. Adv.

Cell Physiol. 1982; 243: C247-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in mitochondrial function, such as suppression of mitochondrial metabolism, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced respiration have been shown to play a key role in induction of cell death (18Higuchi Y. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2004; 8: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Zuryn S. Kuang J. Ebert P. Toxicol. Sci. 2008; 102: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mitochondria produce the majority of cellular ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. The mitochondrial electron transport chain removes electrons from an electron donor (NADH for Complex I or QH2 for Complex III) and passes them to a terminal electron acceptor (O2) via a series of redox reactions. These reactions are coupled to the creation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The resulting transmembrane proton gradient is used to make ATP via ATP synthase (20de Castro I.P. Martins L.M. Tufi R. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2010; 12: e12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

In addition, B2 protein (a novel necrotic cell death inducer translated from subgenomic RNA3) acts via a Bax-mediated pathway (14Su Y.C. Wu J.L. Hong J.R. Virology. 2009; 385: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is prevented from acting via overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene of zfBcl-xL (11Chen S.P. Wu J.L. Su Y.C. Hong J.R.

However, the molecular mechanism of protein B2 induction of mitochondria-mediated necrotic cell death is still unclear and may provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of RNA virus infection.In the present study, we demonstrate that RGNNV B2 targets mitochondria using a specific signal peptide that directs B2 to the mitochondrial matrix, subsequently causing mitochondrial disruption and necrotic cell death in fish cells. Furthermore, we attempt to determine how B2 induces necrotic cell death.DISCUSSIONBetanodavirus causes viral nervous necrosis and the infected fish to lie on its side, float belly up, or swim abnormally (such as in circles or to the right). Histopathological changes include extensive cellular vacuolation and necrotic neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system and retina (44Tanaka S. Kuriyama I. Nakai T. Miyazaki T. J. Fish Dis. 2003; 26: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disease are still unknown.In the present study, the sequence (41RTFVISAHAA50) in RGNNV protein B2 was identified as the molecular signal used to target the mitochondrial matrix. Protein B2 induced MMP loss in both fish and human cells, followed by mitochondrial ATP depletion. Furthermore, this novel necrotic death factor triggered ATP depletion in embryos and consequently embryonic cell death. These results may be the first to elucidate the mechanism of betanodavirus-induced neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system and retina (44Tanaka S. Kuriyama I. Nakai T. Miyazaki T. J.

Mitochondria appear to be the targets of B2. In our system, B2 was expressed early during replication at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Immunofluorescence assay showed that B2 targets mitochondria-like particles (Fig. 1B, j and k) and to some extent exists in the nucleus at 48 h post-infection, where it may act as a host siRNA silencing suppressor (Fig. 1B, j, indicated by arrows). Using tag EYFP tracing (Fig. 2B, g and h) and MitoTracker staining (Fig. 2B, i and j), protein B2 was shown to target mitochondria. Furthermore, we wanted to know whether B2 localized in the outer membrane or inner membrane of mitochondria because protein function differs between them (29Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Morselli E. Touat Z. Kroemer G. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000018Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Immuno-EM staining showed that most protein B2 localized and formed small complexes in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 2B, f, indicated by arrows).Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm as precursors, which are post-translationally translocated into either the outer or inner membrane of the mitochondria (45Neupert W.

These proteins usually have an N-terminal cleavable sequence that is either positively charged or hydrophobic and usually forms an amphipathic helix (48Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R.

Proteins targeted to mitochondrial membrane often contain an N- or C-terminal targeting sequence and anchoring signal sequence (45Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 53Roise D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the midsequence location of the B2 targeting motif is not well known. In our study, the targeting motif (41RTFVISAHAA50) of protein B2 contained 10 amino acid residues and played a very important function early during RGNNV infection. Deletion of this sequence resulted in loss of MMP (Fig. 4A, g–i) and loss of necrosis-inducing activity (loss of SDH activity; Fig. 5C) in fish GF-1 cells. The positively charged and hydrophobic residues within the signal peptide are essential for mitochondrial targeting (45Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 52Robin M.A. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Sepuri N.B. Gordon D.M. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When the positively charged residues (Arg52 and Arg53) and the two hydrophobic residues (Val44 and Ile45) near the signal sequence were changed to uncharged Ala residues (Fig. 3A), targeting to the mitochondrion was lost, implying that these 4 residues (Val44, Ile45, Arg52, and Arg53) of protein B2 are necessary for targeting (Fig. 3E, g–i) and necrosis induction (Fig. 4C, j–l).Protein B2 Induces MMP Loss and Produces a Mitochondrial Energy CrisisThe mitochondria are vital cellular machines for maintaining cellular energy and use oxygen to produce ATP through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation (16Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The inner mitochondrial membrane contains a respiratory chain of four multisubunit protein complexes that release energy used to pump protons across this membrane. The created electrochemical gradient of protons and resulting mitochondria membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨ) drives ATP formation from ADP and phosphate (16Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Thus, damage to mitochondria plays an important role in a wide range of human diseases (20de Castro I.P. Martins L.M. Tufi R. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2010; 12: e12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 55Valmas N. Zuryn S. Ebert P.R. Toxicology. 2008; 252: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial disorders often present as neurological disorders such as Parkinson disease (21Furuya T. Hayakawa H. Yamada M. Yoshimi K. Hisahara S. Miura M. Mizuno Y. Mochizuki H. J.

Rev. 2009; 61: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A variety of studies have suggested that neural cell death could be due to mitochondrial energy deficits. Cell death could be mediated by loss of MMP, release of cytochome c, and depletion of ATP (56Kuczynski B. Reo N.V. Neurochem. Res. 2006; 31: 639-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In our system, protein B2 entered mitochondria to inhibit the activity of complex II (Fig. 5C) but not complex I (Fig. 5B), and thereby deplete ATP (Fig. 5A) and degrade the component proteins of complex II as SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD (Fig. 5D). In fish and human cells, marked depletion of ATP (Fig. 6C) occurred in early zebrafish embryos used as a model animal system (40Hong J.R. Lin G.H. Lin C.J. Wang W.P. Lee C.C. Lin T.L. Wu J.L. Development. 2004; 131: 5417-5427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which ended in embryonic death (Fig. 6, A and B). These in vitro and in vivo results suggest that protein B2 triggers a mitochondrial energy crisis.Viral Proteins Induce Mitochondrial Disruption and Cellular DeathRecently, some well known DNA and RNA viruses have been shown to cause mitochondria-mediated cell death. A number of viral polypeptides modulate apoptosis by either increasing or decreasing MMP through modification of the outer mitochondrial membrane or by acting on upstream/downstream steps of the cell apoptotic cascade (29Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Morselli E. Touat Z. Kroemer G. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000018Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In contrast, only a few viral proteins (e.g. HCV NS4A (57Nomura-Takigawa Y. Nagano-Fujii M. Deng L. Kitazawa S. Ishido S. Sada K. Hotta H. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and HIV-1 Tat (58Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar)) accumulate in mitochondria, induce MMP loss, and activate caspase-3-dependent cell death.Chen et al. (38Chen S.P. Yang H.L. Her G.M. Lin H.Y. Jeng M.F. Wu J.L. Hong J.R. Virology. 2006; 347: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that the RGNNV TN1 strain induced apoptosis and post-apoptotic necrosis in a grouper liver cell line (GL-av). RGNNV infection in fish cells induced loss of MMP, which was blocked by the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore inhibitor BKA (38Chen S.P. Yang H.L. Her G.M. Lin H.Y. Jeng M.F. Wu J.L. Hong J.R. Virology. 2006; 347: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as well as the Bcl-2 member protein zfBcl-xL (11Chen S.P. Wu J.L. Su Y.C. Hong J.R. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1043-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, they showed that cell death was dependent on viral RNA replication, indicating the need for the expression of the viral death factor(s), protein α/B2, before cytochrome c could be released and caspase-3-independent signaling could be activated in mitochondria (59Wu H.C. Wu J.L. Chu H.L. Su Y.C. Hong J.R. Fish Shellfish Immuno. 2010; 29: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in betanodavirus-infected cells, both the viral capsid protein α (8Guo Y.X. Wei T. Dallmann K. Kwang J. Virology. 2003; 308: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Wu H.C. Chiu C.S. Wu J.L. Gong H.Y. Chen M.C. Lu M.W. Hong J.R. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2008; 24: 436-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and non-structural protein B2 (11Chen S.P. Wu J.L. Su Y.C. Hong J.R. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1043-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Su Y.C. Wu J.L. Hong J.R. Virology. 2009; 385: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) all triggered loss of MMP and necrosis. Protein α induces MMP loss, cytochrome c release,and increased caspase-8 and -3 activation, and zfBcl-xL blocks these post-apoptotic necrosis processes thereby rescuing virus-infected cells (8Guo Y.X. Wei T. Dallmann K. Kwang J. Virology. 2003; 308: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Wu H.C. Chiu C.S. Wu J.L. Gong H.Y. Chen M.C. Lu M.W. Hong J.R. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2008; 24: 436-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, protein B2 up-regulates the pro-apoptotic gene Bax to enhance MMP loss, but does not induce release of cytochome c and activation of caspase-3-independent signaling (11Chen S.P. Wu J.L. Su Y.C. Hong J.R. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1043-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, necrosis can be blocked by B2-specific siRNA and the anti-apoptotic protein zfBcl-xL (11Chen S.P. Wu J.L. Su Y.C. Hong J.R. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1043-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Su Y.C. Wu J.L. Hong J.R. Virology. 2009; 385: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, protein B2 disrupted mitochondria via targeting (Fig. 3E) and inhibition of complex II function (Fig. 5, C and D). The resulting MMP loss (Fig. 4A) and ATP depletion (Figs. 5A and 6B) contributed to necrosis induction, which is a strategy used by viruses to modulate the rate of cell death. As summarized in Fig. 7, protein B2 is a non-structural protein expressed early in the infection cycle. It localizes primarily in the mitochondria and secondarily in the nucleus. A targeting signal sequence of 10 amino acids in the central region of the B2 protein directs B2 to the mitochondrial matrix where it disrupts mitochondrial function. Protein B2 inhibits complex II activity leading to induction of MMP loss and ATP depletion culminating in a bioenergetic crisis and necrosis. These findings may provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of RNA viruses and suggest new clinical treatments. IntroductionBetanodaviruses cause viral nervous necrosis, an infectious neuropathological condition in fish that is characterized by necrosis of the central nervous system, including the brain and retina and by clinical signs (e.g. abnormal swimming behavior and development of a darker body color) (1Bovo G. Nishizawa T. Maltese C. Borghesan F. Mutinelli F. Montesi F. De Mas S. Virus Res. 1999; 63: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This disease can cause mass mortality in larval and juvenile populations of several teleost species and is of global economic importance (2Tan C. Huang B. Chang S.F. Ngoh G.H. Munday B. Chen S.C. Kwang J. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The family Nodaviridae is comprised of the genera Alphanodavirus and Betanodavirus. Alphanodavirus predominantly infects insects, whereas Betanodavirus predominantly infects fish (3Ball L.A. Johnson K.L. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 53: 229-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schneemann A.

Evol. 2007; 43: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nodaviruses are small, non-enveloped, spherical viruses with bipartite positive-sense RNA genomes (RNA1 and RNA2) that are capped but not polyadenylated (3Ball L.A. Johnson K.L. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 53: 229-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA1 encodes an ∼110-kDa non-structural protein that has been designated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or protein A. This protein is vital for replication of the viral genome. RNA2 encodes a 42-kDa capsid protein (6Delsert C. Morin N. Comps M. Arch. Virol. 1997; 142: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Mori K."
https://openalex.org/W2057270489,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARS) are modular enzymes that aminoacylate transfer RNAs (tRNA) for their use by the ribosome during protein synthesis. ARS are essential and universal components of the genetic code that were almost completely established before the appearance of the last common ancestor of all living species. This long evolutionary history explains the growing number of functions being discovered for ARS, and for ARS homologues, beyond their canonical role in gene translation. Here we present a previously uncharacterized paralogue of seryl-tRNA synthetase named SLIMP (seryl-tRNA synthetase-like insect mitochondrial protein). SLIMP is the result of a duplication of a mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (SRS) gene that took place in early metazoans and was fixed in Insecta. Here we show that SLIMP is localized in the mitochondria, where it carries out an essential function that is unrelated to the aminoacylation of tRNA. The knockdown of SLIMP by RNA interference (RNAi) causes a decrease in respiration capacity and an increase in mitochondrial mass in the form of aberrant mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2146413291,"Neurons in the sensory system exhibit changes in excitability that unfold over many time scales. These fluctuations produce noise and could potentially lead to perceptual errors. However, to prevent such errors, postsynaptic neurons and synapses can adapt and counteract changes in the excitability of presynaptic neurons. Here we ask how neurons could optimally adapt to minimize the influence of changing presynaptic neural properties on their outputs. The resulting model, based on Bayesian inference, explains a range of physiological results from experiments which have measured the overall properties and detailed time-course of sensory tuning curve adaptation in the early visual cortex. We show how several experimentally measured short term plasticity phenomena can be understood as near-optimal solutions to this adaptation problem. This framework provides a link between high level computational problems, the properties of cortical neurons, and synaptic physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2007488990,"Copper is a highly reactive, toxic metal; consequently, transport of this metal within the cell is tightly regulated. Intriguingly, the actinobacterium Kineococcus radiotolerans has been shown to not only accumulate soluble copper to high levels within the cytoplasm, but the phenotype also correlated with enhanced cell growth during chronic exposure to ionizing radiation. This study offers a first glimpse into the physiological and proteomic responses of K. radiotolerans to copper at increasing concentration and distinct growth phases. Aerobic growth rates and biomass yields were similar over a range of Cu(II) concentrations (0-1.5 mM) in complex medium. Copper uptake coincided with active cell growth and intracellular accumulation was positively correlated with Cu(II) concentration in the growth medium (R(2)=0.7). Approximately 40% of protein coding ORFs on the K. radiotolerans genome were differentially expressed in response to the copper treatments imposed. Copper accumulation coincided with increased abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress and defense, DNA stabilization and repair, and protein turnover. Interestingly, the specific activity of superoxide dismutase was repressed by low to moderate concentrations of copper during exponential growth, and activity was unresponsive to perturbation with paraquot. The biochemical response pathways invoked by sub-lethal copper concentrations are exceptionally complex; though integral cellular functions are preserved, in part, through the coordination of defense enzymes, chaperones, antioxidants and protective osmolytes that likely help maintain cellular redox. This study extends our understanding of the ecology and physiology of this unique actinobacterium that could potentially inspire new biotechnologies in metal recovery and sequestration, and environmental restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2018898540,"Plant sucrose transporter activities were shown to respond to changes in the extracellular pH and redox status, and oxidizing compounds like glutathione (GSSG) or H(2)O(2) were reported to effect the subcellular targeting of these proteins. We hypothesized that changes in both parameters might be used to modulate the activities of competing sucrose transporters at a plant/pathogen interface. We, therefore, compared the effects of redox-active compounds and of extracellular pH on the sucrose transporters UmSRT1 and ZmSUT1 known to compete for extracellular sucrose in the Ustilago maydis (corn smut)/Zea mays (maize) pathosystem.We present functional analyses of the U. maydis sucrose transporter UmSRT1 and of the plant sucrose transporters ZmSUT1 and StSUT1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or in Xenopus laevis oocytes in the presence of different extracellular pH-values and redox systems, and study the possible effects of these treatments on the subcellular targeting. We observed an inverse regulation of host and pathogen sucrose transporters by changes in the apoplastic pH. Under none of the conditions analyzed, we could confirm the reported effects of redox-active compounds.Our data suggest that changes in the extracellular pH but not of the extracellular redox status might be used to oppositely adjust the transport activities of plant and fungal sucrose transporters at the host/pathogen interface."
https://openalex.org/W2023852236,"Background Discriminating threatening individuals from non-threatening ones allow territory owners to modulate their territorial responses according to the threat posed by each intruder. This ability reduces costs associated with territorial defence. Reduced aggression towards familiar adjacent neighbours, termed the dear-enemy effect, has been shown in numerous species. An important question that has never been investigated is whether territory owners perceive distant neighbours established in the same group as strangers because of their unfamiliarity, or as dear-enemies because of their group membership. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate this question, we played back to male skylarks (Alauda arvensis) songs of adjacent neighbours, distant neighbours established a few territories away in the same microdialect area and strangers. Additionally, we carried out a propagation experiment to investigate how far skylark songs are propagated in their natural habitat and we estimated repertoire similarity between adjacent neighbours, distant neighbours and strangers. We show that skylarks, in the field, respond less aggressively to songs of their distant and likely unfamiliar neighbours, as shown by the propagation experiment, compared to stranger songs. The song analysis revealed that individuals share a high amount of syllables and sequences with both their adjacent and distant neighbours, but only few syllables and no sequences with strangers. Conclusions The observed reduction of aggression between distant neighbours thus probably results from their familiarity with the vocal group signature shared by all members of the neighbourhood. Therefore, in skylarks, dear-enemy-like relationships can be established between unfamiliar individuals who share a common acoustic code."
