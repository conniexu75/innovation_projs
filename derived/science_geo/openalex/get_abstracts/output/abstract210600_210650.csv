https://openalex.org/W2094592354,"Phytohemagglutinin causes cultured lymphocytes to agglutinate, divide, and produce gamma-globulin. Most cells are transformed into large lymphocytes, some resembling plasmocytes. Actinomycin D stops gamma-globulin production after 2 hours. When specific antigens are added to lymphocytes from sensitized individuals, only some cells undergo morphological transformation, produce gamma-globulin, and divide. When cells or cell extracts from an unrelated individual are added to a culture, a similar reaction occurs."

https://openalex.org/W2084940226,Detection of the gap in a four-position Landolt C presented to one eye is impaired by critically spaced surrounding bars seen only by the other eye. The intensity and spatial extent of this contralateral contour interaction match those obtained ipsilaterally. These results indicate that the neural site for this loss of visual information is supraretinal.
https://openalex.org/W2051601758,"There are ganglion cells in the pigeon retina that respond selectively, some to any edge moving in a particular direction only, others to any vertically moving horizontal edge. This selective response to a specific stimulus arises from the selective sensitivity of each neuron to a particular spatiotemporal configuration in its afferent influences, and is independent of specific pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2082797056,"Some rat pups were handled for 20 days in infancy, while others were not. When the rats reached adulthood the females were bred. Some of the offspring were left with their natural mothers, others were fostered to mothers of the same background (handled/nonhandled) as that of their natural mothers, while still others were fostered to mothers with a different background from that of their natural mothers. The offspring were weaned and weighed at 21 days; at 50 days, activity and defecation scores were obtained in the open field. The weights at weaning and the defecation scores at 50 days were significantly influenced by the experience in infancy of the ""postnatal"" mother, whether she was the natural mother or a foster mother. The natural mother and the foster mother jointly affected the open-field activity of the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2066600329,"The presence of an aziridine ring in mitomycin C suggests that the mechanism of action of the antibiotic is like that of the antitumor alkylating agents. However the compound is unexpectedly stable during aerobic incubation with rat liver homogenates although rapidly metabolized anaerobically. Mitomycin is not reactive with gamma-(4-nitrobenzyl) pyridine and reacts only slowly at acid p(H) with thiosulfate. It is proposed that mitomycin is activated in vivo, possibly by a reduction which ""unmasks"" the potential activity of the fused aziridine ring."

https://openalex.org/W2073397387,New evidence is presented that spike and transducer processes in sensory receptors are independent events; impulse activity in the crustacean stretch receptor neuron and the mammalian pacinian corpuscle was selectively blocked by a compound (tetrodotoxin) without affecting any of the parameters of the generator potential.
https://openalex.org/W2084480170,"A change in the lactate dehydrogenase isozyme pattern can arise when human tissue homogenates are kept at -20 degrees C. This change is most pronounced in a homogenate with a pH of about 7.9 in barbital buffer and is not seen when nicotinamide adeninedinucleotide is added to the homogenates before freezing, nor when the homogenates are kept at room temperature, nor when the tissue alone is kept at -20 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1965554226,"Part of the RNA synthesized from nucleoside triphosphate precursors by partially purified RNA synthetase, an enzyme induced in Escherichia coli by the RNA-containing phage MS 2, is resistant to hydrolysis by ribonuclease. Upon heating in 0.15M sodium chloride, 0.015M sodium citrate followed by fast cooling the material becomes ribonuclease-sensitive with a sharp transition at 102 degrees to 104 degrees C. The suggestion that the ribonuclease-resistant product is double-stranded RNA is reinforced by restoration of the ribonuclease resistance of the heat-denatured material by reannealing at temperatures just below the transition point and by its buoyant density in cesium sulfate. It is suggested that double-stranded RNA is the replicative form of MS 2 phage RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2046524131,Low-density (1.019 to 1.063) lipoprotein labeled with radioiodine enters the inner layer of the canine aortic wall directly from the aortic lumen. Its rate of entry is greatest in the proximal aorta and decreases progressively down the length of the aorta. A similar gradient was observed previously for the accumulation of cholesterol early in experimental atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2030193859,"Projecting subunits of an average diameter of 80 Å are found on the cristae of mitochondria prepared from the muscle of Ascaris lumbricoides. A spectroscopic examination of the cytochrome content of these mitochondria shows no detectable cytochrome c1, a, or a 3 and does reveal cytochromes of types c and b. Subunits in the same size range are found in cytochrome c deficient mitochondria of the emergent bee, while the frequency of their occurrence along the cristae is decreased relative to the adult bee. Apparently, the cytochrome content of the respiratory chain is not related to the size of the subunits, but may be related to the frequency of occurrence of the subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2018747901,"When a preparation containing the DNA of the bacteriophage øX174 in its replicative form together with DNA from Escherichia coli is treated with exonucleases, the replicative form retains its characteristic physical properties, while the bacterial DNA is degraded. The evidence suggests that the mature replicative form exists as a closed ring."

https://openalex.org/W2411226771,"UNTIL a few years ago, the beneficial effects resulting from the ingestion of the Lactobacillus acidophilus in cases of gastro-intestinal disturbances were attributed to the simple overgrowth of the offending pathogen by the Lactobacilli. Recently a number of workers have indicated that there was more to the reaction than just competition between strains. The substance produced by L. acidophilus has been called variously antagonist1, lactobacillin2, lactocidin3, and antibiotic4. All these workers found that the substance was extremely labile, and attempts to isolate it met with failure. A successful method for the visual demonstration of the phenomenon is described here but isolation has not yet been successfully accomplished."

https://openalex.org/W2081485676,"Alfalfa lipids were treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid in benzene under reflux; after saponification, chromatography of the unsaponifiable portion yielded a carotenoid having a single absorption maximum at 460 mmicro in ethanol and hexane. Its properties correspond to those of the dehydration product of lutein, 3'-hydroxy-3,4-dehydro-ss-carotene, for which the name ""anhydrolutein"" is proposed. Vitamin A depleted chicks convert this pigment to vitamin A(2), as shown by the high ratio of absorbancies at 693 and 620 mmicro in a mixture of CHCI(3) and SbCl(3). and the absorption maximum at 350 mmicro in hexane exhibited by the liver lipids. The possible role of this pigment in the biogenesis of vitamin A(2) is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2041682907,"Specific rejection of sterile orthotopic skin homografts by the fetal lamb in utero was unaccompanied by the presence of plasma cells in either the graft and its bed, or in the reactive draining lymph node. The grafts appeared not to stimulate the production of circulating immunoglobulins. The presence in the fetal circulation of rabbit anti-sheep 7S gamma-globulin and anti-beta(2M)-globulin did not inhibit the normal course of homograft rejection. These data support the contention that conventional circulating antibody is not an obligatory participant in the rejection of solid-tissue homografts."
https://openalex.org/W2046543254,"Rats were required to press a bar to activate a motor-driven wheel that forced them to run and subsequently to drink to turn off the wheel. Barpressing and lickilng increased, showing the onset and offset of running to be positively and negatively reinforcing, respectively. The experimental control of the offset of running, in contrast to the traditional control for onset only, served to demonstrate that since organisms stop such behaviors as they start, self-initiated behaviors will act as negative as well as positive reinforcers."

A Coulter cell counter is used in conjunction with a counting chamber that is fitted with a flexible polyethylene aperture (75 micro in diameter). This aperture rarely becomes blocked and appears to be self-clearing. The unit consists of a proportioning pump, a cell counter, a counting chamber, a rate meter, and a recorder."

With any of the other convulsant drugs tested, development of the convulsive pattern was independent of whether or not the cortex was stimulated. The two groups of drugs evidently have different modes of action."
