 It contained several original observations that would lead to the conclusion that the refolding of the ribonuclease molecule
 after full denaturation by reductive cleavage of its four disulfide bonds required that only one of the one hundred five possible
 pairings of eight sulfhydryl groups to form four disulfide linkages take place."

The activity was attributable to /sup 60/Co (I) to the extent of 63 and 85% of the gross ..gamma..-activity. As it is not a component of fission products, it is assumed that it was induced from an environmental precursor possibly /sup 59/Co, by the neutron flux accompanying the detonation. It was not detected in samples collected one year after the detonation; this points to an enormous concentrating capacity of Tridacna gigas."

https://openalex.org/W2005865571,"SINCE Barr and Bertram1 in 1949 described the detection of the so-called sex chromatin in intermitotic nuclei a large number of investigations has been carried out in this field. Davidson and Smith2 in 1954 showed the presence of sex-specific nuclear appendages in granulocytes of the peripheral blood. Apart from these investigations on granulocytes, the detection of a sex difference in intermitotic cells has been based on the criteria outlined by Barr and his co-workers."

https://openalex.org/W2018702672,"SYSTEMIC administration of parasiticides has been the subject of sporadic research for several decades but has only recently gained prominence in veterinary thought. Successful results have been reported with Cimex lecticularis 1,2, C. hemipterns 2, Aedes aegypti 1, Ornithodorus moubata 1, Boophilus microplus 3, Hypoderma lineatum 4,5, H. bovis 1 and Haemotobia irritans 6,7. All the foregoing insects suck blood, or come in close contact with the host's tissues or fluids. This communication describes experiments showing a powerful systemic effect against the biting louse of poultry, Eomenacanthus straminous, which has no such close contact with the host's tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4242903080,"DR. A. J. BATBMAN'S careful analysis of X-ray-induced dominant lethality in the mouse1 has yielded a sequence of mutation frequencies in successive matings which is strikingly similar to that of Drosophila, as established by me2 and Khishin3 for recessive lethals. In the mouse, as in Drosophila, successive matings of irradiated males result in an initial drop in frequency of mutation, followed by a pronounced peak, which in turn is followed by a decline to about the initial value and finally to a very much lower level. The initial drop, which in Drosophila takes place between the first and the second day, has been variously interpreted as due to a difference of sensitivity between fully mature and nearly mature spermatozoa4,5 or as recovery from genetical X-ray damage during the first 24 hr. after irradiation6,7. Both interpretations are possible for the parallel drop in the mouse which, according to a personal communication by Dr. Bateman, is entirely due to an excess of dominant lethals on the first day."
https://openalex.org/W1974457786,"Yarwood and Elmes1 observed a cyst in the retroauricular region of a native in Nigeria, containing operculated eggs having the same form as the eggs of Paragonimus. Recently, one of us discovered, in natives of the Kasai Province, four cases of cysts or abscesses, similarly situated and containing eggs resembling those of Paragonimus westermani but slightly smaller in size2. Examination of an adult worm extracted from one of these cysts showed that it did not belong to the Troglotrematidae (although it had some of the characteristics of this family) but to the Achillurbainiidae Dollfus3. At the present time this family is represented by only one genus containing one species Achillurbainia nouveli Dollfus, which was discovered in an abscess of the upper eyelid in a Malayan leopard. Our specimen has certain differences from the genus Achillurbainia and we propose to place it in a new genus and in a new species: Poikilorchis congolensis n.g., n.sp."
https://openalex.org/W1980993188,"IT has recently been shown that Sphaerotilus natans, when grown in 0.1 per cent peptone and afterwards exposed to an atmosphere of hydrogen sulphide, deposits sulphur intracellularly. Under phase contrast, there was a suggestion that the oxidation was associated with distinct granules within the cells. It has since been shown that these granules have properties attributed to mitochondria. Acting on the hypothesis that any large cell with well-defined granules would deposit sulphur intracellularly under similar conditions, several yeasts and one unidentified species of the fungus Alternaria were similarly treated."

https://openalex.org/W1986818000,"A tremendous range of physical science problems and techniques, from all branches of engineering, are involved in bioengineering instrumentation. The examples I have cited typify the problems that arise, but the techniques we have used represent only an infinitesimal fraction of the resources that we must exploit. The main challenge to the bioengineer is that of defining the problem in terms of what is useful and economically justified. One must understand the possibilities of engineering development and the probability that an effort will reach any assignable goal within a given time. Only then is it possible to work out a practical solution to the instrumentation problem. It is very easy to become so absorbed in the engineering development that we lose sight of the final goal and the purpose of the development. It is also easy, in working out an experiment, to become obsessed with the need for a particular bit of data, or of too great a degree of precision, without considering that the cost of obtaining these data might not be justified by their value to the full development. Thus, the only principles that can be generally applied to a bioengineering problem are those which would apply to making any decision that leans heavily on judgment."
https://openalex.org/W2007374532,IT is known that the actinophage destroys only those cells that possess specific sensitivity to it. Cells which survive form colonies with a changed structure of the surface and acquire a number of new physiological properties1.

Nitrosomonas seems to be more frail than most other bacteria when in pure culture, and unfortunately the majority of strains isolated during past years have been lost."
