https://openalex.org/W1602867448,"Recent investigations identified a new signal transduction pathway, termed the sphingomyelin pathway, which may mediate the action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin-1 beta (Mathias, S., Younes, A., Kan, C., Orlow, I., Joseph, C., and Kolesnick, R. N. (1993) Science 259, 519-522). This pathway is initiated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide by a neutral sphingomyelinase and stimulation of a ceramide-activated Ser/Thr protein kinase. Recent investigations demonstrated that kinase activity is proline-directed, recognizing substrates in which the phosphoacceptor site is followed by a proline residue. Until now, the kinase has been defined only as a membrane-bound activity capable of phosphorylating a peptide derived from the sequence surrounding Thr669 of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In the present studies, the kinase was quantitatively extracted from membrane with detergent and separated from protein kinase C by anion-exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. Ceramide-activated protein kinase was resolved as an exclusively membrane-bound, 97-kDa protein with a pI of 7.05. Kinase activity toward the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide co-purified with activity toward a generic proline-directed substrate, myelin basic protein. Kinase activity was reconstituted by a denaturation-renaturation procedure and demonstrated activity toward self (autophosphorylation) and exogenous substrate (myelin basic protein). Autophosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues. These activities were enhanced to 7-fold of control by ceramide and TNF alpha. These investigations provide additional evidence for a role for ceramide-activated protein kinase in signal transduction for TNF alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1509384892,"To determine the impact of enhanced apolipoprotein (apo) E secretion on the mechanism of remnant lipoprotein uptake, rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH7777) were stably transfected with normal human apoE3 or receptor binding-defective apoE-Leiden. After a 2-h incubation, the human apoE secreted from the transfected hepatocytes was 10-12 times greater than the endogenous rat apoE. The apoE3-transfected cells bound and internalized rabbit beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) to a much greater degree than did apoE-Leiden-transfected cells and nontransfected cells. The apoE3-secreting cells displayed a 2-3.5-fold enhancement of cell-associated beta-VLDL compared to either the apoE-Leiden-transfected or nontransfected cells. Fluorescently labeled beta-VLDL were observed to concentrate within intracellular granules of the apoE3-transfected cells, presumably within endosomes and lysosomes. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed that the apoE3-secreting cells displayed abundant beta-VLDL and chylomicron remnants on their cell surfaces and microvilli, in contrast to non-transfected or apoE-Leiden-secreting cells. Electron microscopy also revealed an abundance of chylomicron remnants within intracellular vesicles and multivesicular bodies of apoE3-transfected hepatocytes. Heparinase treatment (3 units/ml) completely abolished the increased association of beta-VLDL with apoE3-transfected cells but did not affect the limited association of beta-VLDL with apoE-Leiden-transfected or nontransfected cells. We established that the apoE3-enriched beta-VLDL were bound to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, as was the newly synthesized and secreted apoE3 (approximately 12% of the total secreted apoE3 was released by heparinase and suramin; 4% by heparin). In addition, reisolation of beta-VLDL by fast performance liquid chromatography after their incubation with exogenous apoE3, with medium from apoE3-secreting cells, or with the apoE3-secreting cells themselves revealed that the particles were enriched in apoE3 and displayed enhanced binding. These results suggest a secretion-capture role for apoE and indicate an important role for heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface for remnant lipoprotein metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1506733947,"We have cloned a single cDNA encoding the canalicular sulfate transporter of rat liver using Xenopus laevis oocytes as a functional expression system. The cloned cDNA sulfate anion transporter-1 (sat-1) expresses saturable Na(+)-independent sulfate uptake (Km approximately 0.14 mM) that can be inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS, IC50 = 28 microM) and oxalate, but not by succinate or cholate. These properties are very similar to sulfate uptake expressed in oocytes injected with total rat liver mRNA and to the bicarbonate/sulfate exchange system previously characterized in canalicular rat liver plasma membrane vesicles. The cloned sat-1 cDNA has a total length of 3726 base pairs (bp) with an open reading frame encompassing 2109 bp, a 5'-untranslated region of 367 bp, and a 3'-untranslated region of 1250 bp. The coding region predicts a protein of 703 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 75.4 kDa. Computer-based hydrophobicity analysis suggests the presence of 12 putative transmembrane spanning domains. Furthermore, three potential glycosylation sites are detected (Asn-158, Asn-163, Asn-587). Northern blot analysis indicates that similar sulfate anion transporters are also present in the kidney, muscle, and brain of rat and in the liver of the mouse. Using antisense oligonucleotides the mRNA-species of the sat-1 analogue in rat kidney has been characterized by hybrid depletion experiments (Markovich, D., Bissig, M., Sorribas, V., Hagenbuch, B., Meier, P. J., and Murer, H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3022-3026)."
https://openalex.org/W1491938460,"Electric tissue syntrophin, originally described as an M(r) 58,000 postsynaptic protein having homologs in mammalian muscle, was previously shown to associate with dystrophin in Triton extracts of Torpedo postsynaptic membranes. It also associates with the Torpedo M(r) 87,000 postsynaptic protein (87K), the core of which is a superdomain homologous to the cysteine-rich (CR) and COOH-terminal (CT) domains of human dystrophin. Using immunoaffinity purifications from various rat tissues and immunoblotting, we find that syntrophin associates with dystrophin, utrophin (the chromosome 6-encoded dystrophin homolog formerly known as dystrophin-related protein), multiple proteins which are cross-reactive with 87K, and two subfamilies of 71K-like proteins (CRCT-containing proteins encoded by the dystrophin gene under the control of an alternative promoter in intron 62). One 71K subfamily retains the dystrophin COOH-terminal sequence; the other has an alternative COOH-terminal sequence caused by deletion of the penultimate exon by alternative splicing. The relative masses of the members of the subfamilies suggest they arise by alternative splicing at other previously described sites within CT. These results establish that syntrophin is a general ligand for the CRCT domain in mammalian dystrophin and its homologs. They also reveal a greater diversity in 71K proteins than has previously been apparent."
https://openalex.org/W1551533354,"Purified rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro die over a period of 2-6 days in conventional serum-containing medium. As mast cells die, they become pyknotic and undergo DNA fragmentation suggestive of an apoptotic process. Treatment of in vitro mast cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) greatly retards and reduces the death of mast cells (EC50 approximately 1 nM), with no effect on mast cell proliferation. Other neurotrophins have no such effect. NGF also induces the immediate early genes c-fos and NGFI-A with a similar dose dependence. In contrast to the secretagogue activity of NGF, neither the survival-promoting effect nor immediate early gene induction requires lysophosphatidylserine. The ability of NGF to promote mast cell survival is cell density-dependent and appears to be primarily because of induction of the synthesis and/or secretion of an autocrine survival factor by stimulated mast cells. These results suggest that the previously observed effects of NGF on mast cell numbers in vivo may in part be because of enhanced survival and that NGF may be an important mediator of mast cell function in normal and pathological states."
https://openalex.org/W1593673222,"Receptor activation of phospholipase C (PLC) via G-proteins occurs by pertussis toxin-sensitive and toxin-insensitive signaling pathways. The alpha-subunits of the Gq family are presumed to mediate the toxin-insensitive pathway, but the nature of the G-proteins mediating the toxin-sensitive pathway is not established. Recently, PLC-beta has been shown to be activated by G-protein beta gamma-subunits of mixed or undefined composition. The relative activities of G-protein subunits that might activate PLC-beta were examined using defined recombinant alpha- and beta gamma-subunits obtained from the baculovirus expression system by reconstituting the purified subunits with purified bovine brain PLC-beta 1 or turkey erythrocyte PLC-beta in unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Turkey erythrocyte G alpha 11 and recombinant G alpha 11 and G alpha q obtained after expression in Sf9 cells activated both bovine brain PLC-beta 1 and turkey erythrocyte PLC-beta. In contrast, under the same assay conditions, recombinant G alpha i1, G alpha i2, G alpha i3, and G alpha o were without effect on either type of PLC. All types of beta gamma-subunits tested (r beta 1 gamma 2, r beta 1 gamma 3, r beta 2 gamma 2, r beta 2 gamma 3, bovine brain beta gamma or turkey erythrocyte beta gamma) inhibited G alpha 11-mediated activation of PLC, presumably by promotion of formation of inactive heterotrimeric G-protein. All types of beta gamma-subunits also markedly stimulated the activity of turkey erythrocyte PLC-beta but did not activate bovine brain PLC-beta 1. Of the four different beta gamma complexes of defined composition, three stimulated PLC with similar activities whereas beta 2 gamma 3 was less effective. The data suggest that pertussis toxin-sensitive activation of PLC is mediated by the beta gamma-subunits of G-proteins acting on specific phospholipase C isoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1736480315,The beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) is a membrane spanning glycoprotein. The small beta-protein domain within the precursor is presumed to be the source of amyloid found in plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The amino terminus of beta-APP is released from cells by cleavages that produce both potentially amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic fragments of the carboxyl terminus. We developed a cell free system that imposes specificity and co-localization to characterize the proteolytic activity that cleaves the precursor within the beta-protein domain. A reporter protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 105 amino acids of beta-APP provided a specific substrate for cleavage at Lys16 of the beta-protein. The protease inhibitor profile and solubility characteristics of the activity demonstrate the cleavage is produced by an integral membrane metalloendopeptidase.
https://openalex.org/W1561993052,"The effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) on the expression of its specific receptors (p55 TNF-R and p75 TNF-R) on the surface of human neutrophils (PMN) and mononuclear cells (MNC) was investigated and compared to the effect of various agonists. PMN and MNC express both p55 and p75 TNF-R on their membranes. Within minutes of incubation with chemotactic factors or calcium ionophore A23187, both types of TNF-R were down-regulated from the surface on both cell populations. At the same time, soluble forms of these TNF-R appeared in supernatants, in amounts proportional to the extent of down-regulation induced by each stimulus, suggesting that shedding is the major mechanism leading to loss of p55 and p75 TNF-R upon activation with these agonists. Likewise, TNF induced 60-80% and 73-90% decreases in PMN surface p55 TNF-R and p75 TNF-R, respectively. However, modulation of the two types of TNF-R by TNF proceeded through different mechanisms. TNF induced a selective shedding of the p75 TNF-R since, by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis, only the p75 TNF-R was detected in supernatants of cells stimulated with TNF. Down-modulation of surface p55 TNF-R most probably resulted from TNF-induced receptor internalization, since 125I-TNF bound to PMN p55 TNF-R was rapidly internalized with a t1/2 = 5 min and preincubation of PMN with TNF inhibited by 68 +/- 6% the release of p55 TNF-R triggered upon subsequent treatment with A23187. The apparently unique property of TNF to induce a differential modulation of the two types of TNF-R at the surface of PMN and MNC might play an important role in the control of peripheral blood cell responses to TNF."
https://openalex.org/W1593010743,"Melanotransferrin, also called p97, is a cell surface glycoprotein which was first described as a marker antigen for human melanoma cells. Although p97 has a striking structural similarity to human serum transferrin and lactoferrin, its function has not yet been determined. One feature that distinguishes p97 from the other members of the transferrin family is the presence of a stretch of 24 hydrophobic amino acids at the C terminus, previously assumed to form a proteinacious transmembrane domain. In this study, sensitivity to bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, biosynthetic labeling with [3H]ethanolamine, and partitioning in Triton X-114 are used to establish that p97 is expressed at the cell surface as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. In addition, to gain insight into the intracellular transport of p97, biosynthetic transport studies were performed on a melanoma cell line. These studies resulted in the identification of an additional form of p97 which is found in the medium and which likely does not originate from an alternatively spliced form of the p97 mRNA. These findings, together with our recent observation of the co-localization of p97 and the transferrin receptor in brain capillary endothelium (W. A. Jefferies, M. R. Food, R. Gabathuler, S. Rothenberger, T. Yamada, and P. L. McGeer, manuscript submitted) raise important questions about the function of the two forms of p97 detected and the possible involvement of this protein in a cellular iron uptake mechanism that is independent from the transferrin/transferrin receptor system."
https://openalex.org/W1497948052,"Cysteine-rich regions of protein kinase C (PKC) are critical for the lipid-dependent regulation of activity and are implicated in the coordination of zinc. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the second cysteine-rich region, Cys2, of PKC gamma with bound zinc with a stoichiometry of 1.8 +/- 0.1 mol of zinc/mol of protein. Deletion analysis within this cysteine-rich region defined amino acids essential for zinc coordination. An NH2-terminal histidine (His102) and a COOH-terminal cysteine (Cys151) were both critical for the coordination of distinct zinc atoms. Both represent the ultimate residues of a 50-amino acid consensus motif with six conserved cysteines and two conserved histidines present in the cysteine-rich regions of all PKC isoforms. Removal of histidine His102 abolished phorbol ester binding, while deletion of cysteine Cys151 did not. Deletion of valine (Val147) greatly diminished phorbol ester binding, which was completely lost only when valine (Val144) was also deleted. No significant further reduction in zinc stoichiometry below one resulted even when three COOH-terminal conserved cysteines (Cys151, Cys143, and Cys135) and a conserved histidine (His140) were deleted. These results are consistent with a model in which two zinc atoms are tetracoordinated per cysteine-rich region in two independent coordination spheres that are not functionally equivalent. These analyses determine a minimal peptide (residues 102-144) of 43 amino acids capable of [3H]PDBu binding."
https://openalex.org/W1574958605,"In the present study an attempt was made to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby protein kinase C (PKC) modulates the beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. Regulation of Ca2+ channel activity, [Ca2+]i, and insulin release were investigated in both normal pancreatic mouse beta-cells and in similar beta-cells deprived of PKC activity. [Ca2+]i was measured with the intracellular fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 and the Ca2+ channel activity was estimated by the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. To reveal the various isoenzymes of PKC present in the mouse beta-cell, proteins were separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting was performed. The production of inositol phosphates was measured by ion-exchange chromatography and insulin release was measured radioimmunologically. Acute stimulation with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in suppression of both the carbamylcholine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Under these conditions the increase in [Ca2+]i in response to glucose was similar to that found in control cells. When beta-cells were deprived of PKC, by exposure to 200 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 24-48 h, there was an enhanced response to carbamylcholine. This response constituted increases in both the [Ca2+]i signal and production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Interestingly, cells with down-regulated PKC activity responded more slowly to glucose stimulation, when comparing the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, than control cells. On the other hand, the maximal increase in [Ca2+]i was similar whether or not PKC was present. Moreover, PKC down-regulated cells exhibited a significant reduction of maximal whole cell Ca2+ currents, a finding that may explain the altered kinetics with regard to the [Ca2+]i increase in response to the sugar. Both the alpha and beta 1 forms of the PKC isoenzymes were present in the mouse beta-cell and were also subjected to PKC down-regulation. Hence, either of these isoenzymes or both may be involved in the modulation of phospholipase C and Ca2+ channel activity. Since insulin release under physiological conditions is critically dependent on Ca(2+)-influx through the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels, the kinetics of hormone release was expected to demonstrate a similar delay as that of the [Ca2+]i increase. Although not as pronounced, such a delay was indeed also observed in the onset of insulin release. There was, however, no effect on the total amounts of hormone released.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1535680820,"The catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is inhibited by the regulatory (R) subunit and by a thermostable inhibitor (PKI). Both inhibitors also affect the intracellular distribution of the C subunit. Whether injected into the cytoplasm or into the nucleus, free C subunit can enter and exit the nucleus freely. After 30 min its distribution is identical and is independent of the initial site of injection. In contrast, when C is injected into the cytoplasm complexed with R or PKI, the complexes are restricted to the cytoplasm (1-3). However, unlike the R subunit, which is restricted to the cytoplasm like the holoenzyme, free PKI enters the nucleus rapidly following its injection into the cytoplasm. When holoenzyme is injected directly into the nucleus, it cannot exit and return to the cytoplasm. In contrast, nuclear injection of a C.PKI complex results in the rapid exit of the C subunit from the nucleus. In equilibrated cells previously injected with the C subunit, subsequent cytoplasmic injection of either PKI or type 1 R depletes the nucleus of C although PKI does so faster, consistent with its ability to enter the nucleus. Both inhibitors block the cAMP response element-regulated gene expression. Hence PKI may serve as a nuclear scavenger of C providing a mechanism not only for inhibition but also for subcellular localization in the presence of cAMP by restricting the access of the C subunit to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1571861757,"To investigate whether negatively charged residues of the human Y1 neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor are required for ligand binding, a series of mutants were constructed in which aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues present in putative extracellular domains of the Y1 receptor were systematically replaced by alanines. The mutant cDNAs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using a vaccinia virus-derived expression system, and their ability to bind NPY was evaluated. The level of expression of mutants unable to bind NPY was also tested immunologically. In addition, the ability of the mutant proteins to be recruited to the cell surface was assessed by confocal microscopy. Substitution of aspartic acids and glutamic acids of the N-terminal first extracellular domain had no effect on binding. On the other hand, substitution of acidic residues present in the second, third, and fourth extracellular loops resulted in proteins unable to bind 125I-NPY. These results demonstrate that the extracellular loops of the human Y1 NPY receptor are essential portions of its ligand binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1508330146,"Swiss 3T3 cells contain protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes alpha, delta, epsilon and zeta (Olivier, A. R., and Parker, P. J. (1992) J. Cell. Physiol. 152, 240-244). Acute stimulation of quiescent cells with the neuropeptide bombesin decreases the mobility of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. These slower migrating forms of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon rapidly (within 1 s) and selectively are found associated with the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction. No change in the mobility or distribution of PKC-alpha or PKC-zeta is detected. Long-term treatment of cells with bombesin induces selective membrane association and down-regulation of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon (decreasing 70 and 65%, respectively). No change in the long-term distribution of PKC-alpha and PKC-zeta was detected. Bombesin did, however, increase PKC-alpha protein levels by 60% compared to control cells. PKC-zeta levels remained unchanged. Both the shift in mobility and down-regulation of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon were only induced by mitogenic doses of bombesin. The potent mitogen platelet-derived growth factor induced similar effects on the PKC isotypes delta and epsilon. PKC-alpha and PKC-zeta levels were unaffected. Repeated doses of the synthetic diglyceride 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol induced PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon down-regulation and stimulated the cells to divide. Again PKC-alpha and PKC-zeta levels were unaffected. These results show a correlation between the membrane association and down-regulation of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon and the entry of cells into S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1646809760,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter is localized in nerve terminals. It catalyzes coupled electrogenic translocation of the neurotransmitter with two or three sodium ions and one chloride ion. The transporter contains 599 amino acids and 12 putative membrane spanning alpha-helices. It is the first described member of a neurotransmitter transporter superfamily. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have investigated the role of all 10 tryptophan residues predicted to reside in these helices. All 10 have been changed to serine as well as to leucine residues. Expression of mutant cDNAs in which the tryptophans, located in positions 68, 222, and 230, are replaced by either of these two amino acids reveals that they are severely impaired in gamma-aminobutyric acid transport. Mutants in which a phenylalanine or a tyrosine residue is introduced, at either position 68 or 230, are active. On the other hand, at the 222 position replacement of the tryptophan by the aromatic amino acids results in inactive transport. After prelabeling of the proteins with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation of mutant transporters indicates that their expression levels are similar to those of the wild type. Reconstitution experiments, aimed to reveal the activity of transporter molecules not apparent in the plasma membrane, indicate that the lack of activity of the W230S transporter in intact cells is by and large due to its inefficient targeting to the plasma membrane. Tryptophan residues 68 and 222 appear to be required for the intrinsic activity of the transporter. Based on several observations, including one that tryptophan residue 222 is conserved in all amino acid transporter members of the superfamily, but not in those transporting biogenic amines, we hypothesize that the pi electrons of this tryptophan could be involved in the binding of the amino group of these neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W1524184984,"Human apolipoprotein (apo) B plays an obligatory role in the assembly and secretion of hepatic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Investigation of the truncated human apoB variants associated with hypobetalipoproteinemia has suggested that both size and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins may be reduced by carboxyl-terminal truncation. To examine the role of the carboxyl terminus of apoB in the assembly and secretion of hepatic lipoproteins, we have generated rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells that synthesize and secrete the full-length human apoB100 and the truncated forms B94, B88, B80, B72, and B60. In the resulting lipoproteins, particle density was inversely related to the logarithm of apoB length, ranging from 1.019 g/ml for apoB100 to 1.06 g/ml for B60. Furthermore, particle diameter (as determined by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis) was directly correlated with apoB length, ranging from 21.4 nm for apoB100 to 17.7 nm for B60. The relationship between apoB length and particle geometry was best defined by a linear correlation between length and core volume; a 10% decrease in apoB length resulted in an approximately 13% decrease in core volume. These observations, which are in agreement with the observations of aberrant lipoproteins in hypobetalipoproteinemia, suggest that lipid recruitment by apoB is progressively reduced by carboxyl-terminal truncation. However, pulse-chase studies indicated that carboxyl-terminal truncation did not impair apoB secretion. The recombinant human apoB forms were secreted as efficiently as endogenous rat apoB100; approximately 20% of total newly synthesized apoB72, B80, or B100 was secreted at the end of the chase. Intracellular degradation of newly synthesized apoB was observed for both the truncated human and the endogenous rat proteins. These data suggest that the low apoB levels in hypobetalipoproteinemia might not be caused by impaired secretion of the truncated apoB proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1577385687,"Cysteine-rich regions of protein kinase C (PKC) are implicated in diacylglycerol-dependent regulation of kinase activity. The second cysteine-rich region (residues 92-173) of PKC gamma was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. This fusion protein displayed high affinity phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) binding (Kd 23 nM). The phosphatidylserine dependence of PDBu binding was highly cooperative with Hill numbers (near 4.5) similar to those previously reported for PKC gamma (Burns, D. J., and Bell, R. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18330-18338). The fusion protein specifically bound 4 beta-hydroxy-PDBu but not the 4 alpha-stereoisomer. Furthermore, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) stereoselectively competed for PDBu binding. The cysteine-rich region was sufficient for association of the fusion protein to liposome preparations containing phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. Association was significantly enhanced in a stereospecific manner by the presence of PDBu as well as diC8. These results establish that a single cysteine-rich domain (residues 92-173) of PKC gamma contains regions necessary and sufficient for lipid-dependent stereospecific interactions with PDBu and diC8. Furthermore, the region is sufficient to confer translocation of a fusion protein to liposomes in a PDBu- and diC8-dependent fashion. Thus, a single cysteine-rich region of PKC gamma displays many of the properties characteristic of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1488724428,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a potent and efficacious mitogen for growth-arrested cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells, stimulating an increase in cell number at 0.3-30 nM concentration. Double-chain t-PA is as efficient as single-chain t-PA in stimulating smooth muscle cell mitogenesis, whereas single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) or u-PA and plasmin or plasminogen are ineffective. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, Pefabloc-TPA, diisopropyl fluorophosphate or alpha 1-anti-trypsin inhibit the mitogenic effect of t-PA for smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner, showing that it is dependent on the enzymatic activity. t-PA activated phosphoinositide turnover in smooth muscle cells through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway and stimulated proto-oncogene c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels. These findings indicate that t-PA stimulates vascular human smooth muscle cell proliferation and suggest for the first time that it may contribute to intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation after vascular injury as a result of angioplasty or vascular compromise during atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1608216620,"Cyclosporin A is synthesized by cyclosporin synthetase, a multienzyme polypeptide. This enzyme catalyzes at least 40 reaction steps in an assembly belt-like mechanism. It activates all constituent amino acids of cyclosporin A to thioesters via amino acyladenylates and carries out specific N-methylation reactions. During elongation, the activated amino acids are linked by peptide bonds leading to enzyme-bound nascent peptide chains. Some of the linear peptides of the growing cyclosporin A chain were isolated and their N-terminal amino acid was determined. D-Alanine at position 8 of the cyclosporin A molecule was found to be a starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process of cyclosporin A formation. Four intermediate peptides of the growing peptide chain of cyclosporin A could be isolated and identified. All of them represent partial sequences of cyclosporin A starting with D-alanine. That these intermediate peptides were bound by thioester linkage to cyclosporin synthetase could be demonstrated by liberation of the peptides with performic acid. The peptides strongly suggest the stepwise synthesis of a single linear peptide precursor of cyclosporin A."
https://openalex.org/W1535462659,"Renal proximal tubular sulfate reabsorption is mediated by brush border membrane Na+/sulfate-cotransport and basolateral Na(+)-independent sulfate transport. Injection of rat kidney cortex mRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes induced Na(+)-dependent as well as Na(+)-independent sulfate transport. The inhibition pattern of Na(+)-dependent uptake coincided with that known for the brush border membrane; the inhibition pattern of Na(+)-independent uptake suggested that this activity could be related to the basolateral cell surface. By Northern blot hybridization of size-fractionated mRNA, we provide evidence that the Na(+)-dependent uptake is induced by an mRNA species related to a recently cloned cDNA encoding rat renal cortex Na+/SO4 cotransport (NaSi-1; Markovich, D., Forgo, J., Stange, G., Biber, J., and Murer, H. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3017-3021). Hybrid depletion experiments using antisense oligonucleotides provided further evidence for the association of the expressed transport activities to NaSi-1 and sat-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1520803419,"Although several studies have been performed on the biological activities of analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2 D3) at the whole animal and cellular levels, little work has been done to analyze their transcriptional activation properties. A highly inducible 1,25-(OH)2 D3-responsive promoter composed of three copies of the mouse osteopontin vitamin D3 response element (VDRE3) inserted upstream of a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter has been constructed, and its transcriptional properties have been analyzed by transient transfection into the monkey kidney cell line COS-7 and the rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma line ROS 17/2.8. We have studied systematically transcriptional activation by a number of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 analogs, particularly those substituted at positions 16, 23, 26, and 27, sites that are targets for metabolism. Strikingly, except for derivatives that bind the 1,25-(OH)2 D3 receptor (VDR) very weakly, we find no parallel between the potency of action of a derivative as a transcriptional inducer and its affinity for the VDR. Derivatives substituted by multiple bonds at positions 16 and/or 23, although having varying affinities for the VDR, all stimulate transcription more potently than D3, in some cases at 100-fold lower concentrations. The peak transcriptional activity observed varies by only approximately 20% among different active analogs, indicating little difference in the activity of the VDR once bound to ligand. Gel retardation assays with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts suggest that the VDR binds to the mouse osteopontin VDRE predominantly as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor(s) (RXR(s)). We find that 9-cis-retinoic acid, the cognate ligand for RXRs, does not have a significant effect on the response of the VDRE3 promoter to 1,25-(OH)2 D3 or a number of its derivatives in ROS 17/2.8 or in COS-7 cells, under conditions in which promoters containing retinoid X response elements are activated. This suggests that 9-cis-retinoic acid may not act on the response to 1,25-(OH)2 D3 or its derivatives by directly influencing the transcriptional activity of VDR/RXR heterodimers. This promoter/reporter system should be useful for analyzing the tissue-specific transcriptional activity of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 and its derivatives in any cell type amenable to transient transfection."
https://openalex.org/W1521616081,"Oat arginine decarboxylase is synthesized as a 66-kDa proenzyme, but the soluble enzyme is found in oats as a complex of 42- and 24-kDa polypeptide fragments, both derived from the 66-kDa precursor. We report here that this proteolytic cleavage is the result of a processing enzyme, distinct from arginine decarboxylase itself, that leads to activation of the arginine decarboxylase. The proteolysis is resistant to a standard set of protease inhibitors, but is inhibited by high concentrations of Zn2+, as is the activation of arginine decarboxylase. Agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, as well as the arginine decarboxylase inhibitor difluoromethylarginine, each had no effect on the reaction. Oat arginine decarboxylase is thus similar to some other amino acid decarboxylases in requiring a proteolytic cleavage for activation; however, it differs in that the other examples are auto-catalytic self-processing."
https://openalex.org/W1520953975,"A Ca(2+)-calmodulin dependent histone 3 kinase was partially purified from a low salt (150 mM NaCl) nuclear extract of mouse leukemia cells by calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. In vitro, the kinase activity transferred gamma-phosphate from ATP to histone 3 to form an acid-labile and alkaline-stable linkage. Under the assay conditions 1.8 mol of phosphate are incorporated per mol of histone 3. Upon modification of arginine residues with phenylglyoxal prior to phosphorylation, a considerable decrease in the amount of phosphate transferred to histone 3 was observed. Amino acid analysis revealed that H3 was phosphorylated on arginine residues. To identify the phosphorylated peptide(s), histone 3 was cleaved with cyanogen bromide prior to phosphorylation. The phosphorylated mixture was then separated by gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography under denaturing conditions. Fragments I (N-terminal 10.3-kDa peptide) and III (C-terminal 1.7-kDa peptide) were both phosphorylated. Amino acid sequencing further revealed that the molar yields of 3 of the 4 arginines present in the phosphorylated cyanogen bromide fragment III were reduced by a factor of about 10 compared with the corresponding arginines from the unphosphorylated fragment. In the case of fragment I, 25 cycles of Edman degradation revealed that the recovery of only arginine 2 was reduced by a factor of 20. The putative phosphorylation sites are arginines 2, 128, 129, and 131. The sequence information offered an indirect evidence that these arginines were the sites of phosphorylation. The kinase described in this report represents a first member of a potentially important new class of kinases which are Ca(2+)-calmodulin dependent and which phosphorylate arginine."
https://openalex.org/W1545562191,"The recently established pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 retains the ability to secrete insulin in response to physiological glucose concentrations. To investigate the role of glucose transport and phosphorylation in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by beta-cells, MIN6 cells were stably transfected with a rabbit GLUT1 glucose transporter cDNA or a rat hexokinase I cDNA cloned in an expression vector. Overexpression of GLUT1 increased 3-O-methylglucose uptake, but did not alter either glucose utilization or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In contrast, clones overexpressing hexokinase I exhibited enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at glucose concentrations below 10 mM with a concomitant increase in glucose utilization. Maximal insulin secretion as well as the maximal rate of glucose utilization were not altered in these clones. Insulin secretion stimulated by 2-ketoisocaproate, a non-glucose secretagogue, was not affected by hexokinase I expression. These results strongly suggest that the glucose phosphorylating step, but not glucose transport step, regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by modulating the glycolytic rate in the beta-cell."
https://openalex.org/W1489461884,"The mammalian glucose transporter, GLUT1, is capable of alternating between two conformations which expose either an outward- or inward-facing ligand binding site. The possibility that these conformational changes are related to the presence of prolines and glycines in transmembrane region 10 was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Chinese hamster ovary clones which were transfected with Pro385-->Ile and Pro385-->glycine mutations of GLUT1 were shown, by Western blotting and cell surface carbohydrate labelling, to have expression levels which were comparable with the wild type. The transport activity was markedly reduced as a result of the Pro385-->isoleucine but not in the Pro385-->glycine mutation. The loss of transport activity in the Pro385-->isoleucine clone was associated with loss of labeling by the exofacial photoaffinity ligand, 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 -yloxy)-2- propylamine (ATB-BMPA), but there was no loss in labeling by the inside site-directed ligand cytochalasin B. These results suggest that the transporter cannot adopt the outward-directed conformation in the Pro385-->isoleucine clone. By contrast, the glycine substitution for proline at this position resulted in a retention of the ligand binding properties at both inside and outside sites. We suggest a putative mode of operation of the transporter which involves conformational flexibility about the prolines in transmembrane segment 10 such that helices 11 and 12 can alternately either pack against the outside (ATB-BMPA binding) site in helices 7, 8, and 9 or against the inner (cytochalasin B binding) site at the base of transmembrane segment 10."
https://openalex.org/W1523153544,"Gel retardation assays using nuclear extracts from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus-infected Sf21 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cell line revealed a host factor (polyhedrin promoter-binding protein or PPBP) that binds to the polyhedrin gene promoter. A hexanucleotide sequence (AATAAA) within the promoter is important for binding in association with neighboring elements, some of which are contributed by the sequence TAAGTATT present at the transcription start point. PPBP was affinity purified and appears to be an unusual DNA-binding protein with respect to its stability (binding was obtained at NaCl concentrations and temperatures ranging from 0.2 to 2 M and 0 to 65 degrees C, respectively), high binding affinity (binding even in the absence of nonspecific DNA) with an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 3.7 x 10(-12) M, and high specificity (binding was unaffected in the presence of a 50,000 times excess of nonspecific DNA). From UV cross-linking and Southwestern analyses the molecular mass of PPBP was estimated to be approximately 30 kDa. PPBP is phosphorylated and may have a regulatory function because dephosphorylation abolished DNA binding activity. Differences in PPBP characteristics between nuclear extracts from Sf21 and from Bm5 (Bombyx mori) cell line suggested that additional factors may be involved in the interaction of PPBP with the polyhedrin promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1543438374,"We compared the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity in undifferentiated and neutrophil-like HL60 cells. Although Ca(2+)-mobilizing P2-purinergic receptors are expressed in both cell types, arachidonic acid (AA) release stimulated by P2-purinergic agonists was 5-7-fold higher in the differentiated cells. Similarly, the stimulation of AA release by AlF4- in intact cells or by ATP and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) in electropermeabilized cells was significantly higher in the differentiated cells. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced A23187-stimulated AA release in intact HL60 granulocytes with minimal effects in the undifferentiated cells. Immunoblotting experiments showed similar levels of cPLA2 and of agonist-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in both cell types. Experiments measuring stimulation of AA release by either melittin, using endogenously labeled intact cells, or Ca2+, using homogenates and exogenous substrate, indicated that undifferentiated cells do not lack an activatable PLA2. The stimulatory effects of GTP gamma S and Ca2+ on AA release in homogenates from endogenously labeled cells suggested that undifferentiated cells display G protein-cPLA2 coupling. Basal and PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of cPLA2 was detected in differentiated, but not in undifferentiated cells. However, the two cell types displayed only subtle differences in the time courses of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase triggered by agonists and PMA. The observed defect in cPLA2 phosphorylation may represent the alteration preventing agonist-mediated stimulation of AA release in undifferentiated HL60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1544908228,"We have shown that bile acid efflux and ecto-ATPase activities are two distinct properties of a single rat liver hepatocyte canalicular membrane protein (Sippel, C. J., Suchy, F. J., Ananthanarayanan, M., and Perlmutter, D. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2083-2091). Bile acid efflux in COS cells transfected with this rat hepatocyte canalicular bile acid transport/ectoATPase cDNA is stimulated by ATP and inhibited by nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. In this study, we depleted transfected COS cells of ATP to examine whether bile acid efflux mediated by this transporter was dependent on ATP or just stimulated by ATP. We also used mutagenesis of an ATPase consensus sequence in the ectoplasmic domain to examine the relationship of ATPase activity to bile acid efflux mediated by the same polypeptide. The results indicate that bile acid transport is abrogated by ATP depletion and reconstituted by exogenous ATP in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. Introduction of mutations at amino acids Gly97 and Arg98 in the ATPase consensus sequence abrogated ATPase activity but did not affect synthesis or cell surface delivery of the transporter and did not affect its bile acid transport activity. Taken together, the data indicate that bile acid efflux mediated by the rat hepatocyte canalicular bile acid transport/ecto-ATPase protein is dependent on ATP but not on its own ATPase activity. The data, therefore, imply that 1) ATP affects its bile acid transport activity through an entirely distinct mechanism; and 2) if there is any functional relationship between the ecto-ATPase and bile acid transport properties, it is mediated indirectly through regulation of net ATP concentrations in the canalicular space by the ecto-ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1529865698,"We have previously shown that the tumor promoter okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, transcriptionally induces the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene in LLC-PK1 cells. This induction occurs independently of the protein kinase C- and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. Here we show that a sequence located 2.0 kilobases upstream of the uPA gene, which resembles an AP-1-recognition sequence, mediates the action of OA. DNA-protein interaction studies, together with mRNA and protein analyses, indicate that c-Jun, but not c-Fos, is involved in OA-dependent uPA gene induction. The appearance of high levels of uPA mRNA and DNA binding activity of c-Jun to the AP-1-like site correspond to the appearance of c-Jun accumulation, suggesting that c-Jun accumulation is a critical event in OA-dependent uPA gene induction. c-Jun protein levels increase significantly between 100 and 160 min following OA treatment, whereas c-Jun translation increases only slightly in this time frame, suggesting that post-translation mechanisms are also involved in c-Jun accumulation. Pulse-chase analyses shows that OA specifically stabilizes c-Jun. We discuss our results with respect to the possibility that protein phosphatase 2A maintains c-Jun in its down-regulated state in LLC-PK1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1601707399,"Lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), a small intestinal brush-border glycoprotein, is synthesized as a single chain precursor (pro-LPH, M(r) = 215,000-230,000) that undergoes cleavage to the final mature form (LPHm, M(r) = 160,000 in the human). In the human and pig small intestine as well as in the colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2, this cleavage takes place intracellularly prior to insertion into the brush-border membrane. To assess the role of proteolytic cleavage on the transport, function, and sorting of LPH a stable Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line was generated which expresses LPH (denoted as MDCK-ML). Biosynthetic labeling experiments demonstrated that the transport kinetics and posttranslational processing pattern of LPH in this cell line are similar to those in intestinal cells. Moreover, the enzymatic activity was found to be indistinguishable from that of brush-border LPH (LPHm). The sorting of LPH was studied by biosynthetic labeling of cells grown on filters followed by cell surface immunoprecipitation. Here, we could demonstrate that the cleaved LPHm molecule was predominantly found at the apical membrane, whereas complex glycosylated uncleaved pro-LPH (pro-LPHc) was targeted to both domains, the apical as well as the basolateral. In pulse-chase experiments at 20 degrees C pro-LPH was arrested in the trans-Golgi network, and cleavage to LPHm did not take place. By contrast, when the chase temperature was raised to 37 degrees C transport of pro-LPHc resumed, and cleavage to LPHm occurred. We conclude that the proteolytic cleavage of pro-LPHc to LPHm is a post-trans-Golgi network event and is most likely not implicated in the sorting of LPH by exposition of otherwise masked sorting elements."

https://openalex.org/W1506185475,"To characterize the transcription regulation of the POU-M1/SGF-3 gene, we have cloned a genomic DNA fragment encompassing the whole coding region and its flanking sequences. This gene does not contain any intron. The 5'-flanking region of the gene contains several interesting motifs, such as homeodomain-binding motifs, sequences resembling the transcriptional factor Sp1-binding site, and TGTTT motifs, but lacks some of the typical transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as TATA and CCAAT boxes. Transcriptional analysis of a series of deletion mutants of the gene in the nuclear extracts prepared from the middle silk gland of 2-day-old fifth instar larvae revealed the presence of multiple cis-regulatory elements located both upstream and downstream of the initiation site. One of these elements, the homeodomain-binding element, was identified to mediate negative regulation. By mobility shift assay using the POU-M1 specific antibodies, we found that this negative element interacts with the POU-M1/SGF-3. Transcription analysis in vitro using templates mutagenized in the PB region and one of the POU-M1 antibodies indicated that the PB region is an autoregulatory element responsible for SGF-3-dependent transcriptional repression."

https://openalex.org/W1517817017,"Single amino acid insertions of alanine or aspartate have been introduced into the alpha subunit of the F1F0-ATP synthase at seven different sites, after residues 187, 193, 198, 202, 212, 217, and 222. These sites span a highly conserved region of the alpha subunit, parts of which are thought to be located in transmembrane spanning regions. Alanine insertions have little or no effect on function after positions 187, 193, 198, and 202, indicating that the region spanned by these residues is not essential for function. Alanine insertions after residues 212 and 217 disrupt ATP synthase function without grossly affecting the assembly of the enzyme, while the alanine after residue 222 disrupts both ATP synthase function and assembly. All of the aspartate insertions are deleterious to ATP synthase function, except after residue 198. At the other six sites, aspartate insertions prevent growth on succinate minimal medium, indicating an inability to synthesize ATP. Aspartate insertions after residues 187 and 193 result in alpha subunits that do not fractionate with membranes, as indicated by immunoblotting. These results support a model of the alpha subunit in which residues 187-193 and residues 212-222 are part of distinct transmembrane spans, separated by a short extramembrane loop. The results are consistent with an important interaction between residues 212-222 of the alpha subunit and b or c subunits. General aspects of insertion scanning mutagenesis are also discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1512025728,"RecAc38 protein, a chimeric RecA protein of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is proficient in the renaturation from complementary single strands. However, RecAc38 protein showed a significant deficiency in promoting homologous pairing of single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA. RecAc38 protein was able to remove the secondary structure of single-stranded DNA, the first step of homologous pairing, at a slightly reduced rate. RecAc38 protein-single-stranded DNA-complex (presynaptic complex) was found to be deficient in the sequence-independent binding to double-stranded DNA which is a step in the search for the homology. On the other hand, once unwinding was initiated, RecAc38 protein was able to propagate the unwinding of the double helix at the same extent as wild-type RecA protein. These defects and the proficiency of RecAc38 protein are explained by a model showing that RecA protein has three distinct DNA strand-binding sites (a site for the primary binding to single-stranded DNA, a site for the binding to a strand of second single- or double-stranded DNA, and a site required for the binding to the other strand of the double-stranded DNA) and that RecAc38 protein has a defect in the third site."

https://openalex.org/W1494856196,"Bacterial toxins and ribosomal inhibitory proteins isolated from plants are used to prepare tumor-specific cytotoxic conjugates. The ability of these conjugates to kill tumor cells depends on binding, internalization, translocation to cytoplasm, and translation inhibition. Modulation of any one of these processes can improve cytotoxicity. Since bacterial and plant toxins act at a distinct step in translation, a combination of their activities could be more effective. Therefore, a chimeric protein was prepared by genetically fusing the coding region of the ricin A chain (RTA) and the fragment A of diphtheria toxin (DTA). The hybrid protein (RTA-DTA) expressed in bacteria retained the N-glycosidase activity of the RTA and ADP-ribosylation activity of the DTA. The hybrid toxin was more potent than the ricin A chain (11-fold) and the diphtheria toxin (50-fold) in inhibiting cell-free translation. Immunotoxin made with the hybrid toxin was about 100- and 1000-fold more effective than RTA or DTA conjugate, respectively, in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro. These results indicate that the hybrid toxin with dual activities could be useful in preparing potent immunotoxins with better anti-tumor cell activity."

These include proteins of a structural nature, which link microtubules to one another or to other cellular organelles and which may stimulate tubulin assembly. The second group, the so-called dynamic microtubule-associated proteins, move subcellular components along microtubules through nucleotidase action. In this report the effects of nucleotides on a 49-kDa protein which appears to associate with ordered arrays of microtubules within Artemia are described, revealing a protein with novel characteristics. Efficient removal of the 49-kDa protein from microtubules assembled in cell-free extracts of Artemia occurred with GTP and some analogues of ATP, nonhydrolyzable or otherwise, but not with ATP itself. The latter nucleotide had a greater impact on cross-linking when microtubules were assembled from purified tubulin. The 49-kDa protein possessed a low level of nucleotidase activity, preferring either ATP or GTP as substrate. Unlike other microtubule-associated proteins, the enzymatic activity of the 49-kDa protein was not stimulated by microtubules, at least under assay conditions in which cross-linking was disrupted by nucleotides. Immunofluorescent staining of Artemia larvae by affinity-purified antibodies indicated that the 49-kDa protein is located in mitotic spindles, midbodies, and setal cells, all regions containing organized microtubules. The 49-kDa microtubule cross-linking protein from Artemia, through its unusual response to nucleotides and its cytoplasmic location, has a unique position within the heterogeneous family of microtubule-associated proteins described to date."
https://openalex.org/W1497011504,"The structural perturbations of the amino-terminal domains of hemoglobin A resulting from the carbamino adduct formation (a reversible in vivo electrostatic modification reaction) at Val-1(alpha) and Val-1(beta) is expected to be mimicked in the derivatives of HbA reductively alkylated at its alpha-amino terminus with aldehydes containing a negatively charged functional group at their distal end (double-headed reagents). Derivatives of HbA with galacturonic acid linked through alkylamino linkage either to Val-1(alpha) or Val-1(beta) (disubstituted derivatives) as well as to both Val-1(alpha) and Val-1(beta) (tetrasubstituted derivative) have been now prepared. All the three derivatives exhibit normal cooperativity but reduced O2 affinities. The functional consequence of the modification of HbA at its amino termini with D-galacuronic acid has been compared with that of the carboxymethylation of HbA at the same sites. This comparative study suggests that the stereochemistry of the carboxylate ion introduced into beta-cleft of Hb dictates the level of reduction in the O2 affinity of the molecule seen on derivatization. However such a unique stereochemistry of the carboxylate ion of the reagent does not appear to be crucial to lower oxygen affinity when the modification is at the amino terminus of the alpha-chain. The molecular modeling studies demonstrate that the carboxylate ion of the carbamino adduct at the amino terminus of the beta-chain as well as the carboxylate of carboxymethyl group at the same site are in a geometrical orientation that favors the formation of an intrachain ionic interaction with the epsilon-amino group of Lys-82(beta). On the other hand the stereochemistry of a carboxylate ion of galacuronic acid on Val-1(beta) appears to be appropriate to form either an intrachian salt bridge with epsilon-amino group of Ly2-82(beta) of the same chain (intrachain) or alternatively an interchain salt bridge involving the epsilon-amino group of Lys-82(beta) of the trans chain. We speculate that the latter, i.e. trans configuration is favored as a result of the potential of D-galacturonic acid bound to Val-1(beta) to form an additional hydrogen bond with trans His-143(beta)."
