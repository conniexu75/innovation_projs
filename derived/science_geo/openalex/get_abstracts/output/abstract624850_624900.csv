https://openalex.org/W2906984192,"The mechanisms by which metformin (dimethylbiguanide) inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis at concentrations relevant for type 2 diabetes therapy remain debated. Two proposed mechanisms are 1) inhibition of mitochondrial Complex 1 with consequent compromised ATP and AMP homeostasis or 2) inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) and thereby attenuated transfer of reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, resulting in a raised lactate/pyruvate ratio and redox-dependent inhibition of gluconeogenesis from reduced but not oxidized substrates. Here, we show that metformin has a biphasic effect on the mitochondrial NADH/NAD redox state in mouse hepatocytes. A low cell dose of metformin (therapeutic equivalent: <2 nmol/mg) caused a more oxidized mitochondrial NADH/NAD state and an increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio, whereas a higher metformin dose (≥5 nmol/mg) caused a more reduced mitochondrial NADH/NAD state similar to Complex 1 inhibition by rotenone. The low metformin dose inhibited gluconeogenesis from both oxidized (dihydroxyacetone) and reduced (xylitol) substrates by preferential partitioning of substrate toward glycolysis by a redox-independent mechanism that is best explained by allosteric regulation at phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and/or fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) in association with a decrease in cell glycerol 3-phosphate, an inhibitor of PFK1, rather than by inhibition of transfer of reducing equivalents. We conclude that at a low pharmacological load, the metformin effects on the lactate/pyruvate ratio and glucose production are explained by attenuation of transmitochondrial electrogenic transport mechanisms with consequent compromised malate–aspartate shuttle and changes in allosteric effectors of PFK1 and FBP1.

The key to assembling this protein complex is CcmM, a multidomain protein whose C-terminal region is required for RubisCO recruitment. This CcmM region is built as a series of copies (generally 3–5) of a small domain, CcmMS, joined by unstructured linkers. CcmMS domains have weak, but significant, sequence identity to RubisCO’s small subunit, RbcS, suggesting that CcmM binds RubisCO by displacing RbcS. We report here the 1.35-Å structure of the first Thermosynechococcus elongatus CcmMS domain, revealing that it adopts a compact, well-defined structure that resembles that of RbcS. CcmMS, however, lacked key RbcS RubisCO-binding determinants, most notably an extended N-terminal loop. Nevertheless, individual CcmMS domains are able to bind RubisCO in vitro with 1.16 μm affinity. Two or four linked CcmMS domains did not exhibit dramatic increases in this affinity, implying that short, disordered linkers may frustrate successive CcmMS domains attempting to simultaneously bind a single RubisCO oligomer. Size-exclusion chromatography–coupled right-angled light scattering (SEC-RALS) and native MS experiments indicated that multiple CcmMS domains can bind a single RubisCO holoenzyme and, moreover, that RbcS is not released from these complexes. CcmMS bound equally tightly to a RubisCO variant in which the α/β domain of RbcS was deleted, suggesting that CcmMS binds RubisCO independently of its RbcS subunit. We propose that, instead, the electropositive CcmMS may bind to an extended electronegative pocket between RbcL dimers.

An unexpected sticking point for carboxysome assemblyJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 294Issue 8PreviewIn order to improve photosynthetic efficiency, bacteria often enclose RubisCO and carbonic anhydrase into microcompartments called carboxysomes. Assembly of these complexes requires a protein called CcmM. It had previously been thought that CcmM mediated RubisCO assembly by displacing one of the RubisCO subunits, Ryan et al. show that despite having a three-dimensional structure that closely resembles the RubisCO small subunit, CcmM does not dislodge it, leading to a proposal for an alternative binding location.

https://openalex.org/W2908404950,"The diaphragm is well known for its role as the principal muscle of respiration. However, according to previous studies, its role is multifactorial, from breathing through pain perception, regulation of emotional sphere, collaborating in gastroesophageal functions, facilitating the venous and lymphatic return, to an essential role in the maintenance of lumbar spine stability. The purpose of the study was to examine whether diaphragm function parameters (thickness and range of motion) are associated with static balance maintenance. A total of 142 participants were examined and divided into three groups: G1—patients qualified for lung resection due to cancer; G2 –patients after lobe resection; G3 –healthy subjects. Diaphragm thickness and excursion was measured using ultrasonography. Stabilometric parameters of balance were assessed by Zebris FDM-S platform. Greater diaphragm thickening during active breathing and diaphragm thickness fraction were associated with better static balance parameters. Limitation of diaphragm motion during quiet breathing and deep breathing was linked to balance disorders. There was no correlation between diaphragm muscle excursion during sniff maneuvers and balance parameters. Deterioration of diaphragm function observed after thoracic surgery was closely related with deterioration of balance maintenance. Impairment of diaphragm function manifested by decrease of muscle thickness and movement restriction is strongly associated with balance disorders in a clinical sample and among healthy subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2907169514,"Despite extensive evidence relating attachment dimensions to maladaptive interpersonal behaviours and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, few studies have explored social anxiety in the context of adult attachment dimensions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether attachment-related anxiety and avoidance are associated with symptoms of social anxiety and whether cognitive emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal and suppression) play a role in the relationship between adult attachment and social anxiety. A sample of 253 adults (male n = 47, 18.6%; female n = 202, 79.8%; gender not disclosed n = 4, 1.6%) ranging in age from 18 to 74 years (M = 33.12, SD = 11.56) completed an online questionnaire that consisted of the Experience in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire (ECR-R); The Inventory of Interpersonal Situations Discomfort scale (IIS-D); and The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Results indicated that both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have a direct effect on indices of social anxiety symptomology. Reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and social anxiety. However, the relationship between attachment avoidance and social anxiety was not mediated by the use of reappraisal and suppression. Findings of the study have implications for the development of clinical interventions targeting mediators of psychological distress associated with social anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2906934457,"Introduction Past research has shown relationships between stress during pregnancy, and related psychosocial health measures such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, with infant, child, and adult outcomes. However, most research is from high-income countries. We conducted a scoping review to identify research studies on prenatal stress and outcomes of the pregnancy or offspring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and to synthesize the stress measures and outcomes assessed, the findings observed, and directions for future research. Methods We searched PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO for English-language abstracts published from Jan 1960-Jan 2017. Search terms were related to stress and psychosocial health; pregnancy; infant or child development; and LMICs. Results 48 articles were identified. Sixty percent of studies were in upper-middle, 25% in lower-middle, and 15% in low income countries. Most studies used questionnaires, either existing or tailor-made, to assess stress. Eight assessed cortisol. Most studies (n = 31) assessed infant outcomes at birth, particularly gestational age or preterm birth (n = 22, 12 showing significant relationships), and birthweight (n = 21, 14 showing significant relationships). Five studies analyzed outcomes later in infancy such as temperament and motor development, all showing significant results; and nine in childhood such as behavioral development, asthma, and physical growth, with eight showing significant results. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of prenatal stress on infant and child outcomes in LMICs. Methods used in high-income countries are successfully employed in LMICs, but tailored tools remain necessary. Careful assessment of covariates is needed to foster analyses of interactive effects and pathways. Studies including longer-term follow-up should be prioritized."
https://openalex.org/W2907288761,"The role of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by the bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly understood. We compared C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)8 expression levels in the BM-MSCs of patients with AML and normal control subjects and detected significantly higher levels in the former. Furthermore, CXCL8 was up-regulated in cocultures of BM-MSCs and leukemic cell lines compared with either monoculture. CXCL8 expression was significantly higher in MSCs compared with mononuclear cells in patients with de novo AML. To elucidate the function of paracrine CXCL8 in AML, we blocked CXCL8 binding to the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor (CXCR)2 in the AML cells using SB225002. Inhibition of CXCL8/CXCR2 binding decreased proliferation in the AML cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis via decreased AKT phosphorylation. Blocking the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by a specific inhibitor induced similar apoptosis induction and lower proliferation, suggesting that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was also involved in CXCL8 action. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BM-MSCs are the main source of CXCL8 in the AML bone marrow microenvironment and promote leukemogenesis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, indicating a novel therapeutic target.-Cheng, J., Li, Y., Liu, S., Jiang, Y., Ma, J., Wan, L., Li, Q., Pang, T.

https://openalex.org/W2907681408,"Cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death throughout the world for nearly 2 decades. Hypertriglyceridemia affects more than one-third of the population in the United States and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite the frequency of hypertriglyceridemia, treatment options are primarily limited to diet and exercise. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an enzyme responsible for clearing triglycerides from circulation, and its activity alone can directly control plasma triglyceride concentrations. Therefore, LPL is a good target for triglyceride-lowering therapeutics. One approach for treating hypertriglyceridemia may be to increase the amount of enzymatically active LPL by preventing its inhibition by angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4). However, little is known about how these two proteins interact. Therefore, we used hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS to identify potential binding sites between LPL and ANGPTL4. We validated sites predicted to be located at the protein–protein interface by using chimeric variants of LPL and an LPL peptide mimetic. We found that ANGPTL4 binds LPL near the active site at the lid domain and a nearby α-helix. Lipase lid domains cover the active site to control both enzyme activation and substrate specificity. Our findings suggest that ANGPTL4 specifically inhibits LPL by binding the lid domain, which could prevent substrate catalysis at the active site. The structural details of the LPL–ANGPTL4 interaction uncovered here may inform the development of therapeutics targeted to disrupt this interaction for the management of hypertriglyceridemia.

https://openalex.org/W2906751839,"Background The polio environmental surveillance (ES) system has been an incredible tool for advancing polio eradication efforts because of its ability to highlight the spatial and temporal extent of poliovirus circulation. While ES often outperforms, or is more sensitive than AFP surveillance, the sensitivity of the ES system has not been well characterized. Fundamental uncertainty of ES site sensitivity makes it difficult to interpret results from ES, particularly negative results. Methods and findings To study ES sensitivity, we used data from Afghanistan and Pakistan to examine the probability that each ES site detected the Sabin 1, 2, or 3 components of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) as a function of virus prevalence within the same district (estimated from AFP data). Accounting for virus prevalence is essential for estimating site sensitivity because Sabin detection rates should vary with prevalence—high immediately after supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), but low in subsequent months. We found that most ES sites in Pakistan and Afghanistan are highly sensitive for detecting poliovirus relative to AFP surveillance in the same districts. For example, even when Sabin poliovirus is at low prevalence of ~0.5–3% in AFP surveillance, most ES sites have ~34–50% probability of detecting Sabin. However, there was considerable variation in ES site sensitivity and we flagged several sites for re-evaluation based on low sensitivity rankings and low wild polio virus detection rates. In these areas, adding new sites or modifying collection methods in current sites could improve sensitivity of environmental surveillance. Conclusions Relating ES detections to virus prevalence significantly improved our ability to evaluate site sensitivity compared to evaluations based solely on ES detection rates. To extend our approach to new sites and regions, we provide a preliminary framework for relating ES and AFP detection rates, and descriptions of how detection rates might relate to SIAs and natural seasonality."
https://openalex.org/W2908416597,"Schwann cells promote nerve regeneration by adaptation of a regenerative phenotype referred to as repair mediating Schwann cell. Down-regulation of myelin proteins, myelin clearance, formation of Bungner's bands, and secretion of trophic factors characterize this cell type. We have previously shown that the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist Fingolimod/FTY720P promotes the generation of this particular Schwann cell phenotype by activation of dedifferentiation markers and concomitant release of trophic factors resulting in enhanced neurite growth of dorsal root ganglion neurons. Despite its biomedical relevance, a detailed characterization of the corresponding Schwann cell secretóme is lacking, and the impact of FTY720P on enhancing neurite growth is not defined. Here, we applied a label-free quantitative mass spectrometry approach to characterize the secretomes derived from primary neonatal and adult rat Schwann cells in response to FTY720P. We identified a large proportion of secreted proteins with a high overlap between the neonatal and adult Schwann cells, which can be associated with biologic processes such as development, axon growth, and regeneration. Moreover, FTY720P-treated Schwann cells release proteins downstream of Smad signaling known to support neurite growth. Our results therefore uncover a network of trophic factors involved in glial-mediated repair of the peripheral nervous system.—Schira, J., Heinen, A., Poschmann, G., Ziegler, B., Hartung, H.-P., Stühler, K., Küry, P.

https://openalex.org/W2907314796,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi vesicle trafficking plays a pivotal role in the conventional secretory pathway of many cytokines; however, the precise release mechanism of a major inflammasome mediator, IL-1β, is not thought to follow the conventional ER-Golgi route and remains elusive. Here, we found that perturbation of ER-Golgi trafficking by brefeldin A (BFA) treatment attenuated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin-domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BFA treatment inhibited NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation but did not block IL-1β secretion from BMDMs following BFA administration after NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Consistently, short-hairpin RNA-dependent knockdown of BFA-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 1 (BIG1), a molecular target of BFA and an initiator of Golgi-specific vesicle trafficking, abolished NLRP3-dependent apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain oligomerization and caspase-1 activation in BMDMs. Similarly, knockdown of Golgi-specific BFA-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1, another target of BFA, clearly attenuated NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation in BMDMs. Mechanistically, inhibition of BIG1-mediated vesicle trafficking did not impair NLRP3-activating signal 2-promoted events, such as potassium efflux and mitochondrial rearrangement, but caused significant impairment of signal 1-triggered priming steps, including NF-κB-mediated pathways. These data suggest that BFA-targeted vesicle trafficking at the Golgi contributes to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling.-Hong, S., Hwang, I., Gim, E., Yang, J., Park, S., Yoon, S.-H., Lee, W.-W., Yu, J.-W. Brefeldin A-sensitive ER-Golgi vesicle trafficking contributes to NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2907722809,"Sodium chloride promotes vascular fibrosis, arterial hypertension, pro-inflammatory immune cell polarization and endothelial dysfunction, all of which might influence outcomes following stroke. But despite enormous translational relevance, the functional importance of sodium chloride in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke is still unclear. In the current study, we show that high-salt diet leads to significantly worse functional outcomes, increased infarct volumes, and a loss of astrocytes and cortical neurons in acute ischemic stroke. While analyzing the underlying pathologic processes, we identified the migrasome as a novel, sodium chloride-driven pathomechanism in acute ischemic stroke. The migrasome was previously described in vitro as a migrating organelle, which incorporates and dispatches cytosol of surrounding cells and plays a role in intercellular signaling, whereas a pathophysiological meaning has not been elaborated. We here confirm previously reported characteristics of the migrasome in vivo. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and proteomic analyses further demonstrate that the migrasome incorporates and dispatches cytosol of surrounding neurons following stroke. The clinical relevance of these findings is emphasized by neuropathological examinations, which detected migrasome formation in infarcted brain parenchyma of human stroke patients. In summary, we demonstrate that high-salt diet aggravates stroke outcomes, and we characterize the migrasome as a novel mechanism in acute stroke pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2906839465,"The DNA damage response relies on protein modifications to elicit physiological changes required for coping with genotoxic conditions. Besides canonical DNA damage checkpoint–mediated phosphorylation, DNA damage–induced sumoylation has recently been shown to promote genotoxin survival. Cross-talk between these two pathways exists in both yeast and human cells. In particular, sumoylation is required for optimal checkpoint function, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. To address this question, we examined the sumoylation of the first responder to DNA lesions, the ssDNA-binding protein complex replication protein A (RPA) in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We delineated the sumoylation sites of the RPA large subunit, Rfa1 on the basis of previous and new mapping data. Findings using a sumoylation-defective Rfa1 mutant suggested that Rfa1 sumoylation acts in parallel with the 9-1-1 checkpoint complex to enhance the DNA damage checkpoint response. Mechanistically, sumoylated Rfa1 fostered an interaction with a checkpoint adaptor protein, Sgs1, and contributed to checkpoint kinase activation. Our results suggest that SUMO-based modulation of a DNA damage sensor positively influences the checkpoint response."

This complex organelle stores the chromosomes and also regulates their duplication, segregation, repair, and expression through a series of specific processes. The cell's biological information is saved and transferred within the nucleus by three types of biopolymer molecules: DNA, RNA, and proteins (1Skalska L. Beltran-Nebot M. Ule J. Jenner R.G.

Proteins play crucial roles in nuclear scaffolding, DNA assembly, replication, transcription, and transport of molecules. The biological activity of proteins is directly modulated by their conformation, and changes in protein conformation are controlled mainly by post-translational modifications (PTMs). 3The abbreviations used are: PTMpost-translational modificationHMChuman mononuclear cellWGAwheat germ agglutininHRPhorseradish peroxidaseOGTGlcNAc transferasePSMpeptide spectrum matchWBWestern blottingERendoplasmic reticulumPIpropidium iodideDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleHPAH. pomatia agglutininppGalNAc-Tpolypeptide–N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferaseVVLV. villosa lectinT2ppGalNAc-T2T3ppGalNAc-T3CBBCoomassie Brilliant BluePVPpolyvinylpyrrolidoneOGO-GalNAc over-glycosylated nuclei.

Glycosylation is the most common PTM of proteins; >50% of cellular proteins are potential targets of glycosylation. Protein O-GlcNAc glycosylation (biosynthesis of O-GlcNAc glycans) occurs in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria (4Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Cycling of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine on nucleocytoplasmic proteins.Nature. 2007; 446 (17460662): 1017-102210.1038/nature05815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc is added by multiple alternatively spliced isoforms of the enzyme GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which have different intracellular localizations (5Love D.C. Kochan J. Cathey R.L. Shin S.H. Hanover J.A. Kochran J. Mitochondrial and nucleocytoplasmic targeting of O-linked GlcNAc transferase.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 (12538765): 647-65410.1242/jcs.00246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). There are three major OGT isoforms: nucleocytoplasmic OGT, short OGT, and mitochondrial OGT. Nucleocytoplasmic OGT and short OGT are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas mitochondrial OGT is present in the mitochondrial matrix. O-GlcNAcase, a glycosidase that removes O-GlcNAc from proteins, functions in a cycling fashion with OGT. OGT acts as an epigenetic “writer,” whereas O-GlcNAcase acts as an “eraser” of this PTM by modulating biological activity of relevant nuclear proteins such as histones, RNA polymerase II, and transcription factors. The O-GlcNAc PTM thus plays a crucial role in nuclear homeostasis (6Gambetta M.C. Müller J. A critical perspective of the diverse roles of O-GlcNAc transferase in chromatin.Chromosoma. 2015; 124 (25894967): 429-44210.1007/s00412-015-0513-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

The UDP-hexosamine level thus depends on Glc concentration as well as salvage pathways of GalNAc and GlcNAc. O-GlcNAc glycan biosynthesis is affected by metabolic diseases (notably diabetes) in which Glc concentration is altered (8Banerjee P.S. Lagerlöf O. Hart G.W. Roles of O-GlcNAc in chronic diseases of aging.Mol. Aspects Med. 2016; 51 (27259471): 1-1510.1016/j.mam.2016.05.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Their biosynthesis is initiated by action of a multigene family of enzyme polypeptide–N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts) promoting covalent linkage of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc donor to Ser/Thr of acceptor, yielding GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr (10Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Clausen H. Gerken T.A. Fritz T.A. Tabak L.A. Control of mucin-type O-glycosylation: a classification of the polypeptide GalNAc-transferase gene family.Glycobiology. 2012; 22 (22183981): 736-75610.1093/glycob/cwr182Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Twenty members of the ppGalNAc-T family have been found in humans. The initial step of O-GalNAc glycosylation is critical in defining the amino acid position of PTM on the protein and in facilitating subsequent monosaccharide incorporation. The second monosaccharide linked to GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr may be galactose (Gal) or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) yielding core 1 (Galβ3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) or core 3 (GlcNAcβ3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) glycan, respectively. The core structures are extended by action of specific glycosyltransferases to generate complex O-GalNAc glycans, which are synthesized mainly in Golgi (11Nilsson T. Au C.E. Bergeron J.J. Sorting out glycosylation enzymes in the Golgi apparatus.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583 (19878678): 3764-376910.1016/j.febslet.2009.10.064Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Truncated O-GalNAc glycans are commonly synthesized by epithelial tumor cells with overexpression of GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr (Tn antigen) or Galβ3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr (T antigen) residues, possibly by deletion or loss of the glycosyltransferases elongating Tn or T antigens (12Kumar S.R.

We examined O-GalNAc glycan biosynthesis in the nucleus of human cells as a PTM of nuclear proteins that may play an important role in regulating their functions. Our focus was the identification of all factors in the cell nucleus necessary for initiation of O-GalNAc glycan biosynthesis: the sugar donor substrate, the nuclear polypeptide GalNAc-transferase activity, an enzyme (polypeptide GalNAc-T3), and O-GalNAc–glycosylated proteins (the products of glycan biosynthesis). To examine nuclear localization of several molecules, we purified HeLa cell nuclei as described previously (15Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Extraction, purification and analysis of histones.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 (17545981): 1445-1445710.1038/nprot.2007.202Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Nuclei were separated from the cytoplasm of whole cells using Nonidet P-40 detergent in appropriate buffer and by centrifugation. Purified nuclei were obtained by several washes with buffer without detergent (Fig. 1), placed in hypertonic buffer, and sonicated for disruption of nuclear membrane, and the soluble nuclear fraction (nucleoplasm) was obtained by centrifugation. Quality of purified nuclei was evaluated by confocal microscopy and Western blotting (WB) with molecular markers of cellular organelles: Golgin97 (Golgi), calreticulin (ER), tubulin (cytoplasm), and histone H3 (nucleus). Each of these methods revealed high levels of nuclear markers (PI and histone) in purified nuclei or nucleoplasm but minimal levels of cytoplasm, Golgi, and ER markers. This finding indicated that the method used for purification of nuclei was appropriate. Biosynthesis of nucleotide sugars such as UDP-GalNAc occurs in the cytoplasm (16Varki A. Esko J.D. Colley K.J. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009: 37-46Google Scholar). UDP-GalNAc is the sugar donor substrate required for ppGalNAc-T reaction. To examine the presence of this sugar donor in the nucleus, we developed an enzymatic assay for measurement of UDP-GalNAc substrate, in which the standard curve showed an appropriate linear concentration range (Fig. S1A). High specificity of this enzymatic method for UDP-GalNAc was demonstrated by comparison with UDP-GlcNAc, which was found not to participate in the reaction. UDP-GalNAc level was next measured in various subcellular fractions of HeLa cells (Table 1). UDP-GalNAc concentration was very different in the nucleoplasm (0.330 μm) than in the last nuclear wash (0.015 μm), confirming the presence of this sugar nucleotide in the nucleus.Table 1Measurement of UDP-GalNAc donor substrate in HeLa subcellular fractionsSubcellular fractionUDP-GalNAcμmCytoplasm24 ± 2.7Final nuclear wash0.015 ± 0.005Nucleoplasm0.330 ± 0.052Final nuclear wash (nuclei + UDP-GalNAc)0.060 ± 0.009Nucleoplasm (nuclei + UDP-GalNAc)0.510 ± 0.091 Open table in a new tab To examine transport of UDP-GalNAc through the nuclear membrane, we added UDP-GalNAc to purified nuclei and measured the amount that passed inside. A substantial concentration (0.510 μm) of UDP-GalNAc was found in the nucleoplasm, reflecting the ability of this sugar nucleotide to enter the nucleus (Table 1). To evaluate ppGalNAc-T activity in the nucleus, terminal glycans (products of each enzymatic reaction) were detected using various labeled lectins as probes, and specificities of biotinylated lectins were confirmed (Fig. S1, B–D). Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) and Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) recognized terminal αGalNAc residues but not βGlcNAc residues, whereas wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) primarily recognized terminal βGlcNAc residues. We assayed ppGalNAc-T activity in subcellular fractions of HeLa (human cervix), MCF7 (human breast), T47D (human mammary gland), HEK-293 (human kidney), Vero (monkey kidney) cell lines, and human mononuclear cells (HMC) using naked MUC1 and MUC2 as acceptor substrates and excessive UDP-GalNAc as donor substrate. The enzymatic product, αGalNAc residues, was evaluated using the VVL probe, and ppGalNAc-T activity was determined by extrapolation from the standard curve of purified MUC1αGalNAc (Fig. S1C). ppGalNAc-T activity was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of analyzed cells (Table 2), whereas catalytic activity was not observed in the last nuclear wash fraction. Important ppGalNAc-T activity was detected in all analyzed nucleoplasms, reflecting the enzyme’s capacity for O-GalNAc glycosylation of naked mucins.Table 2Measurement of ppGalNAc-T activity in subcellular fractions of different cells using MUC1 and MUC2 peptides as acceptor substrateppGalNAc-T activity (mean ± S.D. error)TotalaTotal ppGalNAc-T activity present in cytoplasm/final nuclear wash/nucleoplasm from 107 cells.

Open table in a new tab ppGalNAc-T activity was next evaluated in the intact nuclei of HeLa cells. Purified nuclei were incubated with added UDP-GalNAc for 1 h at 37 °C, and the yielded glycans were detected by WB and confocal microscopy using labeled lectins. Increased numbers of terminal α-linked GalNAc residues in multiple nuclear proteins were demonstrated by WB with HPA (Fig. 2A). Terminal α-linkage of GalNAc to proteins was demonstrated using α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (αGalNAc glycosidase). Purified nuclei previously incubated with UDP-GalNAc (OG nuclei) were washed, sonicated for nuclear membrane disruption, and incubated without or with αGalNAc glycosidase. The number of GalNAc residues in glycosylated nuclear proteins was greatly reduced in the presence of αGalNAc glycosidase, indicating that terminal GalNAc was α-anomeric. The findings that intact nuclei display GalNAc-T activity to glycosylate nuclear proteins and that this process is reversed by αGalNAc glycosidase indicate the capacity of nuclei for αGalNAc glycoprotein biosynthesis. A comparison of the effects of UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc preincubation on glycosylation capacity of intact nuclei is shown in Fig. 2B. Labeled VVL recognized an increased level of terminal O-GalNAc glycans when purified nuclei were added with UDP-GalNAc, whereas UDP-GlcNAc addition was not recognized by VVL. When nuclei were added with UDP-GalNAc, WB analysis with detection by WGA did not recognize an increase in O-glycosylation level. These findings indicate a clear distinction between initiation of O-GalNAc versus O-GlcNAc glycosylation of proteins in purified nuclei. We examined O-GalNAc glycosylation inside the nucleus by confocal microscopy of purified intact nuclei of HeLa cells. Constitutive O-GalNAc residues in these nuclei are shown using VVL (Fig. 3A), as well as HPA and anti-Tn antibody (Fig. S2) (top). The interaction of VVL with constitutive O-GalNAc residues of intact nuclei was inhibited in the presence of GalNAc (Fig. S3). Incubation of nuclei with added UDP-GalNAc enhanced the product of O-GalNAc glycosylation (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2, bottom). Z-stacks of purified nuclei showed that in both situations (constitutive glycosylation and GalNAc over-glycosylation), O-GalNAc residues were present in the nucleus, indicating the occurrence of O-GalNAc glycosylation within the nucleus. We next used fluorescence confocal imaging to quantify levels of O-GalNAc residues following O-GalNAc over-glycosylation of purified nuclei. Representative images of measured nuclei and OG nuclei, stained with VVL and PI, are shown in Fig. 3B. Levels of terminal αGalNAc residues per nucleus were evaluated. Over-glycosylated O-GalNAc resulted in a 4.7-fold (638.9/135.4) increase of O-GalNAc residues in purified nuclei (Fig. 3C), indicating that nuclear GalNAc-T activity produced a significant increase of O-GalNAc glycosylation. Finally, we studied ppGalNAc-T nuclear activity in intact CHO ldlD cells. This cell line lacks a functional UDP-Gal-4-epimerase and therefore relies on GalNAc salvaged from the medium for the synthesis of UDP-GalNAc. CHO ldlD cells were grown in media supplemented without (−GalNAc) or with (+GalNAc) GalNAc, and the yielded glycans were detected by confocal microscopy using labeled lectins (Fig. 4). Incubation of cells with GalNAc in growing media enhanced the product of O-GalNAc glycosylation (Fig. 4A), resulting in a 5.8-fold increase in nuclear signal in +GalNAc CHO ldlD cells (Fig. 4B). The subcellular distribution of terminal GalNAc in the cells reveals that a high portion of the signal coincides with the nuclear marker DAPI (Fig. 4C), indicating nuclear ppGalNAc-T activity in intact cells. GalNAc-Ts are localized mainly in the Golgi; however, a few ppGalNAc-T isoforms have been reported in other locations, e.g. ER (17Gill D.J. Tham K.M. Chia J. Wang S.C. Steentoft C. Clausen H. Bard-Chapeau E.A. Bard F.A. Initiation of GalNAc-type O-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum promotes cancer cell invasiveness.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23912186): E3152-E316110.1073/pnas.1305269110Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We examined subcellular localization of isoforms ppGalNAc-T2 (T2) and ppGalNAc-T3 (T3), with emphasis on T3. Fluorescence microscopy assays with anti-human T2 and T3 antibodies was performed to study subcellular localization of these isoforms in HeLa, MCF-7, T47D, SK-N-AS, HEK-293, MRC-5, Vero, and HMC cells (Fig. S4). T2 showed a characteristic Golgi staining pattern in these cells (Fig. S4A). T3 showed a nuclear staining pattern (overlap with nuclear marker DAPI) in HeLa, MCF7, SK-N-AS, HEK-293, MRC-5, Vero, and HMC, but not T47D. Distribution of T3 coincided mainly with the nuclei, whereas T2 showed a Golgi distribution. Evidence for the specificity of anti-T3 antibody was provided by WB and competitive immunofluorescence assay using purified soluble T3. Recombinant human soluble T3 was expressed in insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography. We demonstrated the purity of T3 by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining, which revealed a protein of appropriate molecular mass (72 kDa) (Fig. S4B). Anti-T3 antibody, on WB, recognized a protein with corresponding molecular weight. This antibody also recognized a unique protein with molecular weight corresponding to that of T3 in HeLa cell homogenate. In competitive immunofluorescence assay, recognition of T3 by the antibody in HeLa cells was inhibited by the presence of purified soluble T3 (Fig. S4C). The presence of soluble T3 strongly reduced both the dot-shaped nuclear pattern and the Golgi staining pattern of T3, indicating the ability of antibody to specifically recognize endogenous T3 in HeLa cells. T3 nuclear distribution was analyzed by confocal microscopy in purified nuclei, compared with whole HeLa cells (Fig. 5). Delimitation of the nucleus was detected by staining of nucleic acids with PI, and T3 was detected with anti-T3 antibody. Purification of nuclei removed T3 localized in Golgi but conserved nuclear T3, as observed in many purified nuclei (Fig. 5A). Co-localization of T3 with PI was observed in zoomed regions of whole-cell nuclei and purified nuclei. Orthogonal views (x, y and x, z views) of nuclear Z-stacks reveal co-localization of T3 with PI through the Z planes (Fig. 5B), confirming localization of T3 inside the nucleus of HeLa cells. Proteins with O-GalNAc glycans were identified using a combination of affinity chromatography of immobilized VVL to select O-GalNAc glycoproteins and MS for protein identification. Nucleoplasm from purified nuclei (constitutive O-GalNAc glycosylated nuclear proteins) and nucleoplasm from OG nuclei of HeLa cells were analyzed. Each nucleoplasm was divided into two equal parts: one part was loaded onto streptavidin–agarose column (−VVL column) to identify unspecific adsorption, and the other part was loaded onto VVL-biotin/streptavidin–agarose column (+VVL column) to retain O-GalNAc–glycosylated proteins. Differences of retained proteins between the +VVL and −VVL column were evaluated by SDS-PAGE with colloidal CBB staining (Fig. S5). Proteins from gel bands were digested, and peptides were identified by MS. The criterion for the presence of O-GalNAc glycans on proteins was the identification of ≥2 high-quality peptides per protein, and peptide spectrum matches (PSM) ratio ≥3 (see “Experimental procedures”). Identified O-GalNAc–glycosylated proteins in order of decreasing PSM ratio, their subcellular localization, and main protein function according to UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org), 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. are listed in Table 3. Two proteins were identified as endogenously O-GalNAc–glycosylated in the nucleoplasm: 40S ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and S3 (RPS3) (Table 3A). They are both localized in nuclei, according to UniProt. Twenty five glycoproteins were detected in OG nucleoplasm, indicating the predominance of nuclear localization in this group (Table 3B). PSM ratios of RPS6 and RPS3 were 4 and 3, respectively; in contrast, some proteins in the OG nucleoplasm group had much higher PSM ratios (30 in the case of prelamin-A/C). These findings suggest a direct correlation between O-GalNAc over-glycosylation, major glycoprotein retention by +VVL column, and increased PSM ratio of proteins in the nucleoplasm. Incubation of purified intact nuclei with UDP-GalNAc led to detection of OG proteins localized predominantly in the nucleus, indicating that O-GalNAc glycosylation occurs inside the nucleus. The identified nuclear proteins with the highest O-GalNAc glycosylation levels were prelamin-A/C (PSM ratio = 30) and lamin B1 (LMNB1) (PSM ratio = 22). We therefore examined nuclear O-GalNAc glycosylation of lamins in more detail.Table 3Identification of O-GalNAc glycosylated proteins from HeLa cell nucleoplasmPSM ratioAccession no.NameSubcellular localizationFunctionA.

https://openalex.org/W2907427527,"Fibrosis is characterized by the increased accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), which drives abnormal cell proliferation and progressive organ dysfunction in many inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Studies have shown that halofuginone, a racemic halogenated derivative, inhibits glutamyl-prolyl-transfer RNA-synthetase (EPRS)-mediated fibrosis. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. We explored the mechanistic aspects of how EPRS could develop liver fibrotic phenotypes in cells and animal models. Treatment with TGF-β1 up-regulated fibronectin and collagen I levels in LX2 hepatic stellate cells. This effect was inhibited in prolyl-transfer RNA synthetase (PRS)-suppressed LX2 cells. Using the promoter luciferase assay, TGF-β1–mediated collagen I, α1 chain transcription and γ2 basal laminin transcription in LX2 cells were down-regulated by EPRS suppression, suggesting that EPRS may play roles in ECM production at transcriptional levels. Furthermore, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling activation was involved in the effects of TGF-β1 on ECM expression in a PRS-dependent manner. This was mediated via a protein-protein complex formation consisting of TGF-β1 receptor, EPRS, Janus kinases, and STAT6. Additionally, ECM expression in fibrotic livers overlapped with EPRS expression along fibrotic septa regions and was positively correlated with STAT6 activation in carbon tetrachloride-treated mice. This was less obvious in livers of Eprs−/+ mice. These findings suggest that, during fibrosis development, EPRS plays roles in nontranslational processes of ECM expression via intracellular signaling regulation upon TGF-β1 stimulation.—Song, D.-G., Kim, D., Jung, J.

These include changes known as HIV-associated neurodegenerative disorder (HAND), leading to the loss of neuronal functions, including synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP). Several mechanisms have been proposed for HAND, including direct effects of viral proteins such as the Tat protein. Searching for the mechanisms involved, we found here that HIV-1 Tat inhibits E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3), CAMP-responsive element–binding protein (CREB), and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) by up-regulating the microRNA miR-34a. These changes rendered murine neurons dysfunctional by promoting neurite retraction, and we also demonstrate that E2F3 is a specific target of miR-34a. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of an E2F3-binding site within the CREB promoter, which we validated with ChIP and transient transfection assays. Of note, luciferase reporter assays revealed that E2F3 up-regulates CREB expression and that Tat interferes with this up-regulation. Further, we show that miR-34a inhibition or E2F3 overexpression neutralizes Tat's effects and restores normal distribution of the synaptic protein synaptophysin, confirming that Tat alters these factors, leading to neurite retraction inhibition.

This event was observed even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapies. Neurite retraction is the result of secondary complications such as HIV-associated dementia, mild neurocognitive disorder, and asymptomatic neurocognitive impermanent, with HIV-associated dementia being the most severe and asymptomatic neurocognitive impermanent being asymptomatic but with pronounced physiological changes in the central nervous system (3Valcour V.G.

The exact molecular mechanisms leading to neurite retraction are not fully understood. Several reports indicated that HIV-infected macrophages and microglia produce neurotoxins (e.g. viral proteins) that have the ability to cause neuronal deregulation. Tat is among the released viral proteins that have been considered to be deleterious to neurons; however, the mechanisms used by Tat to cause neurodegeneration remain unclear (4Mayne M. Holden C.P. Nath A. Geiger J.D. Release of calcium from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-regulated stores by HIV-1 Tat regulates TNF-α production in human macrophages.J.

The transactivator regulatory (Tat) protein has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the neurocognitive deficits associated with HIV infection (6Li W. Li G. Steiner J. Nath A. Role of Tat protein in HIV neuropathogenesis.Neurotox. Res. 2009; 16 (19526283): 205-22010.1007/s12640-009-9047-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This is the earliest protein to be produced by the proviral DNA in the infected cell. The protein not only drives the regulatory regions of the virus but may also be actively released from infected astrocytes and microglia cells and interacts with the cell surface receptors of neighboring uninfected neuronal cells in the brain, leading to cellular dysfunction. It may also be taken up by these cells (7Ensoli B. Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Fiorelli V. Gendelman R. Morgan R.A. Wingfield P. Gallo R.C.

Additionally, Tat production is not impacted by the use of antiretroviral drugs once the proviral DNA has been integrated within the host cell genome. In adult animals, Tat affects pre-attentive processes and spatial memory. Tat-transgenic model are marked by glial cell activation and neuronal loss (11Fitting S. Booze R.M. Mactutus C.F.

In animals, Tat causes loss of selective populations of neurons in vitro and in vivo (12Kim B.O. Liu Y. Ruan Y. Xu Z.C. Schantz L. He J.J.

Regions particularly susceptible to Tat neurotoxicity include the striatum, the dentate gyrus, and the CA3 region of the hippocampus (13Hayman M. Arbuthnott G. Harkiss G. Brace H. Filippi P.

Further, neuropathological studies from patients with HIV infection show a preferential loss of neurons in the dentate gyrus and striatum (15Cheng J. Nath A. Knudsen B. Hochman S. Geiger J.D. Ma M.

Tat also depolarizes the neuronal cell membrane when applied extracellularly to outside-out membrane patches providing strong evidence for direct excitation of neurons on the cell surface. Tat induces dramatic increases in levels of intracellular Ca2+ in neurons followed by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, generation of ROS, activation of caspases, and eventually neuronal deregulation. These include alteration of synaptic plasticity and suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP), 4The abbreviations used are: LTPlong-term potentiationCREBCAMP-responsive element–binding proteinBDNFbrain-derived neurotropic factorANOVAanalysis of varianceRFPred fluorescent proteinqPCRquantitative PCRHIVEHIV-1–infected patient with signs of encephalitisH3K9histone H3 Lys-9DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseMOImultiplicity of infectionDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleLucluciferase. leading to premature brain aging.

We recently demonstrated that neuronal deregulation in Tat-treated cells is microRNA-dependent (5Chang J.R. Mukerjee R. Bagashev A. Del Valle L. Chabrashvili T. Hawkins B.J. He J.J. Sawaya B.E. HIV-1 Tat protein promotes neuronal dysfunction through disruption of microRNAs.J. Biol.

Using human neuron cells, we showed that Tat up-regulates the expression of miR-34a and down-regulates the expression levels of CREB and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) proteins; both factors play a key role in LTP (16Kida S. A functional role for CREB as a positive regulator of memory formation and LTP.Exp. Neurobiol. 2012; 21 (23319873): 136-14010.5607/en.2012.21.4.136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhao Y.-N. Li W.-F. Li F. Zhang Z. Dai Y.-D. Xu A.-L. Qi C. Gao J.-M. Gao J. Resveratrol improves learning and memory in normally aged mice through microRNA-CREB pathway.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 435 (23685142): 597-60210.1016/j.bbrc.2013.05.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been shown that the expression pattern of BDNF, a direct transcriptional target of CREB, has been altered not only in HIV mouse model and HIV-associated neurodegenerative disorder (HAND) human brain sections postmortem, but in other neurological paradigms as well, which shows the fundamental significance of this pathway in neuronal cell survival and LTP (18Edelmann E. Lessmann V. Brigadski T. Pre- and postsynaptic twists in BDNF secretion and action in synaptic plasticity.Neuropharmacology. 2014; 76 (23791959): 610-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, neither protein (CREB or BDNF) is a direct target of miR-34a, which points to the existence of an intermediate transcription factor that is under the direct regulation of miRNA-34a and is a positive regulator of CREB. This could also mean that Tat decreases expression levels of these two proteins through an alternative mechanism that yet remains to be determined. Here, we showed that Tat is using miR-34a and its downstream target E2F3 to inhibit CREB and BDNF protein functions. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that E2F3 protein is a positive regulator of the CREB promoter. Remarkably, this functional interplay between Tat, miR-34a, and E2F3 was enough to cause alteration of synaptophysin distribution, leading to neurite retraction and eventually to LTP inhibition. HIV-1 Tat protein has been shown to be associated with neuronal dysfunction; however, the exact mechanisms involved are not fully understood. In this regard, we previously demonstrated the ability of Tat to induce changes in miRNA expression in neuronal cells leading to the deregulation of expression levels of several cell factors implicated in LTP and long-term depression, such as CREB and BDNF. Here, we aimed to decipher the mechanisms leading to neurite retraction by focusing on the CREB-BDNF pathway. First, we assessed the effect of extracellular Tat on intracellular calcium secretion. Human neuronal cells, SH-SY5Y (1 × 105), grown in serum-free medium, were treated with 10 nm (final concentration) recombinant Tat protein for 30 min. The cells were incubated with Fluo-3, and intracellular calcium was measured every 3 s using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A). Within seconds, Tat addition led to a dramatic increase of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]. A montage of calcium increase is displayed in Fig. 1B. It has been shown that calcium is involved in many intracellular and extracellular process such as synaptic plasticity and cell-to-cell communication (19Marambaud P. Dreses-Werringloer U. Vingtdeux V. Calcium signaling in neurodegeneration.Mol. Neurodegener. 2009; 4 (19419557): 2010.1186/1750-1326-4-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Further, calcium channel antagonists have been shown to play a role in preventing neuronal damage (20Lipton S.A. HIV-related neuronal injury. Potential therapeutic intervention with calcium channel antagonists and NMDA antagonists.Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 8 (7999315): 181-19610.1007/BF02780669Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Lipton S.A. Neuronal injury associated with HIV-1 and potential treatment with calcium-channel and NMDA antagonists.Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16 (7705221): 145-15110.1159/000112101Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Tat-induced [Ca2+] can lead to neurite damage. We recorded in a live cell setting the ability of the cells to branch out and to communicate with other neurons. This was followed by measurements of the actual surface area covered by SH-SY5Y cells that were seeded in duplicate (mock untreated or treated with Tat) in ~40% confluences in differentiating medium. The cells were monitored for 20 h prior to the addition of 10 ng/ml recombinant Tat protein and then monitored for an additional 12 h. Automatic bright field contrast–snap shot images were taken every 30 min to evaluate the status of neurite outgrowth progression. As shown in Fig. 1C, measurement of the covered area revealed that the addition of Tat resulted in neurite retraction and a decrease of the covered area that lasted until the 32nd hour followed by a modest recovery when compared with the mock untreated. Similarly, using primary mouse neurons isolated from the hippocampal area of embryonic day 18 pups, we showed that the addition of Tat protein led to neurite retraction when compared with the mock untreated neurons (Fig. 1D). The experiments in C and D were repeated three times each, and the results were analyzed using an ANOVA test (p < 0.05 and 0.001, respectively). These results provided the rationale to examine the functional impact of this deregulation on neurite stability. It has been shown that synaptogenesis and the stability of synapses are key players for proper neuronal function, signal transfer and LTP (22Li H. Zhong X. Chau K.F. Williams E.C. Chang Q. Loss of activity-induced phosphorylation of MeCP2 enhances synaptogenesis, LTP and spatial memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 (21765426): 1001-100810.1038/nn.2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempt to visualize and quantify the synaptic formation. Using the Cell Light transduction system (Life Technologies, Inc.), we transduced an RFP-tagged synaptophysin (MOI 5) into primary mouse neurons (mock and/or treated with Tat). Synaptophysin visualization is used as a marker for synaptic structures (23Dailey M.E. Buchanan J. Bergles D.E. Smith S.J. Mossy fiber growth and synaptogenesis in rat slices in vitro.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14 (8120613): 1060-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, there were significantly fewer synaptophysin puncta (red), corresponding to synaptic endings, in Tat-treated mouse neurons compared with mock treatment. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Additionally, a clear and obvious morphological change was observed in cells treated with Tat when compared with the mock untreated. Quantification of the positive puncta revealed a significant decrease at 24 h after Tat treatment (Fig. 2B) without affecting the size of the synaptic vesicles (Fig. 1C). To further confirm this observation, we examined the status of Reelin protein (RELN) in Tat-treated cells. Reelin is a protein that regulates dendrite growth and controls cell-to-cell interactions during development (24Dijkhuizen P.A. Ghosh A. BDNF regulates primary dendrite formation in cortical neurons via the PI3-kinase and MAP kinase signaling pathways.J. Neurobiol. 2005; 62 (15514998): 278-28810.1002/neu.20100Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In adult brain, Reelin modulates synaptic plasticity by enhancing the induction of the LTP (25Weeber E.J. Beffert U. Jones C. Christian J.M. Forster E. Sweatt J.D. Herz J. Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (12167620): 39944-3995210.1074/jbc.M205147200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Reelin loss or inhibition was shown to be associated with other diseases, such as schizophrenia (26Impagnatiello F. Guidotti A.R. Pesold C. Dwivedi Y. Caruncho H. Pisu M.G. Uzunov D.P. Smalheiser N.R. Davis J.M. Pandey G.N. Pappas G.D. Tueting P. Sharma R.P. Costa E. A decrease of reelin expression as a putative vulnerability factor in schizophrenia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95 (9861036): 15718-1572310.1073/pnas.95.26.15718Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the expression of Reelin in Tat-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Twenty-four hours post-treatment, RNA was collected and subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR). As shown in Fig. 2D, the addition of Tat decreases the level of Reelin by almost 50% when compared with the mock untreated. These results confirmed our observation and hypothesis regarding the ability of Tat to cause neurite retraction. Neurite elongation is normally associated with activation and accumulation of the cytoskeleton component tubulin, and neurotropic factors, such as BDNF protein (27Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Neurotrophins: roles in neuronal development and function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24 (11520916): 677-73610.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.677Crossref PubMed Scopus (3333) Google Scholar). Further, it has been shown that neuronal development and regulation of LTP and LDP depend on the functions of several transcription factors, such as BDNF and CREB proteins (28Sakamoto K. Karelina K. Obrietan K. CREB: a multifaceted regulator of neuronal plasticity and protection.J. Neurochem. 2011; 116 (21044077): 1-910.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.07080.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Note that BDNF is a downstream target of CREB with multiple alternative transcription start sites, which are ultimately spliced to a single functional mature BDNF protein, and that exons I and IV of BDNF gene are transcriptional targets of CREB protein (29Kwon M. Fernández J.R. Zegarek G.F. Lo S.B. Firestein B.L. BDNF-promoted increases in proximal dendrites occur via CREB-dependent transcriptional regulation of cypin.J.

Appleyard S.M. Impey S. Wayman G.A. A genome-wide screen of CREB occupancy identifies the RhoA inhibitors Par6C and Rnd3 as regulators of BDNF-induced synaptogenesis.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (23762244)e6465810.1371/journal.pone.0064658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These observations gave us the rationale to further study the impact of Tat on neuronal functions. Using qPCR, we examined expression levels of BDNF transcripts in Tat-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that only exon IV, but not exon I, of the BDNF gene produced a transcript (Fig. 2E). As expected, BDNF-IV level decreases in Tat-treated cells at 24 h; however, it recovers at 48 h, which could be due to the half-life of Tat protein. These results agree with the axonal surface assay presented in Fig. 1C. Next, we examined the level of CREB mRNA and protein in differentiated and treated SH-SY5Y cells. Similar to BDNF, the CREB level decreases in Tat-treated cells at 24 h and recovers at 48 h (Fig. 2F); however, CREB protein expression did not recover at 48 h as obtained by a Western blotting assay (Fig. 2G). Additionally, CREB protein depends on its ability to bind to the DNA (the promoter of the host gene) and not its increase/decrease in protein expression. CREB binding is ensured by the phosphorylation of its Ser-133 residue (31Shaywitz A.J. Dove S.L. Kornhauser J.M. Hochschild A. Greenberg M.E. Magnitude of the CREB-dependent transcriptional response is determined by the strength of the interaction between the kinase-inducible domain of CREB and the KIX domain of CREB-binding protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (11094091): 9409-942210.1128/MCB.20.24.9409-9422.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether the addition of HIV-1 and/or Tat protein affects CREB phosphorylation. Using a primary human culture of astrocytes, the cells were either infected with HIV-1 JR-FL strain for 10 days or treated with Tat protein for 48 h. The cells were collected, and the extracts were collected, where 50 μg of proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-CREB (total or phosphorylated Ser-133) and anti-GAPDH antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2H, infection of cells with HIV-1JRFL or the addition of Tat protein led to a decrease in expression of total and/or phosphorylated CREB protein. Taken together, these results suggest that Tat protein can promote neurite retraction through reduction of CREB and BDNF expression levels. Because it is a downstream target of CREB protein, it is normal to observe a reduction in BDNF level if CREB is inhibited. However, one may question the mechanisms involved in CREB inhibition. In this regard, we previously demonstrated that up-regulation of miR-34a in Tat-treated SH-SY5Y leads to the inhibition of CREB mRNA and protein (5Chang J.R. Mukerjee R. Bagashev A. Del Valle L. Chabrashvili T. Hawkins B.J. He J.J. Sawaya B.E. HIV-1 Tat protein promotes neuronal dysfunction through disruption of microRNAs.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21956116): 41125-4113410.1074/jbc.M111.268466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is well-known that miRNAs exhibit their function through partial complementary sequences located at the 3′-UTR of their target's mRNA. Those sequences are commonly referred to as seeds, and if miR-34a affects CREB expression, then it is logical for CREB 3′-UTR to contain miR-34a seeds. Unfortunately, neither bioinformatics analysis of the CREB 3′-UTR mRNA nor a literature search revealed or described such a site that could support our hypothesis. Hence, we suspected the presence of an intermediate factor(s). To that end, we performed a CREB promoter analysis using ECR Browser for transcription factor–binding sites. The analysis displayed three highly conservative binding sites for Sp1, Egr, and E2F3 transcription factors (Fig. 3A). Sp1 binding to the CREB promoter was described previously (32Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Expression of the gene encoding transcription factor cyclin adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB): regulation by follicle-stimulating hormone-induced cAMP signaling in primary rat Sertoli cells.Endocrinology. 1995; 136 (7628390): 3534-354510.1210/endo.136.8.7628390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas EGR and E2F3 putative binding sites were only predicted. Further, TargetScan analysis of the 3′-UTR of the three transcription factors (Sp1, Egr, and E2F3) revealed that only E2F3 contains seed for miR-34a (Fig. 3B, yellow box). Furthermore, E2F3 has been shown to be a direct target of miR-34a, and the functional relationship between E2F3 and miR-34a has been established (33Welch C. Chen Y. Stallings R.L. MicroRNA-34a functions as a potential tumor suppressor by inducing apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (17297439): 5017-502210.1038/sj.onc.1210293Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Hence, we sought to examine whether decreased expression of CREB in Tat-treated cells is E2F3– and/or miR-34a–dependent. To that end, we tested the impact of Tat protein on E2F3 expression in SH-SY5Y cells. Western blot analysis showed that the addition of Tat led to a decrease in E2F3 expression (Fig. 3C). GAPDH was used as a control for equal protein loading. To further confirm the involvement of E2F3 in Tat-inducing CREB down-regulation, we performed a ChIP assay to examine the ability of E2F3 to bind to the predicted region of the CREB promoter. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with E2F3-HA–tagged expression vector for 24 h, and then the cells were subjected to a ChIP assay. To discriminate against any nonspecific signal from the total E2F3-specific antibody, HA antibody was used. Several primers, covering three different regions from the CREB promoter, as displayed in Fig. 3D and described under “Experimental procedures,” were used. As expected, untransfected or Tat-treated cells exhibit low or no binding, confirming the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 3D). E2F3 was able to interact with the +1 region of the CREB promoter and not with the other two regions that do not contain an E2F3-binding site. Efficiency of transfection was controlled using GFP fluorescent plasmid (Fig. 3D, inset). Next, we determined the ability of E2F3 to regulate the CREB promoter in the presence and absence of Tat. Using CREB-Luc full-length and mutant (where the E2F3 binding site was mutated; see “Experimental procedures”) reporter plasmids, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of CREB-Luc (FL or mutant) along with 0.25 μg of CMV-Tat and/or E2F3 expression plasmids. Luciferase assay results showed that the addition of Tat down-regulates the CREB promoter, whereas overexpression of E2F3 increased the CREB promoter expression, respectively (Fig. 3E, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, Tat failed to decrease the CREB promoter in the presence of E2F3 (Fig. 3E, lane 4). Similarly, Tat was unable to alter CREB gene regulation in the absence of the E2F3-binding site (lane 6). These results led to the conclusion that E2F3 is an important factor involved in CREB promoter regulation and that Tat protein exerts its negative effect through its functional (and maybe physical) interaction with the E2F3 transcription factor. We validated these observations by performing an RT-qPCR. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of HA-E2F3 expression plasmid and then treated with Tat protein for 24 and 48 h. The cells were collected, processed, and subjected to qPCR. As shown in Fig. 3F, overexpression of E2F3 modestly rescued CREB from being inhibited by Tat when compared with the mock untreated or with Tat-treated samples. GFP expression plasmid was used as a control to determine transfection efficacy. At a functional level, using SH-SY5Y cells, we observed a larger area covered with elongated neurites in the presence of overexpressed E2F3 compared with the mock or Tat-treated cells (Fig. 3G). The addition of Tat and E2F3 did not affect neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results pointed to a significant role of E2F3 in the CREB modification pathway. Our results gave us the rationale to perform additional functional studies. Hence, we examined the impact of E2F3 overexpression on CREB and BDNF functional and physical interactions. As described previously, the BDNF gene contains multiple alternative transcription start sites (34Timmusk T. Metsis M. Regulation of BDNF promoters in rat hippocampus.Neurochem.

https://openalex.org/W2906997441,"Access to point-of-care HIV testing shortens turn-around times, time to diagnosis and reduces loss to follow-up hence minimizing barriers to early linkage to care and treatment among HIV infected infants. Currently samples for early infant HIV diagnosis are sent to centralized testing facilities which are few and located only at specific regions in Kenya. However, there are Point of Care (POC) early infant diagnosis [EID] technologies elsewhere such as SAMBA and ALERE-Q that are yet to be evaluated in Kenya despite the urgent need for data to inform policy formulation regarding EID. The Cepheid GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual (GeneXpert) technology for POC EID offers a great opportunity to minimize HIV associated morbidity, mortality and loss to follow-up through decentralization of early infant HIV testing to the clinics. This technology also allows for same-day results thus facilitating prompt linkage to care.We evaluated the GeneXpert HIV Qual EID POC in Homabay County against the standard of care platform, Roche CAP/CTM HIV-1 qualitative PCR, using dried blood spots (DBS). Between February-July 2016, DBS samples were collected from HIV exposed children <18 months of age enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Samples were collected by qualified nurse counselors, and were tested by trained technicians using field based GeneXpert and conventional laboratory based Roche CAP/CTM HIV-1 qualitative PCR. Sensitivity and specificity were determined.Overall, 3,814 mother/infant pairs were included in the study, out of which 921 infants were HIV exposed as per the mothers' HIV status and based on the infant's HIV rapid test. A total of 969 PCR tests were performed, out of which 30 (3.3%) infants were concordantly positive using both platforms. GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual yielded a sensitivity of 94.1% and specificity of 99.8% with an overall error rate of 0.7%.Our findings show that GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual performs well compared to CAP/CTM using DBS samples, suggesting that this technology may be adopted in decentralized laboratories as a near POC device. It may contribute to prompt diagnosis of HIV exposed infants hence enabling early linkage to care, thus advancing further gains in EID."

Treatment with a synthetic miR-8073 mimic resulted in a dramatic decrease in the proliferation of various types of cancer cells, which was not observed in similarly treated normal cells. As little is known about the biological functions of miR-8073, its target mRNAs were analyzed by both mRNA expression and in silico sequence analyses, leading to five probable target candidates (FOXM1, MBD3, CCND1, KLK10, and CASP2) that enhance survival during the regulation of the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. We experimentally confirmed that miR-8073 binds the 3’-UTR of each of these mRNA target candidates and that the introduction of a synthetic miR-8073 mimic into cancer cells reduced levels of protein expression. Finally, the antiproliferative effects of miR-8073 were validated in vivo: the subcutaneous injection of a synthetic miR-8073 mimic suppressed colorectal tumor volume to 43% in tumor-bearing xenografted mice. These results suggest that because miR-8073 binds, and thus reduces the levels of, these oncogenic targets, cancer cells must actively downregulate miR-8073 as a survival mechanism. The introduction of miR-8073 into tumors could thus inhibit tumor growth, indicating its great potential for cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2907703653,"Parkinson disease–associated mutations within the GTPase domain Ras of complex proteins (ROC) of leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) result in an abnormal over-activation of its kinase domain. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Recent study has shown that LRRK2 G-domain cycles between monomeric and dimeric conformations upon binding to GTP or guanosine diphosphate, and that the Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated R1441C/G/H mutations impair the G-domain monomer-dimer dynamics and trap the G-domain in a constitutive monomeric conformation. That led us to question whether other disease-associated mutations in G-domain would also affect its conformation. Here, we report that another PD-associated N1437H mutation also impairs its monomer-dimer conformational dynamics and GTPase activity. In contrast with mutations at R1441, ROCN1437H was found to be locked in a stable dimeric conformation in solution and its GTPase activity was ∼4-fold lower than that of the wild-type. Furthermore, the N1437H mutation reduced the GTP binding affinity by ∼2.5-fold when compared with other pathogenic G-domain mutations. Moreover, ROCN1437h was found to have a slower GTP dissociation rate, indicating that N1437H might interrupt the nucleotide exchange cycle. Taken together, our data support that conformational dynamics is important for LRRK2 GTPase activity and that the N1437H mutation impairs GTPase activity by locking the ROC domain in a persistently dimeric state.—Huang, X., Wu, C., Park, Y., Long, X., Hoang, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2908151741,"Obesity and diabetes increase the risk of depression, and the incidence of these conditions increases rapidly after menopause, but few animal models of postmenopausal obesity have been available. We developed a mouse model of postmenopausal obesity that exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in behavioral tests. To examine the effect of estradiol (E2) in the model, we prepared 4 experimental groups: 1) control, sham-operated female C57BL/6 mice fed a regular diet; 2) OVX-HF, ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed a high-fat diet (HF); 3) E2-SC, OVX-HF mice administered subcutaneous (SC) E2 (50 μg/kg/day); and 4) E2-ICV, OVX-HF mice administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) E2 (1 μg/kg/day). OVX-HF mice exhibited anxiety phenotypes in the open field test, but not in the light-dark box test, and E2 treatment via both routes effectively ameliorated it. OVX-HF mice demonstrated depressive phenotypes in the tail suspension test and forced swim test. Both E2 treatments achieved significant improvement in the tail suspension test, but not in the forced swim test. Serum corticosterone levels did not differ among the groups. Hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and serotonin 1A receptor mRNA was significantly increased in OVX-HF mice and was decreased in E2-treated mice. The hypothalamic level of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) protein was tended to decrease in OVX-HF mice, but neither E2 treatment increased it. Since this mouse model exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in relatively short experimental periods without genetic manipulations, it would be useful for further exploring psychiatric phenotypes or screening of therapeutic candidates in postmenopausal obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2906815928,"The human-dog relationship is thought to be the oldest domestic animal partnership. These relationships are complex and can become problematic when they become dysfunctional. The most common signs of dysfunctional human-dog partnerships are behaviour problems that, when unidentified and uncorrected, can be a clear danger to both species and the public. The Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) is a widely implemented instrument to evaluate dog behaviour proven to be useful across various cultures. A European Portuguese 78-item version based on the 100-item C-BARQ was developed and its psychometric properties evaluated. The resulting questionnaire has a 13-factor structure accounting for 58.42% of the total variance with Cronbach’s alpha values ranging from 0.902 and 0.721, showing excellent to respectable consistency. The original factors, Dog-Directed Aggression and Dog-Directed Fear, both loaded strongly onto a joint factor renamed Dog Associated Fear/Aggression, explaining the 13-factor structure compared to the previously found 14-factor structure. In the European Portuguese C-BARQ only two items did not load onto their expected factor. Results show that the questionnaire measures universal dog behaviours that are evident to most owners. Our results suggest that the European Portuguese version of the C-BARQ can be used to characterize the behaviour of dog populations and is adequate for use in animal shelters to help match dogs with new owners and in clinical settings to identify behaviour problems in veterinary patients before they become unmanageable. The European Portuguese C-BARQ could be of vital importance in helping to resolve behavioural problems in owned dogs before they become so serious as to lead to abandonment or euthanasia, diminishing the pressure on municipal kennels and greatly improving canine welfare."

The aim of this study was to assess knowledge on birth preparedness and complication readiness and how men and women differ"" among expecting couples in a rural setting of Rukwa Region, Tanzania.A community-based cross-sectional study targeting pregnant women and their partners was performed from June 2017 to October 2017. A total of 546 couples were sampled using three-stage probability sampling techniques and then interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The mean score difference was sought using independent t-test. Multiple linear regressions were performed to determine the predictors of knowledge.There was a significant difference in mean knowledge scores between pregnant women (M = 5.58, SD = 4.591) and male partners (M = 4.37, SD = 4.285); t (1085) = -4.525; p<0.001. Among women, BPCR levels were positively influenced by age (β = 0.236; p<0.01), having ever heard about birth preparedness (β = 0.176;p<0.001), being of Mambwe ethnicity (β = 0.187; p<0.001), living near a health center rather than a dispensary (β = 0.101;p<0.05) and having had a prior preterm delivery (β = 0.086;p<0.05). Access to media through radio ownership negatively influenced BPCR levels among both women (β-.119; p<0.01) and men (β = -0.168; p<0.0001). Among men, the BPCR knowledge was only positively influenced by having ever heard about birth preparedness (β = 0.169;p<0.001), age at marriage (β = -0.103; p<0.05), and having completed either primary (β = 0.157;p<0.001) or secondary education (β = 0.131;p<0.01).Some important predictors of knowledge were revealed among women and men, but overall knowledge about birth preparedness and complication readiness was low. This study demonstrates inadequate knowledge and understanding at the community level about key elements of birth preparedness and complication readiness. In order to improve access to life-saving care for women and neonates, there is a pressing need for innovative community strategies to increase knowledge about birth preparedness and complication readiness. Such strategies are essential in order to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in rural Tanzania."

Granulocyte transfusions (GTX) from healthy donors may lead to early clearance of index infection and thus prevent mortality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GTX in combating life-threatening infections and preventing mortality in patients of hematological disorders/recipients of HSCT with severe neutropenia. This study was a prospective, observational analysis of patients with different hematological disorders/recipients of HSCT, who received GTX from January 2014 to December 2017. All patients had an Absolute neutrophil Count (ANC) < 0.5 x 109/L and a life threatening sepsis defined by presence of hemodynamic instability/ impending septic shock/ continuous high fever despite the use of the highest line of antimicrobials. A total of 143 granulocyte collections were done for 66 infectious episodes (IEs) in 60 patients. Multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) were observed in 47/66 IEs (71.2%) and fungal infections were seen in 9/66 IEs (13.6%). Resolution of index infection after GTX was seen in 45/66 IEs (68.2%), and the 30 day overall survival (OS) was 67.7%. OS was significantly higher in patients who received GTX within 7 days of neutropenic sepsis (p = 0.01). Patients with MDROs who received early GTX therapy had a better OS as compared to those who received late GTX (p = 0.02). GTX were well tolerated and only 6 patients' developed mild features of transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) which was managed conservatively, and 1 patient demonstrated hypocalcemic tetany. GTX may be of particular relevance in countries like India, where the incidence of infections is very high in neutropenic patients and there is an increasing emergence of MDROs."
https://openalex.org/W2906953399,"The adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) provide critical adhesive contacts between neighboring epithelial cells and are crucial for epithelial adhesion, integrity, and barrier functions in a wide variety of tissues and organisms. The striatin protein family, which are part of the striatin interaction phosphatases and kinases complex, are multidomain scaffolding proteins that play important biologic roles. We have previously shown that striatin colocalizes with the tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli in the TJs of epithelial cells. Here we show that striatin affects junction integrity and cell migration, probably through a mechanism that involves the adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Cells engaged in cell-cell adhesion expressed a high MW-modified form of striatin that forms stable associations with detergent-insoluble, membrane-bound cellular fractions. In addition, striatin has recently been suggested to be a target of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases Tankyrase 1, and we have found that striatin interacts with Tankyrase 1 and is subsequently poly-ADP-ribosylated. Taken together, our results suggest that striatin is a novel cell-cell junctional protein that functions to maintain correct cell adhesion and may have a role in establishing the relationship between AJs and TJs that is fundamental for epithelial cell-cell adhesion.-Lahav-Ariel, L., Caspi, M., Nadar-Ponniah, P.

https://openalex.org/W2908087112,"Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) have suffered severe declines in the northern extent of their range due to a variety of threats, including habitat destruction, trauma from cars and dogs, climate change and importantly, disease. The most significant pathogen in koalas is Chlamydia pecorum, which causes inflammation and fibrosis at mucosal sites, resulting in blindness, infertility and death in severe cases. Chlamydia treatment can be problematic in koalas as the response to treatment is often poor in chronic cases and antimicrobial choice is limited. Thus, chlamydial disease is a severely threatening process for koala conservation. We investigated the short and long-term clinical outcomes for 167 koalas with Chlamydia that underwent capture, telemetric monitoring and intensive veterinary management as part of a large-scale population management program in South East Queensland. Chlamydia treatments included the standard regimen of daily subcutaneous chloramphenicol injections (60mg/kg) for 14 to 28-days, and a variety of non-standard regimens such as topical antimicrobials only (for ocular disease), surgical treatment only (for bilateral reproductive tract disease), and other antimicrobials/treatment lengths. To assess these regimens we analysed clinical records, field monitoring data and swab samples collected from the urogenital tract and ocular conjunctiva. Overall, in contrast to other studies, treatment was generally successful with 86.3% of treated koalas released back into the wild. The success of treatment rose to 94.8% however, when the standard treatment regimen was employed. Further, 100% of koalas that were also treated with surgical ovariohysterectomy (n = 12) remained healthy for a median of 466 days of post-treatment monitoring, demonstrating the benefits of surgical treatment. Previous studies reported 45-day chloramphenicol regimens, but the shorter standard regimen still achieved microbiological cure and reduces the risk of negative sequelae associated with treatment and/or captivity and treatment costs. Despite these positive clinical outcomes, alternatives to chloramphenicol are warranted due to its decreasing availability."
https://openalex.org/W2906774555,"Background In patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) a cardinal feature is exercise intolerance, often associated with significant dyspnea and severe hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygen therapy may be offered during exercise. The Oxymizer is a nasal cannula with an incorporated reservoir with the potential to deliver higher oxygen doses to the patient. Objective The primary aim was to investigate the effect of supplemental oxygen delivered via Oxymizer compared to a conventional nasal cannula (CNC) in patients with ILD during constant work rate tests (CWRT). Secondary aim was to evaluate effects on oxygen saturation (SpO2), dyspnea and heart rate at isotime. Methods In this randomized crossover study 24 ILD patients established on long-term oxygen treatment were included. Patients performed four cycling CWRT at 70% of their peak work rate; twice with the Oxymizer and twice with the CNC. Results Twenty-one patients finished all CWRTs (age 60 ± 10.9 years, VC 55.4 ± 23.0%predicted). Cycle endurance time was significantly higher while using the Oxymizer compared to CNC (718 ± 485 vs. 680 ± 579 seconds, p = 0.02), and SpO2 at isotime was significantly higher while using the Oxymizer (85.5 ± 6.7 vs. 82.8± 7.2, p = 0.01). Fifteen of the 21 (71%) patients cycled longer with the Oxymizer. There were no significant differences for dyspnea and heart rate. Conclusions Supplemental oxygen provided by the Oxymizer significantly, but modestly, improved cycle endurance time and SpO2 at isotime in ILD patients compared to CNC."
https://openalex.org/W2907200132,"Bagrada hilaris Burmeister, is a stink bug native to Asia and Africa and invasive in the United States, Mexico, and more recently, South America. This species can cause serious damage to various vegetable crops in the genus Brassica, with seedlings being particularly susceptible to B. hilaris feeding activity. In this study, the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by seedlings of three Brassica species on the host preference of B. hilaris was evaluated. In dual choice arena and olfactometer bioassays, adult painted bugs preferred B. oleracea var. botrytis and B. napus over B. carinata. Volatiles from B. oleracea seedlings were collected and bioassayed with B. hilaris adults and late stage nymphs, using electroantennographic (EAG) and behavioral (olfactometer) techniques. When crude extracts of the VOCs from B. oleracea var. botrytis seedlings and liquid chromatography fractions thereof were bioassayed, B. hilaris adults and nymphs were attracted to the crude extract, and to a non-polar fraction containing hydrocarbons, whereas there were no responses to the more polar fractions. GC-MS analysis indicated that the main constituents of the non-polar fraction was an as yet unidentified diterpene hydrocarbon, with trace amounts of several other diterpene hydrocarbons. The major diterpene occurred in VOCs from both of the preferred host plants B. oleracea and B. napus, but not in VOCs of B. carinata. Our results suggest that this diterpene, alone or in combination with one or more of the minor compounds, is a key mediator in this insect-plant interaction, and could be a good candidate for use in lures for monitoring B. hilaris in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2908282543,"Increased levels of the calcium-binding protein neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1) predict an unfavorable patient outcome in several aggressive cancers, including breast and liver tumors. Previous studies suggest that NCS1 overexpression facilitates metastatic spread of these cancers. To investigate this hypothesis, we explored the effects of NCS1 overexpression on cell proliferation, survival, and migration patterns in vitro in 2- and 3-dimensional (2/3-D). Furthermore, we translated our results into an in vivo mouse xenograft model. Cell-based proliferation assays were used to demonstrate the effects of overexpression of NCS1 on growth rates. In vitro colony formation and wound healing experiments were performed and 3-D migration dynamics were studied using collagen gels. Nude mice were injected with breast cancer cells to monitor NCS1-dependent metastasis formation over time. We observed that increased NCS1 levels do not change cellular growth rates, but do significantly increase 2- and 3-D migration dynamics in vitro. Likewise, NCS1-overexpressing cells have an increased capacity to form distant metastases and demonstrate better survival and less necrosis in vivo. We found that NCS1 preferentially localizes to the leading edge of cells and overexpression increases the motility of cancer cells. Furthermore, this phenotype is correlated with an increased number of metastases in a xenograft model. These results lay the foundation for exploring the relevance of an NCS1-mediated pathway as a metastatic biomarker and as a target for pharmacologic interventions.-Apasu, J.

https://openalex.org/W2908474466,"Folate deficiency in early development leads to disturbance in multiple processes, including neurogenesis during which fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway is one of the crucial pathways. Whether folic acid (FA) directly affects FGF pathways to influence neurodevelopment and the possible mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we presented evidence that in human FA-insufficient encephalocele, the FGF pathway was interfered. Furthermore, in Brachyury knockout mice devoid of such T-box transcription factors regulating embryonic neuromesodermal bipotency and a key component of FGF pathway, change in expression of Brachyury downstream targets, activator Fgf8 and suppressor dual specificity phosphatase 6 was detected, along with the reduction in expression of other key FGF pathway genes. By using a FA-deficient cell model, we further demonstrated that decrease in Brachyury expression was through alteration in hypermethylation at the Brachyury promoter region under FA deficiency conditions, and suppression of Brachyury promoted the inactivation of the FGF pathway. Correspondingly, FA supplementation partially reverses the effects seen in FA-deficient embryoid bodies. Lastly, in mice with maternal folate-deficient diets, aberrant FGF pathway activity was found in fetal brain dysplasia. Taken together, our findings highlight the effect of FA on FGF pathways during neurogenesis, and the mechanism may be due to the low expression of Brachyury gene via hypermethylation under FA-insufficient conditions.-Chang, S., Lu, X., Wang, S., Wang, Z., Huo, J., Huang, J., Shangguan, S., Li, S., Zou, J., Bao, Y., Guo, J., Wang, F., Niu, B., Zhang, T., Qiu, Z., Wu, J., Wang, L.

The stress and anxiety of competition might interfere greatly with performance, by impacting the autonomic system. Physiological alterations, such as situations that irritate, frighten or excite the individual can cause a stress response, defined as a response of the organism to reestablish the homeostasis, regardless of its relationship to a sports situation. The aim of this study was to present data on the autonomic changes induced by precompetitive stress in cyclists and their relation with physical fitness and anxiety. Twelve healthy cyclists aged between 18 and 40 years, with previous experience in competition at the regional level, participated in the study. Heart rate variability (HRV) and physical fitness (body mass index, body fat and aerobic capacity) were measured 5 days before the Mountain Bike championship and remeasured 45 minutes before the start of the race (HRV and Anciety). Paired T test, effect size and correlational test were used. Cycling competition is a stressful situation capable of altering autonomic and hemodynamic parameters.

A random event, dietary change or antibiotic treatment may alter the gut environment with possible repercussions for the bacterial community composition and functionality and ultimately host fitness. The present study was focused on the composition, structure and functionality of gut microbiota in Reticulitermes grassei and the data obtained was compared with sequence surveys of three other Reticulitermes species. Each Reticulitermes species had a significantly different bacterial gut microbiota (pairwise significance tests using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but a similar pattern of distribution (P-test in weighted Unifrac). The core gut microbiota from the analyzed Reticulitermes species contained 16 bacterial operational taxonomic units. Enzymes (KO) were detected from 14 pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. R. grassei and R. hesperus, based on relative abundance of KO, had the most similar carbohydrate pathway patterns. In addition, we described the gut microbiota and functionality pathways in R. grassei after a 7-day dietary shift and antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) treatment. Both factors, but above all the antibiotic, altered the relative abundance of certain microbial groups, although the changes were not statistically significant (P-test in weighted Unifrac). The cellulose diet enhanced the carbohydrate pathways related to propanoate, butanoate, ascorbate, and glyoxylate metabolism. The antibiotic treatment affected galactose metabolism, the citrate cycle and inositol phosphate metabolism. Those functional changes may be related to changes in the abundance of several bacterial groups. Our findings provide insights into the stability of the gut microbiota in R. grassei and a resilience response to dietary shift or antibiotic treatment disturbance after 7 days."

To identify compounds with known targets, we screened drug-repurposing and natural product libraries. We identified, confirmed, and validated 64 activators and 65 inhibitors that acutely increase or rapidly decrease cell-surface Glut4 in adipocytes stimulated with submaximal insulin concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2906851930,"Clostridium difficile is associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in humans. Its 2 major toxins, toxins A and B, enter host cells and inactivate GTPases of the Ras homologue/rat sarcoma family by glucosylation. Pore formation of the toxins in the endosomal membrane enables the translocation of their glucosyltransferase domain into the cytosol, and membrane cholesterol is crucial for this process. Here, we asked whether the activity of the sterol regulatory element–binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) pathway, which regulates the cholesterol content in membranes, affects the susceptibility of target cells toward toxins A and B. We show that the SREBP-2 pathway is crucial for the intoxication process of toxins A and B by using pharmacological inhibitors (PF-429242, 25-hydroxycholesterol) and cells that are specifically deficient in SREBP-2 pathway signaling. SREBP-2 pathway inhibition disturbed the cholesterol-dependent pore formation of toxin B in cellular membranes. Preincubation with the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin protected cells from toxin B intoxication. Inhibition of the SREBP-2 pathway was without effect when the enzyme portion of toxin B was introduced into target cells via the cell delivery property of anthrax protective antigen.

Ten patients with LGG (ages 35.1±12.1 yrs; 4 males, 6 females) and 21 patients with HGG (ages 60.6±19.1 yrs; 10 males, 11 females) who underwent subsequent surgical resections were examined with both IVIM imaging and histopathological analysis. The IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging was conducted using a single-shot echo planar sequence with 13 b-factors (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 sec/mm2) at 3T. In the conventional IVIM analysis, the perfusion fraction (f) and true diffusion coefficient (D) were calculated by biexponential fitting model with 13 b-values. In the simplified method with the selected three b-values (0, 300, and 1000 sec/mm2), D simply corresponds to the slope of a straight line passing through two logarithmic signal intensities (SIs) at the b-values of 300 and 1000 s/mm2, and f corresponds to the difference between the intercept of this line and SI at the b-value of 0 sec/mm2. The maximum f (f-max) and minimum D (D-min) was measured in each tumor. The f-max values calculated with three b-values (12.8±5.9%) were significantly lower than those with 13 b-values (17.3±7.5%, p<0.0001), but a good correlation and agreement were observed between these sets of f-max values (r = 0.79, ICC = 0.87). In the IVIM imaging with both three and 13 b-values, the HGGs showed significantly higher f-max values compared to the LGGs (p<0.001, respectively). The D-min values calculated with three b-values (1.06±0.31 ×10−3 mm2/sec) was not different from those with 13 b-values (1.07±0.33 ×10−3 mm2/sec), and an excellent correlation and agreement were found between them (r = 0.99, ICC = 0.99).

Besides, we compared the sensitivity of the detection of ACE inhibitors in the patient’s plasma using conformational fingerprinting of ACE (with only 2 mAbs to ACE, 1G12 and 9B9) and already accepted kinetic assay and demonstrated that the mAbs-based assay is an order of magnitude more sensitive. This approach is also very effective in detection of known (like bilirubin and lysozyme) and still unknown ACE effectors/inhibitors which nature and set could vary in different tissues or different patients. Conclusions/Significance Phenotyping of ACE (and conformational fingerprinting of ACE as a part of this novel approach for characterization of ACE) in individuals really became informative and clinically relevant. Appreciation (and counting on) of inter-individual differences in ACE conformation and accompanying effectors make the application of this approach for future personalized medicine with ACE inhibitors more accurate. This (or similar) methodology can be applied to any enzyme/protein for which there is a number of mAbs to its different epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2949193693,"Mitochondria are central organelles in cellular metabolism. Their structure is highly dynamic, allowing them to adapt to different energy requirements, to be partitioned during cell division, and to maintain functionality. Mitochondrial dynamics, including membrane fusion and fission reactions, are well studied in yeast and mammals but it is not known if these processes are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Kinetoplastid parasites are some of the earliest-diverging eukaryotes to retain a mitochondrion. Each cell has only a single mitochondrial organelle, making them an interesting model for the role of dynamics in controlling mitochondrial architecture. We have investigated the mitochondrial division cycle in the kinetoplastid Crithidia fasciculata. The majority of mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and the mitochondrion is divided symmetrically in a process coincident with cytokinesis. Live cell imaging revealed that the mitochondrion is highly dynamic, with frequent changes in the topology of the branched network. These remodeling reactions include tubule fission, fusion, and sliding, as well as new tubule formation. We hypothesize that the function of this dynamic remodeling is to homogenize mitochondrial contents and to facilitate rapid transport of mitochondria-encoded gene products from the area containing the mitochondrial nucleoid to other parts of the organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2907194652,"The mechanisms controlling the abundance and sub-cellular distribution of caveolae are not well described. A first step towards determining such mechanisms would be identification of relevant proteins that interact with known components of caveolae. Here, we applied proximity biotinylation (BioID) to identify a list of proteins that may interact with the caveolar protein cavin1. Screening of these candidates using siRNA to reduce their expression revealed that one of them, CSDE1, regulates the levels of mRNAs and protein expression for multiple components of caveolae. A second candidate, CD2AP, co-precipitated with cavin1. Caveolar proteins were observed in characteristic and previously un-described linear arrays adjacent to cell-cell junctions in both MDCK cells, and in HeLa cells overexpressing an active form of the small GTPase Rac1. CD2AP was required for the recruitment of caveolar proteins to these linear arrays. We conclude that BioID will be useful in identification of new proteins involved in the cell biology of caveolae, and that interaction between CD2AP and cavin1 may have an important role in regulating the sub-cellular distribution of caveolae."
https://openalex.org/W2908403568,"In this study, we investigated the effects of context-related semantic anomalies on the fixation-related brain potentials of 12-13-year-old Finnish children in grade 6 during sentence reading. The detection of such anomalies is typically reflected in the N400 event-related potential. We also examined whether the representation invoked by the sentence context extends to the orthographic representation level by replacing the final words of the sentence with an anomalous word neighbour of a plausible word. The eye-movement results show that the anomalous word neighbours of plausible words cause similar first-fixation and gaze duration reactions, as do other anomalous words. Similarly, we observed frontal negativity in the fixation-related potential of the unrelated anomalous words and in the anomalous word neighbours. This frontal negativity was larger in both anomalous conditions than in the response elicited by the plausible condition. We thus show that the brain successfully uses context to separate anomalous words from plausible words on a single letter level during free reading. From the P600 response of the scalp waveform, we observed that the P600 was delayed in the anomalous word neighbour condition. We performed group-level decomposition on the data with ICA (independent component analysis) and analysed the time course and source structure of the decomposed data. This analysis of decomposed brain signals not only confirmed the delay of the P600 response but also revealed that the frontal negativity concealed s more typical and separate N400 response, which was similarly delayed in the anomalous word neighbour condition, as was the P600 response. Source analysis of these independent components implicated the right frontal eye field as the cortical source for the frontal negativity and the middle temporal and parietal regions as cortical sources for the components resembling the N400 and P600 responses. We interpret the delays present in N400 and P600 responses to anomalous word neighbours to reflect competition with the representation of the plausible word just one letter different."
https://openalex.org/W2906690953,"Objective To compare access to healthcare services for people with disabilities to those without disabilities, within a national case-control study in Guatemala. Methods We undertook a population-based case-control study, nested within a national survey in Guatemala. Cases with disabilities were people with self-reported difficulties in functioning. One control without disabilities was selected per case, matched by age, gender and cluster. Information was collected on: health status, access to health services and rehabilitation, and socioeconomic status. Results The study included 707 people with disabilities, and 465 controls. People with disabilities were more likely to report a serious health problem (aOR 2.8, 2.2–3.7) or doctor-diagnosis of one of 17 general health conditions (aOR 2.9, 2.2–3.8) as compared to controls without disabilities. People with disabilities were twice as likely as controls to have received treatment for a diagnosed condition (aOR 2.2, 1.7–2.8). Coverage of treatment for impairment-related health conditions was low, as was awareness and access to rehabilitation services. People with disabilities were more likely than controls to report being disrespected (aOR 1.9, 1.0–3.7) or finding it difficult to understand information given (aOR 1.6, 1.1–1.4). Conclusion Efforts are needed to raise awareness about rehabilitation services and improve quality of health services for people with disabilities in Guatemala, to ensure that their rights are fulfilled and to assist in the achievement of Universal Health Coverage. Better tools are needed to measure healthcare access, including consideration of geographic access, quality and affordability, to allow the generation of comparable data on access to healthcare among people with disabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2906925001,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis outbreaks. From June 2015 to March 2017, fifteen outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were reported to the Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. To identify the circulating NoV genotypes associated with outbreaks in Jinan, China, 414 specimens from the 15 outbreaks were collected and analyzed for the causative viruses, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the NoV-positive strains. The NoV detection rate was 57.5% (238/414), and a total of 14 outbreaks were caused by NoVs (eight by infection with genogroup II (GII), five by mixed infection with GI and GII, and one by mixed infection with GII and rotavirus (RoV)-A). A total of 75 NoV sequences were obtained from 13 NoV-positive outbreaks and classified into seven genotypes (38 GII.17, 13 GII.2, 4 GII.3, 4 GII.1, 10 GI.6, 5 GI.5 and 1 GI.3), while GII.4 was not identified. The most prevalent genotype changed yearly during the 2015-2017 period. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these NoV genotypes had high homology with the strains circulating worldwide, especially strains from Asian countries and cities. Our study illustrated that multiple non-GII.4 NoV genotypes were prevalent in outbreaks of AGE in Jinan, China. Year-round surveillance of multiple NoV genotypes could help health authorities reduce the impact of NoV outbreaks on public health."
https://openalex.org/W2907056364,"Changes in husbandry systems as well as consumers' increasing demands for animal welfare lead to increasing importance of traits such as handleability and aggressiveness in pigs. However, before using such novel traits for selection decisions, information on genetic parameters for these traits for the specific population is required. Therefore, weight gain and behaviour-related traits were recorded in 1004 pigs (814 Pietrain x German Landrace crossbred, 190 German Landrace purebred) at different ages. Behaviour indicators and tests were assessed and conducted, respectively under commercial farm conditions and included scoring of skin lesions (twice) and behaviour during backtests (twice), injections (once), handling (twice) and weighing (three times). Since behaviour scores often exhibit suboptimal statistical properties for parametric analyses, variance components were estimated using an animal model assuming a normal (Gaussian, GA; all traits) and additionally a binary distribution of variables (BI; using a logit-link function for all behaviour traits). Heritabilities for behavioural traits ranged from 0.02 ± 0.04 (finishing pig handling test; BI) to 0.36 ± 0.08 (backtest 2; GA) suggesting that some of the traits are potentially useful for genetic selection (e.g. finishing pig weighing test: h2 (GA) = 0.20 ± 0.07). Only minor differences were observed for results from binary and Gaussian analyses of the same traits suggesting that either approach might yield valid results. However, four-fold cross-validation using correlations between breeding values of a sub-set of animals for the sample trait finishing pig weighing score indicated slight superiority of the logit model (r = 0.85 ± 0.04 vs. r = 0.77 ± 0.03). Generally, only weak to moderate associations were found between behavioural reactions to the same test at different ages (rp ≤ 0.11 for weighing at different ages; rp = 0.30 but rg (GA) = 0.84 ± 0.11 for the backtests) as well as between reactions to different tests. Therefore, for inclusion of behaviour traits into breeding programmes, and considering high labour input required for some tests such as the backtest, it is recommended to assess behaviour during situations that are relevant and identical to practical conditions, while the use of indicator traits generally does not appear to be a very promising alternative."
https://openalex.org/W2907503621,"Intracellular delivery of DNA is considered a challenge in biological research and treatment of diseases. The previously reported transfection rate by commercially available transfection reagents in cancer cell lines, such as the mouse lung tumor cell line (TC-1), is very low. The purpose of this study is to introduce and optimize an efficient gene transfection method by mechanical approaches. The combinatory transfection effect of mechanical treatments and conventional chemical carriers is also investigated on a formerly reported hard-to-transfect cell line (TC-1). To study the effect of mechanical loadings on transfection rate, TC-1 tumor cells are subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch, equiaxial cyclic stretch, and shear stress. The TurboFect transfection reagent is exerted for chemical transfection purposes. The pEGFP-N1 vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression is utilized to determine gene delivery into the cells. The results show a significant DNA delivery rate (by ~30%) in mechanically transfected cells compared to the samples that were transfected with chemical carriers. Moreover, the simultaneous treatment of TC-1 tumor cells with chemical carriers and mechanical loadings significantly increases the gene transfection rate up to ~ 63% after 24 h post-transfection. Our results suggest that the simultaneous use of mechanical loading and chemical reagent can be a promising approach in delivering cargoes into cells with low transfection potentials and lead to efficient cancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2908487056,"Canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common cancers in dogs which shares remarkable similarities with its human counterpart, making the dog an excellent model for the investigation of novel therapeutic agents. However, the integration of canine lymphoma in comparative studies has been limited due in part to the lack of suitable xenograft mouse models for preclinical studies. To overcome these limitations, we established and characterized a localized subcutaneous bioluminescent canine DLBCL xenograft mouse model. The canine CLBL-1 cell line stably expressing the luciferase and green fluorescent protein reporters was generated and used to establish the xenograft tumor model. A pilot study was first conducted with three different cell densities (0.1×10(6), 0.5×10(6) and 1×10(6) cells) in SCID mice. All mice presented homogeneous tumor induction within eight days after subcutaneous injection, with a 100% engraftment efficiency and no significant differences were observed among groups. The tumors were highly aggressive and localized at the site of inoculation and reproduced histological features and immunophenotype consistent with canine DLBCL. Importantly, xenograft tumors were detected and quantified by bioluminescent imaging. To assess response to therapy, a therapeutic study with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat, was performed. The results demonstrated that panobinostat (20 mg/kg) efficiently inhibited tumor growth and that bioluminescent imaging allowed the monitorization and quantification of tumor response to therapy. In summary, this study provides a bioluminescence canine DLBCL model that offers high engraftment efficiency, preservation of tumor features, and noninvasive monitoring of tumor progression, validating the model as a promising preclinical tool for both veterinary and human medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2906985656,"Measuring oxidative stress has become increasingly valuable in ecological studies, especially when different markers are measured on the same individual. However, many of the current methods lack sensitivity for analysis of low blood volume samples, which represent a challenge for longitudinal field studies of small organisms. Small blood volumes can usually only be analysed by using a single assay, therefore providing limited information on individual's oxidative profile. In this study, we used blood collected from a population of wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and modified methods presented in the literature to improve analytical selectivity and sensitivity required for small blood volumes. Specifically, we proposed a modified malondialdehyde (MDA) analysis protocol by HPLC and also optimized both the uric acid independent ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and hypochlorous acid shock capacity (HASC) assays. Development of the three modified methods was achieved with a sensitivity and repeatability that meets standards of field ecology while allowing measurement of all three assays in duplicate using less than 60 μL of plasma. Availability of these tests using small blood volumes will provide ecologists with a more comprehensive portrait of an individual's oxidative profile and a better understanding of its determinants and interactions with the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2907494963,"Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is an emerging technique promising an expansion of the donor pool and improvements in the outcome after lung transplantation. Reliable biomarkers for local assessment of organ function in the EVLP system are intensely sought after. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of multiparametric functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an EVLP system in a porcine aspiration model.Seven female pigs were anesthetized and gastric juice was instilled in the right lower lobe bronchus to simulate aspiration. Left lungs served as control. Lungs were removed and installed in a modified EVLP system. In the 12-hour EVLP run three sequential MRI scans were performed. Oxygen-washout time, Fourier Decomposition derived ventilation and perfusion, and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging derived perfusion were calculated. PaO2:FiO2 ratio was determined and correlated. End-point histology and computed tomography served as control.All animals completed the protocol. MRI structural images showed infiltrates in lungs after aspiration comparable to CT scans. Ventilation was significantly (p = 0.016) reduced while perfusion was increased (p = 0.016) in lungs after aspiration. Non-contrast dependent Fourier decomposition perfusion showed good correlation (R2 = 0.67) to dynamic contrast enhanced derived perfusion. Oxygen washout time was significantly increased (p = 0.016) in lungs after aspiration and showed a correlation with the PaO2:FiO2 ratio (R2 = 0.54).Multiparametric fMRI for local assessment of organ function is feasible in EVLP and detects alterations in lung function following aspiration with correlation to clinical parameters. fMRI may improve organ assessment in ex-vivo perfusion systems, leading to a better selection of segments suitable for transplant."
https://openalex.org/W2907615006,"Backgrounds The prevalence of toxoplasmosis is higher in schizophrenics than in the general population. It has been suggested that certain symptoms of schizophrenia, including changes in olfactory functions, are in fact symptoms of toxoplasmosis that can be easily detected in schizophrenics only due to the increased prevalence of toxoplasmosis in this population. Schizophrenics have impaired identification of odors and lower sensitivity of odor detection, however, no information about these parameters of non-schizophrenic Toxoplasma-infected subjects is available. Methods Here we searched for differences in olfactory functions between 62 infected and 61 noninfected non-schizophrenic subjects using the case-controls experimental design. Results The infected men scored better than the non-infected controls in the standard odor-identification test. The infected women rated all smells as more intensive while the infected men rated nearly all smells as less intensive. Infected women rated the pleasantness of the smell of the cat urine as higher than the non-infected women and the opposite was true for the men–in contrast, higher pleasantness of odor in infected men and lower in infected women were observed and described in the 2011 study. Toxoplasmosis, Rh, and toxoplasmosis-Rh interaction were not associated with the rated pleasantness of the smell of other stimuli. However, our sample contained only 17 Rh negative men and 30 Rh negative women. Therefore, all results concerning the main effects of Rh factor and the interaction with Rh factor must be considered only preliminary. Conclusions Our results suggest that latent toxoplasmosis is associated with changes in the olfactory functions in humans; however, the observed changes differ from those observed in schizophrenics."
https://openalex.org/W2908162306,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the interrelationship between tooth preparation and dental structure of Chinese maxillary central incisors and provide scientific guidance for clinical all-ceramic restoration. Forty-five specimens of maxillary central incisors were fabricated by 3D printer based on data of Micro CT scanning. Subsequently, every three specimens from the same natural tooth were randomly divided into three groups (n = 15): porcelain veneer, all ceramic crown, and the blank control group. All the specimen teeth were prepared according to routine clinical criteria, reconstructed into 3D models and then measured in software. The results showed that the mean quantity of reduction (volume fraction) was (28.35 ± 4.37) % and (56.93 ± 3.47) % for porcelain veneer and all-ceramic crown, respectively. The bonding areas of different all-ceramic restorations were (128.85 ± 11.73) mm2 and (97.15 ± 9.98) mm2 for all-ceramic crown and porcelain veneer respectively. In porcelain veneer group, the area of enamel adhesive was (54.80 ± 12.70) mm2, and the area of dentin was (42.35 ± 9.62) mm2. As the results of the one-sample t test, the mean distances from medullary angle to incisal edge or adjacent surface have significant differences with the test value which was set as 0.5 (P < .05). The reduction of the tooth for porcelain veneer is less than that of ceramic crown and the cementation of porcelain veneer is mostly dependent on the conservation of the enamel during preparation. The region from mesial adjacent surface to mesiopulpal angle is prone to have the problem of medullary perforation."
https://openalex.org/W2908384559,"The aim of this study was a comparison of aortic valve calcium score (AVCS) between patients with hypercholesterolemia and genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia with low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutation (LDLR-M group), versus patients with hypercholesterolemia without LDLR gene mutation (LDLR-WT group). A total of 72 LDLR-M patients and 50 LDLR-WT patients were enrolled in the study and underwent CT as a part of an assessment of coronary calcium scoring. AVCS was determined and compared between the two patient groups. AVCS was significantly higher in the LDLR-M group in comparison to the LDLR-WT group (13.8 ± 37.9 vs. 0.94 ± 3.1, p = 0.03). The Yates' chi-squared test for independence revealed that LDLR mutation and AVCS were significantly dependable (Chi^2 = 6.106, p = 0.013). The LDLR mutation was a strong predictor of a high AVCS (OR 7.83, 95% CI 2.08-29.50, p = 0.002) on multivariate regression analysis. Among the traditional risk factors, age (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.18, p<0.001) and SBP (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07, p = 0.045) were also significant for high result of AVCS. An assessment of computed tomography calcium scores showed that LDLR-M patients have increased AVCS in comparison to those with LDLR-WT. In addition, LDLR mutation can be considered as an independent risk factor of having high AVSC even after adjustment for risk factors including cholesterol levels. This may result from the associated process connected with the regulatory role of LDLR in evolution of aortic valve calcifications."
https://openalex.org/W2907916474,"The majority of cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis, hence improved methods to biologically and computationally model metastasis are required. Computational models rely on robust data that is machine-readable. The current methods used to model metastasis in mice involve generating primary tumors by injecting human cells into immune-compromised mice, or by examining genetically engineered mice that are pre-disposed to tumor development and that eventually metastasize. The degree of metastasis can be measured using flow cytometry, bioluminescence imaging, quantitative PCR, and/or by manually counting individual lesions from metastatic tissue sections. The aforementioned methods are time-consuming and do not provide information on size distribution or spatial localization of individual metastatic lesions. In this work, we describe and provide a MATLAB script for an image-processing based method designed to obtain quantitative data from tissue sections comprised of multiple subpopulations of disseminated cells localized at metastatic sites in vivo. We further show that this method can be easily adapted for high throughput imaging of live or fixed cells in vitro under a multitude of conditions in order to assess clonal fitness and evolution. The inherent variation in mouse studies, increasing complexity in experimental design which incorporate fate-mapping of individual cells, result in the need for a large cohort of mice to generate a robust dataset. High-throughput imaging techniques such as the one that we describe will enhance the data that can be used as input for the development of computational models aimed at modeling the metastatic process."

The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is typically made by multiphasic imaging studies demonstrating arterial enhancement with washout on arterial, portal venous, and delayed phase imaging. The aim of our study was to determine how the presence of TIPS would affect the imaging diagnosis of HCC.This was a single-center electronic database review of all patients who underwent multiphasic imaging with MRI or CT scan for HCC screening between January 2000 and July 2017 and who were subsequently diagnosed with HCC. Data collected included patient demographics, liver disease characteristics including CPT score, MELD-Na, AFP, type of imaging, tumor stage, and lab values at the time of HCC diagnosis. The diagnosis of HCC was made using LI-RADS criteria on contrast-enhanced CT or MR imaging and confirmed by chart abstraction as documented by the treating clinician. Demographic and imaging characteristics for HCC patients with and without TIPS were compared.A total of 279 patients met eligibility criteria for the study, 37 (13.2%) of whom had TIPS placed prior to diagnosis of HCC. There was no significant difference in demographics or liver disease characteristics between patients with and without TIPS. Compared to cirrhotic patients with no TIPS prior to HCC diagnosis, patients with TIPS had significantly more scans with a longer duration of surveillance until HCC diagnosis. However, LI-RADS criteria and stage of HCC at diagnosis were not significantly different between both groups. There were no differences in outcomes including liver transplant and survival.The presence of TIPS does not lead to a delayed diagnosis of HCC. It is associated, however, with greater duration of time from first scan to diagnosis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2907060329,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a fetal defect comprising an incomplete diaphragm and the herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity that interfere with fetal pulmonary development. Though the most promising treatment for CDH is via interventional fetoscopic tracheal occlusion (TO) surgery in-utero, it has produced mixed results due to the static nature of the inserted occlusion. We hypothesize that a suitable noninvasively-actuatable, cyclic-release tracheal occlusion device can be developed to enable dynamic tracheal occlusion (dTO) implementation.To conduct an in-vitro proof-of-concept investigation of the construction of thermo-responsive polymer valves designed for targeted activation within a physiologically realizable temperature range as a first step towards potential development of a noninvasively-actuatable implantable device to facilitate dynamic tracheal occlusion (dTO) therapy.Six thermo-responsive polymer valves, with a critical solution temperature slightly higher than normal physiological body temperature of 37°C, were fabricated using a copolymer of n-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and dimethylacrylamide (DMAA). Three of the valves underwent ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilization while the other three served as controls for EtO-processing compatibility testing. Thermal response actuation of the valves and their steady-state flow performances were evaluated using water and caprine amniotic fluid.All six valves consisting of 0.3-mole fraction of DMAA were tested for thermal actuation of caprine amniotic fluid flow at temperatures ranging from 30-44°C. They all exhibited initiation of valve actuation opening at ~40°C with full completion at ~44°C. The overall average coefficient of variation (CV) for the day-to-day flow performance of the valves tested was less than 12%. Based on a Student t-test, there was no significant difference in the operational characteristics for the EtO processed versus the non-EtO processed valves tested.We successfully fabricated and demonstrated physiological realizable temperature range operation of thermo-responsive polymer valves in-vitro and their suitability for standard EtO sterilization processing, a prerequisite for future in-vivo surgical implantation testing."
