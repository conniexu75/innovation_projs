https://openalex.org/W1967720639,"Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands have been implicated in embryonic vascular development and in in vivo models of angiogenesis. Eph proteins may also regulate tumor neovascularization, but this role has not been previously investigated. To screen for Eph proteins expressed in tumor blood vessels, we used tumor xenografts grown in nude mice from MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells or KS1767 human Kaposi's sarcoma cells. By immunohistochemistry, the ephrin-A1 ligand and one of its receptors, EphA2, were detected throughout tumor vasculature. Double-labeling with anti-CD34 antibodies demonstrated that both ephrin-A1 and EphA2 were expressed in xenograft endothelial cells and also tumor cells. Furthermore, EphA2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the xenograft tumors, indicating that it was activated, presumably by interacting with ephrin-A1. Ephrin-A1 and EphA2 were also detected in both the vasculature and tumor cells of surgically removed human cancers. In an in vitro angiogenesis model, a dominant negative form of EphA2 inhibited capillary tube-like formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), demonstrating a requirement for EphA receptor signaling. These data suggest that ephrin-A1 and EphA2 play a role in human cancers, at least in part by influencing tumor neovascularization. Eph proteins may represent promising new targets for antiangiogenic cancer treatments."

https://openalex.org/W2081124673,"The small GTPase Rho and one of its targets, Rho-kinase (also termed ROK or ROCK), are implicated in various cellular functions including stress fiber formation, smooth muscle contraction, tumor cell invasion and cell motility. We have previously reported that Rho-kinase accumulates at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis in several cultured cells. Here, using Rho-kinase inhibitors, Y-27632 and HA1077, we found that Rho-kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain at Ser19 in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. On the other hand, phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins at the cleavage furrow was enhanced by the addition of the above Rho-kinase inhibitors. Treatment with Y-27632 strongly enhanced the accumulation of Rho-kinase but not RhoA and citron kinase at the cleavage furrow. Furthermore, the furrow ingression in cytokinesis was significantly prolonged in the presence of Y-27632. These results suggest that Rho-kinase is involved in the progression of cytokinesis through the phosphorylation of several proteins including myosin light chain at the cleavage furrow."

https://openalex.org/W1968329759,"The assembly of enzyme components into the cellulosome complex is dictated by the cohesin-dockerin interaction. In a recent article (Mechaly, A., Yaron, S., Lamed, R., Fierobe, H.-P., Belaich, A., Belaich, J.-P., Shoham, Y., and Bayer, E. A. (2000)Proteins 39, 170–177), we provided experimental evidence that four previously predicted dockerin residues play a decisive role in the specificity of this high affinity interaction, although additional residues were also implicated. In the present communication, we examine further the contributing factors for the recognition of a dockerin by a cohesin domain between the respective cellulosomal systems of Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum. In this context, the four confirmed residues were analyzed for their individual effect on selectivity. In addition, other dockerin residues were discerned that could conceivably contribute to the interaction, and the suspected residues were similarly modified by site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicate that mutation of a single residue from threonine to leucine at a given position of theC. thermocellum dockerin differentiates between its nonrecognition and high affinity recognition (Ka∼ 109m−1) by a cohesin fromC. cellulolyticum. This suggests that the presence or absence of a single decisive hydroxyl group is critical to the observed biorecognition. This study further implicates additional residues as secondary determinants in the specificity of interaction, because interconversion of selected residues reduced intraspecies self-recognition by at least three orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, as the latter mutageneses served to reduce but not annul the cohesin-dockerin interaction within this species, it follows that other subtle alterations play a comparatively minor role in the recognition between these two modules.

Initially, such a multienzyme complex was described in the anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum (5Lamed R. Setter E. Bayer E.A. J.

Additional cellulosomes have been described subsequently for a variety of anaerobic bacteria and fungi (7Belaich J.-P. Tardif C. Belaich A. Gaudin C. J.

The various hydrolytic enzymes are incorporated into the cellulosome complex by virtue of a pivotal nonhydrolytic polypeptide, called scaffoldin, which bears a collection of cohesin modules for this purpose. Each cohesin binds a single dockerin domain located on the enzymes, thereby generating the fully assembled cellulosome. In recent years, much effort has been devoted toward a better understanding of the cohesin-dockerin interaction. In early works, it was reported that the cellulosomal subunits are cohesively contained in the complex of C. thermocellum (14Lamed R. Bayer E.A. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1988; 33: 1-46Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Wu J.H.D. Demain A.L. Aubert J.-P. Béguin P. Millet J. Biochemistry and Genetics of Cellulose Degradation.in: Academic Press, London1988: 117-131Google Scholar). It was also noted that a duplicated segment within the dockerin sequence shows remarkable similarity with the EF-hand motif of calcium binding proteins, such as calmodulin and troponin C (16Chauvaux S. Béguin P. Aubert J.-P. Bhat K.M. Gow L.A. Wood T.M. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was shown subsequently that the cohesin-dockerin interaction in C. thermocellum is calcium-dependent, but surprisingly nonspecific among the different dockerin-bearing enzymes of this species (17Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Lytle B. Myers C. Kruus K. Wu J.H.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1200-1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that both duplicated segments of the dockerin domain are required for binding to the cohesin module (19Lytle B. Wu J.H.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6581-6585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fierobe H.-P. Pagès S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.-P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a dockerin is still unknown, although related secondary structure predictions indicated that the dockerin domain would assume an “F-helix variation” of the EF-hand motif (21Pagès S. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Bayer E.A. Morag E. Lamed R. Yaron S. Shoham Y. Claeyssens M. Nerinckx W. Piens K. Carbohydrases from Trichoderma reesei and other microorganisms.in: The Royal Society of Chemistry, London1998: 39-67Google Scholar). This hypothesis has recently been corroborated experimentally by NMR spectroscopy (23Lytle B. Volkman B.F. Westler W.M. Wu J.H.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite the reported crystal structures for two different C. thermocellum cohesins (24Shimon L.J.W. Bayer E.A. Morag E. Lamed R. Yaron S. Shoham Y. Frolow F. Structure. 1997; 5: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Tavares G.A. Béguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), structural information regarding the cohesin-dockerin complex and the precise residues involved in the interaction have yet to be discovered. We have shown that the interaction among cohesins and dockerins between two cellulosome-producing bacteria, C. thermocellum andC. cellulolyticum, is species-specific (21Pagès S. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the various dockerin domains from the two species enabled us to predict four residues that could unambiguously account for the observed species specificity. Subsequent studies, in which the four suspected dockerin residues of one species were converted to emulate those of the other, provided experimental verification of this prediction (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, interconversion of the selected residues created new specificities in which the cohesins now recognized the dockerin from the rival species. However, in each case, despite the relevant mutations, the intra-species interaction was not destroyed, and the modified dockerins still recognized the cohesin from the same species. This implied that other residues might contribute more subtle secondary interactions that would also be involved in cohesin-dockerin recognition. The purpose of the present work was 2-fold: first, to try to determine the minimal number of selectivity determinants in the dockerin domain that distinguish between the two species, and second, to try to identify additional residues that contribute secondarily to the cohesin-dockerin interaction. The first goal was achieved by mutation of a single dockerin residue from threonine to leucine in a C. thermocellum cellulosomal enzyme that sufficed to create the ability to bind a cohesin from C. cellulolyticum. The second goal was only partially achieved, in that up to eight separate dockerin mutations served only to reduce but not to abolish self-recognition of the C. thermocellum cohesin. Escherichia colistrain XL1-Blue was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). E. coli strain MutS was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). E. coli strain BL21 pLysS(λDE3) was used as a host for the expression of the C. thermocellum CelS enzyme in pET9d (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the resulting construct was termed pET9d-CelS (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The various CelS-derived mutants were expressed in the same host strain. DNA was manipulated by standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 28Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith,J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1992) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology,Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). DNA was transformed using either the calcium chloride method for strain BL21(DE3)pLysS or by electroporation using GeneZapper (IBI, New Haven, CT) for strains XL-1 Blue and MutS. DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Sequencing Unit at the Weizmann Institute (Rehovot, Israel). Mutant mS5 (previously termed mCelS-ct) was constructed as reported previously (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using a modification of the unique-site elimination procedure (29Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mutations were first produced in a detached enzyme-free dockerin construct using primers S688AT689F and S720AT721L (TableI). The DNA encoding for the entire mutated dockerin segment was transferred en bloc to the intact parent enzyme (CelS-ct), using selection primer I (thus converting a unique EagI site to SacII) and the entire mutated dockerin as the mutagenic primer. Mutant mS3 was constructed using the same approach, whereby clones containing the desired mutated dockerin segment (S688AT689F) were selected using the appropriate restriction enzyme (MluI), and the mutated segment was then transferred en bloc to the intact parent enzyme using the same selection primer. The resultant mutant, containing both the mutated dockerin and the intact catalytic domain, was used subsequently as a template for the construction of another mutant, mS1. In this case, the mutagenic primer comprised L689T, and selection primer II contained the reverse mutation, which converted theSacII site back to EagI.Table IDetails of mutagenic primers used for site-directed mutagenesisPrimerSequenceRestriction siteCommentsSelection I5′-CCAGCGCGTCCGCGGCCATGCCGGSacIIEagI→SacIISelection II5′-CCAGCGCGTCGGCCGCCATGCCGGEagISacII→EagIL689T-F 1-aNumbering in primer designation refers to the position of the indicated residue in the intact protein, including the signal peptide.

Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar, 31Meza R. Nufiez-Valdez M.-E. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described earlier (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). mS5 was used as a template for the construction of mS6; the mutations were introduced in two OE PCR cycles via mutagenic primers R696K (forward) and R728K (reverse) and flanking primers, N-flank-AatII (forward) and C-flank-NheI (reverse). However, ligation of the mutated dockerin fragment (477 bp) into pET9D-CelS (5979 bp) resulted in a high background of nonmutated colonies, apparently due to the large difference in size of the two DNA fragments and consequent difficulty in distinguishing single- from double-digested plasmid DNA. To circumvent this problem, a triple-fragment ligation approach was undertaken, in which an extended insert, delimited by NcoI and NheI sites, was extracted from the plasmid. The insert was further digested at an internal AatII site, and the resultantNcoI-AatII-digested fragment (1958 bp) was ligated, together with the mutated dockerin fragment(AatII-NheI), into theNcoI-NheI-digested pET9d-CelS (4021 bp). The resulting mutant, mS6, was then used as a template for the construction of mS8, utilizing the mutagenic primers R700G (forward) and K732G (reverse) employing the same method. For the construction of mS7, mutagenic primers K696R (forward) and K728R (reverse) were used with flanking primers N-ter-ScaI (forward) and C-flank-NheI (reverse) with mS8 as template in a simple ligation reaction. The same flanking primers were also used to construct mS2 and mS4. In the case of mS2, mS3 was used as a template with the mutagenic primer A688S (forward), whereas for mS4, pET9d-CelS was used as a template with primer S720AT721L (reverse). The mutant mCelA-cc of the C. cellulolyticum cellulase A was described in an earlier publication (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All mutants were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells as described previously (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The crude extracts were used for affinity-blotting studies without additional purification. The cells were centrifuged (6000 rpm, 10 min), resuspended to a final A600 of 10, and SDS-containing sample buffer was added, prior to boiling and SDS-PAGE. The respective cohesin probes, Coh-cc and Coh-ct, were prepared as described previously (17Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Pagès S. Belaich A. Tardif C. Reverbel-Leroy C. Gaudin C. Belaich J.-P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CelA-cc and its mutant (mCelA-cc) were purified as described earlier (20Fierobe H.-P. Pagès S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.-P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CelS-ct, mS1, mS2, mS3, mS5, mS6, and mS8 were produced and purified as follows:E. coli clones were grown to A600 = 1.5 at 37 °C in 2 liters of Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with 1.2% glycerol (w/v) and 50 μg·ml−1 kanamycin. The cultures were then cooled to 15 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 16 h, the cells were centrifuged (10 min, 3000 × g), resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 4 mmCaCl2, and broken in a French press. The crude extract was then loaded onto a column containing 5–6 g of Avicel (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), equilibrated in the same buffer. The cellulose was washed with the same buffer, and the recombinant protein was eluted with distilled water. To further purify the protein of interest, the eluted fraction was supplemented with Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and CaCl2at final concentrations of 25 and 2 mm, respectively, and loaded on 3 ml of DEAE-Trisacryl (Sepracor, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France) equilibrated with the same buffer. The elution was performed using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing pure recombinant protein were pooled and dialyzed using ultrafiltration (cutoff of 10 kDa; Millipore, Bedford, MA) by several concentration/dilution steps in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), Cohesin-containing constructs were biotinylated using biotinyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester at a 15-fold molar ratio of reagent to protein as described previously (33Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 138-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The cohesin-containing constructs from both species retained normal binding activity to both cellulose and dockerin-containing enzymes and were recognized by avidin probes. The affinity blotting procedure was carried out essentially as described previously (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of the mutated dockerin constructs were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were reacted with biotinylated cohesin-containing constructs from either C. thermocellum or C. cellulolyticum(Coh-ct and Coh-cc, respectively) and developed using ExtrAvidin-horseradish peroxidase complexes (1:2000 dilution, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Experiments were performed as described earlier (20Fierobe H.-P. Pagès S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.-P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), using 10 mm Tris-maleate (pH 6.8), 0.15 m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.005% P20 (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) as running buffer (flow rate 25 μl min−1). Biotinylated cohesin-containing constructs (∼100 resonance units) were immobilized onto streptavidin-bearing sensor chips. The cellulases were diluted in the same buffer (final concentrations ranging from 5 nm to 1 μm) and allowed to interact with the immobilized receptor by injections of 600 s. The cellulosome is a cohesive enzyme complex of exceptional stability. To dissociate the cellulosome from C. thermocellum into its component parts, the presence of detergent at elevated temperatures is required (14Lamed R. Bayer E.A. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1988; 33: 1-46Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Wu J.H.D. Orme-Johnson W.H. Demain A.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1703-1709Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The observed stability of the cellulosome is a function of the very high affinity interaction between two different types of module; i.e. the single dockerin domain of the individual enzyme subunits and the multiple copies of the cohesin domain on the scaffoldin subunit (35Tokatlidis K. Salamitou S. Béguin P. Dhurjati P. Aubert J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Tokatlidis K. Dhurjati P. Béguin P. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent attempts in our laboratory to control the specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction have met with partial success. By interconverting four predicted recognition residues of the dockerins from C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum (21Pagès S. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), a new specificity was created whereby the modified dockerin of one species now recognized the cohesin of the other (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Following these studies, it was of interest to try to refine this interaction further, by pinpointing whether fewer than four residues may account for the specificity of binding between the two species. On the other hand, the inability to neutralize completely the cohesin-dockerin interaction within the same species implicated additional residues as auxiliary specificity determinants, and we thus revisited the potential contribution of other dockerin sites to the observed specificity. To determine the minimal changes necessary to create the new interspecies specificity, progressive mutations of the four putative recognition residues were designed. These particular mutations were carried out at positions 10 and 11 of the two duplicated segments of the dockerin domain in both species (Table II). Thus, mutants of theC. thermocellum CelS dockerin exhibited single mutations at these positions in the first duplicated segment (mutants mS1 and mS2), mutations of both of the latter positions in each duplicated segment alone (mS3 and mS4), and the four-residue mutant (mS5 in the present study, equivalent to mCelS-ct as described previously (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). The mutant dockerin construct of the C. cellulolyticum CelA enzyme (mCelA-cc) was used as a cross-species reference and corresponded to the previously reported (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A.

Blank spaces indicate no mutation at the designated residue. The various C. thermocellum mutant dockerins were overexpressed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and the resultant blots were challenged with a cohesin probe derived from either species. The results are presented in Fig.1. Strikingly, the conversion of a single amino acid residue in the CelS dockerin was enough to create a new specific interaction with the C. cellulolyticum cohesin (Fig. 1 A). In this context, it was clear that the common denominator for interaction of a dockerin mutant with the cross-species cohesin was the presence of a leucine instead of a threonine at position 11 in the first duplicated segment. Thus, mutants mS2, mS3, and mS5 interacted strongly with Coh-cc, whereas mS1 and mS4 failed to do so. Indeed, this result reflects the conservation of hydroxy-amino acids in this particular position of the knownC. thermocellum dockerins and hydrophobic residues of theC. cellulolyticum dockerins (TableIII). It is not clear, however, why mutation of the other conserved residues in positions 10 and 11 (notably the interconversion of serine to alanine in position 10) appears not to be strictly required for interspecies recognition between these two species of dockerin.Table IIIDistribution of amino acid residues at critical positions in the known dockerins of C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticumPositionsDuplicated segment 1Duplicated segment 21011182210111822Ct3-aBased on 20 known dockerin sequences from C. thermocellum enzymes.0.95 S0.95 T, S1.00 R0.75 K, R (g, n)1.00 S1.00 T, S0.90 R (k)0.95 R, K (g)Cc 3-bBased on 12 known dockerin sequences from C. cellulolyticum enzymes.1.00 A1.00 L, I0.75 K (q, n)0.42 G (t, a, d, n, s, l)1.00 A0.90 L, I (v, f)0.50 K (a, v, m, s, q)0.67 G (s, t)The percentage occurrence of the indicated consensus residues are shown.

Open table in a new tab The percentage occurrence of the indicated consensus residues are shown. Non-consensus residues that appear at a given position are included parenthetically in lowercase letters. In our previous study (26Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.-P. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we showed that the four-residue mutant, mS5, clearly recognized the cross-species cohesin probe. Nevertheless, the strong binding of its own cohesin was retained. In the present work, we sought additional sites that might reduce or abolish such intra-species self-recognition while maintaining the newly created binding specificity between the two species. For this purpose, positions 18 and 22 of the two duplicated segments of the CelS dockerin were chosen as targets for site-directed mutagenesis. The basis for selection of these four positions was 2-fold. First, the character of these residues is quite well conserved, especially in theC. thermocellum dockerins (Table III). Second, according to PHD prediction (Profile network prediction HeiDelberg) of solvent accessibility (37Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar, 38Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 39Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these four residues are predicted to be in exposed positions in the dockerin structure (TableIV). According to the prediction, positions 17 may also be exposed (Table IV), but the dockerins ofboth C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum almost invariably show a lysine at this position (position 21), and interconversion in this case would thus be irrelevant.Table IVPredicted solvent accessibility for dockerin residuesAccording to PHD: Profile network prediction HeiDelberg (39Rost B.

Rel, reliability index of prediction (0–9). In view of the above, mutations in positions 18 and 22 of the duplicated segments were performed to accompany the mutations at positions 10 and 11 (Table II). Thus, the arginines in positions 18 were mutated to lysines in mutant mS6, and the basic residues at positions 22 of the two duplicated segments (arginine and lysine, respectively) were mutated to glycines in mS7. Mutant mS8 comprised the combined four-residue mutation in addition to the mutations at positions 10 and 11. In the latter two mutants, mutation to glycine was chosen for position 22 of segment 1 instead of alanine as in the CelA dockerin from C. cellulolyticum, because glycine is more prevalent at this position among all of the known cellulosomal enzymes of this species (Table III). The consequences of these mutations are shown in Fig. 1. In accord with the above bioinformatics-based prediction, mutants mS7 and mS8 (mutated in positions 10, 11, 22, and/or 18) indeed displayed a visible reduction in their self-recognition of the C. thermocellumcohesin (Coh-ct), compared with those of the native CelS-ct and mutants mS1 through mS5 (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, mutant mS6 (mutated in positions 10, 11, 18, but not 22) retained a higher level of interaction with Coh-ct. It thus follows that position 22 is an important determinant in dockerin recognition. Nevertheless, unlike the native C. cellulolyticum-derived enzyme (CelA-cc) that failed to bind Coh-ct, both mutants mS7 and mS8 bound clearly to their own cohesin (Coh-ct) as described above. This indicates that, in theC. thermocellum system, other residues, in addition to the eight designated positions, still play a role in the recognition process. On the basis of the affinity blotting data, several of the key mutants were overexpressed, purified, and subjected to analysis by surface plasmon resonance, using immobilized forms of the two species of cohesins and the BIAcore system. The results are presented in TableV. In general, the data are in total accord with the blots and provide numerical values for the binding of the individual mutant dockerins to either species of cohesin. It is worthwhile noting that the observed affinity characteristics for the cohesin-dockerin interaction in C. thermocellum were found to be much higher than those of C. cellulolyticum. The calculated affinity constant for the mesophilic C. cellulolyticum system (∼1010m−1) was in itself indicative of a very high affinity interaction and in accord with previously reported values (20Fierobe H.-P. Pagès S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.-P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the thermophilic system, the affinity constants were even higher and essentially exceeded the upper limits (>1011m−1) of the BIAcore system. It should be noted that such a high affinity may be required to maintain tight binding under thermophilic conditions. In any case, the cohesin-dockerin complex in the C. thermocellum system represents one of the highest protein-protein affinity interactions known in nature, rivaling many other very high affinity associations, e.g.receptor-effector and enzyme-inhibitor pairs (40Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Biomol. Eng. 1999; 16: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Table VAffinity constants for binding of wild-type and mutant dockerin-borne enzymes to immobilized cohesinsLigandImmobilized receptorCoh-ctCoh-cckonkoffKDkonkoffKDm−1s−1s−1mm−1s−1s−1mCelS-ct>107<10−4<10−11No bindingamS1>107<10−4<10−11No bindingñThe immobilized cohesin receptors and enzyme ligands were derived fromC. thermocellum (ct) and C. cellulolyticum (cc).

Open table in a new tab The immobilized cohesin receptors and enzyme ligands were derived fromC. thermocellum (ct) and C. cellulolyticum (cc). Values were obtained by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore system. With respect to the selectivity of cohesin-dockerin recognition, the critical mutation in mutant mS2 (in which the threonine at position 11 of the first duplicated segment was converted to leucine) generated a novel high affinity interaction with the C. cellulolyticumcohesin. Compared with the native dockerin-bearing enzyme, this single mutation differentiated between a lack of detectable binding and a tenacious cross-species cohesin-dockerin interaction, characterized by a measurable dissociation constant of 5 × 10−9m. It is interesting to note that all of theC. thermocellum dockerin mutants that carried the Thr-11 → Leu mutation exhibited similarly high rates of association for Coh-cc (∼106m−1s−1), resembling that of CelA-cc, i.e. the native enzyme from C. cellulolyticum (Table V). Also of note are the consistently higher koff values for the mutants, compared with CelA-cc, indicating a shorter half-life for their complexes with the C. cellulolyticum cohesin. In the complementary system, the four mutations in the dockerin of CelA-cc gained a similarly high affinity constant (3.3 × 109m−1) with Coh-ct, whereas the native enzyme showed no measurable binding with the cross-species cohesin. With respect to intra-species cohesin-dockerin recognition, the preference of a given dockerin mutant to either of the two species of cohesins could be quantified by comparing the ratio of affinity constants (see Fig. 2). Due to the very high affinity constants for the C. thermocellum system, most of the CelS-derived mutants showed a clear preference for self-recognition of Coh-ct. However, as the number of mutations increased, a trend toward preference for Coh-cc prevailed. Indeed, mutant mS8 exhibited a detectable preference for cross-species recognition. In the reverse direction, the CelA-derived mutant (mCelA-cc) clearly favored interaction with the rival cohesin. It is interesting to note that this mutant is counter-equivalent to mS5 in its mutation pattern (i.e. in positions 10 and 11). Again, the measurable difference in cross-species recognition between these two mutants may be attributed to the higher affinity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction of the thermophilic system. The exchange of a single threonine for leucine in the C. thermocellum dockerin generated cross-species recognition with a C. cellulolyticum cohesin. This implies that the major difference between these two residues,i.e. the lack of a hydroxyl group in leucine compared with threonine, represents the molecular basis for the newly gained specificity. The presence or absence of this single decisive hydroxyl group at the specified position in the C. thermocellumdockerin thus appears to be critical to the specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction in this species. It is remarkable that such a small difference would differentiate between a very high affinity interaction and essentially no detectable interaction at all. This phenomenon also implies a complementary distinction on the surfaces of the two cohesin species. Specifically, it may be expected that the C. cellulolyticum cohesin would exhibit a more hydrophobic microenvironment at a given, yet unidentified locale, which may account for the observed change of specificity in the mutated dockerin. No less remarkable, perhaps, is the fact that the dockerin could be subjected to such a broad number of mutations without abolishing self-recognition of its own cohesin. Thus, the C. thermocellum dockerin could be mutated at positions 10, 11, 18, and 22 in both duplicated segments, encompassing a series of one to eight mutations of the 67-residue dockerin domain, and the entire spectrum of mutated constructs recognized the cohesin of C. cellulolyticum as well as its own. This suggests that the two species of cohesin-dockerin pairs are, perhaps, much more similar than originally presumed (21Pagès S. Belaich A. Belaich J.-P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the precise molecular determinants that dictate binding specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction will probably be resolved by three-dimensional structure determination of cohesin-dockerin complexes from different species. To date, however, both crystallogenesis and NMR spectroscopy of such complexes have proved elusive. In the interim, indirect approaches, such as site-directed or random mutagenesis of the different components, should continue to provide us with clues into the molecular determinants of the tenacious cohesin-dockerin interaction. We appreciate the preparation of mutants mS3 and mS5 by Dr. Sima Yaron."

To investigate whether increased levels of maspin protect against tumor progression in vivo, we established a transgenic model in which maspin is targeted to mammary epithelial cells by the Whey Acidic Protein (WAP) promoter for overexpression. We crossed these WAP-maspin transgenic mice with the WAP-TAg mouse model of tumor progression. Maspin overexpression increased the rate of apoptosis of both preneoplastic and carcinomatous mammary epithelial cells. Maspin reduced tumor growth through a combination of reduced angiogenesis and increased apoptosis. The number of pulmonary metastases was reduced in the presence of maspin overexpression. These data demonstrate that targeted overexpression of maspin can inhibit tumor progression in vivo, likely through a combination of increased apoptosis, decreased angiogenesis, and inhibition of tumor cell migration."

In animals and plants, a major route for leucine catabolism has been demonstrated to be located in the mitochondrion (24Weinstock S.B. Kopito R.R. Endemann G. Tomera J.F. Marinier E. Murray D.M.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The pathway proceeds through the production of α-ketoisocaproate, isovaleryl-CoA, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, and 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA (Scheme FS1) to give 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA),1 which is then cleaved by a lyase to produce acetyl CoA and acetoacetate. The acetyl-CoA generated in this way can be either fed into the citric acid cycle or alternatively transported out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol, where the acetyl-CoA may be utilized for the biosynthesis of a range of compounds including fatty acids and isoprenoids such as sterols. The entry of the acetyl-CoA into the isoprenoid pathway requires the regeneration of HMG-CoA, which is then reduced to mevalonic acid (Scheme FS1). Conclusive evidence that leucine enters isoprenoids in plants by this indirect route and involving production of acetyl-CoA has been provided by incubation of 13C-labeled leucine with a callus culture ofAndrographis paniculata (19Anastasis, P., Freer, I., Overton, K.

We have demonstrated previously (12Ginger M.L. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Ginger M.L. Prescott M.C. Reynolds D.G. Chance M.L.

However, by contrast, [1-14C]acetate was readily incorporated into fatty acids but poorly utilized for sterol production. These observations are incompatible with a route inLeishmania that requires leucine degradation to proceed to acetyl CoA before reutilization for isoprenoid production (19Anastasis, P., Freer, I., Overton, K.

We have therefore undertaken the studies described here to investigate the metabolic route whereby L. mexicana uses leucine for sterol biosynthesis, since this may produce evidence for a target for new antileishmanial drug development. [1-14C]Acetate, sodium salt (57 mCi/mmol), and [U-14C]leucine (299–314 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [2-13C]Leucine (99% enrichment) was obtained from Promochem (Welwyn Garden City, UK). [2-13C]Acetate, [1-13C]glucose, ketoconazole, and mevalonic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Compound L-659,699 was a gift from Merck. The strain of Leishmania used in this study was L. mexicana (MNYC/62/BZ/M379). Promastigotes were cultured at 26 °C in HO-minimum essential medium (26Berens R.L. Brun R. Krassner S.M. J. Parasitol. 1976; 62: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.14C- and 13C-labeled substrates were added to the media to give the final concentrations indicated under “Results.” Cell density of cultures was determined by counting using a Neubauer hemocytometer. Cultures were normally established with an initial cell density of 106 cells/ml; at the termination of the culture period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation as described previously (12Ginger M.L. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Haughan P.A. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lovastatin was administered to cultures from a stock solution (2 mg/ml) in Me2SO; compound L-659,699 was dissolved (2 mg/ml) in sterile H2O saturated with NaHCO3 for administration to the cultures. Amastigotes were obtained after the infection of macrophages isolated from the peritoneal cavities of female CD1 mice with stationary phase promastigotes (72 h of growth) (28Bates P.A. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Haughan P.A. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Promastigotes were allowed to infect macrophages for 24 h at 32 °C before the medium overlying the macrophages was decanted. The cells were rinsed with Locke's solution (containing the following per liter: 9 g of NaCl, 0.42 g of KCl, 0.4 g of CaCl2·H2O, 0.2 g of NaHCO3, and 1 g of glucose) to remove any remaining extracellular promastigotes. RPMI supplemented 15% (v/v) with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and containing [2-13C]leucine in place of unlabeled free leucine was then added to the infected macrophages, and the cultures were left at 32 °C for 48 h. At this time, amastigote forms were prepared by the method described by Haughanet al. (29Haughan P.A. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Parasite lipids were isolated after extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1) as described previously (12Ginger M.L.

J. 1995; 308: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Radioactive lipid extracts were analyzed by analytical TLC and radioscanning using silica gel TLC plates and chloroform/ethanol (98:2) as the developing solvent. Sterols were isolated and analyzed by GC or GC-MS as the TMS ether derivatives following previously described protocols (12Ginger M.L. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Haughan P.A. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Steryl acetates were prepared by treatment of the free sterol with pyridine/acetic anhydride (1:1) followed by usual work up of the steryl acetate. The steryl acetates were separated by preparative TLC on silica gel impregnated with 10% AgNO3and developed with freshly distilled chloroform. Sterols were quantified by capillary GC analysis using 5α-cholestane as a standard. The NMR spectra were measured on deuteriochloroform solutions using a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer operating at 599.9 MHz for protons and 150.9 MHz for 13C nuclei. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using the following parameters: 7000 Hz spectrum width, 3-s preacquisition delay, 90° pulse, 5-s acquisition time, 10,000 transients, 64K data points No weighting function was used before Fourier transformation. Broad band proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were obtained using the following parameters: 35,000-Hz spectrum width, 22° pulse, 0.936-s acquisition time, 70,000 transients, 64K data points, line broadening of 1 Hz before Fourier transformation. Promastigotes were cultured for 72 h in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml ketoconazole (administered from a stock solution of 1 mg/ml in Me2SO) in HO-minimum essential medium. The sterols were isolated as previously described (12Ginger M.L. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Berens R.L. Brun R. Krassner S.M. J. Parasitol. 1976; 62: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol was characterized by GC-MS and 1H NMR analyses. For the experiments studying [2-13C]leucine incorporation into the sterol, the medium contained [2-13C]leucine (78 mg/liter) in place of the unlabeled free leucine normally present. In total, 50 cultures (50 ml in each culture) were grown, and the cells were harvested in batches and extracted with 3 × 100 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) using procedures similar to the those used for the smaller scale extraction (12Ginger M.L. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Haughan P.A. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 13C-labeled N14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol was then purified from the lipid by reversed-phase HPLC using an Econosphere C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; inner diameter, 5 mm; supplied by Alltech) to separate it from cholesterol and other minor sterols. Compounds were eluted isocratically using acetonitrile/water (9:1), and sterols were detected by UV absorbance at 215 nm. The 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol was eluted at 26–30 min, and cholesterol was eluted at 32–36 min. The solvent volume of the eluate was carefully reduced by rotary evaporation, and the sterol was extracted into petroleum ether before taking to dryness and storage at −20 °C. The purity of the isolated13C-labeled 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol (∼3 mg) was checked by GC-MS and then analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy We have utilized [2-13C]leucine to investigate if the leucine carbon skeleton is incorporated by L. mexicana directly into the sterols by reduction of HMG-CoA to MVA. The major sterols of L. mexicana are cholesterol obtained from the medium, and the biosynthesized ergosta-5,7,24(241)-trien-3β-ol (4Haughan P.A. Goad L.J. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor and Francis, London1991: 312-328Google Scholar, 12Ginger M.L. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,13Ginger M.L. Prescott M.C. Reynolds D.G. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2555-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with smaller variable amounts of ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol, stigmasta-5,7,24(241)-trien-3β-ol, and precursors such as ergosta-7,24(241)-dien-3β-ol. A sterol mixture of this nature presents certain problems for the type of 13C NMR study envisaged. First, the complexity of the sterol mixture demands careful purification of one of the biosynthesized ergosta types of sterol so that signal assignments to 13C-enriched carbons can be made with accuracy and without ambiguity. Second, the major sterols of L. mexicana are Δ5,7-compounds that are notoriously unstable in small amounts due to oxidation, and this may cause difficulties in the purification, storage, and NMR analysis of these sterols. This problem has been considered in detail by Schroepfer et al. (30Wilson W.K. Sumpter R.M. Warren J.J. Rogers P.S. Ruan B.F. Schroepfer G.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1529-1555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specifically in relation to the NMR analysis of Δ5,7-sterols. Finally, the success of the study depends upon the extent of enrichment of the biosynthesized sterol with13C. A large pool of preexisting sterol from the inoculum will dilute the 13C-enriched sterol species and could make13C-enriched carbons difficult to detect. Accordingly, we looked for a new approach to the problem and decided to use an inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis. An inhibitor was required that would cause the accumulation of a large amount of a relatively stable sterol intermediate that would normally occur in only trace amounts in the parasite, so dilution of the newly synthesized [13C]sterol by preexisting material would not be significant. Sterol biosynthesis inhibitors suited to this purpose are the imadazole and triazole types of antifungal drugs. These compounds block the action of the cytochrome P450-dependent 14α-methylsterol 14-demethylase with the result that the normal sterols are depleted and one or more 14α-methylsterols accumulate, often in large amounts (31Van den Bossche H. Berg D. Plempl M. Sterol Biosynthesis Inhibitors: Pharmaceutical and Agrochemical Aspects. Ellis Harwood Ltd., Chichester, UK1988: 79-119Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that antifungal imidazoles and triazoles also inhibit the 14α-demethylation step in sterol biosynthesis in severalLeishmania species with the resulting appearance of 4α,14α-dimethylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol and 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol in appreciable amounts (4Haughan P.A. Goad L.J. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor and Francis, London1991: 312-328Google Scholar, 6Goad L.J. Holz Jr., G.G. Beach D.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 257-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These 14α-methylsterols are considerably more stable during isolation, storage, and NMR analysis than are Δ5,7-sterols. Consequently, we decided that using the 14-demethylase inhibitor ketoconazole offered the best opportunity for the isolation of a pure 13C-enriched sterol undiluted by preexisting endogenous sterol, which was required for the13C NMR analysis to determine the route of incorporation of leucine into the isoprenoid pathway. Preliminary experiments were first undertaken to determine the optimum conditions for incubation of the L. mexicana promastigotes with ketoconazole to accumulate a 14α-methylsterol in sufficient amount for isolation and 13C NMR analysis. The incubation of promastigotes of L. mexicana with ketoconazole (0.1 and 1.0 μg/ml) for 72 h followed by isolation and GC-MS examination of the sterols showed that, as anticipated, the ergosta-5,7,24(241)-trien-3β-ol found in the control was replaced by 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol in the ketoconazole-treated cultures (TableI). Cholesterol taken up from the medium was present in both the control and treated cells. The 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol was identified by the mass spectrum of the TMS ether and by the 1H NMR spectrum (6Goad L.J. Holz Jr., G.G. Beach D.H. Mol. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab Promastigotes of L. mexicana (1.0 × 106cells/ml) were cultured for 72 h alone (control) or in the presence of 0.1 or 1.0 μg/ml ketoconazole. The cell density was determined at the end of the growth period, and the cells were harvested, the lipid was extracted, and the sterols were isolated and analyzed by GC-MS as described under “Materials and Methods”; tr indicates trace amount (<0.5%). Ketoconazole at 0.1 μg/ml retarded growth by only about 5% compared with the control, and the total sterol content of the treated cells was ∼70% of the control value. At the higher ketoconazole concentration (1.0 μg/ml), the growth was around 75% of the control, and the total sterol was about 50% of the control. In a further experiment, theL. mexicana promastigotes were incubated with ketoconazole (0.1 μg/ml) and [U-14C]leucine (2.6 μCi) for 72 h to ensure that the accumulating 14α-methylsterol was being biosynthesized from leucine derived from the medium rather than from some internal source of unlabeled precursor(s). The lipids were extracted and found to contain 4.2% of the radioactivity added to the culture medium, while analytical TLC with radioscanning showed that the 14α-methylsterol was the major labeled material. Recovery of the labeled sterol from the TLC plate, acetylation, and rechromatography by TLC on silver nitrate-impregnated silica gel showed that the radioactivity accompanied a material with the sameR f as 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-yl acetate. The above experiments showed that our approach to obtain a pure sterol for the 13C NMR analysis was feasible. Therefore, multiple cultures (50 × 50 ml) of L. mexicanapromastigotes were grown in HO-minimum essential medium (plus 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) in which the free (i.e. nonprotein) leucine was replaced with [2-13C]leucine, and 0.1 μg/ml ketoconazole was added. The cells were cultured for 72 h and harvested, and the lipid was extracted. The total sterol was isolated from the lipid, and the 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol was then separated from the cholesterol and other minor sterols by HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”). The cholesterol was shown by GC-MS analysis to contain only the natural abundance of 13C, and there was no detectable labeling from the [2-13C]leucine. This observation established unequivocally that the cholesterol inL. mexicana must be taken up from the medium and that it is not the product of de novo synthesis in the parasite. The purity of the isolated 14α-methylergosta-8,24(241)-dien-3β-ol (∼3 mg) was 95% as judged by GC analysis. The mass spectrum of the TMS ether showed clusters of ions for the molecular and fragment ions arising from several labeled species of the sterol containing from one to six13C atoms (Fig. 1). Ions due to unlabeled sterol were very minor, showing that there was excellent incorporation of [2-13C]leucine into the sterol in accord with our previous studies with [U-14C]leucine incorporation, which had revealed that at least 80% of the sterol carbon originated from leucine (12Ginger M.L.

The fragment ion clusters atm/z 469–475 and 379–385, which arise by loss of a methyl and methyl and TMSOH from the [M]+ ion, respectively, showed a similar distribution of molecular species containing 1–6 13C-enriched positions (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2326770408,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, Rb, is a transcription cofactor that controls cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Mutant mouse embryos lacking Rb exhibit ectopic proliferation and apoptosis that are mediated in some tissues by E2F1, a major partner of Rb, and by the p53 tumor suppressor. Whether E2F1 and p53 also mediate the differentiation defects in Rb mutant embryos is, however, not clear. Here we show that partially rescued mgRb:Rb-/- mutant fetuses exhibit ectopic lens epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis and severe cataract. The abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis were significantly suppressed in the lens of compound mutant fetuses lacking both Rb and E2F1 at embryonic day (E) E15.5. Interestingly however, at E18.5, only ectopic proliferation, not apoptosis, was dramatically reduced in mgRb:Rb-/-:E2F1-/- lenses. In contrast, p53 did not exert such a stage-specific effect and apoptosis was invariably suppressed in mgRb:Rb-/-:p53-/- composite mutant lenses throughout embryogenesis. Using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses, we identified a subset of lens specific genes, most notably the late differentiation marker filensin, which were not properly induced during lens development in mgRb:Rb-/-fetuses. Remarkably, despite the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis, the degeneration of lens fibers and aberrant expression of filensin were only marginally corrected in mgRb:Rb-/-:E2F1-/- fetuses at E15.5 but not at all at E18.5 or in mgRb:Rb-/-:p53-/mutant fetuses. Thus, inactivation of E2F1 reduces ectopic cell proliferation and stage-specific p53-dependent apoptosis but does not rescue the differentiation defects associated with loss of Rb during lens development."
https://openalex.org/W2319850374,"To develop a new approach to the treatment of primitive neuroectodermal tumors we evaluated the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin on the Ewing's sarcoma cell line CHP-100. Lovastatin induced neural morphology and markers including neuron-specific enolase and neurofilament protein. The acquisition of neural morphology required new mRNA synthesis, and cDNA microarray analysis confirmed that lovastatin altered the program of gene expression. After morphologic differentiation the cells underwent rapidly progressive apoptosis. In normal development of neuronal progenitors, differentiation signals trigger p21WAF1 accumulation, RB hypophosphorylation, enhanced RB-E2F-1 association, and G1 arrest, and these events have been shown to protect from apoptosis. In contrast, in the Ewing's sarcoma cells lovastatin triggered differentiation without causing cell cycle arrest: p21WAF1 was not induced, RB remained hyperphosphorylated, and RB protein expression and RB-E2F-1 association were markedly downregulated, suggesting that loss of an RB-regulated G1 checkpoint promoted apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, adenoviral p21WAF1 decreased DNA synthesis and partially protected from lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity. The data demonstrate a new model for examining the genetic regulation of cell fate in a neural progenitor tumor and suggest a new approach to the treatment of this neoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2313234843,"Constitutive expression of the activated Rap1A protein inhibits differentiation of myogenic C2 cells whereas the inactivated Rap1A protein favours cell differentiation and induces late endocytic compartments clustering. Although the role of Rap1A in MAPK activation has been analysed in various cell types, the signalling pathways activated by Rap1A have not been explored in myogenic cells. In this study, we investigated MAP kinase activity in control C2 myoblasts and in stable C2 cell lines expressing mutated Rap1A proteins. We provide evidence that Rap1A mutants promote ERK activation and that the active protein induces a more sustained activation than the inactive protein. In addition, we established that various pathways mediate transient ERK activation in control cells and in cells expressing the inactivated Rap1A protein. In these cells, ERK are activated by a Raf/MEK-dependent pathway, a P13K/Raf-independent pathway and a third undetermined pathway. In cells expressing the activated Rap1A protein, a PI3K/Raf/MEK-dependent pathway mediates transient ERK activation. However, MAPK activation appears more complex since, according to the state of the myoblasts or the duration of MAPK stimulation, we observed that Rap1A protein could interfere or not with ERK activation."

An increase in gene transcription upon proteasome inhibition was found for a group of proteins, including p21WAF1/CIP1, ubiquitin, and transcription factors. In this study, we have demonstrated selective up-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) mRNA and protein expression upon treatment with peptide-based proteasome inhibitors or lactacystin. ERK3 is a family member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (also called ERK) that are key mediators of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. ERK3 up-regulation is independent of the p53, Bcl2, and caspase 3 status of cells. p38 pathway kinase inhibitors prevent proteasome-dependent ERK3 induction and enhance the antiproliferative effect of proteasome inhibitors. MCF-7 cells expressing ERK3 ectopically show increased resistance toward proteasome inhibition. The results indicate that ERK3 expression is a consequence of p38 pathway activation and most probably represents an intracellular defense or rescue mechanism against cell stress and damage induced by proteasome inhibition."

The overexpressed P46 protein was appropriately targeted to hepatocyte microsomes and caused a 58% increase in glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis in nondetergent-treated (intact) microsomal preparations relative to controls, whereas overexpression of P36 caused a 3.6-fold increase.

One way of gaining insight into this issue is to overexpress selectively single components of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex. Thus, our laboratory has previously used recombinant adenovirus to overexpress P36 in INS-1 insulinoma cells (14Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Expression of P36 caused clear increases in glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis in both cultured cell models (14Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

However, the extent of overexpression of P36 in the INS-1 study (10-fold) was larger than the increment in glucose production measured by a3H2O incorporation assay (4-fold), raising the possibility that other components of the complex such as P46 might contribute to the overall rate at which Glc-6-P is hydrolyzed.The purpose of the current study was to investigate the potential regulatory role of P46 in the glucose-6-phosphatase complex by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the protein in rat hepatocytes. We find that overexpression of P46 increases Glc-6-P hydrolysis in intact microsomes, although not to the same extent as overexpression of the catalytic subunit. Overexpression of P46 also causes pronounced inhibition of glycogen synthesis and activation of glycogenolysis, but has only small effects on glycolysis, whereas overexpression of P36 has potent effects on both pathways. The preferential effect of P46 overexpression on glycogen metabolism may be related to its capacity to enhance the hydrolysis of a hexose phosphate intermediate of glycogen metabolism, glucose 1-phosphate.DISCUSSIONThe cDNA encoding the T1 translocase/P46 component of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex was cloned originally on the basis of its homology to the bacterial gene products UhpT, GlpT, and UhpC, which are hexose phosphate transporter, glycerol phosphate transporter, and hexose phosphate receptor proteins, respectively (7Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 8Van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Gerin I. Moukil M. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. Molecular Pathogenesis of MODYs. 15. Karger, Basel2000: 136-152Google Scholar). The transcript corresponding to the putative P46 clone was found to be expressed at highest levels in liver and kidney, consistent with a role in the gluconeogenic glucose-6-phosphatase complex. The strongest evidence that the newly cloned gene was a component of the mammalian glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme complex was the identification of mutations in the gene in two human subjects with type 1b glycogen storage disease (11Veiga-da-Cunha M. Gerin I. Chen Y.T. de Barsy T. de Lonlay P. Dionisi-Vici C. Fenske C.D. Lee P.J. Leonard J.V. Maire I. McConkie-Rossel A. Schweitzer S. Vikkula M. Van Schaftingen E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the precise biochemical function of P46 in mammalian cells has not been elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to provide insight into the metabolic and biochemical properties of this protein through its adenovirus-mediated overexpression in isolated rat hepatocytes.Type 1b glycogen storage disease is characterized by an absence of glucose-6-phosphatase enzymatic activity in intact liver microsomes but normal or elevated activity in detergent-disrupted preparations (12Narisawa K. Igarashi Y. Tada K. Enzyme ( Basel ). 1987; 38: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical phenotype of type 1b glycogen storage disease patients lends support to the substrate-transport model for the glucose-6-phosphatase complex, in which the role of P46 is suggested to be as an ER-localized transporter for glucose 6-phosphate, allowing the luminally oriented Glc-6-Pase catalytic subunit to gain access to its substrate (2Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls E.H. Ballas I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate-transport model in its original form held that the translocase function was rate-limiting for the system, based on higher rates of glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis in detergent-disrupted compared with intact microsomes. However, subsequent rapid kinetic studies revealed that in the first 10 s, rates of glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis are equal in intact and disrupted microsomes, whereas at longer time points the rate decreases in the intact preparations but maintains linearity in the disrupted ones (31Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was interpreted to indicate a close interaction of the translocase and phosphohydrolase components of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex, with regulation of activity through a conformational change in one or both interacting proteins (3van de Werve G. Lange A. Newgard C. Mechin M.-C. Li Y. Berteloot A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1533-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tight association of the two proteins is supported by recent studies in which knock-out of the Glc-6-Pase catalytic subunit causes loss of glucose 6-phosphate transport into microsomes (27Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Mansfiel B.C. Chou J.-Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).The current study provides the first demonstration that overexpression of P46 is sufficient to enhance the activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme complex. Key data supporting this point include the following. 1) The P46 transgene product is targeted to a microsome-enriched fraction, suggesting normal delivery of the overexpressed protein to the endoplasmic reticulum in intact cells. 2) Overexpression of P46 enhances glucose 6-phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate hydrolysis in intact microsomes, without an effect on total phosphohydrolase activity in disrupted microsomes. However, the data also show that the impact of P46 overexpression on Glc-6-P hydrolysis in intact microsomes is much less than the effect of overexpression of P36, suggesting that most of the flux control is vested in the phosphohydrolase component of the complex. These data do not clearly support or refute any of the foregoing models of glucose-6-phosphatase complex function, since the increased Glc-6-P hydrolysis observed with P46 overexpression can be accommodated by the substrate transport model or a conformational model. 3) Overexpression of P46 clearly inhibits glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes from fasted rats and also causes activation of glycogenolysis in hepatocytes from fed rats. Interestingly, P46 overexpression has minimal effects on lactate production or [3-3H]glucose usage, in contrast to the more pronounced effects of overexpressed P36. Overexpressed P46 is also much less effective than overexpressed P36 at countering the enhancement of glycolytic flux and glycogen synthesis induced by glucokinase overexpression.Our work has uncovered a surprising heterogeneity in the handling of various hexose phosphates by the intact glucose-6-phosphatase system. Thus, we have shown that both Glc-1-P and Fru-6-P are hydrolyzed by intact microsomes from control hepatocytes, although at approximately one-third to one-half the rate of Glc-6-P when all of these hexose phosphates are present at a concentration of 10 mm. Moreover, overexpression of P46 increases Glc-1-P, but not Fru-6-P hydrolysis, suggesting that the former sugar may be a real physiological substrate for the glucose-6-phosphatase system. These findings also suggest a mechanism by which P46 overexpression preferentially impairs glycogen metabolism relative to its minimal effects on glycolysis in hepatocytes from fasted rats, while also explaining why P46 overexpression increases glycogenolysis in glycogen-replete cells. Glc-1-P is a hexose phosphate intermediate that is specific to glycogen metabolism. Enhanced hydrolysis of Glc-1-P during periods of glycogen synthesis would reduce the amount of substrate for the UDPG pyrophosphorylase reaction, whose product UDP-glucose is the immediate precursor of glycogen synthesis. In glycogen-replete hepatocytes with P46 overexpression subjected to a sudden drop in glucose concentration, depletion of Glc-1-P would alter the equilibrium of the glycogen phosphorylase reaction in favor of glycogen degradation and Glc-1-P formation.Although the ability of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex to hydrolyze Glc-1-P seems to explain the specific effects of overexpressed P46 on glycogen metabolism, we have also considered the possibility that P46 facilitates specific interactions between the glucose-6-phosphatase complex with proteins or enzymes that regulate glycogen metabolism. There is growing evidence that glucose disposal in general, and glycogen metabolism in particular, are spatially organized pathways within liver cells. For example, in the fasted state, cytosolic glucokinase enzyme activity is low due to sequestration of the enzyme in the nucleus via its binding to an inhibitory glucokinase regulatory protein (32Van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. Veiga da Cunha M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Agius L. Peak M. Biochem.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the postprandial state, glucose stimulates the translocation of glucokinase from the nucleus to the cytosol. The enzymes of glycogen metabolism also exhibit spatial organization. Thus, in liver cells, glycogen synthase is translocated from an intracellular site to the cell membrane in response to glucose and insulin, resulting in synthesis of glycogen in a gradient from the membrane surface toward the interior of the cell (3van de Werve G. Lange A. Newgard C. Mechin M.-C. Li Y. Berteloot A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1533-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35Fernandez-Novell J.M. Roca A. Bellido D. Vilaro S.

J. 1997; 321: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Controlled movement of glycogen synthase within cells is complemented by targeting of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) to the glycogen particle. This targeting is facilitated by glycogen targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1, which also appear to bind to the key enzymes of glycogen metabolism, thereby serving as a molecular scaffold for glycogen synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 37Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The existence of this glycogen “metabolon” (38Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), coupled with the remarkable organization of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex, suggests the possibility that these two metabolic machines could interact. Further work will be required to determine whether such interaction actually occurs, and if so, the role of the P46 T1 translocase in this process.The findings described herein may also have relevance to understanding of regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism and the control of blood glucose homeostasis. Hepatic glycogen stores are decreased in all forms of human diabetes (39Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 40Cline G.W. Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Katz L.D. Shulman G.I. J. Clin.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms responsible for this defect are not well understood. One possibility is enhanced flux through the glucose-6-phosphatase complex. Consistent with this idea, it has recently been demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes have a reduced capacity to regulate endogenous glucose production by glucose per se, leading the authors to suggest that regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase is impaired (42Mevorach M. Giacca A. Aharon Y. Hawkins M. Shamoon H. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 744-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To date, investigation of the molecular basis of up-regulated glucose-6-phosphatase activity in diabetes has focused on the expression of the P36 catalytic subunit, leading to the finding that P36 expression is increased in response to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in rodents and cultured cells (30Scott D.K.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 153-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that P46 expression was also up-regulated in diabetes (45Li Y.Z. Méchin M.-C. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33866-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), mainly by hyperglycemia (46Li Y.Z. van de Werve G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential contribution of changes in expression and activity of the P46 subunit should be considered more carefully, particularly with regard to its effect on hepatic glycogen storage in type 2 diabetes. The glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme complex catalyzes the final step of gluconeogenesis. The complex is composed of a catalytic subunit of 36 kDa (P36)1sequestered within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a 46-kDa glucose-6-phosphate translocase known as P46 or T1 that delivers glucose 6-phosphate to the catalytic subunit, and putative ER glucose and inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporters (T2 and T3) that move the reaction products back into the cytosol (1Nordlie R.C.

Whereas the human genetic studies clearly demonstrate that both the P36 and P46 gene products are required for normal glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) hydrolysis, the relative contributions made by these proteins to the hydrolytic rate, and to overall regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, are incompletely understood. One way of gaining insight into this issue is to overexpress selectively single components of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex. Thus, our laboratory has previously used recombinant adenovirus to overexpress P36 in INS-1 insulinoma cells (14Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

However, the extent of overexpression of P36 in the INS-1 study (10-fold) was larger than the increment in glucose production measured by a3H2O incorporation assay (4-fold), raising the possibility that other components of the complex such as P46 might contribute to the overall rate at which Glc-6-P is hydrolyzed. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the potential regulatory role of P46 in the glucose-6-phosphatase complex by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the protein in rat hepatocytes. We find that overexpression of P46 increases Glc-6-P hydrolysis in intact microsomes, although not to the same extent as overexpression of the catalytic subunit. Overexpression of P46 also causes pronounced inhibition of glycogen synthesis and activation of glycogenolysis, but has only small effects on glycolysis, whereas overex"

Efficient loading of many MHC class II alleles with peptides requires the assistance of H2-M (HLA-DM in humans), a heterodimeric MHC class II-like molecule that facilitates CLIP removal from MHC class II molecules and aids to shape the peptide repertoire presented by MHC class II to CD4+ T cells. In contrast to the HLA-DM region in humans, the β-chain locus is duplicated in mice, with theH2-Mb1 beta-chain distal to H2-Mb2 and the H2-Ma alpha-chain gene. H2-M alleles appear to be associated with the development of autoimmune diseases. Recent data showed that Mβ1 and Mβ2 isoforms are differentially expressed in isolated macrophages and B cells, respectively. The tissue expression and functional role of these heterodimers in promoting CLIP removal and peptide selection have not been addressed. We utilized the human T2 cell line, which lacks part of chromosome 6 encompassing the MHC class II and DM genes, to construct transgenic cell lines expressing the MHC class II heterodimer I-Aq alone or in the presence of H2-Mαβ1 or H2-Mαβ2 heterodimers. Both H2-M isoforms facilitate the exchange of CLIP for cognate peptides on I-Aq molecules from arthritis-susceptible DBA/1 mice and induce a conformational change in I-Aq molecules. Moreover, I-Aq cell-surface expression is not absolutely dependent on H2-M molecules. These data suggest that I-Aq exhibits a high affinity for CLIP since virtually all I-Aq molecules on T2 cells were found to be associated with CLIP in the absence of both H2-M isoforms.

Both arthritogenic T and B cells are instrumental in initiating and perpetuating the debilitating disease. The dissociation of the capacity to induce a strong anti-CII-directed antibody response without developing arthritis or to induce an immune response ultimately leading to arthritis indicates that qualitative differences in humoral and/or cellular immune responses exist (1Courtenay J.S.

Thus, efficient degradation, processing, and presentation of the autoantigen CII may play a role in whether an “arthritogenic” immune response ensues or not. In contrast, not only the antigen-presenting cell, but also the B and T cell repertoire influences the evolution of an autoimmune response. CD4+ T cells with an arthritogenic potential have been described and are able to initiate arthritis in DBA/1 mice (9Osman G.E. Cheunsuk S. Allen S.E. Chi E. Liggitt H.D. Hood L.E. Ladiges W.C. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, to activate, expand, and maintain these CII-specific T cells, the antigen CII has to be taken up, processed, and presented by appropriate antigen-presenting cells by I-Aq molecules. Previous studies have indicated that substantial differences exist pertaining to the ability of different antigen-presenting cells to effectively present CII to T cell hybridomas. To stimulate CD4+ T cells, MHC class II molecules must be loaded with peptides provided by endogenous or exogenous proteins. This step is governed by the MHC class II-like H2-M molecules, which facilitate exchange of invariant chain (Ii)-derived MHC class II-associated Ii peptides (CLIP) from MHC class II for stably bound antigenic peptides (10Germain R.N. Castellino F. Han R. Reis e Sousa C. Romanoli P. Sadegh-Nasseri S. Zhong G.M. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 5-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wolf P.R. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 267-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although dissociation of CLIP for antigenic peptides might spontaneously occur at endosome/lysosome-like pH (12Urban R.G. Chicz R.M. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), experiments using either H2-M-deficient mice or human B cell lines mutated in the HLA-DM (DM) loci demonstrated that H2-M/DM is required for that final step of peptide loading by many MHC class II alleles (13Morris P.

H2-M/DM appears to function as a peptide editor that serves to positively select peptides that can stably bind to MHC class II molecules (17van Ham S.M. Gruneberg U. Malcherek G. Broker I. Melms A. Trowsdale J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Weber D.A. Evavold B.D. Jensen P.E. Science. 1996; 274: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of certain H2-M alleles associated with susceptibility to develop CII-induced arthritis may critically affect the peptide repertoire displayed to the T cell compartment (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to the DM loci in humans, the H2-Mregion in the mouse contains one H2-Ma (Ma) gene, but two H2-Mb (Mb) genes termedMb1 and Mb2 (20Cho S. Attaya M. Brown M.G. Monaco J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5197-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is still unclear whetherMb1 and Mb2 are equally expressed in vivo (15Stebbins C.C. Peterson M.E. Suh W.M. Sant A.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4892-4898PubMed Google Scholar, 21Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 113-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and no systematic study has been presented in which a comparison of Mα/Mβ1 and Mα/Mβ2 heterodimers has been conducted. To address the questions of whether (i) I-Aq molecules require, for cell-surface expression, the presence of H2-M molecules and (ii) different H2-M isoforms are similar or distinct in peptide loading of MHC class II molecules, we took advantage of the T2 cell line, which lost, due a genetic defect, the MHC class II and DM molecules. Stable transfectants of the T2 cell line expressing the I-Aq allele from autoimmune-prone DBA/1 mice alone or combined with H2-Mαβ1 (Mαβ1) or H2-Mαβ2 (Mαβ2) provide the means to perform a detailed analysis of molecules involved in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway without the possibility that freshly isolated antigen-presenting cells (e.g. macrophages) from autoimmune DBA/1 mice might be contaminated with trace amounts of different antigen-presenting cells (e.g. B cells). DBA/1 mice (H2 q) and New Zealand White rabbits were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). The human T2 cell line (T cell × B cell hybrid, 721.174 × CEM.T2), a generous gift from Dr. R. Salter (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA), contains a homozygous deletion in chromosome 6p that removes the DM gene and the entire MHC class II region (23Salter R.D. Howell D.N. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). T2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), referred to as complete medium. The hybridoma cell line N22 (anti-MHC class II) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Anti-I-Ab,d,q mAb YE2/36HLK was purchased from Serotec (Wiesbaden, Germany). Anti-MHC class II mAbs KH116 (anti-I-Aq) and KH118 (anti-I-Aq,b) were from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany). FITC-conjugated secondary staining reagents (goat anti-hamster IgG, rabbit anti-rat IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG) were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg), and unlabeled isotype-matched control antibodies were from Coulter-Immunotech (Hamburg). The rabbit antisera R.Mα-C.69.3, R.Mβ1/2-C.71.3, and R.hCLIP73.11 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with C-terminal peptides from Mα (amino acids 238–248) (24Cho S.G. Attaya M. Monaco J.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and Mβ1/Mβ2 (amino acids 228–243) (25Karlsson L. Peleraux A. Lindstedt R. Liljedahl M. Peterson P.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and a CLIP peptide (amino acids 81–104 of the human p33 invariant chain isoform) (26Denzin L.K. Robbins N.F. Carboy-Newcomb C. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), respectively, coupled with an added amino-terminal cysteine to diphtheria toxoid (Chiron Mimotopes, Victoria, Australia). The antisera were affinity-purified usingN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Fast Flow Sepharose 4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) cross-linked to the respective Mα, Mβ, or CLIP peptide. Affinity-purified antisera were screened for specific antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis using T2.Aq cell lines transfected with Ma q, Mb1 q, andMb2 q. Specificity controls included Western blot analysis of T2 cells alone or T2 cells expressing I-Aq (but not H2-M genes) using anti-Mα or anti-Mβ antisera (see Fig. 4). I-Aaq (Aa q)andI-Ab q (Ab q) were amplified from a DBA/1 splenocyte cDNA library (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using the ExpandTM Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and standard PCR conditions. The primers used for amplification of the cDNA clones were as follows: Aaq-sense, 5′-ATACCATGGCGCGCAGCAGAGCTC-3′; Aaq-antisense, 5′-ATAGGATCCTCATAAAGGCCCTGG-3′; Abq-sense, 5′-ATACCATGGCTCTGCAGATCCC-3′; and Abq-antisense, 5′-ATAGGATCCTCACTGACGGAGCCCT-3′. The primers were designed with synthetic NcoI andBamHI restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate cloning of amplified DNA. Following amplification, the 809-base pairAa q and 812-base pair Ab q PCR products were cloned into the EcoRV and BamHI sites of pBSK+ (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and sequenced (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For expression in eukaryotic cells, theAa q cDNA was subcloned (NcoI-BamHI) into the retroviral vector MFG (27Dranoff G. Jaffee E. Lazenby A. Golumbek P. Levitsky H. Brose K. Jackson V. Hamada H. Pardoll D. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3539-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar), yielding MFG-Aaq. Subsequently, an IRES-Neocassette (28Maeurer M.J. Gollin S.M. Martin D. Swaney W. Bryant J. Castelli C. Robbins P. Parmiani G. Storkus W.J. Lotze M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), consisting of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence from the encephalomyocarditis virus and the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (Neo), was inserted into theBamHI site at the 3′-end of the Aa qcDNA in MFG-Aaq, yielding the vector DFG-Aaq-IRES-Neo. Next, an IRES-EcoRI-NcoI fragment was fused to the ATG of the Ab q cDNA in pBSK+, yielding the plasmid pBSK-IRES-Abq+. After that, pBSK-IRES-Abq+ was digested with BamHI, and the IRES-Ab q fragment obtained was inserted into theBamHI site at the 3′-end of the Neo cDNA of the partially digested DFG-Aaq-IRES-Neo, yielding the vector TFG-Aaq-IRES-Neo-IRES-Abq. This proviral construct, capable of coordinately expressing Aa q,Ab q, and Neo, was finally termed TFG-Aq. The isolation of Ma q,Mb1 q, and Mb2 q full-length cDNA clones has been reported previously (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For expression in eukaryotic cells, the Ab q cDNA in pBSK-IRES-Abq+ was replaced by Ma q(NcoI-NotI). The IRES-Ma qsequence was subcloned into the BamHI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Subsequently, NotI-NheI-digestedMb1 q or Mb2 q cDNA was inserted into the NotI-NheI sites at the 5′-end of the IRES-Ma q sequence, yielding pCEP4-Mb1q-IRES-Maq and pCEP4-Mb2q-IRES-Maq, respectively. T2 cells stably expressing I-Aq molecules from arthritis-susceptible DBA/1 mice were generated by retroviral transfection as previously described (33Hermel E. Yuan J. Monaco J.J. Immunogenetics. 1995; 42: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, retroviral supernatant was produced by transfecting the TFG-Aq proviral construct into the ψCRIP packaging cell line (29Danos O. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). T2 cells (2–5 × 106) were infected with 2 ml of TFG-Aq retroviral supernatant in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) and subsequently plated in 96-well flat-bottomed plates on irradiated feeder cell layers. Stable transfectants were selected in complete medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). T2.Aq clones were screened for high I-Aq expression levels by flow cytometry using the I-A conformation-independent mAb N22 (30Villadangos J.A. Riese R.J. Peters C. Chapman H.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Transfection of T2.Aq cells with the pCEP4, pCEP4-Mb1q-IRES-Maq or pCEP4-Mb2q-IRES-Maq vector was performed by electroporation as described (26Denzin L.K. Robbins N.F. Carboy-Newcomb C. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To obtain stable T2.Aq.Maq.Mb1q and T2.Aq.Maq.Mb2q cell lines, transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution in complete medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin and 0.45 mg/ml hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Individual clones were screened for the presence of Ma q, Mb1 q, andMb2 q by RT-PCR. Clones that exhibited high Mαβ1 or Mαβ2 protein expression levels determined by Western blot analysis were used in subsequent experiments. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis have been described previously (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed in an amplification mixture adjusted to 50 μl containing 50–100 ng of cDNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01 (w/v) gelatin, 1 mm each dNTP, 25 pmol each primer, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Weiterstadt, Germany). The RT-PCR amplification profile involved an initial denaturation step (94 °C for 10 min), followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; the last extension was for 10 min at 72 °C. The following primers were used for PCR: Ma-sense, 5′-AAGGTATGGAGCATGAGCAGAAGT-3′; Ma-antisense, 5′-GATCAGTCACCTGAGCACGGT-3′; panMb1/2-sense, 5′-GGACCATGGCTGCACTCTGGC-3′; and panMb1/2-antisense, 5′-GCATCACGGGCTCCCTTGTGT-3′. PCR products were resolved on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and digitized with a Gelprint 2000i densitometer (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The ratio RT-PCR assay performed in this study was based on the simultaneous amplification ofMb1 and Mb2 transcripts using panMb1/2 primers (see above) annealing within conserved regions (exons 1 and 3) of bothMb q mRNA species (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Equal amplification efficiency of both Mb transcripts was assured by comparative cycle kinetic and linear regression analysis (31Bouaboula M. Legoux P. Pessegue B. Delpech B. Dumont X. Piechaczyk M. Casellas P. Shire D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21830-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using clonedMb1 and Mb2 full-length cDNAs (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Discrimination between co-amplified Mb transcripts was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis. We therefore took advantage of the polymorphism of Mb1 q andMb2 q genes within exon 2 (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and used the restriction enzyme HhaI, which specifically cleaves at nucleotide +321 within the Mb1 q sequence and nucleotide +264 within the Mb2 q sequence of the 403-base pair panMb RT-PCR product. PCR was performed using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase and standard PCR conditions. After 25 cycles, the amplified mixture was diluted 25-fold in a fresh PCR amplification mixture containing 25 nCi/μl [α-32P]dCTP (ICN, Eschwege, Germany), followed by two additional amplification cycles. The labeled Mb PCR products or their respective restriction fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels. To quantitate individual Mb fragments, gels were subjected to autoradiography. Corresponding bands were excised from the gel, and radioactivity was measured with a β-counter (LS6000TA, Beckman, München, Germany) using a Cerenkov program. To calculate the ratio of Mb1 and Mb2 mRNA expression levels, their respective restriction fragments were corrected for length and cytosine and guanine (GC content) since dCTP was exclusively radioactively labeled in this assay. Cells (1 × 107/ml) were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (all protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclei and insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm) for 30 min, and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Aliquots corresponding to 10 μg of protein were mixed with Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated on SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) by semidry blotting as described (32Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked overnight with blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibody binding was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Dianova), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence using Super Signal Ultra (Pierce). Cells (5 × 105/sample) were washed in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated on ice with unlabeled primary mAb for 30 min. After washing in the PBS and bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with an appropriate FITC-conjugated secondary staining reagent for 30 min at 4 °C: goat anti-hamster IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, rabbit anti-rat IgG, or goat anti-rabbit IgG. Background fluorescence was evaluated using irrelevant matched isotypes and FITC-conjugated goat anti-hamster IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, rabbit anti-rat IgG, or goat anti-rabbit IgG. Cell-surface fluorescent labeling was visualized on an EPICS®-PROFILE II flow cytometer (Coulter-Immunotech), and data analysis was performed using EPICS®-ELITE Version 3.0 software. Transfected T2 cell lines were washed in PBS and cytocentrifuged with a Labofuge 400e (Heraeus Instruments, Hanau, Germany) at 500 × g for 5 min onto Superfrost slides (Menzel, Hannover, Germany) with 200,000 cells/dot. The cytospins were air-dried overnight and afterward stored at −20 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Sigma, München) for 10 min at room temperature before immunostaining. After permeabilization with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS and blocking with serum-free protein block (Dako, Hamburg), cells were incubated with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-human primary polyclonal antibody anti-DMα or anti-DMβ or the corresponding antisera (1:1000 dilution for each one). Negative controls included cells treated with PBS or normal rabbit serum. A Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:600; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was used as the second antibody. Optimal working dilutions of the antibodies were determined in titration experiments. Nuclei were counterstained with bisbenzimide (1:5000; Sigma). Slides were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako) and examined using a Leitz DM RBE fluorescence microscope (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland); the red Cy3 fluorescence was detected by an N2.1 filter (wavelengths 515–560 and 590). The H2-M region contains one Ma gene, but two Mb genes termedMb1 and Mb2 (20Cho S. Attaya M. Brown M.G. Monaco J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5197-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transcription of theMa gene and both Mb genes has been observed in splenocytes of different mouse strains, including mice that carry the arthritis-susceptible H2 q haplotype (19Walter W. Loos M. Maeurer M.J. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Hermel E. Yuan J. Monaco J.J. Immunogenetics. 1995; 42: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar). To define the H2-M gene expression pattern, we examinedMa and Mb mRNA expression in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs or tissues from arthritis-susceptible DBA/1 (H2 q) mice by RT-PCR. Constitutive Ma andMb mRNA expression could be detected in each organ sample (data not shown). Next, we addressed the question of whetherMb1 and Mb2 are differentially expressed by ratio RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1). The ratios ofMb1 to Mb2 mRNA given as percentages of the total Mb mRNA are listed in TableI. Mb2 represents the majorMb transcript in lymphoid organs: 60.4% in spleen; 79.5% in mesenteric lymph nodes; 82.3% in popliteal lymph nodes; and 60.2, 62.4, and 57.8% in thymus of 4-, 8-, and 12-week-old mice, respectively (Fig. 1 A and Table I). Similarly,Mb2 mRNA was preferentially expressed in muscle (62.1%) and heart (57.7%). In contrast, Mb1 mRNA was found to be the dominant transcript in testis, brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, and small and large intestines. With the exception of large intestine (57.1%), the relative expression of Mb1 mRNA averaged ∼76% of the total Mb mRNA transcripts (Fig.1 B and Table I).Table IMb1 and Mb2 are differentially expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs of arthritis-susceptible DBA/1 (H2q) miceOrgan/tissueMb1Mb2Thymus4 weeks39.9 ± 0.860.1 ± 0.98 weeks37.6 ± 2.962.4 ± 1.412 weeks42.2 ± 3.857.8 ± 2.3Spleen39.6 ± 1.460.4 ± 3.2Mesenteric lymph node20.5 ± 1.679.5 ± 2.1Popliteal lymph node17.7 ± 1.782.3 ± 1.6Small intestine81.4 ± 2.118.6 ± 1.5Large intestine57.1 ± 1.142.9 ± 0.9Muscle37.9 ± 1.262.1 ± 1.0Heart42.3 ± 2.157.7 ± 1.9Testis75.1 ± 1.524.9 ± 1.1Brain82.5 ± 1.817.5 ± 1.3Lung79.7 ± 2.320.3 ± 2.5Liver71.2 ± 0.928.8 ± 1.4Kidney80.4 ± 1.619.6 ± 1.8Pancreas59.6 ± 2.440.4 ± 2.8Values, presented as means ± S.D. of three determinations, indicate the relative expression of Mb1 and Mb2mRNAs as percentages of total Mb mRNA as determined by ratio RT-PCR as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

The observation that Mb1 andMb2 are differentially expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs (Table I) implies that both heterodimers, Mαβ1 and Mαβ2, might be functional in I-Aq/peptide assembly. To address this question, we generated T2 transfectants stably expressing either I-Aq alone (T2.Aq.pCEP4) or in combination with Mαβ1 (T2.Aq.Maq.Mb1q) or Mαβ2 (T2.Aq.Maq.Mb2q) derived from DBA/1 mice (H2 q). To ensure comparable levels of I-Aq surface expression as well as Mαβ1 or Mαβ2 heterodimer expression, transgenic T2 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2) and Western blotting (Fig. 3), respectively. Cell-surface staining with mAb N22, which recognizes a monomorphic determinant on Ii- or peptide-associated MHC class II αβ-dimers with similar efficiency (30Villadangos J.A. Riese R.J. Peters C. Chapman H.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp.

Similarly, Western blot analysis of T2.Aq.Maq.Mb1q and T2.Aq.Maq.Mb2q cells demonstrated comparable Mαβ1 and Mαβ2 expression (Fig. 3).Figure 3Comparison of Mαβ1 and Mαβ2 expression in T2.Aq transfectants. MHC class II antigen-processing mutant T2 cells were stably transfected with I-Aq α- and β-chain genes and then super-transfected with Ma andMb1 (T2.Aq.Maq.Mb1q),Mb2 (T2.Aq.Maq.Mb1q), or pCEP4 control vector (T2.Aq.pCEP4). Laemmli buffer-solubilized cell lysates (10 μg) derived from the indicated cell lines were separated on denaturing 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed on Western immunoblots by staining with affinity-purified rabbit antisera to Mα, or Mβ1, and Mβ2 monomers as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of the well documented observation that absent or reduced binding of certain mAbs recognizing conformation-dependent epitopes on MHC class II molecules directly correlates with a failure to exchange CLIP for other peptides on MHC class II molecules inDM mutant cell lines (13Morris P.

Using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the cDNA encoding FAPP, we radiolabeled the enzyme with 32P, and then the protein was purified by affinity chromatography on cholate-immobilized Sepharose column and submitted to a CNBr hydrolysis. Analysis of peptides by high pressure liquid chromatography, associated with the radioactivity profile, revealed that the phosphorylation site is located at threonine 340. Site-specific mutagenesis experiments, in which the threonine was replaced by an alanine residue, were used to invalidate the phosphorylation of FAPP and to study the influence of the modification on the activity and secretion of the enzyme. These studies showed that CHO cells, transfected with the mutated cDNA of FAPP, kept all of their ability to synthesize the protein, but the loss of the phosphorylation motif prevented the release of the protein in the extracellular compartment. However, the mutated enzyme, which was sequestrated in the transfected CHO cells, remains active on bile salt-dependent lipase substrates.

However, the mutated enzyme, which was sequestrated in the transfected CHO cells, remains active on bile salt-dependent lipase substrates. The bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL1; EC 3.1.1.13) is an enzyme implicated in the duodenal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters (1Lindstrom M.B. Sternby B. Bogrström B. Biochim. Biophys.

This enzyme is found in the pancreatic secretions of all species examined up to now, from fishes to humans (5Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1992; 1124: 123-134Google Scholar, 6Lombardo D. Guy O. Figarella C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1978; 527: 142-149Google Scholar). BSDL is synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum of acinar cells and follows the secretory pathway of these cells before its release into the pancreatic juice. To be secreted, the enzyme experiences co- and post-translational modifications. The first one is theN-glycosylation at Asn187, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (7Sugo T. Mas E. Abouakil N. Endo T. Escribano M.J. Kobata A. Lombardo D. Eur. J. Biochem... 1993; 216: 799-805Google Scholar). The second post-translational modification is the O-glycosylation of each tandemly repeated sequence present in the C-terminal domain of BSDL (8Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res... 1991; 32: 267-276Google Scholar). During its intracellular traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network, BSDL is associated with intracellular membranes (9Bruneau N. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 13524-13533Google Scholar, 10Bruneau N. Lechêne de la Porte P. Sbarra V. Lombardo D. Eur. J. Biochem... 1995; 133: 209-218Google Scholar), from which the enzyme is dissociated upon the phosphorylation of a hydroxylated amino acid residue of the protein, such as threonine or serine, by the action of a protein kinase casein kinase II (11Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Valette A. Lloubès R. Vérine A. Lombardo D. Biochem. J... 2000; 345: 121-128Google Scholar). This third post-translational modification remains poorly documented, but it appeared essential to the secretion of the enzyme (12Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Mas E. Bruneau N. Lexa D. Lombardo D. Biochem. J... 1997; 327: 527-535Google Scholar) and should occur once the sequential glycosylation of the protein was achieved. We have further determined that the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation is about 1.2 ± 0.5 mol of phosphorus/mol of secreted BSDL (12Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Mas E. Bruneau N. Lexa D. Lombardo D. Biochem. J... 1997; 327: 527-535Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of BSDL (5Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1992; 1124: 123-134Google Scholar, 13Han J.H.

Acta.. 1998; 1393: 80-89Google Scholar) indicated that this protein differs from species to species at the level of the C-terminal domain that encompasses a variable amount of tandemly repeated identical sequences. The number of these repeated sequences varies from none in salmon (5Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1992; 1124: 123-134Google Scholar) up to 39 in gorilla (17Madeysski K. Lidberg U. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Gene ( Amst. ).. 1999; 239: 273-282Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fetoacinar pancreatic protein (FAPP) is a phosphorylated oncofetal variant of the human BSDL (18Escribano M.J. Imperial S. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 267: 21865-21871Google Scholar) that has only six repeated sequences instead of the 16 normally present in human enzyme (8Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res... 1991; 32: 267-276Google Scholar). As a consequence of the variability of the C-terminal domain of the protein, the phosphorylation site should be located within the N-terminal domain of BSDL. Sequence analysis of BSDL, using the ExPASy Prosite program of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, suggests that as many as eight putative CK II phosphorylation sites are present on BSDL sequence, all located within the N-terminal domain of the protein. 2A. Verine, J. Le Petit-Thevenin, L. Panicot-Dubois, A. Valette, and D. Lombardo, unpublished observations. The aim of these studies was to investigate the role of the phosphorylation step in the BSDL behavior and most particularly (i) to determine the nature and the location of the amino acid involved in phosphorylation process, (ii) to analyze the influence of the phosphorylation step vis-à-vis of the secretion. For this purpose, the phosphorylation site was invalidated by site-directed mutagenesis. Due to the low amount of identical motifs coding for repeated sequences of the protein, FAPP cDNA sequence was used instead of that of BSDL. The former cDNA would be easier to manipulate for site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Consequently, we used a vector including the cDNA encoding FAPP that leads to a secreted protein upon transfection in CHO cells (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all A grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Culture medium Ham F-12 was from Life Technologies, Inc. Taq polymerase was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and was a part of the GC-rich PCR kit. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbL64) against BSDL purified from human pancreatic juice were raised in our laboratory in rabbit (20Abouakil N. Rogalska E. Bonicel J. Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1988; 961: 299-308Google Scholar) and were purified on protein A-Sepharose. These antibodies also recognized FAPP (21Mas E. Abouakil N. Roudani S. Mirallès F. Guy-Crotte O. Figarella C. Escribano M.J. Lombardo D. Biochem. J... 1993; 289: 609-615Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cells were routinely cultured in Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% (by volume) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells, in 100-mm diameter culture dishes, were maintained under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transcripts of FAPP, obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar), were digested by HindIII andEcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated into pSecTag (Invitrogen), an expression vector that carries the V-J2-C region of the mouse IgK chains driving expressed proteins toward secretion. This material, referred to as pSecFAPPw (“w” represents “wild”), was then transfected into CHO-K1 cell line using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's procedure (Life Technologies). Transfected cells were first stabilized in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with zeocin (500 μg/ml). The different clones were then isolated by end dilution procedure and maintained under zeocin selection for at least 6 weeks. Control cells were transfected, according to the same protocol, with the empty pSecTag vector, and corresponding positive clones (CHO-control) were selected as indicated previously. Transfected cells were grown to about 80% confluence, and then they were washed twice with incomplete PBS buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 with 0.15 m NaCl and without Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions) and scraped with a rubber policeman. Cells were resuspended in this buffer and pelleted by low speed centrifugation. The supernatant was removed, and the sedimented cell pellet was homogenized in the complete PBS buffer (0.5 ml for cells obtained from a 100-mm diameter dish culture) by sonication (15 s, 4 watts, 4 °C). Homogenates were quickly cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immediately used for enzymatic assays or frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. Under these conditions, no loss of esterolytic activity was observed for at least 4 weeks. CHO cells transfected with the cDNA of FAPP (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar) were grown until 80% confluence in Ham's F-12 medium. Cells were washed twice at room temperature with incomplete PBS and cultured for 3 h in phosphorus-free Ham's F-12 medium. After this preincubation was used to deplete CHO cells of phosphorus, the medium was removed and replaced by 3 ml of the phosphorus-free fresh Ham's F-12 medium in which was added 0.33 mCi/ml of sodium [32P]orthophosphate, and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation time, the cell culture medium, containing free radioactivity and radiolabeled secreted proteins, was withdrawn. Free radioactivity and salts were removed by ultrafiltration, using Amicon devices (M r cut-off 10,000), and dialyzed against water. Then the concentrated cell culture medium, containing radiolabeled proteins, was lyophilized. The 32P-radiolabeled FAPP was then isolated from concentrated cell culture medium by affinity chromatography on a cholate-immobilized Sepharose column equilibrated in a 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 2 mmEDTA and 1 mm benzamidine. For this purpose, lyophilized material was solubilized in the equilibrating buffer and mixed with the affinity gel. After incubation overnight at 4 °C on a rotating shaker, the gel was poured into a Bio-Rad Econopack column and extensively washed until the absorbance (measured at 280 nm), and the radioactivity reached the background level. Absorbed 32P material was then eluted by competition using the equilibrating buffer, supplemented with sodium cholate (2% w/v). Eluted material was then extensively dialyzed against cold ammonium hydrogenocarbonate solution (5 mm, pH 8.0) and finally concentrated by lyophilization. Unlabeled FAPP was also isolated according to the same protocol. The purified radiolabeled material was mixed with 500 μg of pure nonradiolabeled enzyme, used as a vector, and dissolved into 0.2 ml of 70% formic acid. The reaction was started by adding CNBr (12 mg), and the mixture was incubated, under slow agitation, for 6 h at room temperature and for an additional 12 h at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of distilled water and 0.2 ml of ethanol. The medium was then evaporated to dryness under vacuum. Protein fragments, dissolved in 0.17 ml of guanidinium HCl (6m) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, were separated by HPLC using a C8 reversed-phase column and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile from 0 up to 70% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide collection was monitored by recording the absorbance at 214 nm (Applied Biosystems absorbance detector model 785A). The radioactivity of each fraction was measured by liquid scintillation. The fraction, containing the radioactive peptide, was once again chromatographed under identical conditions using the same column and lyophilized, and its amino acid sequence was determined. Esterase activity was determined on p-nitrophenyl hexanoate as already described (22Vérine A. Bruneau N. Valette A. Le Petit-Thevenin J. Pasqualini E. Lombardo D. Biochem. J... 1999; 342: 179-187Google Scholar) and defined as the difference between the activity levels in assays performed without (control) and with added bile salts (sodium taurocholate, 4 mm). The lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described by Goldberg (23Goldberg E. J. Biol. Chem... 1972; 247: 2044-2048Google Scholar), and protein content was determined with the bicinchoninic acid test from Pierce using BSA as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% polyacrylamide and 0.1% SDS as described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus. After electrophoretic migration, proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at 4 mA/cm2 for 18 h. The efficiency of the electrotransfer was checked by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with 2% Ponceau S solution. Nitrocellulose membranes were air-dried, and transferred proteins were detected by autoradiography for 24 h at −70 °C (BioMax MR, Eastman Kodak Co.) and/or by immunodetection using polyclonal antibodies pAbL64 specific to human pancreatic BSDL/FAPP. Autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometric scanning and quantified using the NIH Image program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For immunodetection assays, membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris/HCl buffer (5 mm, pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl and 3% bovine serum albumin. The immunodetection was carried out for 1 h using pAbL64 (1 μg/ml). After incubation for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, membranes were rinsed and incubated for another 1 h in a solution containing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. After several washings with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, membranes were developed for 10 min with a mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (0.5 mm each) in 0.1m Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. The pSecFAPPw transcript, initially used for the transfection of the CHO cells with the cDNA coding for FAPP (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar), was subcloned in Escherichia colicells and mutated to prevent the expression of the threonine residue bearing the phosphorus motif. For this purpose, a pair of primers, designed to cover the sequence encoding this threonine, was used according to the method described by Ansaldi et al. (25Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Méjean V. Anal. Biochem... 1996; 234: 110-111Google Scholar). Their sequences were modified to replace the threonine codon (ACG) with the alanine codon (GCC). The two primers had the following sequences: 5′-AAC AAG GGC AAC AAG AAA GTCGCC GAG GAG GAC TTC TAC-3′ and 5′-CAGCGG CTC CTC CTG AAG ATG TTC GAC CAG TCA CTC AAG 3′. Underlined letters indicate the modified bases. The oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the pSecFAPPw vector, were extended using the GC-rich PCR kit fromCLONTECH. The amount of the initial substrate was maintained below 100 ng. The amplification was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 GeneAmp PCR system using a 15-reaction cycle program as follows: denaturation (94 °C, 0.5 min), annealing (52 °C, 0.5 min), and extension (68 °C, 4 min). The reaction was terminated by an incubation at 68 °C for 8 min. A treatment withDpnI endonuclease was used to eliminate the methylated parental DNA template. After digestion by DpnI, only the newly synthesized DNA containing the desired mutation remained. About 5 μl of the digested material was used to transform competentE. coli cells (Top10 F′ strain), which were spread and incubated at 37 °C overnight on agarose plates containing the appropriate antibiotic (ampicillin) and the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d- galactopyranoside mixture to perform the blue/white selection. The white and light blue colonies were picked up and cultured in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were pelleted, and plasmid cDNA was isolated using a miniprep kit method (QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit; Qiagen). The presence of the desired PCR product within the plasmid was checked by digestion withNotI restriction enzyme. Positive plasmids were totally sequenced to detect any undesired mutation within the FAPP cDNA. The plasmid, bearing the desired mutation, was then transfected into CHO-KI cells and selected, as above described, to give the CHO-FAPPT340A clone. Cells were grown to confluence and washed twice with PBS buffer, and BSDL, present in clarified lysate (450 μl), was purified on a cholate-immobilized Sepharose column previously equilibrated at pH 9.0 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm benzamidine buffer (TBE buffer). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, Sepharose beads (50 μl by assay) were sedimented by centrifugation and washed with 1 ml of TBE buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 6-fold with TBE buffer alone. Sepharose beads were sedimented and then added to 30 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. After a rapid centrifugation, the supernatant was submitted to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Each assay was performed in duplicate on the same nitrocellulose membrane, which was divided into two parts. Proteins present on the first half of the membrane were revealed by Western blot using pAbL64 as primary antibody. The second half was treated for 6 h at 37 °C with 0.1 unit/ml of neuraminidase (Sigma) in acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 5.2) and probed with biotin-conjugated peanut agglutinin Arachis hypogaea (PNA) lectin (10 μl/ml) and antibodies to biotin linked to alkaline phosphatase and developed as Western blottings. Proteins of CHO cells transfected with the pSecFAPPw vector were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. After an overnight incubation, the cell-free medium containing about 1.1 ± 0.4 mg (n = 32) of radioactive protein was recovered. The radiolabeled secreted [32P]FAPP was purified by affinity chromatography. After exhaustive washings, only 2% of the total loaded radioactive material was eluted with competitive sodium cholate (∼40 μg of 32P-labeled FAPP). The eluted material was then analyzed, and after SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer on nitrocellulose membrane, only one band can be detected after Ponceau S development or autoradiography. This protein is associated with a molecular mass of 78 kDa, which correlates with that of FAPP (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar). After concentration by lyophilization, the affinity-purified [32P]FAPP was subjected to CNBr hydrolysis. When the digested peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC, the elution profile revealed many peaks (Fig.1). Major peaks, detected by UV absorption at 214 nm, were eluted near the end of the gradient under weak polarity conditions. The radioactivity of each fraction was quantified, and the radioactivity profile was superimposed to the peptide elution pattern. It appeared that the radioactivity was mainly recovered under a single peak, associated with the fraction number 47 (Fig. 1, arrow). Several analyses were performed, under the same chromatographic conditions, and all fractions, containing the radioactive peptide, were pooled and once again chromatographed on the same HPLC column. This allows to collect enough radioactive material for further sequencing. One major sequence of 16 amino acids, PAINKGNKKVXEEDFY, was determined. Comparison of this sequence with the amino acid sequence deduced from the FAPP cDNA (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar) or BSDL cDNA (8Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res... 1991; 32: 267-276Google Scholar), revealed a high degree of homology with the sequence PAINKGNKKVTEEDFY, located between Pro330 and Tyr345 in the N-terminal domain of FAPP and BSDL. The missing amino acid residue, X, in the sequence of the radioactive peptide can be identified as Thr340, which therefore could represent the phosphorylation site. Furthermore, the sequence around this Thr residue is representative of a consensus motif that can be phosphorylated by a protein kinase casein kinase II (11Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Valette A. Lloubès R. Vérine A. Lombardo D. Biochem. J... 2000; 345: 121-128Google Scholar). This motif is present in the BSDL sequence of all species examined up to now except salmon enzyme (16Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1998; 1393: 80-89Google Scholar) and in that of FAPP (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar). Amino acid numbering is given according to Reue et al. (8Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res... 1991; 32: 267-276Google Scholar). The definitive proof that Thr340 is the phosphorylation site of FAPP was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. In this experiment, a pair of primers was designed to create a mutation at the threonine 340 codon. The pair of primers was used in a PCR experiment to amplify the pSecFAPPw vector and to replace the threonine 340 residue by alanine. At the end of the PCR experiment, the methylated parental vector was digested by DpnI. The remaining material was used to transform the Top 10 F′ E. coli strain to obtain enough material for sequencing and expression in CHO cells. The sequence of the vector does not differ from that given by the manufacturer. The sequence of the reverse transcriptase-PCR fragment inserted into the vector matches that of FAPP (19Pasqualini E. Caillol N. Panicot L. Mas E. Lloubès R. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 28208-28218Google Scholar), except at the level of the codon encoding Thr340(not shown). This mutated vector will be referred to as pSecFAPPT340A. CHO cells were then stably transfected with the pSecFAPPw, pSecFAPPT340A, and empty pSecTag vector. After selection in zeocin, the transfected cells were cultured until confluence, and the expression of FAPP was determined by Western blotting performed on cell lysates. As many as 12 pSecFAPPw and pSecFAPPT340A clones were selected in the presence of zeocin, and all expressed FAPP, which migrates as a 78-kDa protein. However, cells transfected with the empty pSecTag did not express the protein (Fig. 2,upper panel). A clone representative of each transfection experiment was selected to give CHO-FAPPw, CHO-FAPPT340A and CHO-control cell clones, respectively. As also shown on Fig. 2(lower panel), FAPP expressed either by CHO-FAPPw or CHO-FAPPT340A is quantitatively retained on, and consequently can be isolated by, a cholate-immobilized Sepharose column. Further, this result suggests that mutated, as wild, FAPP is still capable of interacting with bile salt. By using the chemical method, we have previously shown that 1.2 ± 0.5 mol of phosphorus was present per mol of BSDL. If this result is very interesting, it may appear also somewhat ambiguous and may indicate the presence of one or perhaps two phosphoryl group(s) on FAPP. The addition of sodium [32P]orthophosphate in culture medium has been used to confirm that threonine 340 is the unique phosphorylatable site on the N-terminal domain of FAPP. CHO-FAPPw, CHO-FAPPT340A, and CHO-control cells were radiolabeled in [32P]orthophosphate-supplemented medium. At the end of the incubation, cell-free medium was withdrawn, dialyzed, and concentrated, whereas cells were harvested and lysed. Same amounts of proteins, contained in the cell-free medium and in the cleared cell lysate, were loaded on the cholate-immobilized Sepharose column. After washing of the affinity gel, retained FAPP was eluted from beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred on nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by autoradiography. As indicated in Fig. 3(left panel), 32P-phosphorylated FAPP can be detected as a 78-kDa protein in the cell-free medium of CHO-FAPPw clone, whereas radioactive FAPP was undetectable in the cell-free medium of CHO-control and CHO-FAPPT340A clones. The scanning and the quantitation, by the NIH program, of the area around 78 kDa showed that the dark intensity, associated with FAPPT340A, represented less than 0.1% of that of FAPP. This result suggested that FAPPT340A may not be phosphorylated and, possibly, not secreted. Therefore, we attempted to determine the phosphorylation state of FAPP and FAPPT340A in cell lysates. Analyses of FAPP present in cell lysates (Fig. 3,right panel) indicate that phosphorylated FAPP can be purified from CHO-FAPPw cell lysate but was not detected in lysates of CHO-control cells. The radioactivity of the material isolated from CHO-FAPPT340A cell lysate located around 78 kDa was lowered by more than 80–90% compared with the corresponding band detected in the CHO-FAPPw cell lysate. Consequently, FAPP expressed by CHO-FAPPT340A (arrow) appeared very poorly phosphorylated or even unphosphorylated. Although the N-terminal domain of FAPP displays eight putative sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase II protein kinase, threonine 340 appeared as the unique phosphorylatable site of FAPP and, under our experimental conditions, one may rule out the phosphorylation of any other putative sites. As shown above, phosphorylated FAPP cannot be detected in cell-free medium of CHO-FAPPT340A cells. This result indicated that FAPP secretion could be dependent upon phosphorylation. Therefore, the influence of the phosphorylation of the threonine 340 on the secretion of FAPP was analyzed by immunodetection of the protein in cell-free medium of CHO-FAPPw and CHO-FAPPT340A cells. For this purpose, nitrocellulose membranes, used in Fig. 3 to determine the phosphorylation state of FAPP and FAPPT340A, were submitted to an immunodetection with pAbL64. As shown on Fig.4, left panel, no band was immunodetected in the cell-free medium of CHO control transfected with the empty pSecTag vector. However, a protein, migrating at 78 kDa and reactive with pAbL64, was isolated by affinity chromatography on the cholate-immobilized Sepharose column from the cell-free medium of the CHO-FAPPw clone, which ascertained that this clone had the capacity to synthesize and secrete FAPP. On the other hand, mutated FAPP, expressed by the CHO-FAPPT340A clone, cannot be immunodetected in the culture medium of this clone. This suggests that mutated FAPP was absent of the cell-free medium of CHO-FAPPT340A cells and, consequently, cannot be isolated by affinity chromatography from this medium. A Western blotting performed directly on the cell-free medium of CHO-FAPP and CHO-FAPPT340A cells indicated that the protein can be detected in the culture medium of the former cells and was absent in that of the latter clone (see Fig. 2). Cell homogenates showed a pattern somewhat different (Fig. 4,right panel); as expected, no band corresponding to FAPP was immunodetected in CHO-control cells. However, following affinity chromatography, FAPP can be immunodetected as a doublet of protein migrating around 78 kDa in CHO-FAPPw and CHO-FAPPT340A clones. This doublet probably corresponds to different states of maturation of the glycosylation of this protein (10Bruneau N. Lechêne de la Porte P. Sbarra V. Lombardo D. Eur. J. Biochem... 1995; 133: 209-218Google Scholar). Another band was immunodetected in the lower molecular mass range and might correspond to a degradation product.
