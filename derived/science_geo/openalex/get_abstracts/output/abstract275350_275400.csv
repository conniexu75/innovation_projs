https://openalex.org/W2565472021,"The goal of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Project is to detect and study astrophysical gravitational waves and use data from them for research in physics and astronomy. LIGO will support studies concerning the nature and nonlinear dynamics of gravity, the structures of black holes, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. It will also measure the masses, birth rates, collisions, and distributions of black holes and neutron stars in the universe and probe the cores of supernovae and the very early universe. The technology for LIGO has been developed during the past 20 years. Construction will begin in 1992, and under the present schedule, LIGO's gravitational-wave searches will begin in 1998."

Measurements of the altitude profile of the change in the ozone concentration have established that decreases are taking place in the lower stratosphere in the region of highest ozone concentration. Analysis of updated ozone records, through March of 1991, including 29 stations in the former Soviet Union, and analysis of independently calibrated satellite data records from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment instruments confirm many of the findings originally derived from the Dobson record concerning northern midlatitude changes in ozone. The data from many instruments now provide a fairly consistent picture of the change that has occurred in stratospheric ozone levels."
https://openalex.org/W2041288671,"Simultaneous measurements of surface force and surface charge demonstrate strong attraction due to the spontaneous transfer of electrical charge from one smooth insulator (mica) to another (silica) as a result of simple, nonsliding contact in dry nitrogen. The measured surface charge densities are 5 to 20 millicoulombs per square meter after contact. The work required to separate the charged surfaces is typically 6 to 9 joules per square meter, comparable to the fracture energies of ionic-covalent materials. Observation of partial gas discharges when the surfaces are approximately 1 micrometer apart gives valuable insight into the charge separation processes underlying static electrical phenomena in general."
https://openalex.org/W2084564677,"To determine the effects of atmospheric aerosols on the radiative heating of the earth-atmosphere system, the radiative transfer equation is solved analytically in the two-stream approximation. It is found that the sign of the heating is independent of optical thickness of an aerosol layer and the amount of heating approaches a finite limit with increasing thickness of a layer. Limitations of the two-stream approximation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2089818442,"Magnetostratigraphic studies are widely used in conjunction with the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) to date events in the range 0 to 5 million years ago. A critical tie point on the GPTS is the potassium-argon age of the most recent (Brunhes-Matuyama) geomagnetic field reversal. Astronomical values for the forcing frequencies observed in the oxygen isotope record in Ocean Drilling Project site 677 suggest that the age of this last reversal is 780 ka (thousand years ago), whereas the potassium-argon-based estimate is 730 ka. Results from 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating studies on a series of lavas from Maui that straddle the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal give an age of 783 Â± 11 ka, in agreement with the astronomically derived value. The astronomically based technique appears to be a viable tool for dating young sedimentary sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2031367151,"Much of the success of plate tectonics can be attributed to the near rigidity of tectonic plates and the availability of data that describe the rates and directions of motion across narrow plate boundaries \m=~\1 to 60 kilometers wide. Nonetheless, many plate boundaries in both continental and oceanic lithosphere are not narrow but are hundreds to thousands of kilometers wide. Wide plate boundary zones cover \m=~\15 percent of Earth's surface area. Space geodesy, which includes very long baseline radio interferometry, satellite laser ranging, and the global positioning system, is providing the accurate long-distance measurements needed to estimate the present motion across and within wide plate boundary zones. Space geodetic data show that plate velocities averaged over years are remarkably similar to velocities averaged over millions of years."
https://openalex.org/W2004354899,"Diffusion couples, consisting of sapphire and fused silica, which were annealed in the temperature range from 1678 degrees to 2003 degrees C and analyzed by electron beam microprobe, have provided data on the stable phase equilibrium of the silica-alumina system. Under stable equilibrium conditions, the intermediate compound of this system, mullite (3Al(2)O(3) . 2SiO(2)), melts incongruently at 1828 degrees +/- 10 degrees C and its solid solution field extends from 70.5 to 74.0 percent (by weight) alumina. The stable phase diagram is a composite of the two binary eutectic diagrams: silica-mullite in the absence of alumina and silica-alumina in the absence of mullite. Under metastable conditions, mullite melts congruently at approximately 1890 degrees +/- 10 degrees C and its solid solution field extends to approximately 83.2 percent (by weight) alumina."
https://openalex.org/W2082757307,"Although (E,E)-8,10-Dodecadien-l-ol was reported to be a sex pheromone of the codling moth [Laspeyresia pomonella (L.)], its presence in the moth was questioned, mainly because it has not been isolated. A computerized search of data from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of a partially purified extract equivalent to 45 abdominal tips of female moths produced a mass spectrum that matched that of the authentic coinpound. Other data also confirmed the presence of the compound."
https://openalex.org/W2077997035,"A qualitative description of the general magnetospheric configuration is given, with emphasis on some of the physical processes governing the magnetosphere that are the main targets of current research. The magnetosphere behaves like a huge 'bag' of plasma and radiation that swells and contracts under the influence of the solar wind. The electric field, the magnetospheric plasma, the magnetospheric substorm, and the radiation belt and wave particle interactions are discussed. During the past 15 years, the study of the earth's magnetosphere man's immediate plasma and radiation environment - has undergone a successful stage of discovery and exploration. Investigators have obtained a morphological description of the magnetospheric field, the particle population embedded in it, and its interface with the solar wind, and have identified and are beginning to understand many of the physical processes involved. Quite generally, the magnetosphere reveals itself as a region where it is possible to observe some of the fundamental plasma processes at work that are known to occur elsewhere in the universe."
https://openalex.org/W2025345862,"The Hubble constant is the constant of proportionality between recession velocity and distance in the expanding universe. It is a fundamental property of cosmology that sets both the scale and the expansion age of the universe. It is determined by measurement of galaxy radial velocities and distances. Although there has been considerable progress in the development of new techniques for the measurements of galaxy distances, both calibration uncertainties and debates over systematic errors remain. Current determinations still range over nearly a factor of 2; the higher values favored by most local measurements are not consistent with many theories of the origin of large-scale structure and stellar evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2079943112,The asymmetry of irradiation features of grains in the Kapoeta and Fayetteville meteorites suggests irradiation on a regolith before meteorite formation. Chondrules and broken grains require approximately 10(4) years of irradiation time between formation or fracturing and compaction into the meteorite. Shock erasure of tracks from irradiated Kapoeta feldspars requires a severe shock event during or after meteorite formation.

https://openalex.org/W2069050295,"A set of subsurface temperature measurements in the trade wind region northeast of Hawaii reveals large perturbations about the mean state, with zonal wavelengths of 480 kilometers. The perturbations are identified as mesoscale baroclinic eddies, and they appear to drift westward at a rate of 4.7 +/- 2.0 centimeters per second. The large-scale ( 1000 kilometers) baroclinic flow at a depth of 200 meters is 1.5 +/- 0.7 centimeters per second, also toward the west, and comparable in magnitude with the eddy drift velocity; this finding suggests that the eddy drift is strongly influenced by the large-scale flow. Mesoscale eddies have been discovered in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean. Their existence in the Pacific Ocean is now confirmed."

https://openalex.org/W2029807119,"Anthropologists need luck on their side when they search for key fossils or study monkeys in the wild, but their work can still hit the jackpot. That was clear at the 61 st annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropology, which brought more than 800 anthropologists to Las Vegas in early April. Among the reports was one on new fossils of early hominids in Ethiopia and another on extinct giant sloth lemurs in Madagascar."

https://openalex.org/W2094978706,"The controversy in Great Britain over the type of reactor acceptable looms. Tentatively, the LWR is the type chosen for construction, but nuclear power safety has become the issue. With an increase in electric consumption, the Central Electricity Generating Board recommends the application of the LWR for use in Britain. All designs have been considered, but the LWR costs the least and since capital cost is the determining factor, would produce the cheapest electricity. The Magnox gas-cooled graphitemoderated reactor in which natural uranium is used has served well in Britain and has its supporters."
