https://openalex.org/W2066734635,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction with aging, with strong support for an increased mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in sedentary rodent models. Whether this applies to aged human muscle is unknown, nor is it clear whether these changes are caused by sedentary behavior. Thus, we examined mitochondrial function [respiration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission, and calcium retention capacity (CRC)] in permeabilized myofibers obtained from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of healthy physically active young (23.7±2.7 yr; mean±SD) and older (71.2±4.9 yr) men. Although mitochondrial ROS and maximal respiratory capacity were unaffected, the acceptor control ratio was reduced by 18% with aging, suggesting mild uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. CRC was reduced by 50% with aging, indicating sensitization of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) to apoptosis. Consistent with the mPTP sensitization, older muscles showed a 3-fold greater fraction of endonuclease G (a mitochondrial proapoptotic factor)-positive myonuclei. Aged muscles also had lower mitophagic potential, based on a 43% reduction in Parkin to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) protein ratio. Collectively, these results show that mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic signaling is increased in older human muscle and suggest that accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria with exaggerated apoptotic sensitivity is due to impaired mitophagy."

Because mTOR inhibition with rapamycin protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that rapamycin would prevent cardiac dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also investigated the possible mechanisms and novel protein targets involved in rapamycin-induced preservation of cardiac function in T2D mice. Adult male leptin receptor null, homozygous db/db, or wild type mice were treated daily for 28 days with vehicle (5% DMSO) or rapamycin (0.25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Cardiac function was monitored by echocardiography, and protein targets were identified by proteomics analysis. Rapamycin treatment significantly reduced body weight, heart weight, plasma glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels in db/db mice. Fractional shortening was improved by rapamycin treatment in db/db mice. Oxidative stress as measured by glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced in rapamycin-treated db/db hearts. Rapamycin blocked the enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and S6, but not AKT in db/db hearts. Proteomic (by two-dimensional gel and mass spectrometry) and Western blot analyses identified significant changes in several cytoskeletal/contractile proteins (myosin light chain MLY2, myosin heavy chain 6, myosin-binding protein C), glucose metabolism proteins (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, PYGB, Pgm2), and antioxidant proteins (peroxiredoxin 5, ferritin heavy chain 1) following rapamycin treatment in db/db heart. These results show that chronic rapamycin treatment prevents cardiac dysfunction in T2D mice, possibly through attenuation of oxidative stress and alteration of antioxidants and contractile as well as glucose metabolic protein expression.

DM is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, predominantly as a result of cardiovascular complications such as coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure (1.Plutzky J. Macrovascular effects and safety issues of therapies for type 2 diabetes 2.Am. J. Cardiol. 2011; 108: 25B-32BAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Endothelial dysfunction, proteomic/hormonal alterations, and metabolic distresses promote the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (2.Adameova A. Dhalla N.S. Role of microangiopathy in diabetic cardiomyopathy.Heart Fail. Rev. 2014; 19: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The diabetic heart undergoes structural remodeling to cope with the underlying changes; however, it ultimately fails because of deterioration of cardiac contractile force. The underlying pathological mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy are still poorly understood, although there is accumulating evidence that the cardiac complications of DM are closely tied to metabolic disorders including hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, impaired calcium homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation (3.Chong Z.Z.

The serine-threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) serves as an intracellular sensor for energy metabolism, nutrient availability, and stresses and controls cellular growth and metabolism (6.Meric-Bernstam F. Gonzalez-Angulo A.M. Targeting the mTOR signaling network for cancer therapy.J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 2278-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Its role in regulating metabolic stress, aging, and cardiovascular diseases has received tremendous interest recently. mTOR interacts with several proteins to form two distinct complexes named mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) (7.Martin D.E. Hall M.N. The expanding TOR signaling network.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Both complexes share the catalytic mTOR subunit, mLST8 (mammalian lethal with sec-13 protein 8), DEPTOR (DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein), and Tti1-Tel2 complex. In contrast, the other components in mTORC1 are Raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) and PRAS40 (proline-rich AKT substrate). mTORC2 has Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) and mSin1 (mammalian stress-activated MAP kinase-interacting protein 1). The ribosomal protein p70S6K and 4FBP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1) are two downstream targets of mTORC1 (8.Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S.

Raptor, a binding partner of target of rapamycin (TOR), mediates TOR action.Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Rictor promotes the activity of mTORC2 by enabling it to phosphorylate AKT at Ser473 (9.Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Phosphorylation and regulation of Akt/PKB by the Rictor-mTOR complex.Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5223) Google Scholar). We first reported that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Sirolimus) induced protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury indicated by significantly reduced infarct size and reduction of necrosis and apoptosis following simulated ischemia-reoxygenation in cardiomyocytes (10.Khan S. Salloum F. Das A. Xi L. Vetrovec G.W. Kukreja R.C. Rapamycin confers preconditioning-like protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated mouse heart and cardiomyocytes.J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 41: 256-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that rapamycin triggers unique cardioprotective signaling including phosphorylation of ERK, STAT3, and endothelial NOS, in concert with increased Bcl-2 to Bax ratio and inactivation of GSK-3β (11.Das A. Salloum F.N. Durrant D. Ockaili R. Kukreja R.C. Rapamycin protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.J. Mol.

A previous study also showed that chronic treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamune (4 weeks at 2 mg/kg/day, orally) attenuated chronically established left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis with preserved contractile function (12.Gao X.M. Wong G. Wang B. Kiriazis H. Moore X.L. Su Y.D. Dart A. Du X.J. Inhibition of mTOR reduces chronic pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.J. Hypertens. 2006; 24: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study reported that selective activation of mTORC2 with concurrent inhibition of mTORC1 decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction (13.Völkers M.

Because mTOR dysregulation occurs in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, there are ongoing efforts to pharmacologically target mTOR signaling in protecting against diabetic-associated cardiovascular diseases. Systemic administration of rapamycin ameliorates diabetes-induced renal dysfunction and blocks the onset of type 1 and T2D (20.Inoki K. Mori H. Wang J. Suzuki T. Hong S. Yoshida S. Blattner S.M.

In addition, several studies show that sirolimus-eluting stents are highly effective in reducing the risk for major cardiac events and are safe in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease (22.Baumgart D.

Therefore, to investigate the cardioprotective mechanism of mTOR inhibition in T2D, the present study was designed to identify novel cardiac protein targets that may be altered by chronic treatment with rapamycin in a mouse model. By using an advanced proteomic approach with two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a number of proteins that are potentially responsible for cardioprotection and preservation of contractile function following rapamycin treatment in T2D mice. Adult male leptin receptor null, homozygous db/db mice (strain: BKS.Cg-Dock7m+/+Leprdb/J) and respective background strain mice (C57BL/6J) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The animal experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Virginia Commonwealth University. The animal care and experiments were conducted under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals for Biomedical Research published by the National Institutes of Health (No. 85-23, revised 1996). Twenty adult (16–18 weeks) male db/db and corresponding background C57BL/6J mice were treated daily for 28 days with rapamycin (0.25 mg/kg in 5% DMSO intraperitoneally) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (5% DMSO intraperitoneally as control). The dose of rapamycin was chosen based on our previous studies on rapamycin-induced cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (10.Khan S. Salloum F. Das A. Xi L. Vetrovec G.W. Kukreja R.C. Rapamycin confers preconditioning-like protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated mouse heart and cardiomyocytes.J. Mol.

Upon completion of treatment, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and the heart was quickly collected via thoracotomy, rinsed free of blood with saline, weighed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further proteomic experiments or Western blot analysis. At the time of sacrifice of the mice (after 4 h of fasting), blood was collected in a heparinized BD Vacutainer® tube and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The clear top yellow plasma layer was stored at −80 °C until analysis. The plasma glucose and triglycerides were assayed using commercially available colorimetric assay kits (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Plasma insulin concentration was measured using an ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, Inc., Downers Grove, IL). The 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry protein identification were performed by Applied Biomics, Inc. (Hayward, CA) following the established protocols as described in our previous publications (24.Koka S. Xi L. Kukreja R.C.

In brief, three heart tissues samples (100 mg) from C57BL control and db/db mice with DMSO (as control) or rapamycin treatment were sonicated with 2 ml of two-dimensional cell lysis buffer and centrifuged for collecting the supernatant. The protein sample (30 μg) was labeled with 1 μl of CyDye dilution. (Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5; Amersham Biosciences). The CyDyes stock (1 nmol/μl) were diluted 1:5 with dimethylformamide, incubated on ice for 30 min in dark, followed by addition of 1 μl of 10 mm lysine to stop the labeling reaction. The labeled samples were mixed with 2× two-dimensional sample buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mg/ml DTT, 2% pharmalytes, and a trace amount of bromphenol) followed by addition of 100 μl of destreak solution (GE Healthcare) and rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mg/ml DTT, 1% pharmalytes, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue). The sample was loaded into a 13-cm immobilized pH gradient strip (pH 3–10, Linear; GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences), and isoelectric focusing was run under dark. Subsequently, the immobilized pH gradient strips were incubated in 10 ml of equilibration buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 10 mg/ml DTT, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue) for 15 min, followed by incubation in 10 ml of equilibration buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 45 mg/ml iodacetamide, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue) for 10 min. The immobilized pH gradient strips were transferred into 12% SDS gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 15 °C. Each gel was scanned immediately following SDS-PAGE using Typhoon Trio scanner (Amersham Biosciences). The scanned images were then analyzed by Image QuantTL software (GE Healthcare) and then subjected to in-gel analysis and cross-gel analysis using DeCyder software version 6.5 (GE Healthcare). The change in ratio of differential protein expression was obtained from in-gel DeCyder software analysis. Quantitative comparisons were then made between two individual samples for each of the three possible combinations. The pairwise volume ratios (i.e., C57 versus db/db, C57 versus db/db RAPA, and db/db versus db/db RAPA) were calculated for each protein spot and used to determine relative protein expression. The selected spots were picked up by Ettan Spot Picker (GE Healthcare) following the DeCyder software analysis and spot picking design. The selected protein spots were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, peptide extraction, and desalting, followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF to determine the protein identity (24.Koka S. Xi L. Kukreja R.C.

To confirm the results of 2D-DIGE, we performed Western blots to assess the expression levels of selected proteins, particularly the antioxidants and contractile and glucose metabolism proteins. Total soluble proteins were extracted from whole heart tissue with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm PMSF, and halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min under 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered. Protein (50 μg) from each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody at dilution of 1:1,000 for each of the respective proteins, i.e., p-mTOR (Ser2448), mTOR, p-S6 (Ser235/236), S6, p-AKT (Ser473), AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), ferritin heavy chain, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1α, PYGB, SOD2, myosin light chain 2 (MLY-2), myosin heavy chain 6α (MHC6α), Actin, GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and peroxiredoxin 5 (PRX-5; Proteintech Group, Inc., Chicago, IL). The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilutions) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent system (ECL Plus; Amersham Bioscience) and subsequently exposed to Kodak film. The optical density of the protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software. Cardiac contractile function was measured before and after treatment with rapamycin using the Vevo 770TM imaging system (VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, Canada). A 30-MHz probe was used to obtain two-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler imaging from parasternal short axis view at the level of the papillary muscle and the apical four-chamber view (26.Salloum F.N. Abbate A. Das A. Houser J.E. Mudrick C.A. Qureshi I.Z. Hoke N.N. Roy S.K. Brown W.R. Prabhakar S. Kukreja R.C. Sildenafil (Viagra) attenuates ischemic cardiomyopathy and improves left ventricular function in mice.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 294: H1398-H1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, LV end systolic and end diastolic diameters, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction were calculated using Vevo analysis software (version 2.2.3). Oxidative stress was measured by determining the glutathione levels in the myocardium using glutathione assay kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cardiac tissue (60 mg) was homogenized in ice-cold glutathione assay buffer, and then 60 μl of the homogenate was added to the tube containing 20 μl of perchloric acid (6 n) and incubated in ice for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min, and supernatant was collected for glutathione assay. The sample was neutralized with 3 n KOH and incubated with a fluorescence probe, o-phthalaldehyde for 40 min at room temperature. o-Phthalaldehyde reacts with GSH and generates fluorescence, which was detected at 340/420 nm (excitation/emission) using a fluorescence plate reader. The total glutathione was measured by adding a reducing agent that converts the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH. To measure GSSG specifically, a GSH quencher was added to remove GSH, and the reducing agent was added to destroy excess quencher and to convert GSSG to GSH. The GSH, GSSG, and total glutathione concentration were determined using standards curve of GSH. Lipid peroxidation in heart was assayed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal using a lipid peroxidation assay kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the hearts were homogenized in MDA lysis buffer and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant (200 μl) was incubated with thiobarbituric acid (600 μl) at 95 °C for 60 min in an Eppendorf tube. The solution was cooled down to room temperature, 200 μl of each reaction solution were transferred to a microplate, and absorbance was read at 532 nm. The differences between groups were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keul's post hoc test for pair-wise comparison. Probability value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All measurements are expressed as means ± S.E. There were no significant changes in body weight, heart weight, plasma glucose, and triglyceride levels between control (DMSO-treated) and rapamycin-treated C57 mice during treatment periods (Fig. 1). The db/db mice had significantly higher body weight, ratio of heart weight to tibia length, plasma glucose, triglyceride, and insulin level as compared with the nondiabetic control C57 mice. Body weight was significantly reduced following the second week of rapamycin treatment in db/db mice as compared with db/db control (Fig. 1, A and B). The ratio of heart weight to tibia length was significantly higher in db/db mice compared with nondiabetic C57 mice. Although rapamycin treatment did not alter the ratio of heart to tibia length in nondiabetic C57 mice, it prevented the increase in heart weight/tibia length observed in db/db mice (Fig. 1F). Similarly, after 28 days of the treatment with rapamycin, the db/db mice showed a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (Fig. 1C), triglyceride (Fig. 1D), and insulin levels (Fig. 1E) as compared with the control nontreated db/db mice. Rapamycin treatment did not alter cardiac function in C57 mice (Fig. 2). The hearts from db/db mice exhibited significant defect in cardiac function as noted by reduction of fractional shortening (37.3 ± 1.5%) and ejection fraction (68.8 ± 1.8%) as compared with the nondiabetic C57 control mice (fractional shortening, 48.3 ± 0.3%; ejection fraction, 78.7 ± 1.9%) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, G and H). However, rapamycin treatment significantly improved cardiac function (fractional shortening, 49.4 ± 1.7%; ejection fraction, 80.0 ± 2.5%) (Fig. 2, G and H). Although LV end diastolic diameter did not change between groups, LV end systolic diameters were significantly increased in db/db mice (2.0 ± 0.1%) as compared with C57 control (1.4 ± 0.1%) and db/db-rapamycin-treated mice (1.6 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 2, E and F). No differences in heart rate were observed between any of the groups. The phosphorylation of mTOR, ribosomal protein S6, and AKT were significantly enhanced in the hearts of db/db mice as compared with nondiabetic C57 mice (Fig. 3, A–D). Rapamycin treatment completely blocked the enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 in diabetic hearts. However, AKT phosphorylation in the nondiabetic C57 and diabetic db/db mice was not significantly altered after rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3, A and D). The cardiac expression of Beclin in C57 mice was increased following rapamycin treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). The expression of Beclin was also increased significantly in db/db mice as compared with C57 mice. However, rapamycin treatment further enhanced its expression in diabetic heart (Fig. 4, A and B). The ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I increased in the heart of C57 and db/db mice following rapamycin treatment, although this increase was not significant as compared with the nontreated control C57 or db/db (Fig. 4, A and C). Following the 2D-DIGE and SDS-PAGE procedures, the scanned images from each gel were subjected to in-gel analysis to determine the protein differential expression. Quantitative pairwise comparisons of the protein volume ratios for each protein spot were made among the three treatment conditions (i.e., nondiabetic C57 versus db/db or db/db + rapamycin and db/db versus db/db + rapamycin). Fig. 5A shows a representative overlay image for in-gel comparison between the proteins in hearts from db/db (labeled in green dye) and db/db + rapamycin (labeled in red dye) mice. The numbered circles represent a total of 96 protein spots that are differentially expressed among the three groups. From these prominently identified spots, we further selected 30 protein spots that were significantly altered by rapamycin treatment (i.e., the ratio of fold, RAPA + db/db versus db/db heart greater than ±1.5) for protein identification using MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W2027930781,"Glutamine metabolism plays an essential role for growth and proliferation of many cancer cells by providing metabolites for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions and macromolecular synthesis. Aberrant activation of the transcription factor c-Myc, e.g. caused by t(8;14) chromosomal translocation commonly found in Burkitt lymphoma, is a key driver of cellular glutamine metabolism in many tumors, highlighting the need to identify molecular mechanisms that can suppress glutamine usage in these cancers. Recently, the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor by regulating glutamine metabolism, suggesting that it might have therapeutic potential for treating glutamine-dependent cancers. Here, we report that SIRT4 represses Myc-induced B cell lymphomagenesis via inhibition of mitochondrial glutamine metabolism. We found that SIRT4 overexpression can dampen glutamine utilization even in Myc-driven human Burkitt lymphoma cells and inhibit glutamine-dependent proliferation of these cells. Importantly, SIRT4 overexpression sensitizes Burkitt lymphoma cells to glucose depletion and synergizes with pharmacological glycolysis inhibitors to induce cell death. Moreover, SIRT4 loss in a genetic mouse model of Myc-induced Burkitt lymphoma, Eμ-Myc transgenic mouse, greatly accelerates lymphomagenesis and mortality. Indeed, Eμ-Myc-induced B cell lymphoma cells from SIRT4 null mice exhibit increased glutamine uptake and glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, we establish that SIRT4 regulates glutamine metabolism independent of Myc. Together, these results highlight the tumor-suppressive role of SIRT4 in Myc-induced B cell lymphoma and suggest that SIRT4 may be a potential target against Myc-induced and/or glutamine-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1979047127,"The ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains protein 1 (UHRF1) is essential for maintenance DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). UHRF1 has been shown to recruit DNMT1 to replicated DNA by the ability of its SET and RING-associated (SRA) domain to bind to hemimethylated DNA. Here, we demonstrate that UHRF1 also increases the activity of DNMT1 by almost 5-fold. This stimulation is mediated by a direct interaction of both proteins through the SRA domain of UHRF1 and the replication focus targeting sequence domain of DNMT1, and it does not require DNA binding by the SRA domain. Disruption of the interaction between DNMT1 and UHRF1 by replacement of key residues in the replication focus targeting sequence domain led to a strong reduction of DNMT1 stimulation. Additionally, the interaction with UHRF1 increased the specificity of DNMT1 for methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites. These findings show that apart from the targeting of DNMT1 to the replicated DNA UHRF1 increases the activity and specificity of DNMT1, thus exerting a multifaceted influence on the maintenance of DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2007511383,"There is an urgent need for improved therapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma, which may be met by administering immune-modulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to generate a tumor-destructive immune response. Using the ID8 mouse ovarian cancer model, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of various mAb combinations in mice with intraperitoneal (i.p.) tumor established by transplanting 3 × 106 ID8 cells 10 days previously. While most of the tested mAbs were ineffective when given individually or together, the data confirm our previous finding that 2 i.p. injections of a combination of anti-CD137 with anti-PD-1 mAbs doubles overall survival. Mice treated with this mAb combination have a significantly increased frequency and total number of CD8+ T cells both in the peritoneal lavage and spleens, and these cells are functional as demonstrated by antigen-specific cytolytic activity and IFN-γ production. While administration of anti-CD137 mAb as a single agent similarly increases CD8+ T cells, these have no functional activity, which may be attributed to up-regulation of co-inhibitory PD-1 and TIM-3 molecules induced by CD137. Addition of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin to the 2 mAb combination increased overall survival >90 days (and was probably curative) by a mechanism which included a systemic CD8+ T cell response with tumor specificity and immunological memory. Strikingly, combined treatment of cisplatin and CD137/PD-1 mAb also gave rise to the long-term survival of mice with established TC1 lung tumors. A similar combination of the 2 mAbs and cisplatin should be considered for clinical ‘translation’."
https://openalex.org/W1973378701,"The maintenance of endothelial barrier function is essential for normal physiology, and increased vascular permeability is a feature of a wide variety of pathological conditions, leading to complications including edema and tissue damage. Use of the pharmacological inhibitor imatinib, which targets the Abl family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (Abl and Arg), as well as other tyrosine kinases including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), Kit, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), and discoidin domain receptors, has shown protective effects in animal models of inflammation, sepsis, and other pathologies characterized by enhanced vascular permeability. However, the imatinib targets involved in modulation of vascular permeability have not been well-characterized, as imatinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases not only in endothelial cells and pericytes but also immune cells important for disorders associated with pathological inflammation and abnormal vascular permeability. In this work we employ endothelial Abl knockout mice to show for the first time a direct role for Abl in the regulation of vascular permeability in vivo. Using both Abl/Arg-specific pharmacological inhibition and endothelial Abl knockout mice, we demonstrate a requirement for Abl kinase activity in the induction of endothelial permeability by vascular endothelial growth factor both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, Abl kinase inhibition also impaired endothelial permeability in response to the inflammatory mediators thrombin and histamine. Mechanistically, we show that loss of Abl kinase activity was accompanied by activation of the barrier-stabilizing GTPases Rac1 and Rap1, as well as inhibition of agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization and generation of acto-myosin contractility. In all, these findings suggest that pharmacological targeting of the Abl kinases may be capable of inhibiting endothelial permeability induced by a broad range of agonists and that use of Abl kinase inhibitors may have potential for the treatment of disorders involving pathological vascular leakage."

Academic exam stress has effectively been applied as a naturalistic stress model, however its effect on somatization symptoms according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria has not been reported so far. Baseline associations between somatization and personality traits, such as alexithymia, have been studied exhaustively. Nevertheless, it is largely unknown if personality traits have an explanatory value for stress induced somatization.This longitudinal, quasi-experimental study assessed the effects of university exams on somatization - and the reversal of effects after an exam-free period. Repeated-observations were obtained within 150 students, measuring symptom intensity before, during and after an exam period, according to the Screening for Somatoform Symptoms 7-day (SOMS-7d). Additionally, self-reports on health status were used to differentiate between medically explained and medically unexplained symptoms. Alexithymia, neuroticism, trait-anxiety and baseline depression were surveyed using the Toronto-Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Big-Five Personality Interview (NEO-FFI), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II). These traits were competitively tested for their ability to explain somatization increases under exam stress.Somatization significantly increased across a wide range of symptoms under exam stress, while health reports pointed towards a reduction in acute infections and injuries. Neuroticism, alexithymia, trait anxiety and depression explained variance in somatization at baseline, but only neuroticism was associated with symptom increases under exam stress.Exam stress is an effective psychosocial stress model inducing somatization. A comprehensive quantitative description of bodily symptoms under exam stress is supplied. The results do not support the stress-alexithymia hypothesis, but favor neuroticism as a personality trait of importance for somatization."
https://openalex.org/W2075567933,"Norcantharidin (NCTD), a demethylated analog of cantharidin derived from blister beetles, has attracted considerable attentions in recent years due to their definitely toxic properties and the noteworthy advantages in stimulating bone marrow and increasing the peripheral leukocytes. Hence, it is worth studying the anti-tumor effect of NCTD on human prostate cancer cells DU145. It was found that after the treatment of NCTD with different concentrations (25-100 μM), the cell proliferation was significantly inhibited, which led to the appearance of micronucleus (MN). Moreover, the cells could be killed in a dose-/ time-dependent manner along with the reduction of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression, destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), down-regulation of MnSOD, induction of ROS, depletion of ATP, and activation of AMPK (Adenosine 5‘-monophosphate -activated protein kinase) . In addition, a remarkable release of cytochrome c was found in the cells exposed to 100 μM NCTD and exogenous SOD-PEG could eliminate the generation of NCTD-induced MN. In conclusion, our studies indicated that NCTD could induce the collapse of MMP and mitochondria dysfunction. Accumulation of intercellular ROS could eventually switch on the apoptotic pathway by causing DNA damage and depleting ATP."

They display several of the structural characteristics of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Ataluren (PTC124) is proposed to cause readthrough of premature stop codons and has been introduced as a potential treatment of genetic disorders. Clinical trials in DMD have shown promise, although with complex dose dependency. We have established physiology techniques, enabling high resolution of contractile function in skeletal muscle of zebrafish larvae. We aimed to provide a mechanical analysis of sapje larval muscle and examine effects of ataluren. Homozygous 5 d postfertilization (dpf) sapje larvae exhibited structural defects with 50% decrease in active tension. Ataluren (0.1–1 μM, 3–5 dpf) improved contractile function (~60% improvement of force at 0.5 μM) and dystrophin expression. Controls were not affected. Higher doses (5 μM, 35 μM) impaired contractile function, an effect also observed in controls, suggesting unspecific negative effects at high concentrations. In summary, Sapje larvae exhibit impaired contractile performance and provide a relevant DMD model for functional studies. Ataluren significantly improves skeletal muscle function in the sapje larvae, most likely reflecting an observed increase in dystrophin expression. The bell-shaped dose dependence in sapje resembles that previously reported in clinical DMD studies.—Li, M., Andersson-Lendahl, M., Sejersen, T., Arner, A.

https://openalex.org/W2034820917,"Background To prospectively evaluate the usefulness of the BRAFV600E mutation detection in daily clinical practice in patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC). Patients and Methods 504 mCRC patients treated with systemic chemotherapy ± biologics were analyzed. Results A statistically significant higher incidence of the BRAF mutation was observed in patients with ECOG-PS 2 (p=0.001), multiple metastatic sites (p=0.002),> 65 years old (p=0.004), primary tumors located in the colon (p<0.001), high-grade tumors (p=0.001) and in those with mucinous features (p=0.037). Patients with BRAFV600E mutated tumors had a statistically significantly reduced progression-free survival (PFS) compared to wild-type (wt) ones (4.1 and 11.6 months, respectively; p<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (14.0 vs. 34.6 months, respectively; p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis the BRAFV600E mutation emerged as an independent factor associated with reduced PFS (HR: 4.1, 95% CI 2.7–6.2; p<0.001) and OS (HR: 5.9, 95% CI 3.7–9.5; p<0.001). Among the 273 patients treated with salvage cetuximab or panitumumab, the BRAFV600E mutation was correlated with reduced PFS (2.2 vs. 6.0 months; p<0.0001) and OS (4.3 vs. 17.4 months; p<0.0001). Conclusions The presence of BRAFV600E-mutation in mCRC characterizes a subgroup of patients with distinct biologic, clinical and pathological features and is associated with very poor patients’ prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2059387378,"The β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (β-secretase, BACE1) initiates amyloidogenic processing of APP to generate amyloid β (Aβ), which is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Cerebral levels of BACE1 are elevated in individuals with AD, but the molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. We demonstrate that Rheb GTPase (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which induces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, is a physiological regulator of BACE1 stability and activity. Rheb overexpression depletes BACE1 protein levels and reduces Aβ generation, whereas the RNAi knockdown of endogenous Rheb promotes BACE1 accumulation, and this effect by Rheb is independent of its mTOR signaling. Moreover, GTP-bound Rheb interacts with BACE1 and degrades it through proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that Rheb levels are down-regulated in the AD brain, which is consistent with an increased BACE1 expression. Altogether, our study defines Rheb as a novel physiological regulator of BACE1 levels and Aβ generation, and the Rheb-BACE1 circuitry may have a role in brain biology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1999839463,"Megadose vitamin C (Vc) is one of the most enduring alternative treatments for diverse human diseases and is deeply engrafted in popular culture. Preliminary studies in the 1970s described potent effects of Vc on prolonging the survival of patients with terminal cancer, but these claims were later criticized. An improved knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of Vc and recent reports using cancer cell lines have renewed the interest in this subject. Despite these findings, using Vc as an adjuvant for anticancer therapy remains questionable, among other things because there is no proper mechanistic understanding. Here, we show that a Warburg effect triggered by activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway greatly enhances Vc-induced toxicity in multiple cancer cell lines, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective renal cancer cells. HIF increases the intracellular uptake of oxidized Vc through its transcriptional target glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), synergizing with the uptake of its reduced form through sodium-dependent Vc transporters. The resulting high levels of intracellular Vc induce oxidative stress and massive DNA damage, which then causes metabolic exhaustion by depleting cellular ATP reserves. HIF-positive cells are particularly sensitive to Vc-induced ATP reduction because they mostly rely on the rather inefficient glycolytic pathway for energy production. Thus, our experiments link Vc-induced toxicity and cancer metabolism, providing a new explanation for the preferential effect of Vc on cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2101651255,"Wnt4 is a key signal that channels the developmental fate of the indifferent mammalian gonad toward the ovary, but whether Wnt4 has later roles during ovary development remains unknown. To investigate this, we inactivated the Wnt4 gene by crossing Amhr2Cre and doxycycline-inducible RosartTA-knock-in Cre mice with mice carrying a floxed Wnt4 allele and used a novel Wnt4mCherry-knock-in mouse. In these models, ovarian folliculogenesis was compromised, and female fertility was severely reduced, and Wnt4 deficiency eventually led to premature ovarian failure. These anomalies were associated with cell polarity defects in the follicle. Within the follicle, laminin and type IV collagen assembled ectopic basement membrane–like structures, the cell adherens junction components N-cadherin and β-catenin lost their polarized expression pattern, and expression of the gap junction protein connexin 43 was reduced by ~30% when compared with that of the controls. Besides these changes, expression of antimullerian hormone (Amh) was inhibited in the absence of Wnt4 signaling in vivo. Consistent with this, Wnt4 signaling up-regulated Amh gene expression in KK1 cells in vitro. Thus, Wnt4 signaling is necessary during maturation of the ovarian follicles, where it coordinates expression of Amh, cell survival, and polarized organization of the follicular cells.—Prunskaite-Hyyrylainen, R., Shan, J., Railo, A., Heinonen, K.

By oligonucleotide pulldown and mass spectrometry discovery approaches, we identified the splicing regulator serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) 1 or splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor (SF2/ASF) to be important in the expression of CD3ζ chain. Importantly, increases in the expression of SRSF1 rescued IL-2 production in T cells from patients with SLE. In this study, we investigated the regulation of SRSF1 expression in resting and activated human T cells. We found that T cell stimulation induced a rapid and significant increase in mRNA expression of SRSF1; however, protein expression levels did not correlate with this increase. Co-engagement of CD28 induced a similar mRNA induction and reduction in protein levels. Proteasomal but not lysosomal degradation was involved in this down-regulation as evidenced by blocking with specific inhibitors MG132 and bafilomycin, respectively. Immunoprecipitation studies showed increased ubiquitination of SRSF1 in activated T cells. Interestingly, T cells from patients with SLE showed increased ubiquitination of SRSF1 when compared with those from healthy individuals. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of regulation of the splicing factor SRSF1 in human T cells and a potential molecular mechanism that controls its expression in SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2036143010,"Ceramide is a sphingolipid metabolite that induces cancer cell death. When C6-ceramide is encapsulated in a nanoliposome bilayer formulation, cell death is selectively induced in tumor models. However, the mechanism underlying this selectivity is unknown. As most tumors exhibit a preferential switch to glycolysis, as described in the “Warburg effect”, we hypothesize that ceramide nanoliposomes selectively target this glycolytic pathway in cancer. We utilize chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a cancer model, which has an increased dependency on glycolysis. In CLL cells, we demonstrate that C6-ceramide nanoliposomes, but not control nanoliposomes, induce caspase 3/7-independent necrotic cell death. Nanoliposomal ceramide inhibits both the RNA and protein expression of GAPDH, an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, which is overexpressed in CLL. To confirm that ceramide targets GAPDH, we demonstrate that downregulation of GAPDH potentiates the decrease in ATP after ceramide treatment and exogenous pyruvate treatment as well as GAPDH overexpression partially rescues ceramide-induced necrosis. Finally, an in vivo murine model of CLL shows that nanoliposomal C6-ceramide treatment elicits tumor regression, concomitant with GAPDH downregulation. We conclude that selective inhibition of the glycolytic pathway in CLL cells with nanoliposomal C6-ceramide could potentially be an effective therapy for leukemia by targeting the Warburg effect."

Our previous studies indicate that virulent Bb can potently enhance IL-10 production by macrophages (MØs) and that blocking IL-10 production significantly enhances bacterial clearance. We hypothesize that skin-associated APC types, such as MØs and dendritic cells (DCs) are potent producers of IL-10 in response to Bb, which may act in autocrine fashion to suppress APC responses critical for efficient Bb clearance. Our goal is to delineate which APC immune functions are dysregulated by Bb-elicited IL-10 using a murine model of Lyme disease. Our in vitro studies indicated that both APCs rapidly produce IL-10 upon exposure to Bb, that these levels inversely correlate with the production of many Lyme-relevant proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and that APCs derived from IL-10-/- mice produced greater amounts of these proinflammatory mediators than wild-type APCs. Phagocytosis assays determined that Bb-elicited IL-10 levels can diminish Bb uptake and trafficking by MØs, suppresses ROS production, but does not affect NO production; Bb-elicited IL-10 had little effect on phagocytosis, ROS, and NO production by DCs. In general, Bb exposure caused little-to-no upregulation of several critical surface co-stimulatory markers by MØs and DCs, however eliminating Bb-elicited IL-10 allowed a significant upregulation in many of these co-stimulatory receptors. These data indicate that IL-10 elicited from Bb-stimulated MØs and DCs results in decreased production of proinflammatory mediators and co-stimulatory molecules, and suppress phagocytosis-associated events that are important for mediating both innate and adaptive immune responses by APCs."
https://openalex.org/W1998283543,"β-amyloid peptide accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and synapse loss are characteristic neuropathological symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Tau hyperphosphorylation is suggested to inhibit the association of tau with microtubules, making microtubules unstable and causing neurodegeneration. The mechanism of tau phosphorylation in AD brain, therefore, is of considerable significance. Although PHF-tau is phosphorylated at over 40 Ser/Thr sites, Ser262 phosphorylation was shown to mediate β-amyloid neurotoxicity and formation of toxic tau lesions in the brain. In vitro, PKA is one of the kinases that phosphorylates tau at Ser262, but the mechanism by which it phosphorylates tau in AD brain is not very clear. 14-3-3ζ is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and is upregulated in AD brain. In this study, we show that 14-3-3ζ promotes tau phosphorylation at Ser262 by PKA in differentiating neurons. When overexpressed in rat hippocampal primary neurons, 14-3-3ζ causes an increase in Ser262 phosphorylation, a decrease in the amount of microtubule-bound tau, a reduction in the amount of polymerized microtubules, as well as microtubule instability. More importantly, the level of pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin was significantly reduced. Downregulation of synaptophysin in 14-3-3ζ overexpressing neurons was mitigated by inhibiting the proteosome, indicating that 14-3-3ζ promotes proteosomal degradation of synaptophysin. When 14-3-3ζ overexpressing neurons were treated with the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol, tau Ser262 phosphorylation decreased and synaptophysin level was restored. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of 14-3-3ζ accelerates proteosomal turnover of synaptophysin by promoting the destabilization of microtubules. Synaptophysin is involved in synapse formation and neurotransmitter release. Our results suggest that 14-3-3ζ may cause synaptic pathology by reducing synaptophysin levels in the brains of patients suffering from AD."

Here, we report PLTP synthesis, regulation, and its key role in HDL metabolism at the BBB. We demonstrate that PLTP is highly expressed and secreted by pBCEC. In a polarized in vitro model mimicking the BBB, pBCEC secreted phospholipid-transfer active PLTP preferentially to the basolateral (“brain parenchymal”) compartment. PLTP expression levels and phospholipid transfer activity were enhanced (up to 2.5-fold) by LXR activation using 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (a cerebral cholesterol metabolite) or TO901317 (a synthetic LXR agonist).

Preincubation of HDL3 with human plasma-derived active PLTP resulted in the formation of smaller and larger HDL particles and enhanced the capacity of the generated HDL particles to remove cholesterol from pBCEC by up to 3-fold. Pre-β-HDL, detected by two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis, was generated from HDL3 in pBCEC-derived supernatants, and their generation was markedly enhanced (1.9-fold) upon LXR activation. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated PLTP silencing (up to 75%) reduced both apoA-I-dependent (67%) and HDL3-dependent (30%) cholesterol efflux from pBCEC. Based on these findings, we propose that PLTP is actively involved in lipid transfer, cholesterol efflux, HDL genesis, and remodeling at the BBB. Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is a key protein involved in biogenesis and remodeling of plasma HDL. Several neuroprotective properties have been ascribed to HDL. We reported earlier that liver X receptor (LXR) activation promotes cellular cholesterol efflux and formation of HDL-like particles in an established in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) consisting of primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (pBCEC). Here, we report PLTP synthesis, regulation, and its key role in HDL metabolism at the BBB. We demonstrate that PLTP is highly expressed and secreted by pBCEC. In a polarized in vitro model mimicking the BBB, pBCEC secreted phospholipid-transfer active PLTP preferentially to the basolateral (“brain parenchymal”) compartment. PLTP expression levels and phospholipid transfer activity were enhanced (up to 2.5-fold) by LXR activation using 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (a cerebral cholesterol metabolite) or TO901317 (a synthetic LXR agonist). TO901317 administration elevated PLTP activity in BCEC from C57/BL6 mice. Preincubation of HDL3 with human plasma-derived active PLTP resulted in the formation of smaller and larger HDL particles and enhanced the capacity of the generated HDL particles to remove cholesterol from pBCEC by up to 3-fold. Pre-β-HDL, detected by two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis, was generated from HDL3 in pBCEC-derived supernatants, and their generation was markedly enhanced (1.9-fold) upon LXR activation. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated PLTP silencing (up to 75%) reduced both apoA-I-dependent (67%) and HDL3-dependent (30%) cholesterol efflux from pBCEC. Based on these findings, we propose that PLTP is actively involved in lipid transfer, cholesterol efflux, HDL genesis, and remodeling at the BBB. Escalating evidence suggests that disparities in lipid metabolism, mainly associated with impaired cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis, play a role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer disease24OH-C24(S)-hydroxycholesterolABCA1ATP binding cassette transporter A1apo A-Iapolipoprotein A-IBBBblood-brain barrierCSFcerebrospinal fluidHPRT1hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1LXR(s)liver X receptor(s)NDGGEnondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresisPCphosphatidyl cholinePLphospholipidPLTPphospholipid transfer proteinpBCECporcine brain capillary endothelial cellTEERtransendothelial electrical resistanceBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolAβamyloid βmBCECmouse brain capillary endothelial cellAPPamyloid precursor proteinNTCnontargeting controlSR-BIscavenger receptor class B, type I. and Niemann-Pick disease type C (1.Vaya J.

Lipids represent approximately half of the brain's dry weight, and phospholipids and cholesterol are the main lipid constituents of mammalian brain. Compared with other organs, the brain is highly enriched in cholesterol (containing 25% of total unesterified body cholesterol) and covers its cholesterol requirement by de novo synthesis mainly by glial cells and oligodendrocytes (2.Björkhem I. Meaney S. Brain cholesterol: long secret life behind a barrier.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 806-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and phospholipid transport within the central nervous system (CNS) is mediated by high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles (3.Ladu M.J. Reardon C. Van Eldik L. Fagan A.M. Bu G.

Peripheral HDL protects against cardiovascular disease by promoting reverse cholesterol transport and thereby eliminating excess cholesterol and/or by antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties ascribed to HDL (4.Rye K.A.

High plasma HDL-cholesterol and its main apolipoprotein (apo) A-I also protect against neurodegenerative disease; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored (5.Merched A. Xia Y.

The presence of tight junctions between brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC), constituting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), limits the exchange of circulating plasma lipoproteins with the brain. Nevertheless, cells forming the BBB (in particular BCEC) express several lipoprotein receptors, lipid transporters, and apolipoproteins important for both cholesterol turnover and HDL metabolism. We have shown that primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (pBCEC) are involved in the biogenesis of HDL-like particles at the “brain parenchymal side” of the BBB (6.Panzenboeck U.

This 80-kDa, extensively N-glycosylated, protein belongs to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein family and facilitates the exchange of phospholipids, cholesterol, and vitamin E among various lipoproteins as well as between lipoproteins and cells (9.Albers J.J.

Human plasma PLTP was shown to play a significant role in the conversion of circulating HDL into populations of larger (10.9 nm, HDL2) and smaller (7.8 nm pre-β) HDL particles (11.Jauhiainen M.

Both pro- and anti-atherogenic roles of PLTP have been reported (19.Tzotzas T. Desrumaux C. Lagrost L. Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP): review of an emerging cardiometabolic risk factor.Obes.

PLTP was proposed to play a role in the maintenance of functional and structural integrity of myelin and also to be an important regulator of signal transduction pathways in human neurons (13.Albers J.J. Vuletic S. Cheung M.C. Role of plasma phospholipid transfer protein in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PLTP deficiency significantly reduces brain vitamin E content and has been associated with increased anxiety in mice (23.Desrumaux C. Risold P.Y. Schroeder H. Deckert V. Masson D. Athias A.

PLTP was also found to be involved in regulating apoE (the major apolipoprotein in human brain) expression and secretion in primary human astrocytes (22.Vuletic S. Peskind E.R. Marcovina S.M.

These findings collectively suggest a significant role of PLTP in both physiological and pathophysiological processes in the brain. The goal of this study was to investigate possible roles of PLTP at the BBB, the interface between the brain and the peripheral circulation. In particular, we investigated its expression, regulation, and potential functions in HDL metabolism. Furthermore, using an established in vitro model of the BBB, we assessed its role in lipid flux between the brain and the circulation. Cell culture flasks, plates, and other plasticware were purchased from Greiner Bio-One (Kremsmünster, Austria). Transwell multiwell plates (polyester membrane inserts, 0.4 μm pore size) were obtained from Corning/Szabo-Scandic (Vienna, Austria). Medium M199, minimal essential medium, porcine serum, and dispase were obtained from Invitrogen, and bovine calf-skin collagen G was from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). Culture media additives, trypsin/EDTA, and DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium were purchased from PAA (Pasching, Austria), and collagenase/dispase was from Roche Applied Science.

RNeasy mini kit and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting for human PLTP were from Qiagen (Vienna, Austria). siRNA transfection reagents were obtained from Lonza and negative siRNA control from Dharmacon. PD-10 desalting columns and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF; 0.45 μm) transfer membranes were purchased from GE Healthcare. Centrifugal filter units (Amicon Ultra-15) for concentrating culture media from Merck. Antibodies were purchased from Abcam (PLTP, IgG; Cambridge, UK), Invitrogen (APP; Vienna, Austria), Millipore (A11 amyloid oligomer; Vienna, Austria) and Sigma (β-actin). PCR reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad and primers from Invitrogen. Anti-human apoA-I antibodies were raised in rabbits by immunizing the animals subcutaneously with 100 μg of apoA-I purified from human plasma HDL. All other solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade quality and purchased either from Sigma or Merck. Studies were carried out on 5-μm coronal cryosections of porcine brain samples. For immunocytochemistry, pBCEC were cultured on chamber slides. Tissue sections or cells were fixed in acetone for 5 min and air-dried 20 min prior to immunostaining using the UltraVision anti-polyvalent, LP HRP Detection System (Thermo Scientific, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were washed with 0.01 m PBS, pH 7.4, before primary antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Antibody concentrations were 0.7 μg/ml for rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor (Dako, CA), 1 μg/ml for rabbit anti-human PLTP (H-273; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and 1 μg/ml for normal rabbit immunoglobulin fraction (Dako). After rinsing for 5 min with PBS, slides were incubated with primary antibody enhancer (10 min) followed by horseradish peroxidase polymer (15 min). The slides were washed and immunolabeling was visualized by incubating with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Thermo Scientific) for 5 min. Slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Merck) and mounted with Kaiser's glycerol gelatin (Merck). pBCEC were isolated from freshly slaughtered pigs (about 6 months old) obtained from the local slaughterhouse as described by Franke et al. (26.Franke H. Galla H. Beuckmann C.T. Primary cultures of brain microvessel endothelial cells: a valid and flexible model to study drug transport through the blood-brain barrier in vitro.Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2000; 5: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After removal of the meninges and secretory areas of the porcine brain, pBCEC were isolated from the remaining cerebral cortex by sequential enzymatic digestion and centrifugation steps as described (26.Franke H. Galla H. Beuckmann C.T. Primary cultures of brain microvessel endothelial cells: a valid and flexible model to study drug transport through the blood-brain barrier in vitro.Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2000; 5: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). pBCEC were plated onto collagen-coated (60 μg/ml) 75-cm2 culture flasks with M199 medium (containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% gentamycin, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 10% porcine serum). Cells were washed twice with PBS after 24 h to remove cell debris and nonadherent cells and cultured in fresh M199 (containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 10% porcine serum) until confluent. After 3 days, the cells were trypsinized and plated onto collagen-coated (60 or 120 μg/ml) multiwell culture plates, flasks, or transwell filter plates and grown until confluent. For treatments, pBCEC monolayers were incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of LXR agonists (24(S)-hydroxycholesterol or TO901317) for 24 h in serum-free medium. All cell culture incubations were performed at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. To establish polarized pBCEC cultures, cells were plated onto collagen-coated (120 μg/ml) transwell (6- or 12-well) culture dishes at a density of 40,000 cells/cm2. Cells were grown for 2–3 days depending on the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER; ≥50 ohms/cm2). The tightness of the transwell culture was assessed by measuring the TEER using an EndOhm tissue resistance measurement chamber and EndOhm ohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Florida). TEERs of collagen-coated, cell-free filters were used as blanks. Tight junction formation was induced (overnight) by adding DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium containing 550 nm hydrocortisone, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.7 mm l-glutamine along with the indicated concentrations of LXR agonists. Establishment of intact tight junctions was indicated by TEERs rising between 300 and 1000 ohms/cm2 in the in vitro BBB model system. pBCEC supernatants were collected and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and secreted proteins were precipitated with 3% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Protein pellets were washed twice with acetone and resuspended in 1× sample buffer (Bio-Rad). For total cell proteins, pBCEC were lysed in protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% v/v protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4), sonicated, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Cellular protein concentrations were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Vienna, Austria). Equal amounts of proteins (cellular and secreted) were loaded onto NuPAGE Novex 4–12% BisTris Midi gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen) under denaturing conditions (200 V for 55 min). For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to 0.45-μm PVDF membranes (50 V for 1 h). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) for 90 min at room temperature, the membranes were probed using rabbit polyclonal anti-PLTP antibody (Abcam; 1:2000), rabbit polyclonal anti-APP antibody (Invitrogen; 1:1000), rabbit polyclonal A11 anti-amyloid oligomers antibody (Millipore; 1:10,000), or rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma; 1:5000) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and subsequently incubated with streptavidin-HRP (horseradish peroxidase; Bio-Rad)-labeled goat polyclonal antibody against rabbit IgG (Abcam; 1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. Equal loading and transfer of proteins were confirmed by β-actin detection. Immunoreactive bands were detected on CL-XPosure films (Thermo Scientific) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Western C Immun-Star, Bio-Rad). Bands were quantified densitometrically using ImageJ version 1.42 software (National Institutes of Health). Total RNA was isolated from pBCEC using RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, and RNA integrity was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, and total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) on a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Quantitative gene expression analysis of PLTP and reference genes HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1), ACTB (β-actin), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), TBP (TATA box-binding protein), RPL4 (ribosomal protein L4), and HMBS (hydroxymethylbilane synthase) were performed on a CFX 96 Real Time System (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green technology. In general, each reaction (10 μl) contained 1× iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 300 nm of each primer (Table 1), and 20 ng of cDNA template; PCR cycling conditions consisted of 40 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. All reactions were run in triplicate, and melting curve analyses were routinely performed to monitor the specificity of the PCR product. The relative gene expression ratio was determined using a standard curve method (27.Larionov A. Krause A. Miller W.

https://openalex.org/W2107969978,"The clinical symptoms of hemoglobin disorders such as β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia are significantly ameliorated by the persistent expression of γ-globin after birth. This knowledge has driven the discovery of important regulators that silence γ-globin postnatally. Improved understanding of the γ- to β-globin switching mechanism holds the key to devising targeted therapies for β-hemoglobinopathies. To further investigate this mechanism, we used the murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cell line containing an intact 183-kb human β-globin locus, in which the (G)γ- and β-globin genes are replaced by DsRed and eGFP fluorescent reporters, respectively. Following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of two key transcriptional regulators, Myb and BCL11A, we observed a derepression of γ-globin, measured by DsRed fluorescence and qRT-PCR (P<0.001). Interestingly, double knockdown of Myb and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) resulted in a robust induction of ε-globin, (up to 20% of total β-like globin species) compared to single knockdowns (P<0.001). Conversely, double knockdowns of BCL11A and DNMT1 enhanced γ-globin expression (up to 90% of total β-like globin species) compared to single knockdowns (P<0.001). Moreover, following RNAi treatment, expression of human β-like globin genes mirrored the expression levels of their endogenous murine counterparts. These results demonstrate that Myb and BCL11A cooperate with DNMT1 to achieve developmental repression of embryonic and fetal β-like globin genes in the adult erythroid environment."
https://openalex.org/W2124252591,"The scavenger receptor CD36 plays a central role in lipid metabolism by promoting macrophage cholesterol efflux with the potential to reduce atherosclerotic lesions. However, the effect of CD36 on de novo cholesterol synthesis is not known. Here, we describe the cellular mechanism by which CD36 activation induces cholesterol depletion in HepG2 cells. Using the CD36 ligand hexarelin, we found a rapid phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase Ser-872 in treated cells, resulting in inactivation of the rate-limiting enzyme in sterol synthesis. Degradation of HMG-CoA reductase by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was also enhanced by hexarelin, through an increased recruitment of the anchor proteins insulin-induced gene (Insig)-1 and Insig-2. Genes encoding key enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis and under the control of transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 remained unresponsive to sterol depletion, due to retention of the SREBP-2 escort protein Scap by Insig-1/2. Insig1 and Insig2 gene expression was also increased through activation of nuclear receptor peroxisome-proliferator activating receptor γ (PPARγ) by CD36, which lifted the inhibitory effect of PPARγ1 Ser-84 phosphorylation. Recruitment of co-activator peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) to activated AMPKα was also promoted, resulting in PGC-1α transcriptional activation through Sirt1-mediated deacetylation, increased recruitment of PPARγ, and up-regulation of Insig-1/2, revealing a regulatory role of CD36 on PGC-1α signaling. Our data identify CD36 as a novel regulator of HMG-CoA reductase function and Insig-1/2 expression, 2 critical steps regulating cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes.—Rodrigue-Way, A., Caron, V., Bilodeau, S., Keil, S., Hassan, M., Lévy, E., Mitchell, G.

https://openalex.org/W2003875312,"We used quantitative real-time PCR to examine the expression of 112 genes related to retinal function and/or belonging to known pro-apoptotic, cell survival, and autophagy pathways during photoreceptor degeneration in three early-onset canine models of human photoreceptor degeneration, rod cone dysplasia 1 (rcd1), X-linked progressive retinal atrophy 2 (xlpra2), and early retinal degeneration (erd), caused respectively, by mutations in PDE6B, RPGRORF15, and STK38L. Notably, we found that expression and timing of differentially expressed (DE) genes correlated with the cell death kinetics. Gene expression profiles of rcd1 and xlpra2 were similar; however rcd1 was more severe as demonstrated by the results of the TUNEL and ONL thickness analyses, a greater number of genes that were DE, and the identification of altered expression that occurred at earlier time points. Both diseases differed from erd, where a smaller number of genes were DE. Our studies did not highlight the potential involvement of mitochondrial or autophagy pathways, but all three diseases were accompanied by the down-regulation of photoreceptor genes, and up-regulation of several genes that belong to the TNF superfamily, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and pro-survival pathways. These proteins were expressed by different retinal cells, including horizontal, amacrine, ON bipolar, and Müller cells, and suggest an interplay between the dying photoreceptors and inner retinal cells. Western blot and immunohistochemistry results supported the transcriptional regulation for selected proteins. This study highlights a potential role for signaling through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in early cell death events and suggests that retinal cells other than photoreceptors might play a primary or bystander role in the degenerative process."
https://openalex.org/W2025068493,"The Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver (PRL) proteins promote cell signaling and are oncogenic when overexpressed. However, our understanding of PRL function came primarily from studies with cultured cell lines aberrantly or ectopically expressing PRLs. To define the physiological roles of the PRLs, we generated PRL2 knock-out mice to study the effects of PRL deletion in a genetically controlled, organismal model. PRL2-deficient male mice exhibit testicular hypotrophy and impaired spermatogenesis, leading to decreased reproductive capacity. Mechanistically, PRL2 deficiency results in elevated PTEN level in the testis, which attenuates the Kit-PI3K-Akt pathway, resulting in increased germ cell apoptosis. Conversely, increased PRL2 expression in GC-1 cells reduces PTEN level and promotes Akt activation. Our analyses of PRL2-deficient animals suggest that PRL2 is required for spermatogenesis during testis development. The study also reveals that PRL2 promotes Kit-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling by reducing the level of PTEN that normally antagonizes the pathway. Given the strong cancer susceptibility to subtle variations in PTEN level, the ability of PRL2 to repress PTEN expression qualifies it as an oncogene and a novel target for developing anti-cancer agents."

However, the bacterial adhesin(s) remain elusive. In this study, we show a dose-dependent binding of soluble hTSP-1 to Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria. Diminished binding of soluble hTSP-1 to proteolytically pretreated staphylococci suggested a proteinaceous nature of potential bacterial adhesin(s) for hTSP-1. A combination of separation of staphylococcal surface proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with a ligand overlay assay with hTSP-1 and identification of the target protein by mass spectrometry revealed the major staphylococcal autolysin Atl as a bacterial binding protein for hTSP-1. Binding experiments with heterologously expressed repeats of the AtlE amidase from Staphylococcus epidermidis suggest that the repeating sequences (R1ab-R2ab) of the N-acetyl-muramoyl-l-alanine amidase of Atl are essential for binding of hTSP-1. Atl has also been identified previously as a staphylococcal vitronectin (Vn)-binding protein. Similar to the interaction with hTSP-1, the R1ab-R2ab repeats of Atl are shown here to be crucial for the interaction of Atl with the complement inhibition and matrix protein Vn. Competition assays with hTSP-1 and Vn revealed the R1ab-R2ab repeats of AtlE as the common binding domain for both host proteins. Furthermore, Vn competes with hTSP-1 for binding to Atl repeats and vice versa. In conclusion, this study identifies the Atl repeats as bacterial adhesive structures interacting with the human glycoproteins hTSP-1 and Vn.

https://openalex.org/W1982856262,"Trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs) are important virulence factors of many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. TAAs form fibrous, adhesive structures on the bacterial cell surface. Their N-terminal extracellular domains are exported through a C-terminal membrane pore; the insertion of the pore domain into the bacterial outer membrane follows the rules of β-barrel transmembrane protein biogenesis and is dependent on the essential Bam complex. We have recently described the full fiber structure of SadA, a TAA of unknown function in Salmonella and other enterobacteria. In this work, we describe the structure and function of SadB, a small inner membrane lipoprotein. The sadB gene is located in an operon with sadA; orthologous operons are only found in enterobacteria, whereas other TAAs are not typically associated with lipoproteins. Strikingly, SadB is also a trimer, and its co-expression with SadA has a direct influence on SadA structural integrity. This is the first report of a specific export factor of a TAA, suggesting that at least in some cases TAA autotransport is assisted by additional periplasmic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2006292889,"Wnt and Notch signaling pathways both play essential roles and interact closely in development and carcinogenesis, but their interaction in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poorly unknown. Here we investigated the effects of CHIR99021, a Wnt signaling agonist, or Notch3-shRNA, or the combined application of CHIR99021 and Notch3-shRNA on cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the expressions of Notch3, its downstream genes, cyclinA and caspase-3. Our results showed that CHIR99021 up-regulated the expression of Notch3 protein and HES1 and HEYL mRNA. CHIR99021 promoted cell proliferation and the expression of cyclinA, which were inhibited by Notch3-shRNA in these three cell lines. Moreover, Notch3-shRNA significantly attenuated the positive effects of CHIR99021 on cell proliferation and cyclinA in H460 and H157. As for apoptosis, Notch3-shRNA induced cell apoptosis and increased the expression of caspase-3, whereas CHIR99021 showed the different effects in these three cell lines. The inhibitory effect of CHIR99021 on apoptosis was significantly weakened by Notch3-shRNA only in H460. Overall, although the effects of CHIR99021 and the combined application of CHIR99021 and Notch3-shRNA on the cell proliferation and apoptosis aren't completely similar in the three cell lines, our findings still indicate that Notch3 signaling can be activated by canonical Wnt signaling and a functional link between Wnt and Notch signaling pathways exists in NSCLC, at least, which partially is associated with their regulations on the expressions of cyclinA and caspase-3."
https://openalex.org/W2013274023,"Benzodiazepines (BZs) are safe drugs for treating anxiety, sleep, and seizure disorders, but their use also results in unwanted effects including memory impairment, abuse, and dependence. The present study aimed to reveal the molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the effects of BZs in the hippocampus (HIP), an area involved in drug-related plasticity, by investigating the regulation of immediate early genes following BZ administration. Previous studies have demonstrated that both brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and c-Fos contribute to memory- and abuse-related processes that occur within the HIP, and their expression is altered in response to BZ exposure. In the current study, mice received acute or repeated administration of BZs and HIP tissue was analyzed for alterations in BDNF and c-Fos expression. Although no significant changes in BDNF or c-Fos were observed in response to twice-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of diazepam (10 mg/kg + 5 mg/kg) or zolpidem (ZP; 2.5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg/kg), acute i.p. administration of both triazolam (0.03 mg/kg) and ZP (1.0 mg/kg) decreased BDNF protein levels within the HIP relative to vehicle, without any effect on c-Fos. ZP specifically reduced exon IV-containing BDNF transcripts with a concomitant increase in the association of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) with BDNF promoter IV, suggesting that MeCP2 activity at this promoter may represent a ZP-specific mechanism for reducing BDNF expression. ZP also increased the association of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) with BDNF promoter I. Future work should examine the interaction between ZP and DNA as the cause for altered gene expression in the HIP, given that BZs can enter the nucleus and intercalate into DNA directly."
https://openalex.org/W2017745942,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an attractive target for imaging agents that identify tumors and assess their response to therapy. PS is absent from the surface of most cell types, but becomes exposed on tumor cells and tumor vasculature in response to oxidative stresses in the tumor microenvironment and increases in response to therapy. To image exposed PS, we used a fully human PS-targeting antibody fragment, PGN635 F(ab’)2, that binds to complexes of PS and β2-glycoprotein I. PGN635 F(ab’)2 was labeled with the positron-emitting isotope iodine-124 (124I) and the resulting probe was injected into nude mice bearing subcutaneous or orthotopic human PC3 prostate tumors. Biodistribution studies showed that 124I-PGN635 F(ab’)2 localized with remarkable specificity to the tumors with little uptake in other organs, including the liver and kidneys. Clear delineation of the tumors was achieved by PET 48 hours after injection. Radiation of the tumors with 15 Gy or systemic treatment of the mice with 10 mg/kg docetaxel increased localization in the tumors. Tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratios were inversely correlated with tumor growth measured over 28 days. These data indicate that 124I-PGN635 F(ab’)2 is a promising new imaging agent for predicting tumor response to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1969699769,"Actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilins are essential regulators of actin turnover in eukaryotic cells. These multifunctional proteins facilitate both stabilization and severing of filamentous (F)-actin in a concentration-dependent manner. At high concentrations ADF/cofilins bind stably to F-actin longitudinally between two adjacent actin protomers forming what is called a decorative interaction. Low densities of ADF/cofilins, in contrast, result in the optimal severing of the filament. To date, how these two contrasting modalities are achieved by the same protein remains uncertain. Here, we define the proximate amino acids between the actin filament and the malaria parasite ADF/cofilin, PfADF1 from Plasmodium falciparum. PfADF1 is unique among ADF/cofilins in being able to sever F-actin but do so without stable filament binding. Using chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS) combined with structure reconstruction we describe a previously overlooked binding interface on the actin filament targeted by PfADF1. This site is distinct from the known binding site that defines decoration. Furthermore, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy imaging of single actin filaments confirms that this novel low affinity site is required for F-actin severing. Exploring beyond malaria parasites, selective blocking of the decoration site with human cofilin (HsCOF1) using cytochalasin D increases its severing rate. HsCOF1 may therefore also use a decoration-independent site for filament severing. Thus our data suggest that a second, low affinity actin-binding site may be universally used by ADF/cofilins for actin filament severing."
https://openalex.org/W1987803041,"The perennial stoloniferous herbaceous vine Mikania micrantha H.B.K. is among the most noxious exotic invaders in China and the world. Disturbance can fragment stolons of M. micrantha and disperse these fragments over long distances or bury them in soils at different depths. To test their regeneration capacity, single-node stolon fragments with stolon internode lengths of 0, 3, 6 and 12 cm were buried in soil at 0, 2, 5 and 8 cm depths, respectively. The fragments were growing for nine weeks, and their emergence status, growth and morphological traits were measured. The results indicated that increasing burial depth significantly decreased survival rate and increased the emergence time of the M. micrantha plants. At an 8-cm burial depth, very few fragments (2.19%) emerged and survived. Burial did not affect the total biomass and root to shoot ratio of the surviving M. micrantha plants that emerged from the 0- and 2-cm burial depths. Increasing internode length significantly increased survival rate and growth measures, but there was no interaction effect with burial depth for any traits measured. These results suggest that M. micrantha can regenerate from buried stolon fragments, and thus, disturbance may contribute to the spread of this exotic invader. Any human activities producing stolon fragments or facilitating dispersal should be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W2024859421,"The interface between psychiatry and stress-related gastrointestinal disorders (GI), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is well established, with anxiety and depression the most frequently occurring comorbid conditions. Moreover, stress-sensitive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, which display anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, exhibit GI disturbances akin to those observed in stress-related GI disorders. Additionally, there is mounting preclinical and clinical evidence implicating mast cells as significant contributors to the development of abdominal visceral pain in IBS. In this study we examined the effects of the rat connective tissue mast cell (CTMC) stabiliser, disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic ion transport, and examined both colonic and peritoneal mast cells from stress-sensitive WKY rats. DSCG significantly decreased abdominal pain behaviors induced by colorectal distension in WKY animals independent of a reduction in colonic rat mast cell mediator release. We further demonstrated that mast cell-stimulated colonic ion transport was sensitive to inhibition by the mast cell stabiliser DSCG, an effect only observed in stress-sensitive rats. Moreover, CTMC-like mast cells were significantly increased in the colonic submucosa of WKY animals, and we observed a significant increase in the proportion of intermediate, or immature, peritoneal mast cells relative to control animals. Collectively our data further support a role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of stress-related GI disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2154801591,"Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, such as XIAP or cIAP1/2, are important regulators of apoptosis in cancer cells, and IAP antagonists are currently evaluated as antitumor agents. Beyond their function in cancer cells, this study demonstrates a novel role of IAPs as regulators of vascular endothelial permeability. Two structurally different IAP antagonists, ABT and Smac085, as well as silencing of IAPs, reduced the thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)-induced barrier dysfunction in human endothelial cells as assessed by measuring macromolecular permeability or transendothelial electrical resistance. ABT diminished thrombin-evoked stress fiber formation, activation of myosin light chain 2, and disassembly of adherens junctions independent of calcium signaling, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Interestingly, ABT and silencing of IAPs, in particular XIAP, reduced the TRAP-evoked RhoA activation, whereas Rac1 was not affected. XIAP and, to a lesser extent, cIAP1 were found to directly interact with RhoA independently of the RhoA activation status. Under cell-free conditions, XIAP did not induce an ubiquitination of RhoA. In summary, our work discloses IAPs as crucial regulators of endothelial permeability and suggests IAP inhibition as interesting approach for the prevention of endothelial barrier dysfunction.—Hornburger, M.

https://openalex.org/W2042928426,"Hypertrophy is an adaptive response that enables organs to appropriately meet increased functional demands. Previously, we reported that calcineurin (Cn) is required for glomerular and whole kidney hypertrophy in diabetic rodents (Gooch, J. L., Barnes, J. L., Garcia, S., and Abboud, H. E. (2003). Calcineurin is activated in diabetes and is required for glomerular hypertrophy and ECM accumulation. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 284, F144-F154; Reddy, R. N., Knotts, T. L., Roberts, B.

Because studies have also implicated the reactive oxygen species-generating enzymes NADPH oxidases (Nox) in diabetic kidney responses, we tested the hypothesis that Nox and Cn cooperate in a common signaling pathway. First, we examined the role of the two main isoforms of Cn in hypertrophic signaling. Using primary kidney cells lacking a catalytic subunit of Cn (CnAα(-/-) or CnAβ(-/-)), we found that high glucose selectively activates CnAβ, whereas CnAα is constitutively active. Furthermore, CnAβ but not CnAα mediates hypertrophy. Next, we found that chronic reactive oxygen species generation in response to high glucose is attenuated in CnAβ(-/-) cells, suggesting that Cn is upstream of Nox. Consistent with this, loss of CnAβ reduces basal expression and blocks high glucose induction of Nox2 and Nox4. Inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a CnAβ-regulated transcription factor, decreases Nox2 and Nox4 expression, whereas NFAT overexpression increases Nox2 and Nox4, indicating that the CnAβ/NFAT pathway modulates Nox. These data reveal that the CnAβ/NFAT pathway regulates Nox and plays an important role in high glucose-mediated hypertrophic responses in the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2050368995,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a potent bioactive lipid found in atherosclerotic lesions, markedly induces smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration, which is an important process in atherogenesis. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of LPA-induced SMC migration is important. Several microarray databases suggest that the matricellular protein Cyr61 is highly induced by LPA. We hypothesized that Cyr61 mediates LPA-induced cell migration. Our data show that LPA induced temporal and spatial expression of Cyr61, which promptly accumulated in the cellular Golgi apparatus and then translocated to the extracellular matrix. Cyr61 antibody blockade and siRNA inhibition both diminished LPA-induced SMC migration, indicating a novel regulatory role of Cyr61. SMCs derived from LPA receptor 1 (LPA1) knock-out mice lack the ability of Cyr61 induction and cell migration, supporting the concept that LPA1 is required for Cyr61 expression and migration. By contrast, PPARγ was not found to be involved in LPA-mediated effects. Furthermore, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase important for regulating cell migration, was activated by LPA at a late time frame coinciding with Cyr61 accumulation. Interestingly, knockdown of Cyr61 blocked LPA-induced FAK activation, indicating that an LPA-Cyr61-FAK axis leads to SMC migration. Our results further demonstrate that plasma membrane integrins α6β1 and ανβ3 transduced the LPA-Cyr61 signal toward FAK activation and migration. Taken together, these data reveal that de novo Cyr61 in the extracellular matrix bridges LPA and integrin pathways, which in turn, activate FAK, leading to cell migration. The current study provides new insights into mechanisms underlying cell migration-related disorders, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, and cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2135845190,"Although bacteria and fungi are well-known to be decomposers of leaf litter, few studies have examined their compositions and diversities during the decomposition process in tropical stream water. Xishuangbanna is a tropical region preserving one of the highest floristic diversity areas in China. In this study, leaf litter of four dominant plant species in Xishuangbanna was incubated in stream water for 42 days during which samples were taken regularly. Following DNA extraction, PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and clone-sequencing analyses were performed using bacterial and fungal specific primers. Leaf species have slightly influences on bacterial community rather than fungal community. The richness and diversity of bacteria was higher than that of fungi, which increased towards the end of the 42-day-incubation. The bacterial community was initially more specific upon the type of leaves and gradually became similar at the later stage of decomposition with alpha-proteobacteria as major component. Sequences affiliated to methanotrophs were obtained that indicates potentially occurrence of methane oxidation and methanogenesis. For the fungal community, sequences affiliated to Aspergillus were predominant at the beginning and then shifted to Pleosporales. Our results suggest that the microorganisms colonizing leaf bioﬁlm in tropical stream water were mostly generalists that could exploit the resources of leaves of various species equally well."
https://openalex.org/W1973650836,"Candida albicans produces a complex glycosphingolipid called phospholipomannan (PLM), which is present on the cell-wall surface of yeast and shed upon contact with host cells. The glycan moiety of PLM is composed of β-mannosides with degrees of polymerization up to 19 in C. albicans serotype A. PLM from serotype B strains displays a twofold decrease in the length of the glycan chains. In this study we compared the proinflammatory activities of PLMs purified from C. albicans serotype A and serotype B strains and from a bmt6Δ mutant of C. albicans, whose PLM is composed of short truncated oligomannosidic chain. We found that PLMs activate caspase-1 in murine macrophage cell line J774 independent of the glycan chain length although IL-1β secretion is more intense with long glycan chain. None of the tested PLMs stimulate ROS production, indicating that caspase-1 activation may occur through a ROS-independent pathway. On the other hand, only long-chain oligomannosides present on PLM from serotype A strain (PLM-A) are able to induce TNF-α production in macrophages, a property that is not affect by blocking endocytosis through latrunculin A treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that soluble and not cell surface-bound galectin-3, is able to potentiate PLM-A-induced TNF-α production in macrophages. PLMs from C. albicans serotype B and from bmt6∆ mutant are not able to induce TNF-α production and galectin-3 pretreatment does not interfere with this result. In conclusion, we show here that PLMs are able to evoke a proinflammatory state in macrophage, which is in part dependent on their glycosylation status. Long-glycan chains favor interaction with soluble galectin-3 and help amplify inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2018068708,"Introduction Body mass index is known to be positively associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, yet there is there limited evidence on whether physical activity or sedentary behavior affects risk of histology- and site-specific upper gastrointestinal cancers. We used the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study to assess these exposures in relation to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA). Methods Self-administered questionnaires were used to elicit physical activity and sedentary behavior exposures at various age periods. Cohort members were followed via linkage to the US Postal Service National Change of Address database, the Social Security Administration Death Master File, and the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (95%CI) Results During 4.8 million person years, there were a total of 215 incident ESCCs, 631 EAs, 453 GCAs, and 501 GNCAs for analysis. Strenuous physical activity in the last 12 months (HR>5 times/week vs. never=0.58, 95%CI: 0.39, 0.88) and typical physical activity and sports during ages 15–18 years (p for trend=0.01) were each inversely associated with GNCA risk. Increased sedentary behavior was inversely associated with EA (HR5–6 hrs/day vs. <1 hr=0.57, 95%CI: 0.36, 0.92). There was no evidence that BMI was a confounder or effect modifier of any relationship. After adjustment for multiple testing, none of these results were deemed to be statistically significant at p<0.05. Conclusions We find evidence for an inverse association between physical activity and GNCA risk. Associations between body mass index and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus do not appear to be related to physical activity and sedentary behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2000235771,"In both vertebrates and invertebrates, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are expressed in sensory neurons and mediate environmental stimuli such as light, sound, temperature, and taste. Some of these channels, however, are expressed only in the brain and their functions remain incompletely understood. Using the GAL4/UAS binary system with a line in which the GAL4 had been knocked into the trpA1 locus in Drosophila, we recently reported new insights into TRPA1 localization and function, including its expression in approximately 15% of all circadian neurons. TRPA1 is expressed in lateral posterior neurons (LPNs), which are known to be highly sensitive to entrainment by temperature cycles. Here, I used the bacterial sodium channel, NaChBac, to examine the effects of altering the electrical properties of trpA1 neurons on circadian rhythms. My results indicate that circadian activity of the flies in the morning, daytime, and evening was affected in a temperature-dependent manner following TRPA1 neuronal activation. Remarkably, TRPA1 neuron activation in flies kept at 18°C impacted the morning peak of circadian activity even though TRPA1 is not expressed in morning cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of TRPA1-expressing neurons may differentially coordinate light/dark circadian entrainment, depending on the temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2092691099,"Poly(A)-binding proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes and regulate stability of mRNA and translation. Among C. elegans homologues, pab-1 mutants showed defects in germline mitotic proliferation. Unlike pab-1 mutants, pab-1 RNAi at every larval stage caused arrest of germline development at the following stage, indicating that pab-1 is required for the entire postembryonic germline development. This idea is supported by the observations that the mRNA level of pab-1 increased throughout postembryonic development and its protein expression was germline-enriched. PAB-1 localized to P granules and the cytoplasm in the germline. PAB-1 colocalized with CGH-1 and CAR-1 and affected their localization, suggesting that PAB-1 is a component of processing (P)-bodies that interacts with them. The mRNA and protein levels of representative germline genes, rec-8, GLP-1, rme-2, and msp-152, were decreased after pab-1 RNAi. Although the mRNA level of msp-152 was increased in cgh-1 mutant, it was also significantly reduced by pab-1 RNAi. Our results suggest that PAB-1 positively regulates the mRNA levels of germline genes, which is likely facilitated by the interaction of PAB-1 with other P-body components, CGH-1 and CAR-1."
https://openalex.org/W2098868681,"Proximal objects provide affordances that activate the motor information involved in interacting with the objects. This effect has previously been shown for artifacts but not for natural objects, such as food. This study examined whether the sight of proximal food, compared to distant food activates eating-related information. In two experiments reaction times to verbal labels following the sight of proximal and distant objects (food and toys) were measured. Verbal labels included function words that were compatible with one object category (eating and playing) and observation words compatible with both object categories. The sight of food was expected to activate eating-related information when presented at proximity but not at distance, as reflected by faster reaction times to proximal than distant compatible eating words and no difference between reaction times to proximal and distant food for observation words (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 additionally compared the reaction times to wrapped and unwrapped food. The distance effect was expected to occur only for unwrapped food because only unwrapped food is readily edible. As expected, Experiment 1 and 2 revealed faster responses to compatible eating words at proximity than at distance. In Experiment 2 this distance effect occurred only for readily edible, unwrapped food but not for wrapped food. For observation words no difference in response times between the distances was found. These findings suggest that the sight of proximal food activates eating-related information, which could explain people’s differential behavioral responses to reachable versus distant food. The activation of eating-related information upon sight of accessible food could provide a cognition-based explanation for mindless eating."
https://openalex.org/W2071145632,"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is commonly used to measure neurologic function and guide treatment after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in routine stroke clinics. We evaluated its reliability and sensitivity to detect change with consecutive and unique rater combinations in a real-world setting.Conservative measures of interrater reliability (unweighted Kappa (κ), Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC1,1) and sensitivity to detect change (Minimal Detectable Difference (MDD)) were estimated. Sixty-one repeated ratings were completed within 1 week after ICH by physicians and nurses with no investigator intervention.Reliability (consistency) of the NIHSS total score was good for both physicians vs. nurses and nurses vs. nurses (ICC=0.78, 95%CI: 0.58-0.89 and ICC=0.75, 95%CI: 0.55-0.87 respectively) in this scenario. Reliability (agreement) of items 1C and 9 were excellent (κ>=0.61) for both rater comparisons, however, reliability was poor to fair on most remaining items (κ:0.01-0.60), with item 11 being completely unreliable in this scenario (κ<0.01). The MDD95 of the total NIHSS score was ±10 and ±11 points for physician vs. nurse and nurse vs. nurse comparisons.The reliability of the NIHSS is good overall for ICH even in an uncontrolled setting. However, on repeated measurements changes in total NIHSS score of at least >=10 points need to be observed for clinicians to be confident that real changes had occurred within 1 week after ICH."
https://openalex.org/W2031935479,"Shigella flexneri remains a significant human pathogen due to high morbidity among children < 5 years in developing countries. One of the key features of Shigella infection is the ability of the bacterium to initiate actin tail polymerisation to disseminate into neighbouring cells. Dynamin II is associated with the old pole of the bacteria that is associated with F-actin tail formation. Dynamin II inhibition with dynasore as well as siRNA knockdown significantly reduced Shigella cell to cell spreading in vitro. The ocular mouse Sereny model was used to determine if dynasore could delay the progression of Shigella infection in vivo. While dynasore did not reduce ocular inflammation, it did provide significant protection against weight loss. Therefore dynasore's effects in vivo are unlikely to be related to the inhibition of cell spreading observed in vitro. We found that dynasore decreased S. flexneri-induced HeLa cell death in vitro which may explain the protective effect observed in vivo. These results suggest the administration of dynasore or a similar compound during Shigella infection could be a potential intervention strategy to alleviate disease symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2076716789,"Current methods for detecting real-time alphavirus (Family Togaviridae) infection in mosquitoes require the use of recombinant viruses engineered to express a visibly detectable reporter protein. These altered viruses expressing fluorescent proteins, usually from a duplicated viral subgenomic reporter, are effective at marking infection but tend to be attenuated due to the modification of the genome. Additionally, field strains of viruses cannot be visualized using this approach unless infectious clones can be developed to insert a reporter protein. To circumvent these issues, we have developed an insect cell-based system for detecting wild-type sindbis virus infection that uses a virus inducible promoter to express a fluorescent reporter gene only upon active virus infection. We have developed an insect expression system that produces sindbis virus minigenomes containing a subgenomic promoter sequence, which produces a translatable RNA species only when infectious virus is present and providing viral replication proteins. This subgenomic reporter RNA system is able to detect wild-type Sindbis infection in cultured mosquito cells. The detection system is relatively species specific and only detects closely related viruses, but can detect low levels of alphavirus specific replication early during infection. A chikungunya virus detection system was also developed that specifically detects chikungunya virus infection. Transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquito families were established that constitutively express the sindbis virus reporter RNA and were found to only express fluorescent proteins during virus infection. This virus inducible reporter system demonstrates a novel approach for detecting non-recombinant virus infection in mosquito cell culture and in live transgenic mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2067294028,"Action plans are not generated from scratch for each movement, but features of recently generated plans are recalled for subsequent movements. This study investigated whether the observation of an action is sufficient to trigger plan recall processes. Participant dyads performed an object manipulation task in which one participant transported a plunger from an outer platform to a center platform of different heights (first move). Subsequently, either the same (intra-individual task condition) or the other participant (inter-individual task condition) returned the plunger to the outer platform (return moves). Grasp heights were inversely related to center target height and similar irrespective of direction (first vs. return move) and task condition (intra- vs. inter-individual). Moreover, participants' return move grasp heights were highly correlated with their own, but not with their partners' first move grasp heights. Our findings provide evidence that a simulated action plan resembles a plan of how the observer would execute that action (based on a motor representation) rather than a plan of the actually observed action (based on a visual representation)."
https://openalex.org/W2095735657,"Histamine and its receptors are important in both multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). C57BL/6J (B6) mice deficient for the histamine H2 receptor (H2RKO) are less susceptible to EAE and exhibit blunted Th1 responses. However, whether decreased antigen-specific T-cell effector responses in H2RKO mice were due to a lack of H2R signaling in CD4+ T cells or antigen-presenting cells has remained unclear. We generated transgenic mice expressing H2R specifically in T cells on the H2RKO background, and, using wild-type B6 and H2RKO mice as controls, induced EAE either in the presence or absence of the ancillary adjuvant pertussis toxin (PTX), which models the effects of infectious inflammatory stimuli on autoimmune disease. We monitored the mice for clinical signs of EAE and neuropathology, as well as effector T-cell responses using flow cytometry. EAE severity and neuropathology in H2RKO mice expressing H2R exclusively in T cells become equal to those in wild-type B6 mice only when PTX is used to elicit disease. EAE complementation was associated with frequencies of CD4+IFN-γ+ and CD4+IL-17+ cells that are equal to or greater than those in wild-type B6, respectively. Thus, the regulation of enceph-alitogenic T-cell responses and EAE susceptibility by H2R signaling in CD4+ T cells is dependent on gene × environment interactions.—Saligrama, N., Case, L.

https://openalex.org/W2083563651,"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a condition that arises from complex etiologies. The absence of consistent environmental risk factors and the presence of modest familial associations suggest ALL is a complex trait with an underlying genetic component. The identification of genetic factors associated with disease is complicated by complex genetic covariance structures and multiple testing issues. Both issues can be resolved with appropriate Bayesian variable selection methods. The present study was undertaken to extend our hierarchical Bayesian model for case-parent triads to incorporate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and incorporate the biological grouping of SNPs within genes. Based on previous evidence that genetic variation in the folate metabolic pathway influences ALL risk, we evaluated 128 tagging SNPs in 16 folate metabolic genes among 118 ALL case-parent triads recruited from the Texas Children's Cancer Center (Houston, TX) between 2003 and 2010. We used stochastic search gene suggestion (SSGS) in hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the association between folate metabolic SNPs and ALL. Using Bayes factors among these variants in childhood ALL case-parent triads, two SNPs were identified with a Bayes factor greater than 1. There was evidence that the minor alleles of NOS3 rs3918186 (OR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15) and SLC19A1 rs1051266 (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25-3.46) were positively associated with childhood ALL. Our findings are suggestive of the role of inherited genetic variation in the folate metabolic pathway on childhood ALL risk, and they also suggest the utility of Bayesian variable selection methods in the context of case-parent triads for evaluating the role of SNPs on disease risk."
