https://openalex.org/W2999585791,"Genomes across a wide range of eukaryotic organisms fold into higher-order chromatin domains. Topologically associating domains (TADs) were originally discovered empirically in low-resolution Hi-C heat maps representing ensemble average interaction frequencies from millions of cells. Here, we discuss recent advances in high-resolution Hi-C, single-cell imaging experiments, and functional genetic studies, which provide an increasingly complex view of the genome’s hierarchical structure–function relationship. On the basis of these new findings, we update the definitions of distinct classes of chromatin domains according to emerging knowledge of their structural, mechanistic and functional properties. Recent advances in Hi-C, single-cell imaging and functional genetic studies warrant discussion on the functional relevance of topologically associating domains (TADs) and other classes of chromatin domains."
https://openalex.org/W3000416397,"Enteric-associated neurons (EANs) are closely associated with immune cells and continuously monitor and modulate homeostatic intestinal functions, including motility and nutrient sensing. Bidirectional interactions between neuronal and immune cells are altered during disease processes such as neurodegeneration or irritable bowel syndrome. We investigated the effects of infection-induced inflammation on intrinsic EANs (iEANs) and the role of intestinal muscularis macrophages (MMs) in this context. Using murine models of enteric infections, we observed long-term gastrointestinal symptoms, including reduced motility and loss of excitatory iEANs, which was mediated by a Nlrp6- and Casp11-dependent mechanism, depended on infection history, and could be reversed by manipulation of the microbiota. MMs responded to luminal infection by upregulating a neuroprotective program via β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) signaling and mediated neuronal protection through an arginase 1-polyamine axis. Our results identify a mechanism of neuronal death post-infection and point to a role for tissue-resident MMs in limiting neuronal damage."
https://openalex.org/W2999849152,"Recent interest in astrocyte activation states has raised the fundamental question of how these cells, normally essential for synapse and neuronal maintenance, become pathogenic. Here, we show that activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), specifically phosphorylated protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK-P) signaling-a pathway that is widely dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases-generates a distinct reactivity state in astrocytes that alters the astrocytic secretome, leading to loss of synaptogenic function in vitro. Further, we establish that the same PERK-P-dependent astrocyte reactivity state is harmful to neurons in vivo in mice with prion neurodegeneration. Critically, targeting this signaling exclusively in astrocytes during prion disease is alone sufficient to prevent neuronal loss and significantly prolongs survival. Thus, the astrocyte reactivity state resulting from UPR over-activation is a distinct pathogenic mechanism that can by itself be effectively targeted for neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2999987908,"In response to biotic stress, plants produce suites of highly modified fatty acids that bear unusual chemical functionalities. Despite their chemical complexity and proposed roles in pathogen defense, little is known about the biosynthesis of decorated fatty acids in plants. Falcarindiol is a prototypical acetylenic lipid present in carrot, tomato, and celery that inhibits growth of fungi and human cancer cell lines. Using a combination of untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) required for falcarindiol production. By reconstituting initial biosynthetic steps in a heterologous host and generating transgenic pathway mutants in tomato, we demonstrate a direct role of the cluster in falcarindiol biosynthesis and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in tomato leaves. This work reveals a mechanism by which plants sculpt their lipid pool in response to pathogens and provides critical insight into the complex biochemistry of alkynyl lipid production."
https://openalex.org/W2998766705,"Background Problem gambling is a public health issue and its comorbidity with other health conditions may provide an opportunity for screening in healthcare settings; however, a high level of uncertainty and a lack of research in the field remains. The objective of this study is to investigate potential associations between problem gambling and numerous other health conditions, including substance use, mental health problems, and behavioural addictions. Methods A cross-sectional web-survey was distributed by a market research company to an online panel of respondents in Sweden, which aimed to be representative of the general population. Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests, followed by logistic regression analysis, were performed to determine associations between screening positive for lifetime problem gambling and potential comorbid conditions and behaviours. Results Among 2038 participants, 5.7 percent screened positive for lifetime problem gambling. Significant associations were found between problem gambling and male gender, education level, daily tobacco use, moderate psychological distress, problematic shopping, and problem gaming. Conclusion The association between screening for problem gambling and other health conditions, including psychological distress and behavioural addictions such as shopping and gaming, demonstrates the need to screen for problem gambling in the context of other health hazards, such as in different healthcare settings. Further research is required to identify the temporal relationship between these conditions and to investigate underlying etiological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2999353892,"Attachment theories postulate that during adolescence, peer relationships become more important as a predictor of positive social, emotional and behavioral outcomes. Adolescents develop the ability to empathize with others, which is related to healthy functioning and positive peer relationships. Empathy has been studied as a potential mechanism that may help to explain how strong and healthy emotional bonds are associated with less emotional disorders and conduct problems in youth. The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between peer attachment and strengths and difficulties during adolescence, considering empathy as a potential mediator of this association. A total of 800 Spanish adolescents (56.65% girls), aged between 12 and 15 years (M = 14.02, SD = 1.21), completed measures of peer attachment, empathy, conduct problems, emotional difficulties and prosocial behavior. Structural equation models indicated that peer attachment was negatively associated with conduct problems and emotional difficulties but positively related to prosocial behavior. In general, empathy mediated the link between peer attachment and both emotional and behavioral outcomes, without significant group differences between boys and girls. The discussion focuses on the importance of healthy peer relationships as a powerful predictor of emotional well-being and psychological problems in adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2999355862,"Studies of the interactions between plants and their microbiome have been conducted worldwide in the search for growth-promoting representative strains for use as biological inputs for agriculture, aiming to achieve more sustainable agriculture practices. With a focus on the isolation of plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria with ability to alleviate N stress, representative strains that were found at population densities greater than 104 cells g-1 and that could grow in N-free semisolid media were isolated from soils under different management conditions and from the roots of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and lulo (Solanum quitoense) plants that were grown in those soils. A total of 101 bacterial strains were obtained, after which they were phylogenetically categorized and characterized for their basic PGP mechanisms. All strains belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum in the classes Alphaproteobacteria (61% of isolates), Betaproteobacteria (19% of isolates) and Gammaproteobacteria (20% of isolates), with distribution encompassing nine genera, with the predominant genus being Rhizobium (58.4% of isolates). Strains isolated from conventional horticulture (CH) soil composed three bacterial genera, suggesting a lower diversity for the diazotrophs/N scavenger bacterial community than that observed for soils under organic management (ORG) or secondary forest coverture (SF). Conversely, diazotrophs/N scavenger strains from tomato plants grown in CH soil comprised a higher number of bacterial genera than did strains isolated from tomato plants grown in ORG or SF soils. Furthermore, strains isolated from tomato were phylogenetically more diverse than those from lulo. BOX-PCR fingerprinting of all strains revealed a high genetic diversity for several clonal representatives (four Rhizobium species and one Pseudomonas species). Considering the potential PGP mechanisms, 49 strains (48.5% of the total) produced IAA (2.96–193.97 μg IAA mg protein-1), 72 strains (71.3%) solubilized FePO4 (0.40–56.00 mg l-1), 44 strains (43.5%) solubilized AlPO4 (0.62–17.05 mg l-1), and 44 strains produced siderophores (1.06–3.23). Further, 91 isolates (90.1% of total) showed at least one PGP trait, and 68 isolates (67.3%) showed multiple PGP traits. Greenhouse trials using the bacterial collection to inoculate tomato or lulo plants revealed increases in plant biomass (roots, shoots or both plant tissues) elicited by 65 strains (54.5% of the bacterial collection), of which 36 were obtained from the tomato rhizosphere, 15 were obtained from the lulo rhizosphere, and 14 originated from samples of soil that lacked plants. In addition, 18 strains showed positive inoculation effects on both Solanum species, of which 12 were classified as Rhizobium spp. by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, the strategy adopted allowed us to identify the variability in the composition of culturable diazotroph/N-scavenger representatives from soils under different management conditions by using two Solanum species as trap plants. The present results suggest the ability of tomato and lulo plants to enrich their belowground microbiomes with rhizobia representatives and the potential of selected rhizobial strains to promote the growth of Solanum crops under limiting N supply."
https://openalex.org/W2999937891,"Glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are believed to classically bind DNA as homodimers or MR-GR heterodimers to influence gene regulation in response to pulsatile basal or stress-evoked glucocorticoid secretion. Pulsed corticosterone presentation reveals MR and GR co-occupy DNA only at the peaks of glucocorticoid oscillations, allowing interaction. GR DNA occupancy was pulsatile, while MR DNA occupancy was prolonged through the inter-pulse interval. In mouse mammary 3617 cells MR-GR interacted in the nucleus and at a chromatin-associated DNA binding site. Interactions occurred irrespective of ligand type and receptors formed complexes of higher order than heterodimers. We also detected MR-GR interactions ex-vivo in rat hippocampus. An expanded range of MR-GR interactions predicts structural allostery allowing a variety of transcriptional outcomes and is applicable to the multiple tissue types that co-express both receptors in the same cells whether activated by the same or different hormones."
https://openalex.org/W3000671084,"Liberia and Gabon joined the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa (GDSA), established in 2012, with the goal of incorporating the value of nature into national decision making by estimating the multiple services obtained from ecosystems using the natural capital accounting framework. In this study, we produced 30-m resolution 10 classes land cover maps for the 2015 epoch for Liberia and Gabon using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to support the ongoing natural capital accounting efforts in these nations. We propose an integrated method of pixel-based classification using Landsat 8 data, the Random Forest (RF) classifier and ancillary data to produce high quality land cover products to fit a broad range of applications, including natural capital accounting. Our approach focuses on a pre-classification filtering (Masking Phase) based on spectral signature and ancillary data to reduce the number of pixels prone to be misclassified; therefore, increasing the quality of the final product. The proposed approach yields an overall accuracy of 83% and 81% for Liberia and Gabon, respectively, outperforming prior land cover products for these countries in both thematic content and accuracy. Our approach, while relatively simple and highly replicable, was able to produce high quality land cover products to fill an observational gap in up to date land cover data at national scale for Liberia and Gabon."
https://openalex.org/W2999224604,"Additive manufactured, porous bone implants have the potential to improve osseointegration and reduce failure rates of orthopaedic devices. Substantially porous implants are increasingly used in a number of orthopaedic applications. HA plasma spraying–a line of sight process—cannot coat the inner surfaces of substantially porous structures, whereas electrochemical deposition of calcium phosphate can fully coat the inner surfaces of porous implants for improved bioactivity, but the osseous response of different types of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings with ionic substitutions has not been evaluated for implants in the same in vivo model. In this study, laser sintered Ti6Al4V implants with pore sizes of Ø 700 μm and Ø 1500 μm were electrochemically coated with HA, silicon-substituted HA (SiHA), and strontium-substituted HA (SrHA), and implanted in ovine femoral condylar defects. Implants were retrieved after 6 weeks and histological and histomorphometric evaluation were compared to electrochemically coated implants with uncoated and HA plasma sprayed controls. The HA, SiHA and SrHA coatings had Ca:P, Ca:(P+Si) and (Ca+Sr):P ratios of 1.53, 1.14 and 1.32 respectively. Electrochemically coated implants significantly promoted bone attachment to the implant surfaces of the inner pores and displayed improved osseointegration compared to uncoated scaffolds for both pore sizes (p<0.001), whereas bone ingrowth was restricted to the surface for HA plasma coated or uncoated implants. Electrochemically coated HA implants achieved the highest osseointegration, followed by SrHA coated implants, and both coatings exhibited significantly more bone growth than plasma sprayed groups (p≤0.01 for all 4 cases). SiHA had significantly more osseointegration when compared against the uncoated control, but no significant difference compared with other coatings. There was no significant difference in ingrowth or osseointegration between pore sizes, and the bone-implant-contact was significantly higher in the electrochemical HA than in SiHA or SrHA. These results suggest that osseointegration is insensitive to pore size, whereas surface modification through the presence of an osteoconductive coating plays an important role in improving osseointegration, which may be critically important for extensively porous implants."
https://openalex.org/W2999289224,"Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is one of the most serious diseases. Although previous research using two-dimensional gel-based proteomics to assess the proteins related to the rice blast resistance had been done, few proteins were identified. Here, we used the iTRAQ method to detect the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the durable resistant rice variety Gangyuan8 (GY8) and the susceptible rice variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) in response to M. oryzae invasion, and then transcriptome sequencing was used to assist analysis A total of 193 and 672 DEPs were specifically identified in GY8 and LTH, respectively, with only 46 similarly expressed DEPs being shared by GY8 and LTH.39 DEPs involved in plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, fatty acid metabolism and peroxisome biosynthesis were significantly different between compatible interaction (LTH) and incompatible interaction (GY8). Some proteins participated in peroxide signal transduction and biosynthesis was down-regulated in GY8 but up-regulated in LTH. A lot of genes encoding pathogenesis-related gene (PR), such as chitinase and glucanase, were significantly up-regulated at both the transcriptome and proteome levels at 24 hours post-inoculation in GY8, but up-regulated at the transcriptome level and down-regulated at the proteome level in LTH. Our study reveals that the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity defense system may be activated at the transcriptome level but was inhibited at the protein level in susceptible rice varieties after inoculation. The results may facilitate future studies of the molecular mechanisms of rice blast resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2999654231,"Osteoporotic osteoarthritis (OPOA) is a common bone disease mostly in the elderly, but the relationship between Osteoporotic (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) is complex. It has been shown that knee loading can mitigate OA symptoms. However, its effects on OPOA remain unclear. In this study, we characterized pathological linkage of OP to OA, and evaluated the effect of knee loading on OPOA. We employed two mouse models (OA and OPOA), and conducted histology, cytology, and molecular analyses. In the OA and OPOA groups, articular cartilage was degenerated and Osteoarthritis Research Society International score was increased. Subchondral bone underwent abnormal remodeling, the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to osteoblasts and chondrocytes was reduced, and migration and adhesion of pre-osteoclasts were enhanced. Compared to the OA group, the pathological changes of OA in the OPOA group were considerably aggravated. After knee loading, however, cartilage degradation was effectively prevented, and the abnormal remodeling of subchondral bone was significantly inhibited. The differentiation of BMSCs was also improved, and the expression of Wnt/β-catenin was elevated. Collectively, this study demonstrates that osteoporosis aggravates OA symptoms. Knee loading restores OPOA by regulating subchondral bone remodeling, and may provide an effective method for repairing OPOA."
https://openalex.org/W3000382870,"Ocean acidification is an emerging consequence of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The full extent of the biological impacts are currently not entirely defined. However, it is expected that invertebrate species that rely on the mineral calcium carbonate will be directly affected. Despite the limited understanding of the full extent of potential impacts and responses there is a need to identify potential pathways for human societies to be affected by ocean acidification. Research on these social implications is a small but developing field. This research contributes to this field by using an impact assessment framework, informed by a biophysical model of future species distributions, to investigate potential impacts facing Atlantic Canadian society from potential changes in shellfish fisheries driven by ocean acidification and climate change. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are expected to see declines in resource accessibility but are relatively socially insulated from these changes. Conversely, Prince Edward Island, along with Newfoundland and Labrador are more socially vulnerable to potential losses in fisheries, but are expected to experience relatively minor net changes in access."
https://openalex.org/W2999037327,"A platform capable of specifically delivering an antiviral drug to the liver infected with hepatitis B is a major concern in hepatology. Vaccination has had a major effect on decreasing the emerging numbers of new cases of infection. However, the total elimination of the hepatitis B virus from the body requires prolonged therapy. In this work, we aimed to target the liver macrophages with lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPH), combining the merit of polymeric nanoparticles and lipid vesicles. The hydrophilic antiviral drug, entecavir (E), loaded LPH nanoparticles were optimized and physicochemically characterized. A modulated lipidic corona, as well as, an additional coat with vitamin E were used to extend the drug release enhance the macrophage uptake. The selected vitamin E coated LPH nanoparticles enriched with lecithin-glyceryl monostearate lipid shell exhibited high entrapment for E (80.47%), a size ≤ 200 nm for liver passive targeting, extended release over one week, proven serum stability, retained stability after refrigeration storage for 6 months. Upon macrophage uptake in vitro assessment, the presented formulation displayed promising traits, enhancing the cellular retention in J774 macrophages cells. In vivo and antiviral activity futuristic studies would help in the potential application of the ELPH in hepatitis B control."

Ten samples (k = 10) from each worker were obtained for the cold season (November-March) from various locations across Almaty. Total sampling time was 57600 minutes. We compared normalized time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations for 8-hour shifts within and between workers using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and assessed compliance with environmental exposure limit (EEL) (0.060 mg/m3) via exceedance (γ) and probability of overexposure (θ).PM10 TWA ranged from 0.050 to 2.075 mg/m3 with the geometric mean 0.366 and median 0.352 mg/m3. PM10 TWA distribution was left-skewed with large variation. The fold-range of within-person variability, containing 95% of the exposure concentration (wR0.95) was 13, whereas between-person fold-range (bR0.95) was 3. However, between-person variance exceeded the one within with F-ratio 2.797 (p = 0.003) with statistical power 97% at α = 0.05. Only two of 120 samples had TWA below EEL, yielding γ = 0.995 and θ = 1.Outdoor workers in polluted cities like Almaty are exposed to very high levels of PM10 during the cold season. Urgent action should be taken to regulate such occupational exposure and to raise awareness of workers and employers on hazards associated with it."
https://openalex.org/W3000660042,"High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a well-established treatment for medial compartmental knee osteoarthritis. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in osteoarthritis progression and are useful as osteoarthritis-related biomarkers. In this prospective study, we investigated differentially expressed microRNAs in the synovial fluid (SF) before and after HTO in patients with medial compartmental knee osteoarthritis to identify microRNAs that can be used as prognostic biomarkers. We used miRNA-PCR arrays to screen for miRNAs in SF samples obtained preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively from 6 patients with medial compartmental knee osteoarthritis who were treated with medial open wedge HTO. Differentially expressed miRNAs identified in the profiling stage were validated by real-time quantitative PCR in 22 other patients who had also been treated with HTO. All patients radiographically corresponded to Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III with medial compartmental osteoarthritis. These patients were clinically assessed using a visual analogue scale and Western Ontario McMaster Universities scores. Mechanical axis changes were measured on standing anteroposterior radiographs of the lower limbs assessed preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. Among 84 miRNAs known to be involved in the inflammatory process, 14 were expressed in all SF specimens and 3 (miR-30a-5p, miR-29a-3p, and miR-30c-5p) were differentially expressed in the profiling stage. These 3 miRNAs, as well as 4 other miRNAs (miR-378a-5p, miR-140-3p, miR-23a-3p, miR-27b-3p), are related to osteoarthritis progression. These results were validated in the SF from 22 patients. Clinical and radiological outcomes improved after HTO in all patients, and only 2 miRNAs (miR-30c-5p and miR-23a-3p) were significantly differentially expressed between preoperative and postoperative 6-month SF samples (p = 0.006 and 0.007, respectively). Of these two miRNAs, miR-30c-5p correlated with postoperative pain relief. This study provides potential prognostic miRNAs after HTO and further investigations should be considered to determine clinical implications of these miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3000319625,"Disclosure of patient safety incidents is a healthcare management strategy that primarily involves responding after incidents. We investigated the association between nursing students' moral sensitivity, attitudes about patient safety, and perceptions of open disclosure of patient safety incidents in Korea. Data were collected from 407 nursing students at four nursing universities using self-reported moral sensitivity, attitudes about patient safety, and perceptions about open disclosure of patient safety incidents as measures. The data were analyzed using t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and a multiple regression. As moral sensitivity and attitudes about patient safety improved, nursing students' perceptions regarding the open disclosure of patient safety incidents improved significantly. After controlling for gender, grade, and major satisfaction, the effect of changing attitudes about patient safety was greater than that of moral sensitivity for all perceptions of open disclosure. An education and intervention program is needed to improve nursing students' attitudes about patient safety and promote the open disclosure of patient safety incidents during undergraduate training."
https://openalex.org/W2999494468,"In human-transformed landscapes, predators may feed on domesticated animals, and thus affect human well-being, creating negative perceptions and leading to conflict with people that can result in the persecution of the predator. We studied the factors that influence the perception of the Black-and-chestnut Eagle (Spizaetus isidori) in four rural Andean communities in Colombia and compiled historical and recent evidence on the persecution and other causes of mortality of this species in the country. We applied 267 questionnaires and conducted 16 interviews with local inhabitants, via visits to homes and schools in the surroundings of S. isidori nests. The perception of S. isidori by the inhabitants was largely negative and influenced by different socio-demographic factors such as gender, chicken (Gallus gallus) ownership, and chicken management. The records we obtained indicate that 47 eagles were shot, 16 were captured (three for illegal trafficking) and two were electrocuted on high-tension wires. The persecution of S. isidori occurs as retaliation or as a preventative measure against chicken predation, and is a significant cause of mortality of this species in Colombia. Effective conservation planning for S. isidori in Colombia needs to go further than the protected areas system, and include a socioecological perspective in conservation practices applied at landscapes scales that are dominated by people. Education programs and socioecological research, along with participatory work in local communities are key to the conservation of S. isidori in breeding territories. This approach can also prevent conflict over food resources-G. gallus and other poultry-that are shared by humans and S. isidori in rural landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2999813320,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an ageing-related neurodegenerative disease characterized and diagnosed by deposition of insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain. The plaque accumulation in the brain directly affects reduced levels of Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, as Aβ can freely transport the blood-brain barrier, and clinical investigations have suggested these two biofluids as promising samples for in vitro diagnosis. Given that the human eye structurally resembles the brain and Aβ accumulation often observed in the ocular region of AD patients, in this study, we examined aqueous humor Aβ as another possible surrogate biomarker. First, using the acute Aβ-infused AD mouse model by injecting Aβ to the CSF in intracerebroventricular region of normal ICR mice, we investigated whether Aβ concentration in the aqueous humor in AD models is positively correlated with the concentration in the CSF. Then, we examined the correlation of aqueous humor Aβ levels with increased plaque deposition in the brain and reduced Aβ levels in both CSF and blood in adult and aged 5XFAD Alzheimer transgenic mice. Collectively, the synthetic Aβ injected into CSF immediately migrate to the aqueous humor, however, the age-dependently reducing pattern of Aβ levels in CSF and blood was not observed in the aqueous humor."
https://openalex.org/W2998879714,"Background Illness perceptions may vary between different populations. This raises the question as to whether refugees and migrants of the same ethnic background have different perceptions. Understanding differences may have a significant impact on enhancing medication adherence in these groups. Objective The study examined the associations and differences between illness perceptions, and medication adherence in hypertensive Middle Eastern migrants and refugees. Methods Middle Eastern refugees and migrants (≥30 years old), with hypertension were recruited from Arabic community groups in Australia and asked to complete a cross-sectional survey. The survey consisted of basic socio-demographic and clinical profile, self-reported illness perceptions, and self-reported medication adherence. The outcome measure was the Medication Adherence Questionnaire. Simple mediation modelling was applied to examine the role of illness perceptions as a mediator between different migration statuses, and medication adherence. Results A total of 320 participants were recruited; 168 refugees, and 152 migrants. Educational level was found to be positively significantly associated with medication adherence in refugees, p = 0.003, while employed migrants were more likely to report higher adherence to hypertensive medication, p = 0.005. In both groups, there was a significant association between illness perceptions and medication adherence p = 0.0001. Significant differences were found between both groups regarding adherence and illness perceptions variables. Refugees had more negative illness perceptions and were less adherent than migrants. Illness perception was a mediator in the relationship between migration status and medication adherence; the unstandardized indirect effect was 0.24, and the 95% confidence interval ranged from (0.21–0.36). Conclusions To achieve better adherence to medications in vulnerable populations such as refugees, illness perceptions need to be understood, and differentiated from other populations, such as migrants from similar backgrounds. Patients’ education about illnesses and medications should be specific and targeted to each population. Interventional studies are recommended to modify refugees’ and migrants’ illness perceptions, to enhance medication adherence and wellbeing."

A few prebiotics act as food supplements to increase fermentation by beneficial bacteria, which enhance the host immune system and health. Allium hookeri is a healthy food with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. A. hookeri is used as a feed supplement for broiler chickens to improve growth performance. Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, A. hookeri may alter the gut microbiome. In the current study, 16S rRNA sequencing has been carried out using samples obtained from the cecum of broiler chickens exposed to diets comprising different tissue types (leaf and root) and varying amounts (0.3% and 0.5%) of A. hookeri to investigate their impact on gut microbiome. The microbiome composition in the groups supplemented with A. hookeri leaf varied from that of the control group. Especially, exposure to 0.5% amounts of leaf resulted in differences in the abundance of genera compared with diets comprising 0.3% leaf. Exposure to a diet containing 0.5% A. hookeri leaf decreased the abundance of the following bacteria: Eubacterium nodatum, Marvinbryantia, Oscillospira, and Gelria. The modulation of gut microbiome by leaf supplement correlated with growth traits including body weight, bone strength, and infectious bursal disease antibody. The results demonstrate that A. hookeri may improve the health benefits of broiler chickens by altering the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2999843613,"Background Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) is an emergency condition that requires acute intervention and can lead to permanent neurological deficit in working age adults. A Core Outcome Set (COS) is the minimum set of outcomes that should be reported by a research study within a specific disease area. There is significant heterogeneity in outcome reporting for CES, which does not allow data synthesis between studies. The hypothesis is that a COS for CES can be developed for future research studies using patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) as key stakeholders. Methods and findings Qualitative semi-structured interviews with CES patients were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo to identify the outcomes of importance. These were combined with the outcomes obtained from a published systematic literature review of CES patients. The outcomes were grouped into a list of 37, for rating through two rounds of an international Delphi survey according to pre-set criteria. The Delphi survey had an overall response rate of 63% and included 172 participants (104 patients, 68 HCPs) from 14 countries who completed both rounds. Thirteen outcomes reached consensus at the end of the Delphi survey and there was no attrition bias detected. The results were discussed at an international consensus meeting attended by 34 key stakeholders (16 patients and 18 HCPs) from 8 countries. A further three outcomes were agreed to be included. There was no selection bias detected at the consensus meeting. There are 16 outcomes in total in the CESCOS. Discussion This is the first study in the literature that has determined the core outcomes in CES using a transparent international consensus process involving healthcare professionals and CES patients as key stakeholders. This COS is recommended as the most important outcomes to be reported in any research study investigating CES outcomes and will allow evidence synthesis in CES."
https://openalex.org/W2996808565,"In this work, we propose a framework to store and manage spatial data, which includes new efficient algorithms to perform operations accepting as input a raster dataset and a vector dataset. More concretely, we present algorithms for solving a spatial join between a raster and a vector dataset imposing a restriction on the values of the cells of the raster; and an algorithm for retrieving K objects of a vector dataset that overlap cells of a raster dataset, such that the K objects are those overlapping the highest (or lowest) cell values among all objects. The raster data is stored using a compact data structure, which can directly manipulate compressed data without the need for prior decompression. This leads to better running times and lower memory consumption. In our experimental evaluation comparing our solution to other baselines, we obtain the best space/time trade-offs."

https://openalex.org/W2998906727,"Chitin degradation is important for biomass conversion and has potential applications for agriculture, biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical industry. Chitinase A from the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens (SmChiA) is a processive enzyme that hydrolyzes crystalline chitin as it moves linearly along the substrate surface. In a previous study, the catalytic activity of SmChiA against crystalline chitin was found to increase after the tryptophan substitution of two phenylalanine residues (F232W and F396W), located at the entrance and exit of the substrate binding cleft of the catalytic domain, respectively. However, the mechanism underlying this high catalytic activity remains elusive. In this study, single-molecule fluorescence imaging and high-speed atomic force microscopy were applied to understand the mechanism of this high-catalytic-activity mutant. A reaction scheme including processive catalysis was used to reproduce the properties of SmChiA WT and F232W/F396W, in which all of the kinetic parameters were experimentally determined. High activity of F232W/F396W mutant was caused by a high processivity and a low dissociation rate constant after productive binding. The turnover numbers for both WT and F232W/F396W, determined by the biochemical analysis, were well-replicated using the kinetic parameters obtained from single-molecule imaging analysis, indicating the validity of the reaction scheme. Furthermore, alignment of amino acid sequences of 258 SmChiA-like proteins revealed that tryptophan, not phenylalanine, is the predominant amino acid at the corresponding positions (Phe-232 and Phe-396 for SmChiA). Our study will be helpful for understanding the kinetic mechanisms and further improvement of crystalline chitin hydrolytic activity of SmChiA mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2999525596,"Body image concerns are common among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Research into how young people living with HIV (YPLHIV) experience and make sense of feared or actual body changes is limited, yet these changes have emotional, psychological and interpersonal implications for young people who associate physical attractiveness with social desirability. The current study examined the subjective perceptions of body appearance and coping mechanisms among a sample of YPLHIV in Durban, South Africa. An interpretive qualitative inquiry was adopted to understand their lived experiences in relation to their body image and body satisfaction. In-depth interviews were conducted with 18 YPLHIV (15-24 years). Findings indicate physical and psychosocial effects of living with HIV among young people including weight loss, skin sores, body dissatisfaction, loss of self-esteem and social withdrawal. The study builds on previous research suggesting that PLHIV may experience a discrepancy between their actual self and ideal self. Enhancing existing coping mechanisms such as religious beliefs, support networks and physical exercises among YPLHIV can counter the physical and psychosocial effects of living with HIV and improve well-being. Body image concerns should be acknowledged when addressing HIV-related health in both health and family settings."
https://openalex.org/W2999745513,"Clan CA cysteine proteases, also known as papain-like proteases, play important roles throughout the malaria parasite life cycle and are therefore potential drug targets to treat this disease and prevent its transmission. In order to study the biological function of these proteases and to chemically validate some of them as viable drug targets, highly specific inhibitors need to be developed. This is especially challenging given the large number of clan CA proteases present in Plasmodium species (ten in Plasmodium falciparum), and the difficulty of designing selective inhibitors that do not cross-react with other members of the same family. Additionally, any efforts to develop antimalarial drugs targeting these proteases will also have to take into account potential off-target effects against the 11 human cysteine cathepsins. Activity-based protein profiling has been a very useful tool to determine the specificity of inhibitors against all members of an enzyme family. However, current clan CA proteases broad-spectrum activity-based probes either target endopeptidases or dipeptidyl aminopeptidases, but not both subfamilies efficiently. In this study, we present a new series of dipeptydic vinyl sulfone probes containing a free N-terminal tryptophan and a fluorophore at the P1 position that are able to label both subfamilies efficiently, both in Plasmodium falciparum and in mammalian cells, thus making them better broad-spectrum activity-based probes. We also show that some of these probes are cell permeable and can therefore be used to determine the specificity of inhibitors in living cells. Interestingly, we show that the choice of fluorophore greatly influences the specificity of the probes as well as their cell permeability."

Some studies have shown that childcare attendance moderates associations between MDS and child behavior problems, but we do not know if this is the case for children's cognitive development. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated whether associations between MDS and child cognitive development differ for boys and girls at school entry.This study used data from a population-based cohort study (n = 1364) comprising well-validated measures of children's cognitive development including academic readiness and language development in kindergarten and reading and mathematics achievement in first grade. Information on MDS was collected repeatedly from the child's age of 5 months to 5 years and on childcare from 5 months to 4.5 years. Moderation analyses were conducted to evaluate the differential associations of MDS with children's outcomes depending on the type of childcare attended and the child's sex.Childcare type or child's sex did not moderate associations between MDS and children's cognitive outcomes except for MDS being associated with lower scores on reading achievement in first grade for girls with a very small effect size (sr2 = .003). Childcare attendance was associated with higher scores for children's cognitive development, however these associations disappeared after adjusting for covariates including child, mother and family characteristics. Regardless of MDS and childcare type, boys had, even after adjusting for covariates, lower scores on academic readiness (sr2 = .029) and higher scores on mathematics achievement (sr2 = .004).Children's cognitive development at school entry was more strongly associated with maternal education, children's age in kindergarten and number of months of schooling in first grade than MDS. Contrary to associations between MDS and child behavior problems, childcare attendance did not moderate associations between MDS and children's cognitive development at school entry."
https://openalex.org/W3000015787,"Introduction Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in post-transplant setting has heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Methods We retrospectively studied data of 89 patients with post-transplant TMA, which was characterized by thrombi in at least one glomerulus and/or arteriole. Systemic TMA was defined by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic anemia and early onset TMA, when occurred less than 90 days post transplant. Results The cumulative incidence was 0.93%. The majority of the recipients were young (mean age 39 years), female (52%) and Caucasian (48%) with primary kidney disease of unknown etiology (37%). Early TMA occurred in 51% of the patients and systemic TMA, in 25%. Underlying precipitating factors were: infection (54%), acute rejection (34%), calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (13%) and pregnancy (3%). 18% of the patients had several triggers. Glomerular TMA was observed in 50% of the biopsies and endothelial cell activation, in 61%. The 1-year patient survival was 97% and corresponding graft survival, 66%. Allograft survival was inferior when acute antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) occurred (with 41%; without 70%, p = 0.01), however no differences were determined by hemolysis, time of onset, thrombi location or endothelial cell activation. Conclusions Our results suggest that post-transplant TMA is a rare but severe condition, regardless of its clinical and histological presentation, mainly when associated to ABMR."

Through a two-phase feasibility study among Indian students living in the Delhi area, we longitudinally examined the following: (1) the daily eating-fasting cycles of students (N = 34) in school and college using smartphones as they transition from high school (aged 13-15 years; nIX = 13) to higher secondary school (HSSS; 16-18 years; nXII = 9) to their first year (FY) of college (18-19 years; nFC = 12); and (2) daily activity-rest cycles and light-dark exposure of 31 higher secondary school students (HSSS) using actigraphy. In phase 1, students' food data were analyzed for temporal details of eating events and observable differences in diet composition, such as an energy-dense diet (fast food (FF)), as confounding factors of circadian health. Overall, the mean eating duration in high school, higher secondary and FY college students ranged from 14.1 to 16.2h. HSSS exhibited the shortest night fasting. Although FY college students exhibited the highest fast food percentage (FF%), a positive correlation between body mass index (BMI) and FF% was observed only among HSSS. Furthermore, the body weight of HSSS was significantly higher, indicating that FF, untimely eating and reduced night fasting were important obesity-associated factors in adolescents. Reduced night fasting duration was also related to shorter sleep in HSSS. Therefore, food data were supplemented with wrist actigraphy, i.e., activity-rest data, in HSSS. Actigraphy externally validated the increased obesogenic consequences of deregulated eating rhythms in HSSS. CamNtech motion watches were used to assess the relationship between disturbed activity cycles of HSSS and other circadian clock-related rhythms, such as sleep. Less than 50% of Indian HSSS slept 6 hours or more per night. Seven of 31 students remained awake throughout the night, during which they had more than 20% of their daily light exposure. Three nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis (NPCRA) variables revealed circadian disruption of activity in HSSS. The present study suggests that inappropriate timing and quality of food and sleep disturbances are important determinants of circadian disruptions in adolescents attending school."
https://openalex.org/W3000411318,"Diffusing fluid at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent creates rapid, acute physico-chemical gradients that correlate strongly with the distribution of the vent fauna. Two alvinocaridid shrimps, Alvinocaris longirostris and Shinkaicaris leurokolos occupy distinct microhabitats around these vents and exhibit different thermal preferences. S. leurokolos inhabits the central area closer to the active chimney, while A. longirostris inhabits the peripheral area. In this study, we screened candidate genes that might be involved in niche separation and microhabitat adaptation through comparative transcriptomics. The results showed that among the top 20% of overexpressed genes, gene families related to protein synthesis and structural components were much more abundant in S. leurokolos compared to A. longirostris. Moreover, 15 out of 25 genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism were related to trehalose biosynthesis, versus 1 out of 5 in A. longirostris. Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide, is a multifunctional molecule and has been proven to act as a protectant responsible for thermotolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Putative positively selected genes involved in chitin metabolism and the immune system (lectin, serine protease and antimicrobial peptide) were enriched in S. leurokolos. In particular, one collagen and two serine proteases were found to have experienced strong positive selection. In addition, sulfotransferase-related genes were both overexpressed and positively selected in S. leurokolos. Finally, genes related to structural proteins, immune proteins and protectants were overexpressed or positively selected. These characteristics could represent adaptations of S. leurokolos to its microhabitat, which need to be confirmed by more evidence, such as data from large samples and different development stages of these alvinocaridid shrimps."

Computational models are however naive to cellular response in the myriads of assay-conditions. In a realistic paradigm of assay context-aware predictive hybrid models that combine minimal experimental data from deep mutational scans with structure, sequence information and computational models, we define and evaluate different strategies for choosing this minimal set. We evaluated the trivial strategy of a systematic reduction in the number of mutational studies from 85% to 15%, along with several others about the choice of the types of mutations such as random versus site-directed with the same 15% data completeness. Interestingly, the predictive capabilities by training on a random set of mutations and using a systematic substitution of all amino acids to alanine, asparagine and histidine (ANH) were comparable. Another strategy we explored, augmenting the training data with measurements of the same mutants at multiple assay conditions, did not improve the prediction quality. For the six proteins we analyzed, the bin-wise error in prediction is optimal when 50-100 mutations per bin are used in training the computational model, suggesting that good prediction quality may be achieved with a library of 500-1000 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3000182940,"Chronic cancer-related fatigue (CF) is a common and distressing condition in a subset of cancer survivors and common also after successful treatment of malignant lymphoma. The etiology and pathogenesis of CF is unknown, and lack of biomarkers hampers development of diagnostic tests and successful therapy. Recent studies on the changes of amino acid levels and other metabolites in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have pointed to possible central defects in energy metabolism. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of serum concentrations of amino acids, including metabolites of tryptophan, the kynurenine pathway and vitamin B6 in a well characterized national Norwegian cohort of lymphoma survivors after high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Among the 20 standard amino acids in humans, only tryptophan levels were significantly lower in both males and females with CF compared to non-fatigued survivors, a strikingly different pattern than seen in CFS/ME. Markers of tryptophan degradation by the kynurenine pathway (kynurenine/tryptophan ratio) and activation of vitamin B6 catabolism (pyridoxic acid/(pyridoxal + pyridoxal 5'-phosphate), PAr index) differed in survivors with or without CF and correlated with known markers of immune activation and inflammation, such as neopterin, C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6. Among personal traits and clinical findings assessed simultaneously in participating survivors, higher neuroticism score, obesity and higher PAr index were significantly associated with increased risk of CF. Collectively, these data point to low grade immune activation and inflammation as a basis for CF in lymphoma survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3000449228,"Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) is a promising treatment modality for lymphedema; however, how lymphatic tissue responds to ischemia has not been well defined. This study investigates the cellular changes that occur in lymph nodes in response to ischemia and reperfusion. Lymph node containing superficial epigastric artery-based groin flaps were isolated in Prox-1 EGFP rats which permits real time identification of lymphatic tissue by green fluorescence during flap dissection. Flaps were subjected to ischemia for either 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours, by temporarily occluding the vascular pedicle. Flaps were harvested after 0 hours, 24 hours, or 5 days of reperfusion. Using EGFP signal guidance, lymph nodes were isolated from the flaps and tissue morphology, cell apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokines were quantified and analyzed via histology, immunostaining, and rtPCR. There was a significant increase in collagen deposition and tissue fibrosis in lymph nodes after 4 and 8 hours of ischemia compared to 1 and 2 hours, as assessed by picrosirius red staining. Cell apoptosis significantly increased after 4 hours of ischemia in all harvest times. In tissue subject to 4 hours of ischemia, longer reperfusion periods were associated with increased rates of CD3+ and CD45+ cell apoptosis. rtPCR analysis demonstrated significantly increased expression of CXCL1/GRO-α with 2 hours of ischemia and increased PECAM-1 and TNF-α expression with 1 hour of ischemia. Significant cell death and changes in tissue morphology do not occur until after 4 hours of ischemia; however, analysis of inflammatory biomarkers suggests that ischemia reperfusion injury can occur with as little as 2 hours of ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W3000116468,"Pseudozyma antarctica is a nonpathogenic phyllosphere yeast known as an excellent producer of industrial lipases and mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), which are multi-functional glycolipids. The fungus produces a much higher amount of MELs from vegetable oil than from glucose, whereas its close relative, Ustilago maydis UM521, produces a lower amount of MELs from vegetable oil. In the present study, we used previous gene expression profiles measured by DNA microarray analyses after culturing on two carbon sources, glucose and soybean oil, to further characterize MEL biosynthesis in P. antarctica T-34. A total of 264 genes were found with induction ratios and expression intensities under oily conditions with similar tendencies to those of MEL cluster genes. Of these, 93 were categorized as metabolic genes using the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups classification. Within this metabolic category, amino acids, carbohydrates, inorganic ions, and secondary metabolite metabolism, as well as energy production and conversion, but not lipid metabolism, were enriched. Furthermore, genes involved in central metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, were highly induced in P. antarctica T-34 under oily conditions, whereas they were suppressed in U. maydis UM521. These results suggest that the central metabolism of P. antarctica T-34 under oily conditions contributes to its excellent oil utilization and extracellular glycolipid production."

There are few real-world instances of the use of SOF-based regimens to treat genotype 2 CHC. This study determines the effectiveness and safety of SOF/Ribavirn (RBV), SOF/Daclatasvir (DCV) and SOF/DCV/RBV in the treatment of genotype 2 CHC patients in Taiwan.Patients with genotype 2 CHC were treated for 12 weeks with SOF/RBV, SOF/DCV or SOF/DCV/RBV under the National Health Insurance reimbursement program in three hospitals in Taiwan. The sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was determined. Adverse events were recorded for a safety analysis.A total of 467 genotype 2 CHC patients were enrolled from January to October 2018. One hundred and eleven patients (24%) had cirrhosis, including 10 patients (2.1%) with hepatic decompensation. Fifty-five patients (12%) had already experienced interferon-alpha/RBV treatment. Forty-two patients (9%) had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the baseline. Three hundred and fifty-five patients received SOF/RBV, forty-seven patients received SOF/DCV and sixty-two patients received SOF/DCV/RBV. The SOF/DCV group featured a greater HCV viral load than the SOF/RBV or SOF/DCV/RBV groups. SVR12 was achieved in 94.6% of the SOF/RBV group, 95.7% of the SOF/DCV group and 96.8% of then SOF/DCV/RBV group (P = NS). Thirteen out of 352 patients (3.7%) in the SOF/RBV group, 1 out of 62 patients (1.6%) in the SOF/DCV/RBV group and 1 out of 47 patients (2.1%) in the SOF/DCV group developed virological failure. There are no differences in virological failure between the three groups (P = NS). Multi-variate analysis shows that history of HCC is an independent factor that is associated with the failure of treatment in the SOF/RBV group (odds ratio:4.905, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.321-18.205, P = 0.017). Hemoglobin levels at 12 weeks are significantly lower in the SOF/RBV and the SOF/RBV/DCV group than in the SOF/DCV group (P<0.05). Serious adverse events (SAE) occurred in six patients (1.6%) in the SOF/RBV group and in one patient (1.6%) in the SOF/RBV/DCV group. No patients in the SOF/DCV group experienced SAE.SOF/RBV, SOF/DCV or SOF/DCV/RBV for 12 weeks all achieve very high SVR rates and are equally effective in the treatment of genotype 2 CHC patients in the real world in Taiwan. Patients in the SOF/RBV group who have a history of HCC exhibit a lower SVR rate."
https://openalex.org/W3000737963,"Canine Chronic Ulcerative Stomatitis is a spontaneously occurring inflammatory disease of the oral mucosa. An immune-mediated pathogenesis is suspected though not yet proven. We have recently reported on the clinical and histologic features, and identification of select leukocyte cell populations within the lesion. A clinical and histologic similarity to oral lichen planus of people was proposed. In the present study, these initial observations are extended by examining lesions from 24 dogs with clinical evidence of chronic ulcerative stomatitis. Because dogs with chronic ulcerative stomatitis often have concurrent periodontal disease, we wondered if dental plaque/biofilm may be a common instigator of inflammation in both lesions. We hypothesized that dogs with chronic ulcerative stomatitis would exhibit a spectrum of pathologic changes and phenotype of infiltrating leukocytes that would inform lesion pathogenesis and that these changes would differ from inflammatory phenotypes in periodontitis. Previously we identified chronic ulcerative stomatitis lesions to be rich in FoxP3+ and IL17+ cells. As such, we suspect that these leukocytes play an important role in lesion pathogenesis. The current study confirms the presence of moderate to large numbers of FoxP3+ T cells and IL17+ cells in all ulcerative stomatitis lesions using confocal immunofluorescence. Interestingly, the majority of IL17+ cells were determined to be non-T cells and IL17+ cell frequencies were negatively correlated with severity on the clinical scoring system. Three histologic subtypes of ulcerative stomatitis were determined; lichenoid, deep stomatitis and granulomatous. Periodontitis lesions, like stomatitis lesions, were B cell and plasma cell rich, but otherwise differed from the stomatitis lesions. Direct immunofluorescence results did not support an autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disease process. This investigation contributes to the body of literature regarding leukocyte involvement in canine idiopathic inflammatory disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3000343591,"Background Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) occurs more frequently in older patients with an increased occurrence of recurrent cardiac events following the index presentation. Telomeres are structures consisting of repeated DNA sequences as associated shelterin proteins at the ends of chromosomes. We aim to determine whether telomere length (TL) and telomerase activity (TA) predicted poor outcomes in older patients presenting with NSTEACS undergoing invasive care. Method Older patients undergoing invasive management for NSTEACS were recruited to the ICON-1 biomarker study (NCT01933581). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were recovered on 153 patients. DNA was isolated and mean TL was measured by quantitative PCR expressed as relative T (telomere repeat copy number) to S (single copy gene number) ratio (T/S ratio), and a telomere repeat amplification assay was used to assess TA during index presentation with NSTEACS. Primary clinical outcomes consisted of death, myocardial infarction (MI), unplanned revascularisation, stroke and significant bleeding recorded at 1 year. TL and TA were divided into tertile groups for analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed. Ordinal regression was performed to evaluate the relationship between TL and TA and traditional cardiovascular risk factors at baseline. Results 298 patients were recruited in the ICON-1 study of which 153 had PBMC recovered. The mean age was 81.0 ± 4.0 years (64% male). Mean telomere length T/S ratio was 0.47 ± 0.25 and mean TA was 1.52 ± 0.61 units. The primary composite outcome occurred in 44 (28.8%) patients. There was no association between short TL or low TA and incidence of the primary composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.50, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.68–3.34, p = 0.32 and HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.52–3.36, p = 0.51 respectively).

https://openalex.org/W3000352579,"Introduction Posttraumatic pneumothorax (PTX) is often overseen in anteroposterior chest X-ray. Chest sonography and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) can both be used at the bedside and may provide complementary information. We evaluated the performance of EIT for diagnosing posttraumatic PTX in a pig model. Methods This study used images from an existing database of images acquired from 17 mechanically ventilated pigs, which had sustained standardized blunt chest trauma and had undergone repeated thoracic CT and EIT. 100 corresponding EIT/CT datasets were randomly chosen from the database and anonymized. Two independent and blinded observers analyzed the EIT data for presence and location of PTX. Analysis of the corresponding CTs by a radiologist served as reference. Results 87/100 cases had at least one PTX detected by CT. Fourty-two cases showed a PTX > 20% of the sternovertebral diameter (PTXtrans20), whereas 52/100 PTX showed a PTX>3 cm in the craniocaudal diameter (PTXcc3), with 20 cases showing both a PTXtranscc and a PTXcc3. We found a very low agreement between both EIT observers considering the classification overall PTX/noPTX (κ = 0.09, p = 0.183). For PTXtrans20, sensitivity was 59% for observer 1 and 17% for observer 2, with a specificity of 48% and 50%, respectively. For PTXcc3, observer 1 showed a sensitivity of 60% with a specificity of 51% while the sensitivity of observer 2 was 17%, with a specificity of 89%. By programming a semi-automatized detection algorithm, we significantly improved the detection rate of PTXcc3, with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 70%. However, detection of PTXtranscc was not improved. Conclusion In our analysis, visual interpretation of EIT without specific image processing or comparison with baseline data did not allow clinically useful diagnosis of posttraumatic PTX. Multimodal imaging approaches, technical improvements and image postprocessing algorithms might improve the performance of EIT for diagnosing PTX in the future."

These failures occur in spite of established wheelchair test methods and regulations, suggesting that the existing tests may not be sufficient to screen poorly designed castors. An expert stakeholder group, convened by the International Society of Wheelchair Professionals (ISWP), noted castor failures as a high priority and recommended that a new castor testing system should be developed. In a previous study, the effect of shock exposure on castor durability was studied. The current paper extends the previous work and focuses on the development of a castor testing protocol based on shock, corrosion and abrasion exposure data collected in the community. The testing protocol was applied to 8 different castor models tested under four conditions: shock, corrosion + shock, abrasion + shock and abrasion + corrosion + shock. For each model, a total of n = 8 samples were evaluated across the four conditions. Results demonstrate that corrosion and abrasion reduced castor durability between 13% to 100% depending on the model. Importantly, the inclusion of corrosion and abrasion resulted in changes in the failure modes for 75% of the tested models and two-thirds of the altered failure modes are associated with increased risk of injury for wheelchair users. These results suggest that corrosion and abrasion present in the community reduce castor durability, thus supporting their inclusion in the castor testing protocol and potentially other wheelchair standards."
https://openalex.org/W2999924179,"How biodiversity is maintained in ecosystems is a central issue in ecology. According to the evolutionary theory, heritable variations between individuals are important for the generation of species diversity, linking both intra and interspecific variations. The present food web model shows that intraspecific variations via natural selection also play crucial roles in maintaining the stability of large communities with diverse species. In particular, our computations indicate that larger communities need more intraspecific variation to be maintained and are powerfully stabilized when multiple traits are variable. Consequently, these variations are likely to be maintained in larger communities. Hence, intra and interspecific diversities may support each other during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3000569795,"Several European countries have established criteria for prioritising initiation of treatment in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by grouping patients according to clinical characteristics. Based on neural network techniques, our objective was to identify those factors for HIV/HCV co-infected patients (to which clinicians have given careful consideration before treatment uptake) that have not being included among the prioritisation criteria. This study was based on the Spanish HERACLES cohort (NCT02511496) (April-September 2015, 2940 patients) and involved application of different neural network models with different basis functions (product-unit, sigmoid unit and radial basis function neural networks) for automatic classification of patients for treatment. An evolutionary algorithm was used to determine the architecture and estimate the coefficients of the model. This machine learning methodology found that radial basis neural networks provided a very simple model in terms of the number of patient characteristics to be considered by the classifier (in this case, six), returning a good overall classification accuracy of 0.767 and a minimum sensitivity (for the classification of the minority class, untreated patients) of 0.550. Finally, the area under the ROC curve was 0.802, which proved to be exceptional. The parsimony of the model makes it especially attractive, using just eight connections. The independent variable “recent PWID” is compulsory due to its importance. The simplicity of the model means that it is possible to analyse the relationship between patient characteristics and the probability of belonging to the treated group."
https://openalex.org/W2998737192,"Olfactory sense remains elusive regarding the primary reception mechanism. Some studies suggest that olfaction is a spectral sense, the olfactory event is triggered by electron transfer (ET) across the odorants at the active sites of odorant receptors (ORs). Herein we present a Donor-Bridge-Acceptor model, proposing that the ET process can be viewed as an electron hopping from the donor molecule to the odorant molecule (Bridge), then hopping off to the acceptor molecule, making the electronic state of the odorant molecule change along with vibrations (vibronic transition). The odorant specific parameter, Huang-Rhys factor can be derived from ab initio calculations, which make the simulation of ET spectra achievable. In this study, we revealed that the emission spectra (after Gaussian convolution) can be acted as odor characteristic spectra. Using the emission spectrum of ET, we were able to reasonably interpret the similar bitter-almond odors among hydrogen cyanide, benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene. In terms of isotope effects, we succeeded in explaining why subjects can easily distinguish cyclopentadecanone from its fully deuterated analogue cyclopentadecanone-d28 but not distinguishing acetophenone from acetophenone-d8."
https://openalex.org/W2999533197,"Success of invasive non-native plant species management is usually measured as changes in the abundance of the invasive plant species or native plant species following invader management, but more complex trophic responses to invader removal are often ignored or assumed. Moreover, the effects of invader removal at different stages of the invasion process is rarely evaluated, despite a growing recognition that invader impacts are density or stage-dependent. Therefore, the effectiveness of invasive species management for restoring community structure and function across trophic levels remains poorly understood. We determined how soil nematode diversity and community composition respond to removal of the globally invasive tree species Pinus contorta at different stages of invasion by reanalysing and expanding an earlier study including uninvaded vegetation (seedlings removed continuously), early invader removal (saplings removed), late removal (trees removed), and no removal (invaded). These treatments allowed us to evaluate the stage-dependent belowground trophic responses to biological invasion and removal. We found that invaded plots had half the nematode taxa richness compared to uninvaded plots, and that tree invasion altered the overall composition of the nematode community. Differences in nematode community composition between uninvaded nematode communities and those under the tree removal strategy tended to dilute higher up the food chain, whereas the composition of uninvaded vs. sapling removal strategies did not differ significantly. Conversely, the composition of invaded compared to uninvaded nematode communities differed across all trophic levels, altering the community structure and function. Specifically, invaded communities were structurally simplified compared to uninvaded communities, and had a higher proportion of short life cycle nematodes, characteristic of disturbed environments. We demonstrate that a shift in management strategies for a globally invasive tree species from removing trees to earlier removal of saplings is needed for maintaining the composition and structure of soil nematode communities to resemble uninvaded conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3000492423,"If viruses or other pathogens infect a single host, the outcome of infection may depend on the initial basic reproduction number R0, the expected number of host cells infected by a single infected cell. This article shows that sometimes, phylogenetic models can estimate the initial R0, using only sequences sampled from the pathogenic population during its exponential growth or shortly thereafter. When evaluated by simulations mimicking the bursting viral reproduction of HIV and simultaneous sampling of HIV gp120 sequences during early viremia, the estimated R0 displayed useful accuracies in achievable experimental designs. Estimates of R0 have several potential applications to investigators interested in the progress of infection in single hosts, including: (1) timing a pathogen's movement through different microenvironments; (2) timing the change points in a pathogen's mode of spread (e.g., timing the change from cell-free spread to cell-to-cell spread, or vice versa, in an HIV infection); (3) quantifying the impact different initial microenvironments have on pathogens (e.g., in mucosal challenge with HIV, quantifying the impact that the presence or absence of mucosal infection has on R0); (4) quantifying subtle changes in infectability in therapeutic trials (either human or animal), even when therapies do not produce total sterilizing immunity; and (5) providing a variable predictive of the clinical efficacy of prophylactic therapies."
