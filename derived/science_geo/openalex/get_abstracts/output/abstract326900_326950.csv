https://openalex.org/W2023546252,"Simultaneous in situ measurements of the concentrations of OH, HO(2), ClO, BrO, NO, and NO(2) demonstrate the predominance of odd-hydrogen and halogen free-radical catalysis in determining the rate of removal of ozone in the lower stratosphere during May 1993. A single catalytic cycle, in which the rate-limiting step is the reaction of HO(2) with ozone, accounted for nearly one-half of the total O(3) removal in this region of the atmosphere. Halogen-radical chemistry was responsible for approximately one-third of the photochemical removal of O(3); reactions involving BrO account for one-half of this loss. Catalytic destruction by NO(2), which for two decades was considered to be the predominant loss process, accounted for less than 20 percent of the O(3) removal. The measurements demonstrate quantitatively the coupling that exists between the radical families. The concentrations of HO(2) and ClO are inversely correlated with those of NO and NO(2). The direct determination of the relative importance of the catalytic loss processes, combined with a demonstration of the reactions linking the hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen radical concentrations, shows that in the air sampled the rate of O(3) removal was inversely correlated with total NOx, loading."

The environmental factors causing these assemblage shifts may be related to recent climatic warming. Regardless of the cause, the biota of these isolated and seemingly pristine ponds have changed dramatically in the recent past and any hopes of cataloging natural assemblages may already be fruitless."

At room temperature, the diamond crystals exhibit elastic behavior with increasing pressure. Significant ductile deformation is observed only at temperatures above 1000 degrees C at this pressure. The differential yield strength of diamond decreases with temperature from 16 gigapascals at 1100 degrees C to 4 gigapascals at 1550 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy observations on the recovered sample indicate that the dominant deformation mechanism under high pressure and temperature is crystal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W4212804818,"The most costly American earthquake since 1906 struck Los Angeles on 17 January 1994. The magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake resulted from more than 3 meters of reverse slip on a 15-kilometer-long south-dipping thrust fault that raised the Santa Susana mountains by as much as 70 centimeters. The fault appears to be truncated by the fault that broke in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake at a depth of 8 kilometers. Of these two events, the Northridge earthquake caused many times more damage, primarily because its causative fault is directly under the city. Many types of structures were damaged, but the fracture of welds in steel-frame buildings was the greatest surprise. The Northridge earthquake emphasizes the hazard posed to Los Angeles by concealed thrust faults and the potential for strong ground shaking in moderate earthquakes."

https://openalex.org/W2087284544,"Solubilities of sphalerite (ZnS) and galena (PbS) were determined at 300 degrees to 500 degrees C and 1000 bars total pressure in a chemical environment buffered by silicate mineral equilibria. Chloride solutions and muscovite-bearing assemblages characteristic of hydrothermal wall-rock alteration were used; weak acidities at temperature were therefore involved. The metal concentrations encountered tended to be higher than those observed in high bisulfide-H(2)S systems at neutral to weakly basic pH used in most previous experimentation; the chemical conditions of the work, although not completely satisfactory, are geologically more realistic than previous experimentation done in the basic-pH region."

https://openalex.org/W1977498719,"Late Miocene (about 8.65 million years ago) mafic intrusions and lava flows along with remagnetized host rocks from Paiute Ridge, southern Nevada, provide a high-quality paleomagnetic record of a geomagnetic field reversal. These rocks yield thermoremanent magnetizations with declinations of 227 degrees to 310 degrees and inclinations of -7 degrees to 49 degrees , defining a reasonably continuous virtual geomagnetic pole path over west-central Pacific longitudes. Conductive cooling estimates for the intrusions suggest that this field transition, and mafic magmatism, lasted only a few hundred years. Because this record comes principally from intrusive rocks, rather than sediments or lavas, it is important in demonstrating the longitudinal confinement of the geomagnetic field during a reversal."

https://openalex.org/W2066873777,"The 2-desoxy-ribose nucleosides, first isolated by Levene and Londonâ€™ by the hydrolysis of thymus nucleic acid, are characterized by their extreme ease of hydrolysis by very dilute mineral acids. Thus, guanine-2-desoxy-riboside is completely hydrolyzed by heating with 0.01 N hydrochloric acid during 5 minutes. Since the rate of hydrolysis is of the same order as that of the furanosides, it was considered possible that the 2-desoxy-ribonucleosides, similarly to the ribonucleosides, have the furanoside ring structure. When, however, it was discovered2 that methyl-2-desoxyglucopyranoside is almost as readily hydrolyzed, it appeared just as feasible that the natural derivatives might have the pyranoside ring structure. Hence the question of their ring structure was in need of further special investigation. We have now studied the ring structure of the sugar portion of thymidine (thymine-2-desoxy-riboside). This substance is found to react with triphenylmethyl chloride in pyridine to give a monotrityl derivative. Since it was shown by us3 that the analogous monotrityl uridine is the 5-substituted derivative, the formation of a monotrityl thymidine might, of itself, be considered a good indication that thymidine is, likewise, a furanoside. Definite proof of this conclusion was provided by substituting the remaining free hydroxyl group by a tosyl group and examining the behavior of the resulting monotosyl trityl thymidine on treat-"

The seismic gap hypothesis, which predicts characteristic earthquakes in areas of the circum-Pacific belt that have not produced recent great earthquakes, has also failed to predict the observed clustering of high-energy events. Models in which fractal scaling is broken at high magnitude predict that characteristic events and recurrence behavior will be unstable in time. The central predictions of these models are supported by recent observations at Landers and Big Bear in California."
