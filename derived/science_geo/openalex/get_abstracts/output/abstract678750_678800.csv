https://openalex.org/W3188077199,"Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains a leading cause of cancer death with few therapeutic options. We characterized the proteogenomic landscape of LSCC, providing a deeper exposition of LSCC biology with potential therapeutic implications. We identify NSD3 as an alternative driver in FGFR1-amplified tumors and low-p63 tumors overexpressing the therapeutic target survivin. SOX2 is considered undruggable, but our analyses provide rationale for exploring chromatin modifiers such as LSD1 and EZH2 to target SOX2-overexpressing tumors. Our data support complex regulation of metabolic pathways by crosstalk between post-translational modifications including ubiquitylation. Numerous immune-related proteogenomic observations suggest directions for further investigation. Proteogenomic dissection of CDKN2A mutations argue for more nuanced assessment of RB1 protein expression and phosphorylation before declaring CDK4/6 inhibition unsuccessful. Finally, triangulation between LSCC, LUAD, and HNSCC identified both unique and common therapeutic vulnerabilities. These observations and proteogenomics data resources may guide research into the biology and treatment of LSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3191046015,"SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3) contains a macrodomain that is essential for coronavirus pathogenesis and is thus an attractive target for drug development. This macrodomain is thought to counteract the host interferon (IFN) response, an important antiviral signalling cascade, via the reversal of protein ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification catalyzed by host poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). However, the main cellular targets of the coronavirus macrodomain that mediate this effect are currently unknown. Here, we use a robust immunofluorescence-based assay to show that activation of the IFN response induces ADP-ribosylation of host proteins and that ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 macrodomain reverses this modification in human cells. We further demonstrate that this assay can be used to screen for on-target and cell-active macrodomain inhibitors. This IFN-induced ADP-ribosylation is dependent on PARP9 and its binding partner DTX3L, but surprisingly the expression of the Nsp3 macrodomain or the deletion of either PARP9 or DTX3L does not impair IFN signaling or the induction of IFN-responsive genes. Our results suggest that PARP9/DTX3L-dependent ADP-ribosylation is a downstream effector of the host IFN response and that the cellular function of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 macrodomain is to hydrolyze this end product of IFN signaling, rather than to suppress the IFN response itself."

TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) regulates IFN-I, NF-κB, and TNF-induced RIPK1-dependent cell death (RCD). In mice, biallelic loss of TBK1 is embryonically lethal. We discovered four humans, ages 32, 26, 7, and 8 from three unrelated consanguineous families with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TBK1. All four patients suffer from chronic and systemic autoinflammation, but not severe viral infections. We demonstrate that TBK1 loss results in hypomorphic but sufficient IFN-I induction via RIG-I/MDA5, while the system retains near intact IL-6 induction through NF-κB. Autoinflammation is driven by TNF-induced RCD as patient-derived fibroblasts experienced higher rates of necroptosis in vitro, and CC3 was elevated in peripheral blood ex vivo. Treatment with anti-TNF dampened the baseline circulating inflammatory profile and ameliorated the clinical condition in vivo. These findings highlight the plasticity of the IFN-I response and underscore a cardinal role for TBK1 in the regulation of RCD.

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) or inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are genetic disorders that heighten susceptibility to infection, autoinflammation, severe allergy, autoimmunity, and/or malignancy. Often monogenic, the causes of these clinically apparent immune dysfunctions have been linked to pathogenic variants in over 400 different genes (Gruber and Bogunovic, 2020Gruber C. Bogunovic D.

Occasionally, a monogenic IEI will manifest as a combination of weakened pathogen protection and chronic autoinflammation (Bogunovic et al., 2012Bogunovic D. Byun M. Durfee L.A. Abhyankar A. Sanal O.

This clinical scenario occurs when the gene in question functions in both promotion and suppression of inflammation. TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is one such factor. Classically considered an activator of innate immunity, TBK1 acts as a signaling intermediate upstream of type-I -interferon (IFN-I) and inflammatory cytokine production via the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) (Ahmad et al., 2016Ahmad L.

The loss of TBK1 would therefore be expected to produce an immunocompromised state, as was the case in one functional evaluation of two individuals with genetic defects in TBK1 where heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations conferred susceptibility to Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) (Herman et al., 2012Herman M.

Here we report and characterize four patients, two adult siblings and two children, from three unrelated consanguineous families with biallelic LoF mutations in TBK1 who suffer from an early-onset autoinflammatory syndrome not partnered with any overt signs of heightened sensitivity to viral infection. A sister (P1: age 32) and brother (P2: age 26) from a consanguineous family of Moroccan descent presented in early childhood with an unknown autoinflammatory syndrome in the absence of pathogenic autoantibodies (Figure S1A). Both developed polyarthritis in their first year, followed by cutaneous vasculitis, autoinflammatory features, and mild intellectual disability. P1 developed epileptic and pseudo-epileptic seizures in adolescence, while P2 experienced intermittent periods of motor disturbance starting at age 20 and then generalized seizures from the age of 24 (Tables S1 and S2; Data S1). A third patient from a consanguineous Indian family (P3: age 7) suffered from a similar unknown autoinflammatory syndrome to P1 and P2 that included early-onset arthritis, systemic vasculitis, and autoinflammatory features. He had one seizure with status epilepticus but has otherwise experienced normal physical and cognitive development up to the time of this report (Tables S1 and S2; Data S1). P4 (age 8), who was previously reported as part of a study that correlated autoinflammatory disease with genetic drivers in a cohort of unclassified patients (Kosukcu et al., 2021Kosukcu C. Taskiran E.Z. Batu E.D. Sag E. Bilginer Y. Alikasifoglu M. Ozen S.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation in the helix-loop-helix domain of TBK1 in P1 and P2 (chr12:64890825-G>A; p.Trp619∗; p.W619∗), a homozygous missense mutation in the kinase domain in P3 (chr12:64868103-T>G; p.Tyr212Asp; p.Y212D), and a homozygous nonsense mutation in the first coiled-coil domain in P4 (chr12:64879775-C>T; p.Arg440Ter; p.R440∗) (Kosukcu et al., 2021Kosukcu C. Taskiran E.Z. Batu E.D. Sag E. Bilginer Y. Alikasifoglu M. Ozen S. Whole exome sequencing in unclassified autoinflammatory diseases: more monogenic diseases in the pipeline?.Rheumatology (Oxford). 2021; 60: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and S1B). All variants are private to the patients, and the lack of any other homozygous predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) was standout (Karczewski et al., 2020Karczewski K.J. Francioli L.C. Tiao G. Cummings B.B. Alföldi J. Wang Q. Collins R.L. Laricchia K.M. Ganna A. Birnbaum D.P. et al.Genome Aggregation Database ConsortiumThe mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141,456 humans.Nature. 2020; 581: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar). Further, TBK1 is considered a LoF-intolerant gene based on the ratio of observed and expected pLoF variants reported in gnomAD, which is adjusted for sequence context, coverage, and methylation with a cutoff of < 0.35 (pLoF o/e = 0.254), and in silico damage prediction by Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) indicated a probable functional consequence from these variants as they scored above the mutation significance cutoff (MSC) for TBK1. The MSC is a gene-specific threshold of significance for scoring the potential damage of a mutation (CADD: P1 and P2 = 39, P3 = 24.9; P4 = 36; MSC = 10.854) (Itan et al., 2016Itan Y. Shang L. Boisson B. Ciancanelli M.J. Markle J.G. Martinez-Barricarte R. Scott E. Shah I. Stenson P.D. Gleeson J. et al.The mutation significance cutoff: gene-level thresholds for variant predictions.Nat.

A general framework for estimating the relative pathogenicity of human genetic variants.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar). Combined with a lack of other plausible candidate variants in WES (Tables S3 and S4) and the high conservation of the mutated residues (Figure S1C), these genetic lesions stood out as the most likely cause of the patients’ clinical phenotype. To determine if the genetic variants affect mRNA expression and/or protein production, we derived hTERT-immortalized dermal fibroblasts (hTERTs) from P1 and P2 and assessed endogenous baseline TBK1 expression. W619∗ TBK1 was dramatically less well expressed at the mRNA level compared to WT (Figure 1B) and was undetectable at the protein level (Figure 1C). We also transfected N-terminally FLAG-tagged WT, W619∗, and R440∗ TBK1 into HEK293T cells to check for the possibility of a truncated protein but no W619∗ or R440∗ TBK1 of any length was visible with anti-FLAG staining (Figure 1D). This absence of protein combined with the lack of mRNA suggested a mechanism of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and complete loss of expression (LoE). Y212D TBK1 transfected into HEK293Ts, on the other hand, was expressed at comparable levels to WT in HEK293Ts (Figures 1D and 1E), but, unlike WT, its overexpression did not trigger downstream signaling, suggesting a severely hypomorphic or LoF variant (Figures 1D–1G and S2A). The same was true for G159A, an autosomal dominant (AD) mutation that strangled IFN-I induction and led to HSE susceptibility (Herman et al., 2012Herman M. Ciancanelli M. Ou Y.-H. Lorenzo L. Klaudel-Dreszler M. Pauwels E. Sancho-Shimizu V. Pérez de Diego R. Abhyankar A.

Also unexpected was the identification of basal ganglia calcifications in both P1 (Figures S3C and S3D) and P2 (data not available) since basal ganglia calcifications are tightly associated with type-I interferonopathy, but neither possessed an IFN-I signature in peripheral blood (Figure S1E) (Livingston et al., 2014Livingston J.H.

To understand why these individuals do not present clinically with hyper-susceptibility to viral infection, we measured IFN-I activation in P1- and P2-derived hTERTs, Epstein Barr virus-transduced B cells (EBV-Bs), P1-hTERTs stably transduced with Y212D TBK1, and CRISPR-generated TBK1 KO A549s. hTERTs and EBV-Bs were stimulated with poly(I:C) (pIC) added directly to the culture media, leading to endosomal uptake and TLR3-mediated detection, or with pIC transfected into the cytoplasm with lipofectamine (L2K) where it engages cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors. In P1 and P2, endosomal pIC, sensed by TLR3, failed to induce IFN-β and IL-6 (as a measure of NF-κB), but pIC delivered into the cytoplasm produced appreciable, albeit hypomorphic, levels of both cytokines (Figures 2A, S2B, and S2C). When we looked downstream of IFN-β, we found that despite reduced IFN-β expression, IFIT1 mRNA levels were comparable to the healthy controls (HCs) (Figure 2A). Ectopic expression of Y212D TBK1 (P3’s allele) in P1 hTERTs appeared severely hypomorphic. It produced far less pIRF3 and pSTAT2 than WT following a 4-h endosomal pIC stimulation (Figure 2B) and muted IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG) and IL-6 mRNA expression after an overnight endosomal pIC stimulation (Figures 2C and S2D). In response to cytoplasmic pIC, Y212D TBK1 behaved similarly to WT (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2D), which together with the above suggests that Y212D TBK1 is severely hypomorphic in the TLR3 axis but comparably functional to the TBK1 null system downstream of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). The residual ability of TBK1 null cells to react to cytoplasmic—but not endosomal—pIC was noted globally in RNA-seq on hTERTs from P1 and P2 24 h after endosomal or cytoplasmic pIC stimulation. In principal component analysis (PCA), P1 and P2 transfected with pIC clustered together with similarly treated HCs, while P1 and P2 hTERTs that received endosomal pIC clustered with untreated and mock-transfected samples (Figure 2D). At the same time, pIC-transfected P1 and P2 hTERTs produced a muted transcriptional profile to HC cells (Figure S4A). We also assessed cGAS/STING functionality in P1 and P2 and found a hamstrung IFN-I and NF-κB response to transfected DNA (Figure S2E), in agreement with previous reports that cGAS signaling is diminished in the absence of TBK1 (Fang et al., 2017Fang R. Wang C. Jiang Q. Lv M. Gao P. Yu X. Mu P. Zhang R. Bi S. Feng J.-M. Jiang Z. NEMO-IKKβ Are Essential for IRF3 and NF-κB Activation in the cGAS-STING Pathway.J. Immunol. 2017; 199: 3222-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that a TBK1 null system can transduce signals through RIG-I-like PRRs and MAVS but not TLR3- and TRIF-dependent pathways. Meanwhile, similar induction of ISGs between the patients and HCs highlights the plasticity of the IFN-I response since it appears that antiviral immunity is largely adequate despite stunted cytokine production. We next aimed to define the mechanism of TBK1-independent IFN-I induction. The presence of phosphorylated and nuclear IRF3, the principal IFN-I transcription factor, in P1 and P2 (Figures 2E, S4B, and S4C) suggested that IFN-I production in a TBK1 null system involves a compensatory kinase such as the other non-canonical IKK-related kinase IKKε. Known to have overlapping function with TBK1, IKKε is capable of phosphorylating IRF3 (and IRF7) to initiate IFN-I production (Fitzgerald et al., 2003Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L.

We first established binding between IKKε and IRF3 in TBK1 null hTERTs (Figure 2E), and then assessed IRF3 and STAT2 phosphorylation as measures of signaling up and downstream of IFN-I cytokine production following cytoplasmic pIC stimulation. Unlike in cytoplasmic pIC-stimulated WT and TBK1 null hTERTs (Figure 2E), EBV-Bs (Figure S2C), and A549s (Figure 2F), pIRF3 and pSTAT2 were absent in A549s doubly knocked out for TBK1 and I"

https://openalex.org/W3190819343,"Animals face both external and internal dangers: pathogens threaten from the environment, and unstable genomic elements threaten from within. C. elegans protects itself from pathogens by ""reading"" bacterial small RNAs, using this information to both induce avoidance and transmit memories for four generations. Here, we found that memories can be transferred from either lysed animals or from conditioned media to naive animals via Cer1 retrotransposon-encoded virus-like particles. Moreover, Cer1 functions internally at the step of transmission of information from the germline to neurons and is required for learned avoidance. The presence of the Cer1 retrotransposon in wild C. elegans strains correlates with the ability to learn and inherit small-RNA-induced pathogen avoidance. Together, these results suggest that C. elegans has co-opted a potentially dangerous retrotransposon to instead protect itself and its progeny from a common pathogen through its inter-tissue signaling ability, hijacking this genomic element for its own adaptive immunity benefit."
https://openalex.org/W3191059496,"Objective Falls are serious issues in older populations. Balance problems are a major cause of falls and may lead to fear of falling and decreased balance confidence. The Otago Exercise Programme (OEP) is an effective fall prevention program that benefits balance function and fear of falling. The primary aim of the meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of the OEP intervention on actual balance performance (i.e., static, dynamic, proactive or reactive balance) and perceived balance ability (i.e., balance confidence or fear of falling) for older adults; the secondary aim was to examine which OEP protocol most improves balance in older adults. Methods A systematic electronic review search was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of the OEP on actual balance performance and perceived balance ability in healthy older adults, and examining which OEP training protocol and intervention format most improves balance. Results A total of 12 RCTs were included in the analyses. The OEP exerted significant effects on static balance (Hedges’s g = 0.388; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.131 to 0.645), dynamic balance (g = -0.228; 95% CI = -0.352 to -0.1.4), proactive balance (g = 0.239; 95% CI = 0.061 to 0.416) and perceived balance (g = -0.184; 95% CI = -0.320 to -0.048) in older adults. Subgroup analysis indicated that the group format for the OEP was more effective for improving static ( p = 0.008), dynamic ( p = 0.004) and perceived balance ( p = 0.004) than was the individual format. Sessions of &gt;30 minutes were more effective in improving static ( p = 0.007) and perceived balance ( p = 0.014) than were sessions of ≤30 minutes. However, the effects of the OEP on balance were unrelated to the types of control group, training frequency and training period. Discussion The OEP is helpful for improving actual balance including static, dynamic, and proactive balance; enhancing confidence in balance control; and reducing fear of falling in older adults. In particular, administrating the OEP in a group setting in &gt;30-minute sessions may be the most appropriate and effective exercise protocol for improving balance."

The recent global pandemic is a natural experiment for exploring the role of government interventions and their direct impact on hospitality stock returns in the U.S. financial market. Overall, our findings show that most of the government interventions were associated with a negative response in the returns of the hospitality industry, a response that became more negative as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved. Similar patterns were also detected for other industries such as entertainment and transportation that are closely related to hospitality. The findings we document are fundamental to understanding the trends and fluctuations in hospitality stocks in the current crisis and any similar crisis in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3190292272,"Neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex alter their firing properties in response to environmental changes. This flexibility in neural coding is hypothesized to support navigation and memory by dividing sensory experience into unique episodes. However, it is unknown how the entorhinal circuit as a whole transitions between different representations when sensory information is not delineated into discrete contexts. Here we describe rapid and reversible transitions between multiple spatial maps of an unchanging task and environment. These remapping events were synchronized across hundreds of neurons, differentially affected navigational cell types, and correlated with changes in running speed. Despite widespread changes in spatial coding, remapping comprised a translation along a single dimension in population-level activity space, enabling simple decoding strategies. These findings provoke reconsideration of how the medial entorhinal cortex dynamically represents space and suggest a remarkable capacity of cortical circuits to rapidly and substantially reorganize their neural representations."
https://openalex.org/W3191848403,"Abstract Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis and an important tumor suppressor in human malignancies. Here, we aimed to investigate the expression profile of FBP1 in ovarian cancer, the molecular mechanisms that regulate FBP1 expression and to examine how the FBP1 regulatory axis contributes to tumorigenesis and progression in ovarian cancer. We showed that FBP1 expression was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal ovarian tissues, and low-FBP1 expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. The enhanced expression of FBP1 in ovarian cancer cell lines suppressed proliferation and 2-D/3-D invasion, reduced aerobic glycolysis, and sensitized cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, DNA methylation and C-MYC binding at the promoter inhibited FBP1 expression. Furthermore, through physical interactions with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), FBP1 suppressed nuclear translocation of STAT3 and exerted its non-metabolic enzymatic activity to induce the dysfunction of STAT3. Thus, our study suggests that FBP1 may be a valuable prognostic predictor for ovarian cancer. C-MYC-dependent downregulation of FBP1 acted as a tumor suppressor via modulating STAT3, and the C-MYC/FBP1/STAT3 axis could be a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3191044343,"Differences in obesity and body fat distribution across gender and race/ethnicity have been extensively described. We sought to replicate these differences and evaluate newly emerging data from the All of Us Research Program (AoU). We compared body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio from the baseline physical examination, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from the electronic health record in up to 88,195 Non-Hispanic White (NHW), 40,770 Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 35,640 Hispanic, and 5,648 Asian participants. We compared AoU sociodemographic variable distribution to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and applied the pseudo-weighting method for adjusting selection biases of AoU recruitment. Our findings replicate previous observations with respect to gender differences in BMI. In particular, we replicate the large gender disparity in obesity rates among NHB participants, in which obesity and mean BMI are much higher in NHB women than NHB men (33.34 kg/m2 versus 28.40 kg/m2 respectively; p<2.22x10-308). The overall age-adjusted obesity prevalence in AoU participants is similar overall but lower than the prevalence found in NHANES for NHW participants. ALT was higher in men than women, and lower among NHB participants compared to other racial/ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings. Our data suggest consistency of AoU with national averages related to obesity and suggest this resource is likely to be a major source of scientific inquiry and discovery in diverse populations."
https://openalex.org/W3191220621,"Background Reviews and meta-analyses suggest that substance use and suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideations and attempts) are associated in youth, but the direction of this association remains unclear. Theoretically, the secondary psychiatric disorder hypothesis (SPDH) posits that substance use leads to suicidality, while the secondary substance use disorder hypothesis (SSUDH) posits that suicidality leads to substance use. To clarify these associations, this meta-analysis systematically reviewed studies that examined the prospective associations between SUDs and suicidality in youth (age 25 and younger) and compared results according to the direction of the association. Methods Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global were searched from inception to March 8, 2020, and 55 effect sizes from 23 samples were included and analyzed using a three-level meta-analysis. Results SUDs significantly predicted subsequent suicidality (OR = 2.16, 95%CI 1.57–2.97), suicidality significantly predicted subsequent SUDs (OR = 2.16, 95%CI 1.53–3.04), and these effect sizes did not differ (p = 0.49). Conclusions Considering that 65% of reviewed studies only examined the SPDH, this review highlights that more attention should be given to the SSUDH, and that studies should examine bidirectional associations between SUDs and suicidality across time. Clinically, because SUDs and suicidality were found to influence each other, results suggest that mental health and SUDs should ideally be detected and treated early, and that co-occurring disorders should be assessed and treated concomitantly."
https://openalex.org/W3191827252,"Abstract N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent RNA epigenetic regulator in cancer. However, the understanding of m6A modification on lipid metabolism regulation in colorectal cancer (CRC) is very limited. Here, we observed that human CRCs exhibited increased m6A mRNA methylation mediated by dysregulation of m6A erasers and readers. By performing methylated RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq), we identified DEGS2 as a downstream target of m6A dysregulation. Overexpression or knockdown of DEGS2 confirmed the role of DEGS2 in proliferation, invasion and metastasis of CRC both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies identified the specific m6A modification site within DEGS2 mRNA, and mutation of this target site was found to drastically enhance the proliferative and invasive ability of CRC cells in vitro and promote tumorigenicity in vivo. Lipidome analysis showed that lipid metabolism was dysregulated in CRC. Moreover, ceramide synthesis was suppressed due to DEGS2 upregulation mediated by m6A modification in CRC tissues. Our findings highlight that the function of DEGS2 m6A methylation in CRC and extend the understanding of the importance of RNA epigenetics in cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W3191542549,"Background In chronic pain, it seems that the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is boosted when it is combined with hypnosis. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of self-hypnosis combined with self-care (i.e., a type of CBT) compared to music/self-care, self-care and psychoeducation/CBT and to evaluate their long-term effects. Methods An open label randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with chronic pain and was carried out at the University Hospital of Liège (Belgium). Patients were randomized into four groups: self-hypnosis/self-care, music/self-care, self-care, psychoeducation/CBT (7 monthly sessions of 2 hours). Two follow-up sessions were delivered at 6- and 12-month. Levels of pain, fatigue intensity, anxiety, depression, insomnia severity, disability, health locus of control, mental and physical quality of life and attitudes (control, disability, harm, emotion, medical cure, medication, solicitude) towards pain were assessed before and after the treatments, and at follow-up. Results 203 patients were randomized: 52 in self-hypnosis/self-care, 59 in music/self-care, 47 in self-care, and 45 in psychoeducation/CBT. No group effect was found. A significant time effect was showed. Directly after the treatment, all groups decreased in pain attitudes and physical quality of life. Perceived control increased. At 6-month, all patients kept their levels of physical quality of life and perceived control, and showed decrease in pain intensity, harm, emotion and medical cure. At 12-month, scores that had change previously remained ameliorated, a decrease in insomnia severity and an increase in internal locus of control were observed. Conclusions The present findings are encouraging as they display long-term beneficial effects of complementary biopsychosocial-based treatments in chronic pain. It seems that patients continued to apply the learnt strategies as improvements were observed one year after the treatments had ended."
https://openalex.org/W3187427232,"Progressive fibrosis leads to loss of organ function and affects many organs as a result of excessive extracellular matrix production. The ubiquitous matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) is central to this through association with its primary receptor, CD44, which exists as standard CD44 (CD44s) or multiple splice variants. Mediators such as profibrotic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β are widely associated with fibrotic progression. TGF-β1 induces myofibroblast differentiation, while IL-1β induces a proinflammatory fibroblast phenotype that promotes fibroblast binding to monocyte/macrophages. CD44 expression is essential for both responses. Potential CD44 splice variants involved, however, are unidentified. The TGF-β1-activated CD44/epidermal growth factor receptor complex induces differentiation of metastatic cells through interactions with the matrix metalloproteinase inducer, CD147. This study aimed to determine the CD44 variants involved in TGF-β1- and IL-1β-mediated responses and to investigate the potential profibrotic role of CD147. Using immunocytochemistry and quantitative PCR, standard CD44s were shown to be essential for both TGF-β1-induced fibroblast/myofibroblast differentiation and IL-1β-induced monocyte binding. Co-immunoprecipitation identified that CD147 associated with CD44s. Using CD147-siRNA and confocal microscopy, we also determined that incorporation of the myofibroblast marker, αSMA, into F-actin stress fibers was prevented in the absence of CD147 and myofibroblast-dependent collagen gel contraction was inhibited. CD147 did not associate with HA, but removal of HA prevented the association of CD44s with CD147 at points of cell-cell contact. Taken together, our data suggest that CD44s/CD147 colocalization is essential in regulating the mechanical tension required for the αSMA incorporation into F-actin stress fibers that regulates myofibroblast phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3187982874,"Background COVID-19 is highly infectious viral disease that can lead to main clinical symptoms like fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia, and dyspnea. Since there is no drug to cure the disease, focusing on improving community awareness related to prevention methods is crucial. But there was no regional level study addressing the reach of information, community knowledge and attitude related to COVID-19 and its prevention, and this study was done to inform and assist communication related to the disease responses during early introduction of the disease to the setting. Methods Community based cross sectional study was conducted in selected ten towns of SNNPR, Ethiopia. Multi-stage sampling was used to select 1239 participants. Semi-structured questionnaire was designed, pre-tested and uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Knowledge was assessed considering awareness about signs and symptoms, confirmatory test (laboratory test), what to do if there is a suspect, availability of drug to cure the disease, mechanisms of transmission, prevention methods and most at risk groups. Attitude was assessed using 11 statements including seriousness of disease, being at risk, possibility of prevention, and benefits of staying at health facilities. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed to manage data using SPSS version 25. Results Almost all respondents (99.8%) heard about the disease. The mean score of knowledge was 52.3% (SD = 18.9) while the mean score attitude was 80.8% (SD = 6.48). Educational status, housing condition and marital status were associated with having good knowledge while occupation, housing condition, age and overall knowledge were associated with having positive attitude. Conclusion Even though almost all respondents had heard about the COVID-19, knowledge and attitude related to COVID-19 and its prevention were low. Awareness creation should be intensified using different local languages to improve community awareness, overcome misconceptions and minimize consequences of the disease."

Reversing HIV-1-induced T cell exhaustion is imperative for efficient virus clearance; however, viral mediators of checkpoint receptor upregulation remain largely unknown. The enrichment of checkpoint receptors on T cells upon HIV-1 infection severely constrains the generation of an efficient immune response. Herein, we examined the role of HIV-1 Nef in mediating the upregulation of checkpoint receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that the HIV-1 accessory protein Nef upregulates cell surface levels of the checkpoint receptor T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) and that this is dependent on Nef's dileucine motif LL164/165. Furthermore, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay to demonstrate that Nef and Tim-3 form a complex within cells that is abrogated upon mutation of the Nef dileucine motif. We also provide evidence that Nef moderately promotes Tim-3 shedding from the cell surface in a dileucine motif-dependent manner. Treating HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells with a matrix metalloprotease inhibitor enhanced cell surface Tim-3 levels and reduced Tim-3 shedding. Finally, Tim-3-expressing CD4+ T cells displayed a higher propensity to release the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 directly increases the levels of a checkpoint receptor on the surface of infected CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W3189454171,"Surveillance and detection of polioviruses (PV) remain crucial to monitoring eradication progress. Intratypic differentiation (ITD) using the real-time RT-PCR kit is key to the surveillance workflow, where viruses are screened after cell culture isolation before a subset are verified by sequencing. The ITD kit is a series of real-time RT-PCR assays that screens cytopathic effect (CPE)-positive cell cultures using the standard WHO method for virus isolation. Because ITD screening is a critical procedure in the poliovirus identification workflow, validation of performance of real-time PCR platforms is a core requirement for the detection of poliovirus using the ITD kit. In addition, the continual update and improvement of the ITD assays to simplify interpretation in all platforms is necessary to ensure that all real-time machines are capable of detecting positive real-time signals. Four platforms (ABI7500 real-time systems, Bio-Rad CFX96, Stratagene MX3000P, and the Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q) were validated with the ITD kit and a redesigned poliovirus probe. The poliovirus probe in the real-time RT-PCR pan-poliovirus (PanPV) assay was re-designed with a double-quencher (Zen™) to reduce background fluorescence and potential false negatives. The updated PanPV probe was evaluated with a panel consisting of 184 polioviruses and non-polio enteroviruses. To further validate the updated PanPV probe, the new assay was pilot tested in five Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) laboratories (Madagascar, India, Philippines, Pakistan, and Democratic Republic of Congo). The updated PanPV probe performance was shown to reduce background fluorescence and decrease the number of false positives compared to the standard PanPV probe."

However, the conventional processes used to produce deglycosylated ginsenosides focus on the use of intestinal microorganisms for transformation. In this study, an edible and medicinal mushroom Stereum hirsutum JE0512 was screened from 161 β-glucosidase-producing soil microorganisms sourced from wild ginseng using the plate coloration method. Furthermore, JE0512 was used for the production of CK from ginseng extracts (GE) in solid-state fermentation (SSF) using 20 g corn bran as substrate, 4 g GE, and 20% inoculation volume, and the results showed that the highest CK content was 29.13 mg/g. After combining S. hirsutum JE0512 with cellulase (Aspergillus niger), the MGs (F2, CK, and PPT) content increased from 1.66 to 130.79 mg/g in the final products. Our results indicate that the Stereum genus has the potential to biotransform GE into CK and the combination of S. hirsutum JE0512 and cellulase could pave the way for the production of MGs from GE."
https://openalex.org/W3190727696,"The tissue dynamics that govern maintenance and regeneration of the pancreas remain largely unknown. In particular, the presence and nature of a cellular hierarchy remains a topic of debate. Previous lineage tracing strategies in the pancreas relied on specific marker genes for clonal labeling, which left other populations untested and failed to account for potential widespread phenotypical plasticity. Here we employed a tracing system that depends on replication-induced clonal marks. We found that, in homeostasis, steady acinar replacement events characterize tissue dynamics, to which all acinar cells have an equal ability to contribute. Similarly, regeneration following pancreatitis was best characterized by an acinar self-replication model because no evidence of a cellular hierarchy was detected. In particular, rapid regeneration in the pancreas was found to be driven by an accelerated rate of acinar fission-like events. These results provide a comprehensive and quantitative model of cell dynamics in the exocrine pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W3191509081,"Glycosyltransferases constitute a large family of enzymes across all domains of life, but knowledge of their biochemical function remains largely incomplete, particularly in the context of plant specialized metabolism. The labdane diterpenes represent a large class of phytochemicals with many pharmacological benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and anticarcinogenic. The medicinal plant kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) produces bioactive labdane diterpenes; notably, the C19-hydroxyl diterpene (andrograpanin) is predominantly found as C19-O-glucoside (neoandrographolide), whereas diterpenes having additional hydroxylation(s) at C3 (14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide) or C3 and C14 (andrographolide) are primarily detected as aglycones, signifying scaffold-selective C19-O-glucosylation of diterpenes in planta. Here, we analyzed UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) activity and diterpene levels across various developmental stages and tissues and found an apparent correlation of UGT activity with the spatiotemporal accumulation of neoandrographolide, the major diterpene C19-O-glucoside. The biochemical analysis of recombinant UGTs preferentially expressed in neoandrographolide-accumulating tissues identified a previously uncharacterized UGT86 member (ApUGT12/UGT86C11) that catalyzes C19-O-glucosylation of diterpenes with strict scaffold selectivity. ApUGT12 localized to the cytoplasm and catalyzed diterpene C19-O-glucosylation in planta. The substrate selectivity demonstrated by the recombinant ApUGT12 expressed in plant and bacterium hosts was comparable to native UGT activity. Recombinant ApUGT12 showed significantly higher catalytic efficiency using andrograpanin compared with 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide and trivial activity using andrographolide. Moreover, ApUGT12 silencing in plants led to a drastic reduction in neoandrographolide content and increased levels of andrograpanin. These data suggest the involvement of ApUGT12 in scaffold-selective C19-O-glucosylation of labdane diterpenes in plants. This knowledge of UGT86 function might help in developing plant chemotypes and synthesis of pharmacologically relevant diterpenes. Glycosyltransferases constitute a large family of enzymes across all domains of life, but knowledge of their biochemical function remains largely incomplete, particularly in the context of plant specialized metabolism. The labdane diterpenes represent a large class of phytochemicals with many pharmacological benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and anticarcinogenic. The medicinal plant kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) produces bioactive labdane diterpenes; notably, the C19-hydroxyl diterpene (andrograpanin) is predominantly found as C19-O-glucoside (neoandrographolide), whereas diterpenes having additional hydroxylation(s) at C3 (14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide) or C3 and C14 (andrographolide) are primarily detected as aglycones, signifying scaffold-selective C19-O-glucosylation of diterpenes in planta. Here, we analyzed UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) activity and diterpene levels across various developmental stages and tissues and found an apparent correlation of UGT activity with the spatiotemporal accumulation of neoandrographolide, the major diterpene C19-O-glucoside. The biochemical analysis of recombinant UGTs preferentially expressed in neoandrographolide-accumulating tissues identified a previously uncharacterized UGT86 member (ApUGT12/UGT86C11) that catalyzes C19-O-glucosylation of diterpenes with strict scaffold selectivity. ApUGT12 localized to the cytoplasm and catalyzed diterpene C19-O-glucosylation in planta. The substrate selectivity demonstrated by the recombinant ApUGT12 expressed in plant and bacterium hosts was comparable to native UGT activity. Recombinant ApUGT12 showed significantly higher catalytic efficiency using andrograpanin compared with 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide and trivial activity using andrographolide. Moreover, ApUGT12 silencing in plants led to a drastic reduction in neoandrographolide content and increased levels of andrograpanin. These data suggest the involvement of ApUGT12 in scaffold-selective C19-O-glucosylation of labdane diterpenes in plants. This knowledge of UGT86 function might help in developing plant chemotypes and synthesis of pharmacologically relevant diterpenes. Plants make an astonishing diversity of chemicals that are important to their overall fitness in a challenging environment and are also valuable as pharmaceuticals and various industrial chemicals (1Pichersky E.

Kliebenstein D.J. Plant secondary metabolites as defenses, regulators, and primary metabolites: The blurred functional trichotomy.Plant Physiol. 2020; 184: 39-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diversity in plant specialized pathway is believed to have originated because of the evolution of diverse enzyme function following gene duplication and neofunctionalization (4Fernie A.R. Tohge T. The genetics of plant metabolism.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2017; 51: 287-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A genome-wide analysis found about 15% of the protein-coding genes corresponds to the specialized metabolic pathways in plants (5Chae L. Kim T. Nilo-Poyanco R. Rhee S.Y. Genomic signatures of specialized metabolism in plants.Science. 2014; 344: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Besides, the enzymes of the plant specialized metabolism often show catalytic promiscuity, leading to additional product diversity. The glycosyltransferases (GTs) detected in all forms of life catalyze the transfer of sugar moiety from activated sugar donors (e.g., nucleotide diphosphate/monophosphate sugar or lipid phosphate sugar) to various acceptor molecules, such as nucleotides, sugars, lipids, proteins, antibiotics, and small molecules/specialized metabolites (6Lairson L.L.

An evolutionary view of functional diversity in family 1 glycosyltransferases.Plant J. 2011; 66: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the Carbohydrate-Active enZYymes database, the multigene family GTs are broadly classified into 114 families depending on sequence similarity (http://www.cazy.org/GlycosylTransferases.html). The GTs involved in glycosylation of small molecules such as plant specialized metabolites are grouped under the GT1 family, representing the largest GT family in plants. For example, GT1 family represents more than 25% to 35% GTs in model plants, Arabidopsis and rice (7Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Hanada K. An evolutionary view of functional diversity in family 1 glycosyltransferases.Plant J. 2011; 66: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). GT1 are also referred to as UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) considering that they utilize UDP-sugar as sugar donor. In majority of cases, plant UGTs utilize UDP-glucose as sugar donor, although UDP-galactose, UDP-xylose, UDP-rhamnose, and UDP-glucuronic acid are also accepted by some UGTs (8Lim E.K. Bowles D.J.

However, considering a huge diversity of UGTs even in a single plant species and the diversity of specialized metabolites produced in plants, it is quite impossible to assign biochemical function of UGTs in plant specialized metabolism, solely based on sequence similarity. For example, Arabidopsis and rice encode about 120 and 215 UGTs, respectively, but only about 25% UGTs are biochemically characterized so far, and the native substrates of many of the UGTs remain to be known (7Yonekura-Sakakibara K.

Neoandrographolide biosynthesis in kalmegh starts with a diterpene cyclization reaction catalyzed by the diterpene synthase, converting a general diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to ent-copalyl pyrophosphate (Fig. 1). Previously, we have identified a diterpene synthase (ApCPS2) catalyzing the first committed reaction in the neoandrographolide biosynthetic pathway (40Misra R.C. Garg A. Roy S. Chanotiya C.S. Vasudev P.G. Ghosh S.

Andrographis paniculata transcriptome provides molecular insights into tissue-specific accumulation of medicinal diterpenes.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16: 659Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The final step in neoandrographolide biosynthesis involves C19-O-glucosylation of andrograpanin (Fig. 1). However, UGT involved in developmental and tissue-specific biosynthesis of neoandrographolide was not identified. Previously, two methyl jasmonate (MeJA)–inducible UGTs (UGT73AU1 and UGT5), which catalyzed in vitro C19-O-glucosylation of andrograpanin, were identified, but their involvement in planta biosynthesis of neoandrographolide was not understood (42Li Y.

To investigate the UGT involved in spatiotemporal biosynthesis of neoandrographolide, we have analyzed a large-scale transcriptome data of kalmegh and identified UGTs that preferentially expressed in neoandrographolide-accumulating tissues. Furthermore, 23 recombinant UGTs were screened in UGT assay, leading to the identification of ApUGT12 (UGT86C11) catalyzing C19-O-glucosylation of diterpenes in a scaffold-selective manner (Fig. 1). The steady-state kinetic of ApUGT12, an altered diterpene profiles in ApUGT12-silenced plants, and a strong correlation of ApUGT12 transcript expression with UGT activity and neoandrographolide accumulation patterns across various developmental stages and tissues suggested a pivotal role of ApUGT12 in the biosynthesis of diterpene C19-O-glucoside. To understand spatiotemporal biosynthesis of diterpenes, we conducted comprehensive profiling of diterpene aglycones (andrographolide, andrograpanin, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide) and diterpene C19-O-glucosides (neoandrographolide, andrographiside, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside) across five developmental stages (germinating seeds, cotyledonary leaf stage, 15-day-old plants, 30-day-old plants, and 60-day-old plants) using six tissues (root, leaf, stem, sepal, petal, and seedpod) (Fig. S1). HPLC analysis of methanolic extracts revealed higher content of neoandrographolide, andrographolide, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide in leaves (Figs. 2A, S2, and S3, A and B). However, these diterpenes were not detected in roots and germinating seeds. In addition, neoandrographolide, andrographolide, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide were also detected in considerable amounts in seedpod, sepal, and cotyledonary leaf stage seedlings, respectively. The increased amount of neoandrographolide than andrograpanin in kalmegh tissues suggested ready conversion of andrograpanin to neoandrographolide following C19-O-glucosylation, thus limiting in planta accumulation of andrograpanin (Figs. 1 and 2A). On the other hand, higher content of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide than the corresponding C19-O-glucosides (andrographiside and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside) indicated inefficient C19-O-glucosylation of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (Figs. 1 and S3, A and B). These results suggest that scaffold-selective C19-O-glucosylation potentially contributes to distinct patterns of diterpene aglycones and glucosides in planta. To investigate the involvement of UGT in diterpene C19-O-glucosylation, UGT assays were carried out using total protein extract of various tissues. Andrograpanin, andrographolide, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide were the sugar acceptors, whereas UDP-glucose served as sugar donor in assays. Diterpene C19-O-glucoside produced in assay was monitored by HPLC. UGT assays using andrograpanin as sugar acceptor revealed considerably higher enzyme activity in leaves of 60-day-old and 30-day-old plants followed by in leaves of 15-day-old plants and seedpod (Fig. 2B). These tissues also contained higher amount of neoandrographolide (Fig. 2A). UGT assay using total protein extract of roots and germinating seeds could not form neoandrographolide. Likewise, neoandrographolide was not detected in roots and germinating seeds. In contrast, UGT assay using 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide revealed considerably lower activity than using andrograpanin (Fig. S4). However, C19-O-glucosylation of andrographolide could not be achieved at a detectable level using total protein extract of various tissues. Thus, higher UGT activity using andrograpanin than andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide might have contributed to neoandrographolide biosynthesis at a higher rate than andrographiside and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside biosynthesis, leading to distinct profiles of diterpene aglycones and C19-O-glucosides in planta (Figs. 2, A and B, S3, A and B, and S4). Unlike andrograpanin, the other two diterpene aglycones (andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide) bear additional hydroxyl group(s) at the C3 and/or C14 positions. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that scaffold-selective C19-O-glucosylation of diterpene aglycones by UGT potentially contributes to selective accumulation of diterpene aglycones and glucosides. Andrograpanin C19-O-glucosylation activity and neoandrographolide level in various tissues showed a clear correlation (Fig. 2, A and B). The maximum UGT activity toward andrograpanin C19-O-glucosylation was noticed in leaves of 60-day-old plants; however, UGT activity was not detected in roots. Similarly, neoandrographolide was detected at a higher level in leaves of 60-day-old plants, whereas neoandrographolide could not be detected in roots. To investigate the enzyme involved in C19-O-glucosylation of diterpenes, a large-scale RNA-Seq data representing more than 170 million sequencing reads of leaves and roots were screened and UGTs that preferentially expressed in leaves were identified (41Garg A. Agrawal L. Misra R.C. Sharma S. Ghosh S. Andrographis paniculata transcriptome provides molecular insights into tissue-specific accumulation of medicinal diterpenes.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16: 659Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The transcripts potentially encoding UGTs were retrieved based on annotation to the Carbohydrate-Active enZYymes database following BlastX analysis. Among a total of 615 transcripts annotated to various GT families, 161 transcripts were categorized under the GT1/UGT family. Notably, UGT73AU1 (contig ApU2595) and UGT5 (contig ApU62177) transcript expression in leaves and roots was quite comparable (Fig. S5A). The previous study also found a similar transcript expression of UGT73AU1 in leaves and roots; however, UGT5 transcript expression in different tissues was not examined before (42Li Y. Lin H.X. Wang J. Yang J. Lai C.J. Wang X. Ma B.W. Tang J.F. Li Y. Li X.L. Guo J. Gao W. Huang L.Q. Glucosyltransferase capable of catalyzing the last step in neoandrographolide biosynthesis.Org.

To know whether UGT73AU1 and UGT5 contribute to developmental and tissue-specific C19-O-glucosylation of diterpenes, UGT73AU1 and UGT5 transcript expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and correlated with diterpene accumulation patterns and UGT activity (Fig. S6A). UGT73AU1 and UGT5 transcripts expressed at a higher level in roots of 60-day-old plants and sepal. However, andrograpanin C19-O-glucosylation activity and neoandrographolide content in these tissues were substantially lower or not detected (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, UGT73AU1 and UGT5 transcript expression patterns strongly indicated that they might not be playing a major role in developmental and tissue-specific biosynthesis of diterpene glucosides. Moreover, a similar catalytic efficiency of recombinant UGT5 using andrograpanin, andrographolide, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide could not corroborate differential activity of native UGT using these diterpene aglycones, if UGT5 is considered to be playing a major role in planta diterpene C19-O-glucosylation (Fig. S4) (42Li Y.

https://openalex.org/W3190865283,"A large number of protein sequences are registered in public databases such as PubMed. Functionally uncharacterized enzymes are included in these databases, some of which likely have potential for industrial applications. However, assignment of the enzymes remained difficult tasks for now. In this study, we assigned a total of 28 original sequences to uncharacterized enzymes in the FAD-dependent oxidase family expressed in some species of bacteria including Chryseobacterium, Flavobacterium, and Pedobactor. Progenitor sequence of the assigned 28 sequences was generated by ancestral sequence reconstruction, and the generated sequence exhibited L-lysine oxidase activity; thus, we named the enzyme AncLLysO. Crystal structures of ligand-free and ligand-bound forms of AncLLysO were determined, indicating that the enzyme recognizes L-Lys by hydrogen bond formation with R76 and E383. The binding of L-Lys to AncLLysO induced dynamic structural change at a plug loop formed by residues 251 to 254. Biochemical assays of AncLLysO variants revealed the functional importance of these substrate recognition residues and the plug loop. R76A and E383D variants were also observed to lose their activity, and the kcat/Km value of G251P and Y253A mutations were approximately 800- to 1800-fold lower than that of AncLLysO, despite the indirect interaction of the substrates with the mutated residues. Taken together, our data demonstrate that combinational approaches to sequence classification from database and ancestral sequence reconstruction may be effective not only to find new enzymes using databases of unknown sequences but also to elucidate their functions."
https://openalex.org/W3191147376,"Although several studies have been conducted on COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and prevention practices among healthcare workers and the general population, there has not been any study among taxi drivers in Ethiopia, including Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, the lack of which hinders providing evidence-based interventions to this target group. Thus, this study was designed to contribute to proper planning of COVID-19 intervention measures among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town during July to August, 2020. The data was collected using a structured questionnaire and an observational checklist. The collected data was checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. The outcome variables of this study were good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor frequent hand hygiene practices towards COVID-19. Bivariate (Crude Odds Ratio [COR]) and multivariable (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]) logistic regression analysis were employed to identify factors significantly associated with good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices among taxi drivers. Significance level of variables was declared at a p < 0.05 from the adjusted analysis.Out of the total 417 taxi drivers, 69.8% [95% CI: 65.2-73.9], 67.6% [95%CI: 63.1-72.2] and 66.4% [95% CI: 62.1-71.0] of the drivers had good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices, respectively. Educational level (AOR = 7.55, 95% CI = 4.55-12.54), place of residence (AOR = 5.41, 95% CI = 1.4-20.08) and attitude towards COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.02-2.74) were factors associated with good knowledge about COVID-19. Further, age of taxi drivers greater than 30 years (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.76-5.13), educational level of secondary or above (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.88-5.31), income (AOR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.48-7.61), and knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.21-3.54) were factors associated with positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention. In addition, attitude towards COVID-19 (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI = 3.40-8.88) and educational level (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.15-2.95) were the factors associated with good frequent hand hygiene practices.We concluded that the rates of good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices were relatively low among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. We strongly recommended providing training about COVID-19 prevention measures for taxi drivers that considers age, education status and attitude areas essential to improve their knowledge, attitude and frequent hand hygiene practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3192555705,"To address workforce shortages and expand access to care, we developed a telemedicine program incorporating existing infrastructure for delivery of cardiovascular care in Gulu, Northern Uganda. Our study had three objectives: 1) assess feasibility and clinical impact 2) evaluate patient/parent satisfaction and 3) estimate costs.All cardiology clinic visits during a two-year study period were included. All patients received an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram performed by a local nurse in Gulu which were stored and transmitted to the Uganda Heart Institute in the capital of Kampala for remote consultation by a cardiologist. Results were relayed to patients/families following cardiologist interpretation. The following telemedicine process was utilized: 1) clinical intake by nurse in Gulu; 2) ECG and echocardiography acquisition in Gulu; 3) echocardiography transmission to the Uganda Heart Institute in Kampala, Uganda; 4) remote telemedicine consultation by cardiologists in Kampala; and 5) communication of results to patients/families in Gulu. Clinical care and technical aspects were tracked. Diagnoses and recommendations were analyzed by age groups (0-5 years, 6-21 years, 22-50 years and > 50 years). A mixed methods approach involving interviews and surveys was used to assess patient satisfaction. Healthcare sector costs of telemedicine-based cardiovascular care were estimated using time-driven activity-based costing.Normal studies made up 47%, 55%, 76% and 45% of 1,324 patients in the four age groups from youngest to oldest. Valvular heart disease (predominantly rheumatic heart disease) was the most common diagnosis in the older three age groups. Medications were prescribed to 31%, 31%, 24%, and 48% of patients in the four age groups. The median time for consultation was 7 days. A thematic analysis of focus group transcripts displayed an overall acceptance and appreciation for telemedicine, citing cost- and time-saving benefits. The cost of telemedicine was $29.48/visit.Our data show that transmission and interpretation of echocardiograms from a remote clinic in northern Uganda is feasible, serves a population with a high burden of heart disease, has a significant impact on patient care, is favorably received by patients, and can be delivered at low cost. Further study is needed to better assess the impact relative to existing standards of care and cost effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3191164977,"Polysaccharide lyases (PLs) are a broad class of microbial enzymes that degrade anionic polysaccharides. Equally broad diversity in their polysaccharide substrates has attracted interest in biotechnological applications such as biomass conversion to value-added chemicals and microbial biofilm removal. Unlike other PLs, Smlt1473 present in the clinically relevant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain K279a demonstrates a wide range of pH-dependent substrate specificities toward multiple, diverse polysaccharides: hyaluronic acid (pH 5.0), poly-β-D-glucuronic (celluronic) acid (pH 7.0), poly-β-D-mannuronic acid, and poly-α-L-guluronate (pH 9.0). To decode the pH-driven multiple substrate specificities and selectivity in this single enzyme, we present the X-ray structures of Smlt1473 determined at multiple pH values in apo and mannuronate-bound states as well as the tetra-hyaluronate-docked structure. Our results indicate that structural flexibility in the binding site and N-terminal loop coupled with specific substrate stereochemistry facilitates distinct modes of entry for substrates having diverse charge densities and chemical structures. Our structural analyses of wild-type apo structures solved at different pH values (5.0-9.0) and pH-trapped (5.0 and 7.0) catalytically relevant wild-type mannuronate complexes (1) indicate that pH modulates the catalytic microenvironment for guiding structurally and chemically diverse polysaccharide substrates, (2) further establish that molecular-level fluctuation in the enzyme catalytic tunnel is preconfigured, and (3) suggest that pH modulates fluctuations resulting in optimal substrate binding and cleavage. Furthermore, our results provide key insight into how strategies to reengineer both flexible loop and regions distal to the active site could be developed to target new and diverse substrates in a wide range of applications."
https://openalex.org/W3124664822,"Noninvasive techniques for evaluating the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have shown limited diagnostic performance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are useful biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring the progression and treatment response to several diseases. Here, we evaluated whether serum exosomal miRNAs could be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of NAFLD severity. Exosomal miRNAs were isolated from the sera of 41 patients with NAFLD (diagnosed using liver biopsy) for microarray profiling. The degree of NAFLD severity was determined using inflammation, steatosis, and ballooning scores and the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Correlations between miRNA expression, clinical and biochemical parameters, and mRNA expression were analyzed. Overall, 25, 11, 13, and 14 miRNAs correlated with the inflammation score, steatosis score, ballooning score, and NAS, respectively, with 33 significant correlations observed between 27 miRNAs and six clinical variables. Eight miRNAs (let-7b-5p, miR-378h, -1184, -3613-3p, -877-5p, -602, -133b, and 509-3p) showed anticorrelated patterns with the corresponding mRNA expression. In fibrosis, 52 and 30 interactions corresponding to high miRNA-low mRNA and low miRNA-high mRNA expression, respectively, were observed. The present results therefore suggest that serum exosomal miRNAs can be used to evaluate NAFLD severity and identify potential targets for NAFLD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3187753422,"Bacteria require high-efficiency uptake systems to survive and proliferate in nutrient-limiting environments, such as those found in host organisms. ABC transporters in the bacterial plasma membrane provide a mechanism for transport of many substrates. In this study, we examine an operon containing a periplasmic binding protein in Actinobacillus for its potential role in nutrient acquisition. The electron density map of 1.76 Å resolution obtained from the crystal structure of the periplasmic binding protein was best fit with a molecular model containing a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (P5P/pyridoxal phosphate/the active form of vitamin B6) ligand within the protein's binding site. The identity of the P5P bound to this periplasmic binding protein was verified by isothermal titration calorimetry, microscale thermophoresis, and mass spectrometry, leading us to name the protein P5PA and the operon P5PAB. To illustrate the functional utility of this uptake system, we introduced the P5PAB operon from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae into an Escherichia coli K-12 strain that was devoid of a key enzyme required for P5P synthesis. The growth of this strain at low levels of P5P supports the functional role of this operon in P5P uptake. This is the first report of a dedicated P5P bacterial uptake system, but through bioinformatics, we discovered homologs mainly within pathogenic representatives of the Pasteurellaceae family, suggesting that this operon exists more widely outside the Actinobacillus genus."
https://openalex.org/W3188311647,"Mozambique introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix ® , GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) in September 2015. Previous analysis, showed that Nampula province continues reporting a high frequency of Rotavirus A (RVA) infection and the emergence of G9P[6], G9P[4] and G3P[4] genotypes. This analysis aimed to determine the RVA frequency; risk factors; genotype distribution by vaccination status and age between pre- and post-vaccine periods in children under-five years old with diarrhea in Nampula. A cross-sectional, hospital-based surveillance study was conducted in the Hospital Central de Nampula in Mozambique. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected to assess factors related to RVA infection in both periods. Stool specimens were screened to detect RVA by ELISA, and positive samples were genotyped. Between 2015 (pre-vaccine period) and 2016–2019 (post-vaccine period), 614 stool specimens were collected and tested for RVA in which 34.9% (67/192) were positive in pre-vaccine period and 21.8% (92/422) in post-vaccine (p = 0.001). In the post-vaccine period, age, year, and contact with different animal species (chicken, duck, or multiple animals) were associated with RVA infection. RVA infection was higher in children partially vaccinated (40.7%, 11/27) followed by the fully vaccinated (29.3%, 56/191) and the unvaccinated (15.3%, 21/137) (p = 0.002). G1P[8] and G9P[4] were common in vaccinated children less than 12 months. The present analysis showed that RVA infection reduced slightly in the post-vaccine period, with a high proportion of infection and genotype diversity in children, under 12 months of age, vaccinated. Further research on factors associated with RVA infection on vaccinated compared to unvaccinated children and vaccination optimization should be done."
https://openalex.org/W3187703192,"The asymmetric cell division of stem or progenitor cells generates daughter cells with distinct fates that balance proliferation and differentiation. Asymmetric segregation of Notch signaling regulatory protein Numb plays a crucial role in cell diversification. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examined the unequal distribution of Numb in the daughter cells of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELCs) that undergo DMSO-induced erythroid differentiation. In contrast to the cytoplasmic localization of Numb during uninduced cell division, Numb is concentrated at the cell boundary in interphase, near the one-spindle pole in metaphase, and is unequally distributed to one daughter cell in anaphase in induced cells. The inheritance of Numb guides this daughter cell toward erythroid differentiation while the other cell remains a progenitor cell. Mitotic spindle orientation, critical for distribution of cell fate determinants, requires complex communication between the spindle microtubules and the cell cortex mediated by the NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex. Depletion of each individual member of the complex randomizes the position of Numb relative to the mitotic spindle. Gene replacement confirms that multifunctional erythrocyte protein 4.1R (4.1R) functions as a member of the NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex and is necessary for regulating spindle orientation, in which interaction between 4.1R and NuMA plays an important role. These results suggest that mispositioning of Numb is the result of spindle misorientation. Finally, disruption of the 4.1R-NuMA-LGN complex increases Notch signaling and decreases the erythroblast population. Together, our results identify a critical role for 4.1R in regulating the asymmetric segregation of Numb to mediate erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W3190011279,"Defined daily doses (DDD) have been established in human medicine to standardize the measurement of treatment in a population. In veterinary medicine, the European Medicine Agency published defined daily dose (DDDvet) values for antimicrobial agents used in food-producing animals in 2016. National defined doses (DDDjp) for antimicrobials used for pigs in Japan have recently been determined. The aim of this study was to compare the results of calculated antimicrobial use in the field using the DDDjp and DDDvet values. Data from 74 pig farms in Japan relative to antimicrobial use in 2019 was collected. The numbers of DDDs (the weight of biomass treated in kg-days) using DDDjp and DDDvet values for each farm and for different antimicrobial classes were compared. Associations between calculated numbers of DDDjp and DDDvet on farm level were investigated. In addition, differences in antimicrobial use were investigated between different production types of farms (farrowing, finishing and farrow-to-finish farms). Using DDDjp and DDDvet values, the aggregated number of DDDs for 74 farms were 4,099,188 and 2,217,085 respectively, with the former being larger by 1.85 times than the latter. The most frequently used antimicrobial class was penicillin regardless of whether DDDjp or DDDvet was used. The absence of DDDvet values for certain antimicrobial agents used in Japan and the differences in the number of DDDjps/PCU and DDDvets/PCU indicated the need for Japanese DDDs. The number of DDDs per kg population correction unit (PCU) per farm tended to be higher in farrowing farms than in farrow-to-finish farms and finishing farms, with no significant difference (P = 0.19)."
https://openalex.org/W3192058160,"Eating disorders are prevalent in college students but college students are not accurate in identifying the presence of eating disorders (ED) especially when race is involved. Much has been researched about diagnostic ability in vignette form, but little outside of this. For example, it is not known how facial features, such as perceived femininity, may affect observers’ beliefs about the likelihood of disordered eating depending on race. In the present study, we examined how biases regarding facial appearance and disordered eating may differ depending on the race of face images. Using a technique called reverse correlation, we estimated the image templates associated with perceived likelihood of disordered eating using both White and Black Faces. Specifically, we recruited 28 college students who categorized White and Black faces according to perceived likelihood of an eating disorder diagnosis in the presence of image noise. Subsequently, we asked Amazon Mechanical Turk participants to categorize the resulting race-specific face templates according to perceived ED likelihood and femininity. The templates corresponding to a high likelihood of an ED diagnosis were distinguished from low-likelihood images by this second independent participant sample at above-chance levels. For Black faces, the templates corresponding to a high likelihood of an ED diagnosis were also selected as more feminine than low-likelihood templates at an above-chance level, whereas there was no such effect found for White faces. These results suggest that stereotyped beliefs about both femininity and the likelihood of disordered eating may interact with perceptual processes."
https://openalex.org/W3192793763,"PRML, a novel candlestick pattern recognition model using machine learning methods, is proposed to improve stock trading decisions. Four popular machine learning methods and 11 different features types are applied to all possible combinations of daily patterns to start the pattern recognition schedule. Different time windows from one to ten days are used to detect the prediction effect at different periods. An investment strategy is constructed according to the identified candlestick patterns and suitable time window. We deploy PRML for the forecast of all Chinese market stocks from Jan 1, 2000 until Oct 30, 2020. Among them, the data from Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2014 is used as the training data set, and the data set from Jan 1, 2015 to Oct 30, 2020 is used to verify the forecasting effect. Empirical results show that the two-day candlestick patterns after filtering have the best prediction effect when forecasting one day ahead; these patterns obtain an average annual return, an annual Sharpe ratio, and an information ratio as high as 36.73%, 0.81, and 2.37, respectively. After screening, three-day candlestick patterns also present a beneficial effect when forecasting one day ahead in that these patterns show stable characteristics. Two other popular machine learning methods, multilayer perceptron network and long short-term memory neural networks, are applied to the pattern recognition framework to evaluate the dependency of the prediction model. A transaction cost of 0.2% is considered on the two-day patterns predicting one day ahead, thus confirming the profitability. Empirical results show that applying different machine learning methods to two-day and three-day patterns for one-day-ahead forecasts can be profitable."

The present study was carried out to determine the associations between DSM-IV TR Axis- I &amp; II disorders and deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) in a rural agricultural district in Sri Lanka. Patients residing in the district who presented with DSP were randomly selected for the study. Both the cases and age, sex, and, residential area, matched controls were assessed for DSM-IV TR Axis- I &amp; II disorders based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I and II Disorders (SCID I &amp; II) conducted by a specialist psychiatrist. Cases consisted of 208 (47.4%) males and 231 (52.6%) females. More than one third (37%) of males and more than half (53.7%) of females were aged below 20 years. DSM-IV TR axis-I and/or II psychiatric diagnoses were diagnosed in 89 (20.3%) of cases and 14 (3.2%) controls. Cases with a DSM-IV TR axis-I diagnosis were older than the cases without psychiatric diagnosis (32 and 19 years), p&lt;0.0001. Having a depressive episode was associated with a 19 times higher risk for DSP. Being a male aged &gt; = 30 years and having an alcohol use disorder carried a 21 times excess risk for DSP. A fivefold excess risk for DSP was found among 10–19 year old females with borderline personality traits. Depressive disorder and alcohol-related disorders were significantly associated with the older participants who presented with DSP. The overall prevalence of psychiatric disorders associated with DSP in rural Sri Lanka was significantly lower compared to the rates reported in the West and other countries in the region. Therefore, health and research priorities to reduce self-harm in Sri Lanka should focus both on psychiatric and non-psychiatric factors associated with DSP."
https://openalex.org/W3190081975,"Background Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the most common type of renal cell carcinoma after clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Its pathological classification is controversial, and its molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Therefore, the identification of key genes and their biological pathways is of great significance to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PRCC occurrence and progression. Methods The PRCC-related datasets GSE7023, GSE48352 and GSE15641 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed. Cytoscape and STRING were used to construct the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and perform module analysis to identify hub genes and key pathways. A heatmap of hub genes was constructed using the UCSC cancer genomics browser. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients stratified by the expression levels of hub genes were analysed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter. The online database UALCAN was applied to analyse gene expression based on tissue type, stage, subtype and race. Results A total of 214 DEGs, specifically, 205 downregulated genes and 9 upregulated genes, were identified. The DEGs were mainly enriched in angiogenesis, kidney development, oxidation-reduction process, metabolic pathways, etc. The 17 hub genes identified were mainly enriched in the biological processes of angiogenesis, cell adhesion, platelet degranulation, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Survival analysis showed that EGF, KDR, CXCL12, REN, PECAM1, CDH5, THY1, WT1, PLAU and DCN might be related to the carcinogenesis, metastasis or recurrence of PRCC. UALCAN analysis showed that low expression of PECAM1 and PLAU in PRCC tissues was related to stage, subtype and race. Conclusions The DEGs and hub genes identified in the present study provide insight into the specific molecular mechanisms of PRCC occurrence and development and may be potential molecular markers and therapeutic targets for the accurate classification and efficient diagnosis and treatment of PRCC."
https://openalex.org/W3190721542,"Introduction Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) can cause persisting life-changing dysfunction. There is scarce literature regarding the long-term assessment of CES symptoms, and rarer still is the impact of these symptoms on mental wellbeing investigated. This study assessed the long-term patient reported mental wellbeing outcomes of post-operative CES patients. Methods Patients who underwent surgery for CES between August 2013 and November 2014 were identified using an ethically approved database. They then completed validated questionnaires over the telephone assessing their mental and physical functioning (Short-Form 12 Questionnaire), generating the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Bladder, bowel and sexual function were also assessed using validated questionnaires. MCS scores were compared to both the Scottish mean and previously published cut-offs indicating patients at risk of depression. Correlations of MCS with bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction were examined and multifactorial regression to predict MCS from these variables analysed. Independent t-tests assessed the mean difference in MCS between patients presenting with incomplete CES (CES-I) and CES with retention (CES-R) and between those with radiologically confirmed and impending CES. Results Forty-six participants with a mean follow-up time of 43 months completed the study. The mean (±SD) MCS was 49 (±11.8) with 22% demonstrating poor mental health related quality of life in comparison to the Scottish mean. Overall, 37% had scores consistent with being at risk for depression with in the last 30 days, and 45% within the last 12 months. MCS was significantly correlated with Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) score (-0.608), NBDS score (-0.556), ASEX score (-0.349) and PCS score (0.413) with worse bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction associated with worse MCS score. Multifactorial regression analysis demonstrated both urinary (USP score p = 0.031) and bowel function (NBDS score p = 0.009) to be significant predictive variables of mental health related quality of life. There were no significant mean differences in MCS between those presenting with CES-I and CES-R or those with radiologically complete and impending CES. Discussion This study demonstrates a high frequency of being at risk for depression in patients with CES and identifies outcome measures (physical, sexual and more so bladder and bowel dysfunction) associated with poorer mental wellbeing. Our large cohort and long follow-up highlight that CES patients should be considered at risk of depression, and the need to consider mental health outcomes following CES surgery."

Research into how people experience medicines in their everyday life remains scarce with the majority of research in this area of focusing on whether or not people take their medicines as prescribed. Hence, this study used a phenomenological hermeneutical qualitative design to gain a deeper understanding of individuals’ perspectives on the lived experience of medicine-taking. Findings from this study highlight five main themes where participants experience medicines as: 1) life-saving and indispensable, 2) normal and a daily routine, 3) confusing and concerning, 4) unsuitable without adjustment, and 5) intrusive and unwelcome. These results can be the basis for mutually agreed prescribing through a co-creative approach that aims at enhancing open and honest dialogues between patients and healthcare professionals in partnership about medicines."
https://openalex.org/W3191183808,"We predicted that people with compassionate goals to support others and not harm them practiced more COVID-19 health behaviors during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to protect both themselves and others from infection. Three studies ( N = 1,143 American adults) supported these predictions and ruled out several alternative explanations. Compassionate goals unrelated to the health context predicted COVID-19 health behaviors better than the general motivation to be healthy (Studies 2 and 3). In contrast, general health motivation predicted general health behaviors better than did compassionate goals. Compassionate goals and political ideology each explained unique variance in COVID-19 health behaviors (Studies 1–3). Compassionate goals predict unique variance in COVID-19 health behaviors beyond empathic concern, communal orientation, and relational self-construal (Study 3), supporting the unique contribution of compassionate goals to understanding health behaviors. Our results suggest that ecosystem motivation is an important predictor of health behaviors, particularly in the context of a highly contagious disease."

Test samples were sprayed with etofenprox during rice cultivation, and brown rice samples were dipped in a pesticide solution to investigate the effects of washing and processing. A multiresidue method for multiclass pesticides was employed for etofenprox analysis using a high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector setup. Etofenprox was not detected in polished rice that was processed into rice cakes and cookies. The etofenprox residue levels were 2.13 mg/kg in each processing stage of brown rice products that were dipped in 400 mg/kg etofenprox solutions. The residual amounts of etofenprox in washed/polished rice and rice flour obtained by grinding were 1.25 and 0.77 mg/kg, respectively. The residual levels were 0.38 mg/kg in rice cakes prepared by cooking rice flour in a steamer for 20 min (a decrease of 82.1% compared to that in polished rice), 0.47 mg/kg in rice cookies baked in an oven for 20 min (a decrease of 78.0%), and 0.21 mg/kg in fried rice cookies (a decrease of 90.2%).

The study was conducted on two large samples of middle (n = 379, Mage = 11.31) and high school (n = 451, Mage = 15.21) students. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the expected three-factor structure, comprising SOP-Striving, SOP-Critical, and SPP. Multigroup analyses provided evidence of configural, metric, and (partial) scalar measurement invariance across grade levels. Structural invariance (i.e., the invariance of factor variances and covariances) was also established. The scale scores exhibited a differentiated pattern of relations with personality traits and academic achievement, as measured by school grades: SOP-Critical and SPP were positively related to neuroticism and have adverse effects on grades of middle and high school students, respectively. SOP-Striving, by contrast, was positively related to conscientiousness and predicted higher grades. The SOP-Striving-achievement relation was consistent across grade levels and held even after controlling for individual differences in conscientiousness and neuroticism. In sum, results from this study establish sound psychometric properties for an Italian version of the CAPS, providing support for the dual nature of self-oriented perfectionism among adolescents of different ages."

The function and regulation of nonhistone protein acetylation in synaptic plasticity and learning remain largely unknown. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor, plays critical roles in synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP). During LTP induction, activation of NMDA receptor triggers Ca2+ influx, and the Ca2+ binds with CaM and activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα). In our previous study, we demonstrated that acetylation of CaM was important for synaptic plasticity and fear learning in mice. However, the KAT responsible for CaM acetylation is currently unknown. Here, following an HEK293 cell-based screen of candidate KATs, steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) is identified as the most active KAT for CaM. We further demonstrate that SRC3 interacts with and acetylates CaM in a Ca2+ and NMDA receptor-dependent manner. We also show that pharmacological inhibition or genetic downregulation of SRC3 impairs CaM acetylation, synaptic plasticity, and contextual fear learning in mice. Moreover, the effects of SRC3 inhibition on synaptic plasticity and fear learning could be rescued by 3KQ-CaM, a mutant form of CaM, which mimics acetylation. Together, these observations demonstrate that SRC3 acetylates CaM and regulates synaptic plasticity and learning in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3189078607,"Secretory proteins are important for microbial adaptation and survival in a particular environment. Till date, experimental secretomes have been reported for a few archaea. In this study, we have identified the experimental secretome of Picrophilous torridus and evaluated the efficacy of various signal peptide predictors (SPPs) in identifying signal peptides (SPs) in its experimental secretome. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometric (LC MS) analysis was performed for three independent P . torridus secretome samples and only those proteins which were common in the three experiments were selected for further analysis. Thus, 30 proteins were finally included in this study. Of these, 10 proteins were identified as hypothetical/uncharacterized proteins. Gene Ontology, KEGG and STRING analyses revealed that majority of the sercreted proteins and/or their interacting partners were involved in different metabolic pathways. Also, a few proteins like malate dehydrogenase (Q6L0C3) were multi-functional involved in different metabolic pathways like carbon metabolism, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, biosynthesis of antibiotics, etc. Multi-functionality of the secreted proteins reflects an important aspect of thermoacidophilic adaptation of P . torridus which has the smallest genome (1.5 Mbp) among nonparasitic aerobic microbes. SPPs like, PRED-SIGNAL, SignalP 5.0, PRED-TAT and LipoP 1.0 identified SPs in only a few secreted proteins. This suggests that either these SPPs were insufficient, or N-terminal SPs were absent in majority of the secreted proteins, or there might be alternative mechanisms of protein translocation in P . torridus ."
https://openalex.org/W3192621558,"Root and bark of Limonium axillare (Forssk) Kuntze are used as antidiabetic remedies in parts of East Africa, but this activity has never been fully investigated. To validate its ethnobotanical use, we compared the chemical and pharmacological profiles of the ethanolic extracts of L . axillare root (REE) and aerial parts (AEE). Administration of REE (500 mg kg -1 ) reduced streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia by 44%, restored serum insulin levels, reestablished Glut2 and Glut4 expression and ameliorated pancreatic tissue damage in diabetic rats. In vitro studies revealed a strong radical scavenging effect, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase inhibition activity of REE at IC 50 at 25.2, 44.8 and 89.1μg/mL, respectively. HPLC analysis identified ten phenolic compounds in REE with umbelliferone as the major constituents at 10 ± 0.081 mg/g of extract. Additionally, six compounds were isolated from REE including, β -sitosterol-3-palmitate, β -sitosterol, myricetin and gallic acids with two new tetrahydrofuran monoterpenes; 2-isopropyl- 3,4,4, trimethyl-tetrahydrofuran ( 3 ), and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-tetrahydrofuran-3,4 dicarboxylic acid ( 4 ), the latter was revealed by molecular docking to be a good ligand to glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase a key enzyme in glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W3191429159,"Based on the engineering practice of large cross-section highway tunnel, this paper reveals the space-time coordinated evolution law of the construction mechanical characteristics and deformation distribution of the support structure in the construction by half bench CD method through field test. At the same time, the mechanical response calculation model of the supporting structure in the partial excavation is constructed, and the mechanical characteristics of the support structure in the partial excavation process are analyzed by above mechanical calculation model. Then, the mechanical and deformation distribution of the feet-reinforcement bolt in the steel frame—foot-reinforcement bolt combined support system is analyzed under different levels of surrounding rock load and different structural parameters of the feet-reinforcement bolt. The research results show that: (1) The internal force of the supporting structure changes most obviously during the excavation of Part Ⅰ, Part Ⅱ and Part Ⅲ, and the internal force of the support structure gradually tends to be stable after a slight increase in the excavation of Part Ⅳ and Part Ⅴ; (2) The horizontal deformation and vertical deformation of the support structure mainly occur in the excavation process of Part Ⅰ, Part Ⅱ and Part Ⅲ, and the excavation of Part Ⅳ and Ⅴ has little effect on the deformation response of the structure. The vertical displacement of the supporting structure is larger than the horizontal displacement, and the dynamic response of the temporary diaphragm structure during tunnel excavation is shrinkage-expansion-shrinkage-expansion; (3) The bending strain of each measuring point decreases with the increase of the distance from the loading point, and the bending strain of section 1 and section 2 is much larger than that of the other three sections; (4) With the increase of the angle, the section position with strain close to 0 gradually moves to the deeper position of the bolt, and the axial strain of each section on the bolt gradually changes from positive strain to negative strain."
https://openalex.org/W3193253029,"Searching for new high temperature superconductors has long been a key research issue. Fe-based superconductors attract researchers' attention due to their high transition temperature, strong irreversibility field, and excellent crystallographic symmetry. By using doping methods and dopant levels, different types of new Fe-based superconductors are synthesized. The transition temperature is a key indicator to measure whether new superconductors are high temperature superconductors. However, the condition for measuring transition temperature are strict, and the measurement process is dangerous. There is a strong relationship between the lattice parameters and the transition temperature of Fe-based superconductors. To avoid the difficulties in measuring transition temperature, in this paper, we adopt a machine learning method to build a model based on the lattice parameters to predict the transition temperature of Fe-based superconductors. The model results are in accordance with available transition temperatures, showing 91.181% accuracy. Therefore, we can use the proposed model to predict unknown transition temperatures of Fe-based superconductors."

https://openalex.org/W3187597628,"Purpose Establishing the reliability of a new method to check the mean retinal and choroidal reflectivity and using it to find retinal and choroid changes in amblyopia. Methods Design: Retrospective case-control. Population: 28 subjects of which 10 were healthy controls (20 eyes): 8 with refractive errors, 1 with strabismus, and 1 with both. 18 patients with unilateral amblyopia included: 7 anisometropic, 6 isoametropic, 1 strabismic, and 4 combined. Mean participants’ age: 13.77 years ± 10.28. Observation procedures: SD-OCT and ImageJ. Main outcome measure: mean reflectivity of retinal and choroid layers. Amblyopic, fellow, and healthy eyes were compared. Results The method of measuring reflectivity is good to excellent reliability for all regions of interest except the fourth. The mean reflectivity of the choriocapillaris and Sattler’s layer in amblyopic eyes were significantly lower than in healthy eyes (p = 0.003 and p = 0.008 respectively). The RNFL reflectivity was lower than that of fellow eyes (p = 0.025). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons showed statistically significant differences between amblyopic and healthy eyes for choriocapillaris (p = 0.018) and Sattler’s (p = 0.035), and between amblyopic and fellow eyes for RNFL (p = 0.039). Conclusion A decrease in reflectivity of the choriocapillaris and Sattler’s in amblyopic compared to healthy eyes, and a decrease in reflectivity of the RNFL in the amblyopic compared to fellow eyes, indicate that the pathophysiology is partly peripheral and might be bilateral."
