https://openalex.org/W2003828025,"The reaction rate between atmospheric hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO(2)) is greatly enhanced in the presence of ice particles; HCl dissolves readily into ice, and the collisional reaction probability for ClONO(2) on the surface of ice with HCl in the mole fraction range from approximately 0.003 to 0.010 is in the range from approximately 0.05 to 0.1 for temperatures near 200 K. Chlorine (Cl(2)) is released into the gas phase on a time scale of at most a few milliseconds, whereas nitric acid (HNO(3)), the other product, remains in the condensed phase. This reaction could play an important role in explaining the observed depletion of ozone over Antarctica; it releases photolytically active chlorine from its most abundant reservoir species, and it promotes the formation of HNO(3) and thus removes nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) from the gas phase. Hence it establishes the necessary conditions for the efficient catalytic destruction of ozone by halogenated free radicals. In the absence of HCl, ClONO(2) also reacts irreversibly with ice with a collision efficiency of approximately 0.02 at 200 K; the product hypochlorous acid (HOCI) is released to the gas phase on a time scale of minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2092194749,"Laboratory studies of heterogeneous reactions important for ozone depletion over Antarctica are reported. The reaction of chlorine nitrate (ClONO(2)) with H(2)0 and hydrogen chloride (HCl) on surfaces that simulate polar stratospheric clouds [ice and nitric acid (HNO(3))-ice and sulfuric acid] are studied at temperatures relevant to the Antarctic stratosphere. The reaction of ClONO(2) on ice and certain mixtures of HNO(3) and ice proceeded readily. The sticking coefficient of ClONO(2) on ice of 0.009 +/- 0.002 was observed. A reaction produced gas-phase hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and condensed-phase HNO(3); HOC1 underwent a secondary reaction on ice producing dichlorine monoxide (Cl(2)O). In addition to the reaction with H(2)0, ClONO(2) reacted with HCl on ice to form gas-phase chlorine (Cl(2)) and condensed-phase HNO(3.) Essentially all of the HCl in the bulk of the ice can react with ClONO(2) on the ice surface. The gaseous products of the above reactions, HOCl, Cl(2)0, and Cl(2), could readily photolyze in the Antarctic spring to produce active chlorine for ozone depletion. Furthermore, the formation of condensed-phase HNO(3) could serve as a sink for odd nitrogen species that would otherwise scavenge the active chlorine."

These features are incompatible with the original Alvarez hypothesis of their being caused by a single asteroid impact that produced a world-embracing dust cloud with devastating environmental consequences. By analysis of physical and chemical evidence from the stratigraphic record it is shown that a modified extraterrestrial model in which stepwise extinctions resulted from encounter with a comet shower is less plausible than one intrinsic to the earth, involving significant disturbance in the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2048392324,"The Spacelab-2 Plasma Depletion Experiments were a series of studies to examine shuttle-induced perturbations in the ionosphere and their application to ground-based radio astronomy. The space shuttle Challenger fired its orbital maneuvering subsystem engines on 30 July and 5 August 1985, releasing large amounts of exhaust molecules (water, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide) that caused the electrons and ions in Earth's upper atmosphere to chemically recombine, thereby creating so-called ""ionospheric holes."" Two burns conducted over New England produced ionospheric peak depletions ranging from 25 to 50 percent, affected the ionosphere over a 200-kilometer altitude range, and covered 1 degrees to 2 degrees of latitude. Optical emissions associated with the hole spanned an area of several hundred thousand square kilometers. A third burn was conducted over a low-frequency radio observatory in Hobart, Australia, to create an ""artificial window"" for ground-based observations at frequencies normally below the natural ionospheric cutoff (penetration) frequency. The Hobart experiment succeeded in making high-resolution observations at 1.7 megahertz through the induced ionospheric hole."

La raison de cette disparition est pour l'instant inexpliquee mais un stress ecologique lie a El Nino et a l'elevation de la temperature de l'eau semble fort probable. Certains coraux ont commence a mourir mais il est trop tot pour savoir si ce blanchiment est precurseur d'une mortalite en masse
https://openalex.org/W2051735921,"Numerous examples of metallic alloys have been discovered, the atomic structures of which display an icosahedral symmetry that is impossible for ordinary periodic crystals. Recent experimental results support the hypothesis that the alloys are examples of a new ""quasicrystal"" phase of solid matter. Observed deviations from an ideal quasicrystal structure can be explained as ""phason strains,"" a special class of defects predicted to be the dominant type of imperfection formed during solidification."

https://openalex.org/W2001856322,"In the Southern Ocean, primary production estimated from seasonal chemical and geochemical changes is two to four times greater than the value calculated from carbon-14 uptake. Since carbon uptake had typically been measured only during midday incubations, the influence of diel periodicity of photosynthesis on daily productions was not considered. Phytoplankton from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, exhibited distinct, but seasonally variable diel patterns of light-saturated and light-limited photosynthesis. Maximum photosynthetic capacity occurred about noon in early September, and its occurrence progressively shifted to about midnight by late October. This shift was accompanied by a concomitant phase shift in the occurrence of minimum photosynthetic capacity from midnight to midday. Daily production estimated from time-of-day corrected photosynthetic characteristics and from 24-hour incubations was 2.5 to 4 times greater than that predicted from 6-hour midday incubations. If similar diel periodicity in photosynthesis occurs in other polar oceans, primary production would be significantly higher than previously estimated from carbon-14 uptake measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1995785193,"The flight of the Solar Optical Universal Polarimeter on Spacelab-2 provided the opportunity for the collection of time sequences of diffraction-limited (0.5 are second) solar images with excellent pointing stability (0.003 are second) and with freedom from the distortion that plagues ground-based images. A series of white-light images of active region 4682 were obtained on 5 August 1985, and the area containing the sunspot has been analyzed. These data have been digitally processed to remove noise and to separate waves from low-velocity material motions. The results include (i) proper motion measurements of a radial outflow in the photospheric granulation pattern just outside the penumbra; (ii) discovery of occasional bright structures (""streakers"") that appear to be ejected outward from the penumbra; (iii) broad dark ""clouds"" moving outward in the penumbra, in addition to the well-known bright penumbral grains moving inward; (iv) apparent extensions and contractions of penumbral filaments over the photosphere; and (v) observation of a faint bubble or looplike structure that seems to expand from two bright penumbral filaments into the photosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2083858100,The High Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph was flown on the Spacelab-2 shuttle mission to perform extended observations of the solar chromosphere and transition zone at high spatial and temporal resolution. Ultraviolet spectroheliograms show the temporal development of macrospicules at the solar limb. The C IV transition zone emission is produced in discrete emission elements that must be composed of exceedingly fine (less than 70 kilometers) subresolution structures.
