https://openalex.org/W2108508060,"A method is presented for analytically calculating a smooth, three-dimensional contour about a molecule. The molecular surface envelope may be drawn on either color raster computer displays or real-time vector computer graphics systems. Molecular areas and volumes may be computed analytically from this surface representation. Unlike most previous computer graphics representations of molecules, which imitate wire models or space-filling plastic spheres, this surface shows only the atoms that are accessible to solvent. This analytical method extends the earlier dot surface numerical algorithm, which has been applied in enzymology, rational drug design, immunology, and understanding DNA base sequence recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2030078771,"Neuronal systems involved in the initiation of cocaine reinforcement were investigated by identifying brain sites where direct application of the drug was reinforcing. This was accomplished by allowing rats to self-administer picomolar concentrations of cocaine into discrete brain regions. The medial prefrontal cortex supported self-administration, while the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area did not. Self-administration could be attenuated by including equimolar concentrations of the dopaminergic D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride in the microinjection system. These results imply that cocaine reinforcement is mediated in part through a direct action on mesocortical dopaminergic receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2094618026,The missing link in the evidence for an active endogenous renin angiotensin system in the brain has been the demonstration of local angiotensin synthesis in the central nervous system in vivo. In this report the extraction and characterization of angiotensin I and angiotensin II from the brain of rats is described. The accumulation of angiotensin I was enhanced in hypertensive rats when the conversion to angiotensin II was blocked in vivo by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril.

Such macrophages in the presence of murine immunoglobulin G2a monoclonal antibodies to tumors mediated the killing of tumor cells in vitro. These data suggest that monoclonal antibodies of the G2a subclass may be useful in the immunotherapy of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2110901838,"Ground water contamination is of increasing concern in the United States because about 50 percent of our drinking water comes from well water. The causes of contamination stem from both point sources and nonpoint sources. Since ground water moves slowly, the contaminant may affect only a small portion of an aquifer for a considerable period of time. Deleterious effects on human health have resulted from pathogenic organisms in ground water and from its toxic chemical composition. It is difficult to estimate the extent of contamination on a national basis as the frequency of instances of contamination is very variable. Remedial actions to clean up aquifers are difficult, expensive, and sometimes not feasible. Many of the laws and regulations that control ground water contamination are designed with other main objectives."

https://openalex.org/W1487942148,"After 5 weeks in secondary culture, chondrocytes derived from specific regions of the embryonic chick tibiotarsus secrete greater than 90% of their culture medium collagen as a short chain (SC) collagen. Quantities of the molecule, sufficient for biochemical characterization, were isolated without proteolytic treatment from the medium of such mass cell cultures. The chains, Mr = 59,000, of SC collagen are cleaved to Mr = 45,000 by limited pepsin digestion of the native molecule. These two forms of SC collagen are referred to as the 59K form and the 45K form. The CD spectrum of the 59K form confirms the presence of a triple helical domain within the molecule. The amino acid composition of the two forms of SC collagen show it to be different from any other known collagen, including the short chain collagens that have been isolated by the proteolytic extraction of cartilages. The most characteristic features of SC collagen are its high content of methionine, low level of arginine, and a lack of cysteine. The amino acid composition of the 45K form shows it to be the collagenous domain, while the differences between the 45K and 59K form presumably reflect the composition of the nonhelical domain of the 59K form. The nonhelical domain contains greatly elevated levels of aromatic amino acids which contribute to the hydrophobic character of this domain."

https://openalex.org/W1488875751,"Chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage has been shown to contain three different proteoglycan species (PG-H, PG-Lb, and PG-Lt). This report is concerned with the purification and characterization of the third proteoglycan, PG-Lt. The proteoglycan can be separated from the other two by virtue of its low buoyant density in a CsCl density gradient and further purified by consecutive ion exchange and gel chromatography. The final preparation is composed of PG-Lt monomer and PG-Lt oligomer. The amino acid composition of PG-Lt is quite different from that of PG-H and PG-Lb and rather resembles that of collagens with respect to high content of glycine and high degrees of hydroxylation of proline and lysine. PG-Lt monomer is composed of disulfide-bonded subunits of Mr congruent to 120,000 and 190,000 as demonstrated by its gel electrophoretic behavior after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. The latter, but not the former, contains dermatan sulfate chains with glucuronic acid/iduronic acid residues and yields a protein-enriched core molecule of Mr congruent to 100,000 after digestion with chondroitinase ABC. Both of the protein subunits are completely digestible with bacterial collagenase. Immunofluorescence microscopic examination of cartilage tissues, using an antibody against PG-Lt, shows that this proteoglycan exists in both the cartilage matrix and perichondrial noncartilagenous region. When chondrocytes are plated onto tissue culture dishes, the antibody stains strands found on the cell surfaces and in the intercellular space of substrate-attached cell layers, suggesting that PG-Lt mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate contacts."

https://openalex.org/W1497150657,"2-Methyl-branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity from rat liver mitochondria. The native molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 170,000 by gel filtration. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis both with and without 2-mercaptoethanol, the enzyme showed a single protein band with Mr = 41,500, suggesting that this enzyme is composed of four subunits of equal size. Its isoelectric point was 5.50 +/- 0.2, and A1%280 nm was 12.5. This enzyme contained protein-bound FAD. The purified enzyme dehydrogenated S-2-methylbutyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA with equal activity. The activities with each of these compounds were co-purified throughout the entire purification procedure. This enzyme also dehydrogenated R-2-methylbutyryl-CoA, but the specific activity was considerably lower (22%) than that for the S-enantiomer. The enzyme did not dehydrogenate other acyl-CoAs, including isovaleryl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA, at any significant rate. Apparent Km and Vmax values for S-2-methylbutyryl-CoA were 20 microM and 2.2 mumol min-1 mg-1, respectively, while those for isobutyryl-CoA were 89 microM and 2.0 mumol min-1 mg-1 using phenazine methosulfate as an artificial electron acceptor. The enzyme was also active with electron transfer flavoprotein. Tiglyl-CoA and methacrylyl-CoA were identified as the reaction products from S-2-methylbutyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Ethylacrylyl-CoA was produced from R-2-methylbutyryl-CoA. Tiglyl-CoA competitively inhibited the activity with both S-2-methylbutyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA with a similar Ki. The enzyme activity was also severely inhibited by several organic sulfhydryl reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and methyl mercury iodide. The pattern and degree of inhibition were essentially identical for both substrates. The purified 2-methyl-branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was immunologically distinct from isovaleryl-CoA-, short chain acyl-CoA-, medium chain acyl-CoA-, or long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1575542562,"The interactions of the carboxyl group of oleic acid with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied by 13C NMR spectroscopy at 50.3 MHz using 90% isotopically substituted [1-13C]oleic acid. 13C NMR spectra were obtained as a function of the mole ratio of oleic acid to BSA (from 0.5-10.0) and, for selected mole ratios, as a function of pH (between pH 3.0 and 10.6) and temperature (between 15 and 55 degrees C and thermally denatured at 95 degrees C). Except for spectra of highly acidic (pH less than or equal to 3.9) and denatured samples, spectra of oleic acid/BSA complexes showed multiple narrow resonances from the oleic acid carboxyl carbon in a region (179-184 ppm) downfield from protein carbonyl and carboxyl carbon resonances. At low oleic acid/BSA ratios (0.5 and 1.0), at least two oleic acid carboxyl carbon peaks were observed; at high ratios (greater than or equal to 3.0), at least four peaks were present. The intensities of individual peaks, but not their chemical shifts, varied with the oleic acid/BSA ratio. The chemical shift of individual oleic acid peaks was invariant between pH 6.0 and 10.6; below pH 6.0, one of the oleic acid resonances exhibited an NMR titration curve with an apparent pKa of approximately 4. Thus, BSA binding sites for oleic acid are heterogeneous as monitored by the magnetic microenvironment of the oleic acid carboxyl carbon. The number of different oleic acid environments and the relative population of oleic acid molecules in these environments is dependent on the mole ratio of oleic acid/BSA. Our results suggested that the anionic form of oleic acid is bound to BSA at physiological pH and that the multiplicity of NMR peaks for [1-13C]oleic acid resulted from, at least in part, different electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the oleic acid carboxyl group and specific amino acid residues of BSA."

These findings support the idea that chronically elevated saccharin intake may cause increased release and utilization of endogenous opiates.

The mean incidence in age- and sex-matched controls was 2.1 X 10(-4), so approximately eight times the normal number of 6-thioguanine-resistant lymphocytes were detected in Bloom's syndrome blood. The basis for this increase is unknown, but the inherent genomic instability demonstrated in the form of chromosomal aberrations is one possible explanation."

The latent enzyme had Mr approximately 130,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Upon proteinase treatment (trypsin or endogenous proteinase), the latent form is converted to an active form Mr approximately 87,000.

https://openalex.org/W1637943476,"Three different molecular species of proteoglycan (designated PG-H, PG-Lb, and PG-Lt) have been isolated from chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage. PG-H is a major proteoglycan of the tissue and identical, or nearly identical, with so-called cartilage-characteristic proteoglycan previously described in mammalian and avian cartilages. The third proteoglycan, PG-Lt, differs from the other two in containing disulfide-bonded collagenous polypeptides (Noro, A., Kimata, K., Oike, Y., Shinomura, T., Maeda, N., Yano, S., Takahashi, N., and Suzuki, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9323-9331). The second proteoglycan, PG-Lb, consists of a core protein with Mr congruent to 52,000 dermatan sulfate copolymer chains with glucuronic acid/iduronic acid residues. Upon chondroitinase ABC digestion, the proteoglycan yields a protein-enriched core fraction of Mr congruent to 43,000. Its amino acid composition, tryptic peptide profile, and immunochemical properties indicate that PG-Lb is distinctly different from PG-H and PG-Lt in core protein structure. PG-Lb shows no specific binding with hyaluronic acid. Pulse-chase experiments with [3H]serine indicate that PG-Lb is first synthesized as a precursor form (pro-PG-Lb) that can be distinguished from PG-Lb by the production of a core molecule of Mr congruent to 52,000 after chondroitinase ABC digestion. This core molecule is labeled when [2-3H]mannose is used as a precursor, suggesting that it contains a glycoprotein type oligosaccharide. Since the core molecule from pro-PG-Lb is significantly larger in molecular weight than that from PG-Lb, the conversion of pro-PG-Lb to PG-Lb should involve scission of the polypeptide or possibly removal of mannose-containing oligosaccharide chain."

Horseradish peroxidase, infused systemically into the host, was exuded from the graft's vessels into the graft's extracellular stroma within 1 minute. At later times the glycoprotein reached the extracellular clefts of adjacent brain tissue, the vessels of which appeared to retain their impermeability. The blood-brain barrier to horseradish peroxide was thus bypassed where the extracellular compartments of graft and brain became confluent. The graft of autonomic ganglia can serve as a portal through which peptides, hormones, and immunoglobulins may likewise enter the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1543334276,"Energy deprivation, induced in thyroid slices by incubation with an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) or inhibitors of respiration (N2 or antimycin A), led to a disturbance in oligosaccharide-lipid metabolism which was characterized by a pronounced depletion of the glucosylated (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) dolichyl pyrophosphoryl saccharide with an attendant accumulation of the Man9GlcNAc2 and, to a lesser extent, the Man8GlcNAc2 lipid-linked species. A concomitant decrease in the N-glycosylation of proteins was furthermore observed. The distribution of lipid-derived oligosaccharides observed by thin layer chromatographic separation was similar whether radiolabeling was achieved by a metabolic ([14C]glucose or [2-3H]mannose incubation) or chemical ([3H]NaBH4) procedure. The latter method proved useful for measuring the levels of individual oligosaccharide-lipids in unincubated tissue, and in this way it was found that unless thyroid was rapidly frozen or immediately immersed in oxygenated medium a marked decrease of glucose-containing oligosaccharide-lipids occurred which could, however, be reversed by a short incubation. The addition of glucose to the slice incubations did not prevent the Man8-9GlcNAc2 accumulation brought about by the inhibitors of energy production, nor did it alter the oligosaccharide-lipid pattern of uninhibited slices. The effect of the inhibitors on metabolically labeled liver slices was similar to that observed in thyroid. The size of the total chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3)-extractable oligosaccharide-lipid pool (Glc3-Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2) of thyroid remained quite constant (about 2 nmol/g) regardless of the energy state, and no substantial change in the level of smaller oligosaccharide-lipids, primarily represented by Man2GlcNAc2 (0.5 nmol/g) was evident. Moreover, no change in the total pool sizes was observed in puromycin-treated slices. The possible mechanisms by which energy deprivation leads to an accumulation of the glucose-free oligosaccharide-lipids are evaluated. While it is likely that a selective impairment of glucosylation of newly formed molecules occurs, it is also possible that an imbalance occurs in a postulated glucosyltransferase-glucosidase shuttle with a trapping of the oligosaccharide-lipid in its unglucosylated form."

https://openalex.org/W1521604330,"The avian erythrocyte anion exchange protein (band 3), after labeling with [3H2]4,4'-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid appears as a doublet of polypeptide chains with apparent Mr = 105,000 and 100,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The structures of the two species are almost identical as determined by partial proteolysis. The copy number of band 3 molecules per chicken erythrocyte was determined to be 800,000 by quantitating the amount of [3H2]4,4'-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid covalently bound to the cell surface. A comparison of human and chicken band 3 has revealed differences in their structure. Chicken band 3 differs from the human polypeptide in isoelectric point and proteolytic patterns. Antisera raised against human and chicken band 3 do not cross-react, implying that the two sera do not recognize any common antigenic determinants. There is a 6.5-fold lower activity per cell in the rate of phosphate exchange in the chicken erythrocyte which can be entirely explained by the 1.5-fold decrease in copy number per cell and the increased size of the chicken erythrocyte. This would suggest that there is no difference in the enzyme turnover number between chicken and human band 3. A major functional difference resulting from the structural differences is the inability to bind glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a function associated with the NH2 terminus of human band 3."
https://openalex.org/W1574044113,"Abstract Calcium plus calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent protein kinase activity was demonstrated in subcellular fractions from Torpedo californica electric organ. A protein kinase activity dependent on Ca2+/CaM was purified about 200-fold from electric organ cytosol using DEAE-cellulose and CaM-affinity chromatography. The most effective exogenous substrates for this enzyme were the synapse-specific protein Synapsin I (Protein I) and histone f3. Phosphorylase b, skeletal muscle myosin light chains, casein, phosvitin, histone f2b, and G-substrate were relatively poorly phosphorylated by Torpedo CaM-protein kinase. Thus, the enzyme differs in its substrate specificity from known cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, myosin light chain kinase and phosphorylase kinase. The Km for ATP was 15-20 microM; for Synapsin I, 0.8 microM; and for CaM, 85 nM. Two major endogenous substrates (Mr = 62,000 and 54,000) for CaM-protein kinase co-purified with the enzyme through the CaM-affinity column step. These two substrates, as well as the enzyme, were present in other subcellular fractions in addition to the cytosol, including crude membranes and purified synaptic vesicles. A third major substrate (Mr = 39,000) could be separated from the enzyme during purification and appeared to be localized primarily in the cytosol. CaM-protein kinase increased the phosphorylation of both serine and threonine residues in endogenous substrates. In contrast to previous reports, no evidence for Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphorylation of any subunit of the acetylcholine receptor was obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1556415922,"The biosynthesis and processing of pea lectin was studied in developing pea cotyledons by a combination of pulse-chase experiments using 14C-aminoacids and subcellular fractionation of the homogenates. Lectin polypeptides were isolated on immunoaffinity gels and fractionated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels followed by fluorography. Whether made in vivo or in an in vitro chain completion system containing polysomes still attached to microsomal membranes, newly synthesized lectin had an Mr of 23,000. In vivo labeling showed that radioactive lectin first associates with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is then sequestered into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Pulse-chase experiments showed that it is chased out of the endoplasmic reticulum considerably more slowly than the storage proteins and accumulates in the protein bodies, initially as a polypeptide of Mr = 23,000. This pro-lectin is processed in the protein bodies to its mature form with polypeptides of Mr = 17,000 and 6,000. Pea lectin is synthesized throughout the protein accumulation phase of seed formation with maximum levels of synthesis and of mRNA approximately half-way through this period."

https://openalex.org/W1490289023,"Abstract Catalytic reaction of the 2', 3'-dialdehyde analog of TPN (oTPN) with pig heart TPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in the presence of the substrate manganous isocitrate results in the formation of the dialdehyde derivative of TPNH (oTPNH). In the absence of the substrate, modification by oTPN leads to a progressive inactivation of the enzyme. The dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constants on the reagent concentration indicates the formation of a reversible complex with the enzyme prior to covalent modification (kmax = 5.5 X 10(-2) min-1; K1 = 290 microM). Reaction of [14C]oTPN with the enzyme results in the incorporation of 2 mol of oTPN/mol of peptide chain. No appreciable protection against either inactivation or incorporation by the natural ligands TPN and TPNH was obtained, suggesting different modes of binding of the analog in the presence and absence of the substrate isocitrate. Enzymatically synthesized oTPNH has been isolated and demonstrated to act as an affinity label for a TPNH-binding site of isocitrate dehydrogenase. The inactivation process exhibits saturation kinetics (kmax = 2.67 X 10(-3) min-1; K1 = 33 microM). Protection against activity loss, as well as a decrease in incorporation from 2 to 1 eq of [14C]oTPNH bound/peptide chain was observed in the presence of 1 mM TPNH. From the TPNH concentration dependence of the inactivation rate by oTPNH, a dissociation constant of 3.4 microM is calculated for TPNH, indicating binding of the analog to a specific TPNH-binding site on the enzyme. Although dialdehyde derivatives are frequently assumed to form Schiff bases with proteins, the evidence presented suggests the formation of morpholino derivatives as the products of the covalent reaction of isocitrate dehydrogenase with the dialdehyde derivatives of TPN and TPNH. The new reagent, oTPNH, may serve as an affinity label for other dehydrogenases."

https://openalex.org/W1529094716,"Fractionation of human blood platelets has revealed that myosin, a contractile and mechanochemical protein, is present in both the soluble and particulate fraction. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether platelets contain more than one myosin isoform, especially in view of the fact that in other cellular systems (cardiac muscle, amoeba) several myosin isoenzymes were found. The particulate fraction was solubilized by Triton X-100, and the myosin was purified by the same procedure used for the cytoplasmic myosin. The final preparation contained, in addition to myosin, a 130-kDa polypeptide, which was observed also in myosin preparations obtained from the soluble fraction. The electrophoretic mobilities of the two myosins were identical under both dissociating and nondissociating conditions. Comparison of the molecular structure of the heavy chain of the two myosins by limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease showed that the proteolytic fragments of the two myosins were rather similar, with only minor alterations in the quantitative distribution of the products. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of the iodinated tryptic peptides of the myosin heavy chains indicated that at least one peptide is missing in the map of the particulate myosin, as compared to its soluble counterpart. According to the two-dimensional peptide map, the 130-kDa polypeptide seems to be a proteolytic fragment of the myosin heavy chain and most probably the rod portion of the molecule. The observed minor variations in the structure of myosins isolated from the soluble and the fractions of human platelets may reflect differences in their respective physiological functions."

Of the two, one form crystallizes in a unit cell of symmetry F432 with parameters a = b = c = 128.0 A, and diffracts at least to 2.6-A resolution. Each of the 96 asymmetric units contains one protein molecule, and has a solvent content of 60% by volume. The other form is of space group P4132 or P4332 with the unit-cell edge 87.1 A, and diffracts barely to 3-A spacings. The unit cell is composed of 24 asymmetric units, each of which probably also contains one molecule and has a solvent content of 69% by volume. The former cubic form appears to be more suitable for x-ray study than the latter in terms of stability and the extent of diffraction."
https://openalex.org/W1590796303,"We are studying the fate of alpha-mannosidase, a lysosomal enzyme, in Dictyostelium discoideum. alpha-Mannosidase is synthesized as a 150,000-dalton precursor which becomes proteolytically cleaved to mature (56,000-62,000 dalton) forms. When cells are shifted into starvation buffer (5 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), the enzyme is secreted. We compared the kinetics of secretion of newly processed alpha-mannosidase with that of bulk forms. After 2 h in phosphate buffer less than 20% of the newly processed forms but as much as 50% of the bulk enzyme activity was secreted. During the course of the experiments, the total alpha-mannosidase activity remains constant, cells remain viable, and there is no evidence of degradation of enzyme. Furthermore, a 4-h chase period prior to starvation is required before the newly processed forms are secreted to the same extent as the bulk forms. On the basis of these results we propose that the enzyme is present in at least two pools and that it is transferred from a newly processed to an efficiently secreted pool."
