https://openalex.org/W3179557623,"<h2>Summary</h2> Diet modulates the gut microbiome, which in turn can impact the immune system. Here, we determined how two microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber and fermented foods, influence the human microbiome and immune system in healthy adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study (n = 18/arm) combined with -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we found diet-specific effects. The high-fiber diet increased microbiome-encoded glycan-degrading carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) despite stable microbial community diversity. Although cytokine response score (primary outcome) was unchanged, three distinct immunological trajectories in high-fiber consumers corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the high-fermented-food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and population-wide insight. Fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in industrialized society."

However, the relative impacts of vaccine coverage, effectiveness, and capacity in the context of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask use and physical distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are unclear. Our objective was to examine the impact of vaccination on the control of SARS-CoV-2 using our previously developed agent-based simulation model.We applied our agent-based model to replicate COVID-19-related events in 1) Dane County, Wisconsin; 2) Milwaukee metropolitan area, Wisconsin; 3) New York City (NYC). We evaluated the impact of vaccination considering the proportion of the population vaccinated, probability that a vaccinated individual gains immunity, vaccination capacity, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. We estimated the timing of pandemic control, defined as the date after which only a small number of new cases occur.The timing of pandemic control depends highly on vaccination coverage, effectiveness, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. In Dane County and Milwaukee, if 50% of the population is vaccinated with a daily vaccination capacity of 0.25% of the population, vaccine effectiveness of 90%, and the adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions is 60%, controlled spread could be achieved by June 2021 versus October 2021 in Dane County and November 2021 in Milwaukee without vaccine.In controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of vaccination varies widely depending not only on effectiveness and coverage, but also concurrent adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3177552861,"The integral membrane protein ATG9A plays a key role in autophagy. It displays a broad intracellular distribution and is present in numerous compartments, including the plasma membrane (PM). The reasons for the distribution of ATG9A to the PM and its role at the PM are not understood. Here, we show that ATG9A organizes, in concert with IQGAP1, components of the ESCRT system and uncover cooperation between ATG9A, IQGAP1 and ESCRTs in protection from PM damage. ESCRTs and ATG9A phenocopied each other in protection against PM injury. ATG9A knockouts sensitized the PM to permeabilization by a broad spectrum of microbial and endogenous agents, including gasdermin, MLKL and the MLKL-like action of coronavirus ORF3a. Thus, ATG9A engages IQGAP1 and the ESCRT system to maintain PM integrity."
https://openalex.org/W3181092437,"Ficus carica L., commonly known as fig, has been used in traditional medicine for metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and cancer. Various bioactive compounds have been previously isolated from the leaves, fruit, and bark, which have different pharmacological properties, but the anticancer mechanisms of this plant are not known. In the current study we focused on understanding the probable mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of F. carica plant extracts by molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches. We evaluated the drug-likeness of the active constituents of the plant and explored its binding affinity with selected anticancer drug target receptors such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK-2), cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK-6), topoisomerase-I (Topo I), topoisomerase-II (Topo II), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). In silico toxicity studies revealed that thirteen molecules out of sixty-eight major active compounds in the plant extract have acceptable drug-like properties. Compound 37 (β-bourbonene) has a good binding affinity with the majority of drug targets, as revealed by molecular docking studies. The complexes of the lead molecules with the drug receptors were stable in terms of molecular dynamics simulation derived parameters such as root mean square deviation and radius of gyration. The top ten residues contributing significantly to the binding free energies were deciphered through analysis of molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA). Thus, the results of our studies unravel the potential of F. carica bioactive compounds as anticancer candidate molecules against selected macromolecular receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3179495764,"Due to difficulty in early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related to cost and differentiated capability, it is necessary to identify low-cost, accessible, and reliable tools for identifying AD risk in the preclinical stage. We hypothesized that cognitive ability, as expressed in the vocal features in daily conversation, is associated with AD progression. Thus, we have developed a novel machine learning prediction model to identify AD risk by using the rich voice data collected from daily conversations, and evaluated its predictive performance in comparison with a classification method based on the Japanese version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-J). We used 1,465 audio data files from 99 Healthy controls (HC) and 151 audio data files recorded from 24 AD patients derived from a dementia prevention program conducted by Hachioji City, Tokyo, between March and May 2020. After extracting vocal features from each audio file, we developed machine-learning models based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR), using each audio file as one observation. We evaluated the predictive performance of the developed models by describing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the areas under the curve (AUCs), sensitivity, and specificity. Further, we conducted classifications by considering each participant as one observation, computing the average of their audio files’ predictive value, and making comparisons with the predictive performance of the TICS-J based questionnaire. Of 1,616 audio files in total, 1,308 (81.0%) were randomly allocated to the training data and 308 (19.1%) to the validation data. For audio file-based prediction, the AUCs for XGboost, RF, and LR were 0.863 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.794–0.931), 0.882 (95% CI: 0.840–0.924), and 0.893 (95%CI: 0.832–0.954), respectively. For participant-based prediction, the AUC for XGboost, RF, LR, and TICS-J were 1.000 (95%CI: 1.000–1.000), 1.000 (95%CI: 1.000–1.000), 0.972 (95%CI: 0.918–1.000) and 0.917 (95%CI: 0.918–1.000), respectively. There was difference in predictive accuracy of XGBoost and TICS-J with almost approached significance (p = 0.065). Our novel prediction model using the vocal features of daily conversations demonstrated the potential to be useful for the AD risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3179917918,"To develop a fine-grained phenomenological analysis of ""pure awareness"" experiences in meditators.An online survey in five language versions (German, English, French, Spanish, Italian) collected data from January to March 2020. A total of 92 questionnaire items on a visual analogue scale were submitted to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.Out of 3627 submitted responses, 1403 were usable. Participants had a median age of 52 years (range: 17-88) and were evenly split between men and women (48.5% vs 50.0%). The majority of meditators practiced regularly (77.3%), were free of diagnosed mental disorders (92.4%) and did not regularly use any psychoactive substances (84.0%). Vipassana (43.9%) followed by Zen (34.9%) were the most frequently practiced meditation techniques. German (63.4%) and English (31.4%) were by far the most frequent questionnaire languages. A solution with 12 factors explaining 44% of the total variance was deemed optimal under joint conceptual and statistical considerations. The factors were named ""Time, Effort and Desire,"" ""Peace, Bliss and Silence,"" ""Self-Knowledge, Autonomous Cognizance and Insight,"" ""Wakeful Presence,"" ""Pure Awareness in Dream and Sleep,"" ""Luminosity,"" ""Thoughts and Feelings,"" ""Emptiness and Non-egoic Self-awareness,"" ""Sensory Perception in Body and Space,"" ""Touching World and Self,"" ""Mental Agency,"" and ""Witness Consciousness."" This factor structure fit the data moderately well.We have previously posited a phenomenological prototype for the experience of ""pure awareness"" as it occurs in the context of meditation practice. Here we offer a tentative 12-factor model to describe its phenomenal character in a fine-grained way. The current findings are in line with an earlier study extracting semantic constraints for a working definition of minimal phenomenal experience."
https://openalex.org/W3180614888,"Postoperative delirium (POD) is a well-recognized postoperative complication and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether the preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could be an effective predictor of POD after head and neck free-flap reconstruction. This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. We analyzed the perioperative data of patients who had undergone elective head and neck free-flap reconstruction surgery. POD was assessed with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) during admission to our intensive care unit (ICU). POD was defined as an ICDSC score ≥4. Risk factors for POD were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. We included 97 patients. The incidence of POD was 20.6% (20/97). Significantly longer ICU stays were observed in the patients with POD compared to those without POD (median [interquartile range]: 5 [4–6] vs. 4 [4–5], p = 0.031). Higher preoperative NLR values (3 &lt;NLR ≤4 and 4 &lt;NLR) were significantly associated with higher ICDSC scores compared to NLR ≤1 (4 [2–4] vs. 1 [1–1], p = 0.027 and 4 [1–4] vs. 1 [1–1], p = 0.038, respectively). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that only a preoperative NLR &gt;3.0 (adjusted Odds Ratio: 23.6, 95% Confidence Interval: 6.6–85.1; p&lt;0.001) was independently associated with POD. The multivariate area under the receiver operator curve was significantly greater for the E-PRE-DELIRIC model with NLR compared to the E-PRE-DELIRIC model (0.87 vs. 0.60; p&lt;0.001). The preoperative NLR may be a good predictor of POD in patients undergoing head and neck free-flap reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W3181918596,"Background The efficacy of testing and tracing programs to reduce COVID-19 transmission hinges not only on widespread access to testing, but also on the public’s willingness to participate in them. To the extent that testing intentions are patterned by social determinants of health, this constitutes an understudied mechanism of disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Design Using data from a representative household probability sample, the Person to Person Health Interview Study (n = 935), sociodemographic, economic, and psychological determinants of testing considerations were evaluated across six domains: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others. Results Findings demonstrated significant differences in testing motivations across race/ethnicity, education level, socioeconomic status, and worry about self and loved ones. Notably, Black (p&lt;0.01) and Latino (p&lt;0.05) respondents and those experiencing financial strain (p&lt;0.001) were disproportionately likely to indicate that resource factors would influence their decision to get tested. Desire to reduce transmission and concern about proximity to the infected were reported among those who expressed COVID-19 worries (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Public health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic must address social, economic, and psychological factors that enable and constrain individual behavior. Increasing access to preventative interventions and technologies, including vaccines, is unlikely to markedly reduce morbidity and mortality without effective messaging and economic support to improve uptake in vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W3177497841,"Classroom-based active breaks are a feasible and effective way to reduce and break up sitting time, and to potentially benefit physical health in school children. However, the effect of active breaks on children's cognitive functions and brain activity remains unclear.We investigated the impact of an active break intervention on typically developing children's cognitive functions and brain activity, sitting/standing/stepping, on-task behaviour, and enjoyment.Up to 141 children, aged between 6 and 8 years (46% girls), were included, although about half of them completed two of the assessments (n = 77, working memory; n = 67, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex haemodynamic response). Classrooms from two consenting schools were randomly allocated to a six-week simple or cognitively engaging active break intervention. Classrooms from another school acted as a control group. The main analyses used linear mixed models, clustered at the class level and adjusted for sex and age, to investigate the effects of the interventions on response inhibition, lapses of attention, working memory, event-related brain haemodynamic response (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). The mediating effects of sitting/standing/stepping on cognition/brain activity were also explored. To test intervention fidelity, we investigated differences by group on the change values in children's sitting, standing, and moving patterns during class/school time using linear mixed models. Generalized linear mixed models clustered at the individual level were used to examine on-task behaviour data. For the intervention groups only, we also assessed children's perceived enjoyment, physical exertion and mental exertion related to the active breaks and compared the results using independent t-tests.There was a significantly greater positive change in the proportion of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of children assigned to cognitively engaging active breaks compared to the control group (B = 1.53 × 10-07, 95% CI [0.17 × 10-07, 2.90 × 10-07]), which under the same cognitive performance is suggestive of improved neural efficiency. Mixed models showed no significant effects on response inhibition, lapses of attention, working memory. The mediation analysis revealed that the active breaks positively affected response inhibition via a change in sitting and standing time. The sitting, standing, and moving patterns and on-task behaviour were positively affected by the active breaks at end of trial, but not at mid-trial. Children in both intervention groups showed similarly high levels of enjoyment of active breaks.Cognitively engaging active breaks may improve brain efficiency in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the neural substrate of executive functions, as well as response inhibition, via effects partially mediated by the change in sitting/stepping time. Active breaks can effectively reduce sitting and increase standing/stepping and improve on-task behaviour, but the regular implementation of these activities might require time for teachers to become familiar with. Further research is needed to confirm what type of active break best facilitates cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3178497052,"The current global pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 has pushed the limits of global health systems across all aspects of clinical care, including laboratory diagnostics. Supply chain disruptions and rapidly-shifting markets have resulted in flash-scarcity of commercial laboratory reagents; this has motivated health care providers to search for alternative workflows to cope with the international increase in demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The aim of this study is to present a reproducible workflow for real time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing using OT-2 open-source liquid-handling robots (Opentrons, NY). We have developed a framework that includes a code template which is helpful for building different stand-alone robotic stations, capable of performing specific protocols. Such stations can be combined together to create a complex multi-stage workflow, from sample setup to real time RT-PCR. Using our open-source code, it is easy to create new stations or workflows from scratch, adapt existing templates to update the experimental protocols, or to fine-tune the code to fit specific needs. Using this framework, we developed the code for two different workflows and evaluated them using external quality assessment (EQA) samples from the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN). The affordability of this platform makes automated SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing accessible for most laboratories and hospitals with qualified bioinformatics personnel. This platform also allows for flexibility, as it is not dependent on any specific commercial kit, and thus it can be quickly adapted to protocol changes, reagent, consumable shortages, or any other temporary material constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3179229242,"Reducing the mechanical load on the human body through simulated reduced gravity can reveal important insight into locomotion biomechanics. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of simulated reduced gravity on muscle activation levels and lower limb biomechanics across a range of overground walking speeds. Our overall hypothesis was that muscle activation amplitudes would not decrease proportionally to gravity level. We recruited 12 participants (6 female, 6 male) to walk overground at 1.0, 0.76, 0.55, and 0.31 G for four speeds: 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 ms-1. We found that peak ground reaction forces, peak knee extension moment in early stance, peak hip flexion moment, and peak ankle extension moment all decreased substantially with reduced gravity. The peak knee extension moment at late stance/early swing did not change with gravity. The effect of gravity on muscle activity amplitude varied considerably with muscle and speed, often varying nonlinearly with gravity level. Quadriceps (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, & vastus medialis) and medial gastrocnemius activity decreased in stance phase with reduced gravity. Soleus and lateral gastrocnemius activity had no statistical differences with gravity level. Tibialis anterior and biceps femoris increased with simulated reduced gravity in swing and stance phase, respectively. The uncoupled relationship between simulated gravity level and muscle activity have important implications for understanding biomechanical muscle functions during human walking and for the use of bodyweight support for gait rehabilitation after injury."
https://openalex.org/W3181337054,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with abnormal brain development during fetal life. Overall, increasing evidence indicates an important role of epigenetic dysfunction in ASD. The placenta is critical to and produces neurotransmitters that regulate fetal brain development. We hypothesized that placental DNA methylation changes are a feature of the fetal development of the autistic brain and importantly could help to elucidate the early pathogenesis and prediction of these disorders. Genome-wide methylation using placental tissue from the full-term autistic disorder subtype was performed using the Illumina 450K array. The study consisted of 14 cases and 10 control subjects. Significantly epigenetically altered CpG loci (FDR p-value <0.05) in autism were identified. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was further used to identify molecular pathways that were over-represented (epigenetically dysregulated) in autism. Six Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms including Deep Learning (DL) to determine the predictive accuracy of CpG markers for autism detection. We identified 9655 CpGs differentially methylated in autism. Among them, 2802 CpGs were inter- or non-genic and 6853 intragenic. The latter involved 4129 genes. AI analysis of differentially methylated loci appeared highly accurate for autism detection. DL yielded an AUC (95% CI) of 1.00 (1.00-1.00) for autism detection using intra- or intergenic markers by themselves or combined. The biological functional enrichment showed, four significant functions that were affected in autism: quantity of synapse, microtubule dynamics, neuritogenesis, and abnormal morphology of neurons. In this preliminary study, significant placental DNA methylation changes. AI had high accuracy for the prediction of subsequent autism development in newborns. Finally, biologically functional relevant gene pathways were identified that may play a significant role in early fetal neurodevelopmental influences on later cognition and social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3182116042,"The proliferation of internet-based home-sharing platforms like Airbnb has raised heated debates, with many in the general public believing that the presence of Airbnb listings can lead to an increase in crime and disorder in residential neighborhoods. Despite the importance of this debate to residents, policymakers, and other stakeholders, few studies have examined the causal linkage between Airbnb listings and crime in neighborhoods. We conduct the first such empirical test in Boston neighborhoods, focusing on two potential mechanisms: (1) the inflow of tourists might generate or attract crime; and (2) the creation of transient properties undermines local social dynamics. Corresponding to these mechanisms, we examine whether the number of tourists (approximated with reviews) or the prevalence of listings predict more incidents of private conflict, social disorder, and violence both concurrently and in the following year. We find evidence that increases in Airbnb listings–but not reviews–led to more violence in neighborhoods in later years. This result supports the notion that the prevalence of Airbnb listings erodes the natural ability of a neighborhood to prevent crime, but does not support the interpretation that elevated numbers of tourists bring crime with them."

However, studies with a large sample size are needed to clarify their independent and combined risks for subsequent dementia.This nationwide population-based cohort study included all individuals aged 66 years who participated in the National Screening Program between 2009 and 2013 (N = 939,099). Subjects were followed from the day they underwent screening to the diagnosis of dementia, death, or the last follow-up day (December 31, 2017).Depressive symptom presentation, recent depressive disorder, and SCD independently increased dementia incidence with adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.286 (95% CI:1.255-1.318), 1.697 (95% CI:1.621-1.776), and 1.748 (95% CI: 689-1.808) respectively. Subjects having both SCD and depression had a higher risk (aHR = 2.466, 95% CI:2.383-2.551) of dementia than having depression (aHR = 1.402, 95% CI:1.364-1.441) or SCD (aHR = 1.748, 95% CI:1.689-1.808) alone.Depressive symptoms, depressive disorder, and SCD are independent risk factors for dementia. Co-occurring depression and SCD have an additive effect on the risk of dementia; thus, early intervention and close follow up are necessary for patients with co-occurring SCD and depression."
https://openalex.org/W3182978874,"Despite being among the largest and most charismatic species in the marine environment, considerable gaps remain in our understanding of the behavioural ecology of manta rays (Mobula alfredi, M. birostris). Manta rays are often sighted in association with an array of smaller hitchhiker fish species, which utilise their hosts as a sanctuary for shelter, protection, and the sustenance they provide. Species interactions, rather than the species at the individual level, determine the ecological processes that drive community dynamics, support biodiversity and ecosystem health. Thus, understanding the associations within marine communities is critical to implementing effective conservation and management. However, the underlying patterns between manta rays, their symbionts, and other hitchhiker species remain elusive. Here, we explore the spatial and temporal variation in hitchhiker presence with M. alfredi and M. birostris throughout the Maldives and investigate the factors which may influence association using generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMM). For the first time, associations between M. alfredi and M. birostris with hitchhiker species other than those belonging to the family Echeneidae are described. A variation in the species of hitchhiker associated with M. alfredi and M. birostris was identified, with sharksucker remora (Echeneis naucrates) and giant remora (Remora remora) being the most common, respectively. Spatiotemporal variation in the presence of manta rays was identified as a driver for the occurrence of ephemeral hitchhiker associations. Near-term pregnant female M. alfredi, and M. alfredi at cleaning stations, had the highest likelihood of an association with adult E. naucrates. Juvenile E. naucrates were more likely to be associated with juvenile M. alfredi, and a seasonal trend in E. naucrates host association was identified. Remora were most likely to be present with female M. birostris, and a mean number of 1.5 ± 0.5 R. remora were observed per M. birostris. It is hoped these initial findings will serve as the basis for future work into the complex relationships between manta rays and their hitchhikers."
https://openalex.org/W3179900358,"European Researchers’ Night is an annual pan-European synchronized event devoted to public engagement with research. It was first held in 2005 and now occurs in over 400 cities across Europe, with the aim of bringing researchers closer to the general public. To investigate social inclusion in these events, we conducted survey research across three national contexts (Ireland, Malta and the UK) and events in seven cities between 2016 and 2019 (n = 1590). The results from this exploratory descriptive study confirmed one hypothesis, namely that event attendees had substantially higher levels of university qualification than the national publics. This is in line with wider patterns of unequal participation in public engagement with research activities based on socio-economic status. However, we also found mixed evidence on the prevalence of ethnic minority representation among event attendees compared to the general population, thus failing to uphold the second hypothesis that predicted an over-representation of white majority participants. This second finding diverges from existing research findings about ethnic diversity amongst science communication audiences, raising the possibility that some public engagement events are over-performing on this dimension of social inclusion. Overall, the findings demonstrate that European Researchers’ Night has potential for addressing the critical goal of enhancing the diversity of audiences for public engagement with research, even as it falls short on the key metric of socio-economic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3181702891,"Objective To assess the feasibility, safety and precision of organ-based tracking (OBT)-fusion targeted focal microwave ablation (FMA), in patients with low to intermediate risk prostate cancer. Patients and method Ten patients with a visible index tumor of Gleason score ≤3+4, largest diameter &lt;20mm were included. Transrectal OBT-fusion targeted FMA was performed using an 18G needle. Primary endpoint was the evidence of complete overlap of the index tumor by ablation zone necrosis on MRI 7 days after ablation. Urinary and sexual function were assessed with IPSS, IIEF5 and MSHQ-EjD-SF. Oncological outcomes were assessed with PSA at 2 and 6 months, and re-biopsy at 6 months. Results Median [IQR] age was 64.5 [61–72] years and baseline PSA was 5 [4.3–8.1] ng/mL. Seven (70%) and 3 (30%) patients had a low and intermediate risk cancer, respectively. Median largest tumor axis was of 11 [9.0–15.0] mm. Median duration of procedure was of 82 [44–170] min. No patient reported any pain or rectal bleeding, and all 10 patients were discharged the next day. Seven days after ablation, total necrosis of the index tumor on MRI was obtained in eight (80% [95%CI 55%-100%]) patients. One patient was treated with radical prostatectomy. Re-biopsy at 6 months in the other 9 did not show evidence of cancer in 4 patients. IPSS, IIEF-5 and MSHQ-EjD-SF were not statistically different between baseline and 6 months follow up. Conclusions OBT-fusion targeted FMA was feasible, precise, and safe in patients with low to intermediate risk localized prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3182551671,"A case control study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of feather-damaging behavior and evaluate the correlation with risk factors among pet psittacine birds in Japan. Although feather-damaging behavior among pet parrots is frequently observed in Japan, its prevalence and potential risk factors have not been investigated. Therefore, we conducted an online questionnaire survey on parrot owners throughout Japan to examine regional differences in feather-damaging behavior and associated risk factors. In total, 2,331 valid responses were obtained. The prevalence of feather-damaging behavior was 11.7%, in general agreement with prior studies. The highest prevalence was among Cockatoos ( Cacatua spp., etc.; 30.6%), followed by Lovebirds ( Agapornis spp.; 24.5%) and African grey parrots ( Psittacus erithacus ; 23.7%). Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR adj ) for potential risk factors and adjust the confounding of the variables. The odds of feather-damaging behavior were significantly higher for Conures ( Aratinga spp., Pyrrhura spp., Thectocercus acuticaudatus , Cyanoliseus patagonus ) (OR adj = 2.55, P = 0.005), Pacific parrotlets ( Forpus coelestis ) (OR adj = 3.96, P &lt; 0.001), African grey parrots (OR adj = 6.74, P &lt; 0.001), Lovebirds (OR adj = 6.79, P &lt; 0.001) and Cockatoos (OR adj = 9.46, P &lt; 0.001) than Budgerigars ( Melopsittacus undulatus ), and for young adults (OR adj = 1.81, P = 0.038) and adults (OR adj = 3.17, P &lt; 0.001) than young birds, and for signs of separation anxiety (OR adj = 1.81, P &lt; 0.001). Species, bird age and signs of separation anxiety were significantly higher risk factors for feather-damaging behavior than any other potential risk factors. Our findings, which include broad species diversity, are a good source of data for predicting risk factors for feather-damaging behavior and could be useful in preventing declines in welfare."
https://openalex.org/W3180910842,"The aim of this study is to investigate the clinicopathological features of intrinsic and extrinsic subtypes in adenomyosis. In particular, we focused on the early lesions of adenomyosis.This is a single-center, prospective study of women who elected surgery for adenomyosis at the Department of Gynecology, Nara Medical University Hospital, Kashihara, Japan, from April 2008 to March 2018. Adenomyosis was histologically classified as intrinsic, extrinsic, and others, depending on the type of intramural growth. Adenomyosis that occurs at the inner and outer myometrium was defined as an intrinsic and extrinsic type, respectively.One hundred eighty-nine patients with histologically confirmed adenomyosis were classified into three different types, 74 intrinsic type, 78 extrinsic type, and 37 other type. Compared to the intrinsic type, the extrinsic type was more likely to have endometriosis, including ovarian endometrioma (OMA), superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SUP), or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). To further identify the clinicopathological features of early-stage adenomyosis, we focused only on patients with intrinsic and extrinsic types of adenomyosis with less than one-third of muscular layer infiltration. Patients with early-stage intrinsic adenomyosis were more likely to experience induced abortions. Patients with early-stage extrinsic adenomyosis were more likely to have endometriosis. The coexistence of endometriosis and the lack of induced abortion were independent predictors of extrinsic adenomyosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified coexistence of endometriosis as independent predictors of the early stage extrinsic adenomyosis.The study suggests that there are at least two types of adenomyosis, where the intrinsic type is closely associated with a history of induced abortion, while the extrinsic type is strongly associated with endometriosis. Adenomyosis might be a gynecological disorder with complex pathogenesis implicating both traumatic and endometriotic factors."
https://openalex.org/W3179620818,"Phytophthora cinnamomi is a plant pathogenic oomycete that causes Phytophthora root rot of avocado (PRR). Currently, there is a limited understanding of the molecular interactions underlying this disease. Other Phytophthora species employ an arsenal of effector proteins to manipulate host physiology, of which the RxLR effectors contribute to virulence by interfering with host immune responses. The aim of this study was to identify candidate RxLR effectors in P . cinnamomi that play a role in establishing PRR, and to infer possible functions for these effectors. We identified 61 candidate RxLR genes which were expressed during infection of a susceptible avocado rootstock. Several of these genes were present in multiple copies in the P . cinnamomi genome, suggesting that they may contribute to pathogen fitness. Phylogenetic analysis of the manually predicted RxLR protein sequences revealed 12 P . cinnamomi RxLRs that were related to characterised effectors in other Phytophthora spp., providing clues to their functions in planta . Expression profiles of nine more RxLR s point to possible virulence roles in avocado–highlighting a way forward for studies of this interaction. This study represents the first investigation of the expression of P . cinnamomi RxLR genes during the course of avocado infection, and puts forward a pipeline to pinpoint effector genes with potential as virulence determinants, providing a foundation for the future functional characterization of RxLRs that contribute to P . cinnamomi virulence in avocado."
https://openalex.org/W3179717510,"Background We identify socioeconomic disparities by region in cancer morbidity and mortality in England for all-cancer and type-specific cancers, and use incidence data to quantify the impact of cancer diagnosis delays on cancer deaths between 2001–2016. Methods and findings We obtain population cancer morbidity and mortality rates at various age, year, gender, deprivation, and region levels based on a Bayesian approach. A significant increase in type-specific cancer deaths, which can also vary among regions, is shown as a result of delay in cancer diagnoses. Our analysis suggests increase of 7.75% (7.42% to 8.25%) in female lung cancer mortality in London, as an impact of 12-month delay in cancer diagnosis, and a 3.39% (3.29% to 3.48%) increase in male lung cancer mortality across all regions. The same delay can cause a 23.56% (23.09% to 24.30%) increase in male bowel cancer mortality. Furthermore, for all-cancer mortality, the highest increase in deprivation gap happened in the East Midlands, from 199 (186 to 212) in 2001, to 239 (224 to 252) in 2016 for males, and from 114 (107 to 121) to 163 (155 to 171) for females. Also, for female lung cancer, the deprivation gap has widened with the highest change in the North West, e.g. for incidence from 180 (172 to 188) to 272 (261 to 282), whereas it has narrowed for prostate cancer incidence with the biggest reduction in the South West from 165 (139 to 190) in 2001 to 95 (72 to 117) in 2016. Conclusions The analysis reveals considerable disparities in all-cancer and some type-specific cancers with respect to socioeconomic status. Furthermore, a significant increase in cancer deaths is shown as a result of delays in cancer diagnoses which can be linked to concerns about the effect of delay in cancer screening and diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health interventions at regional and deprivation level can contribute to prevention of cancer deaths."
https://openalex.org/W3180906554,"We investigated the uptake of opportunistic cervical cancer screening (CCS) and other risk factors and their association with cervical cancer in Germany in a case-control study.We recruited incident cases of cervical cancer (ICD-10 C53) diagnosed between 2012 and 2016 and matched with three population-based controls, based on age and region of residence. Cases and controls reported their CCS participation during the past ten years (frequent: every three years; no or infrequent: less than every three years) and other relevant variables. We fitted conditional logistic regression models, reporting odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We report overall and stratified analyses by histologic group (squamous cell-SCC, and adenocarcinoma-AC), T category (T1 and T2+), and age (<50 and ≥50 years). We analysed 217 cases and 652 matched controls. 53.0% of cases and 85.7% of controls attended CCS frequently. In the overall adjusted model, no or infrequent participation in CCS (OR 5.63; 95% CI 3.51 to 9.04), having had more than one sexual partner (OR 2.86; 95%CI 1.50 to 5.45) and obesity (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.83) were associated with cervical cancer. Twelve years of schooling (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.60) and a net monthly income of €3000 or more (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.82) were protective factors. In the stratified analyses, no or infrequent participation was associated with T1 (OR 4.37; 95% CI 2.48 to 7.71), T2+ (OR 10.67; 95% CI 3.83 to 29.74), SCC (OR 6.88; 95% CI 4.08 to 11.59) and AC (OR 3.95; 95% CI 1.47 to 10.63).Although women who frequently attended CCS were less likely to develop cervical cancer, especially larger tumours, the high proportion of cases who had been frequently screened prior to diagnosis underscores the need to investigate the quality of cytology and treatment of precancerous lesions in Germany."
https://openalex.org/W3181613082,"Potato cyst nematodes (PCN) from the genus Globodera spp. cause major losses in the potato ( Solanum tuberosum) industry worldwide. Despite their importance, at present little is known about the status of this plant pathogen in cultivated potatoes in Colombia. In this study, a total of 589 samples collected from 75 geographic localities in nine potato producing regions of Colombia (Cundinamarca, Boyacá, Antioquia, Nariño, Santander, Norte de Santander, Tolima, Caldas and Cauca) were assayed for the presence of potato cyst nematodes. Fifty-seven percent of samples tested positive for PCN. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of the rRNA gene and D2-D3 expansion segments of the 28S rRNA gene, all populations but one were identified as Globodera pallida . Sequences of G . pallida from Colombia formed a monophyletic group closely related to Peruvian populations, with the lowest average number of nucleotide substitutions per site ( Dxy = 0.002) and net nucleotide substitutions per site ( Da = 0.001), when compared to G . pallida populations from Europe, South and North America. A single sample formed a well-supported subclade along with G . rostochiensis and G . tabacum from Japan, USA and Argentina. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive survey of Globodera populations from Colombia that includes genetic data. Our findings on species diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Globodera populations from Colombia may help elucidate the status and distribution of Globodera species, and lead to the development of accurate management strategies for the potato cyst nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W3182086041,"Background Childhood stunting remains the most challenging consequence of undernutrition because it is associated with suboptimal brain development and the subsequent increased risk of metabolic diseases and decreased earnings in adult life. The Sambas District in Indonesia has a high prevalence of stunting (28.4%), followed by underweight (25.5.%) and wasting (14.4%) among children, as well chronic energy deficiency (27%) and anemia (62%) among pregnant women. The present study sought to determine significant factors in childhood stunting with a focus on maternal and child nutrition and prenatal and postnatal determinants. Methods This prospective, repeat, cross-sectional study investigated factors associated with stunting among 559 infants age 0–11 months in Sambas District, Indonesia. Anthropometric measurements were performed by trained enumerators. Data from a 2016 survey of pregnant women and a 2017 survey on mothers and their children were used for postnatal data collection to quantify the prevalence of stunting at age 0–11 months. Using 20 potential predictors of stunting categorized by household characteristics, maternal characteristics, antenatal care services, and child characteristics, logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the adjusted association between stunting and these factors. Results Of 559 children analyzed, 20.8% were stunted. In the model with low birth weight (LBW) as predictor for stunting, the odds of stunting increased significantly among children who weighed &lt;2.500 g at birth; children who had diarrhea in the past 2 weeks and children who had incomplete basic immunization coverage as infants age 9–11 months. In model without LBW, the odds of stunting increased significantly among children who had preterm at birth, short maternal stature and children who had incomplete basic immunization coverage for 9–11 months infants. Conclusions Postnatal factors—preterm birth, low birth weight, diarrhea and complete basic immunization coverage—were associated with infant stunting in Sambas District, Indonesia. The prenatal factors such as short maternal stature were significant in the multivariate model. Policy makers, especially in the government, should recommend measures focused on those prenatal and postnatal factors to prevent stunting in children and to avoid the sequelae of childhood stunting in adult life."
https://openalex.org/W3177857269,"Adequate sexual and reproductive health information is vital to women of reproductive age (WRA) 15 to 49 years, for making informed choices on their reproductive health including family planning (FP). However, many women who interact with the health system continue to miss out this vital service. The study aimed to identify the extent of provision of FP counselling at service delivery points and associated behavioral factors among women of reproductive age in two districts of Arusha region. It also determined the association between receipt of FP counselling and contraceptive usage.Data were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of 5,208 WRA residing in two districts of Arusha region in Tanzania; conducted between January and May 2018. Multistage sampling technique was employed to select the WRA for the face-to-face interviews. FP counseling was defined as receipt of FP information by a woman during any visit at the health facility for antenatal care (ANC), or for post-natal care (PNC). Analyses on receipt of FP counseling were done on 3,116 WRA, aged 16-44 years who were in contact with health facilities in the past two years. A modified Poisson regression model was used to determine the Prevalence Ratio (PR) as a measure of association between receipt of any FP counseling and current use of modern contraception, controlling for potential confounders.Among the women that visited the health facility for any health-related visit in the past two years, 1,256 (40%) reported that they received FP counselling. Among the women who had had births in the last 30 months; 1,389 and 1,409 women had contact with the service delivery points for ANC and PNC visits respectively. Of these 31% and 26% had a missed FP counseling at ANC and PNC visit respectively. Women who were not formally employed were more likely to receive FP counselling during facility visit than others. WRA who received any FP counseling at PNC were significantly more likely to report current use of modern contraception than those who did not (adjusted PR [adj. PR] = 1.28; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.09, 1.49).Overall, only 40% women reported that they received any form of FP counseling when they interfaced with the healthcare system in the past two years. Informally employed women were more likely to receive FP counselling, and women who received FP counselling during PNC visits were significantly more likely to use contraceptive in comparison to the women who did not receive FP counselling. This presents a missed opportunity for prevention of unintended pregnancies and suggests a need for further integration of FP counseling into the ANC and PNC visits."
https://openalex.org/W3180048344,"Development of a competent collateral circulation in established coronary artery disease is cardio-protective. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) system plays a key role in this process. We investigated the prognostic performance of circulating VEGF-A and three genetic variants in the VEGFA gene in a clinical coronary cohort.The Coronary Disease Cohort Study (CDCS) recruited 2,140 patients, with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), after admission to Christchurch or Auckland City Hospitals between July 2002 and January 2009. We present data for 1927 patients from the cohort genotyped for three SNPs in the VEGF-A gene, rs699947 (C-2578A), rs2010963 (C405G) and rs3025039 (C936T). Plasma VEGF-A concentrations were assayed in a subgroup (n = 550) of CDCS patients (geometric mean 36.6 [34.7-38.5] pg/ml). VEGF-A levels correlated with patient heart rate at baseline (p = 0.034). None of rs699947, rs3025039, nor rs2010963 genotypes were significantly associated with VEGF-A levels, but rs3025039 genotype was positively associated with collateral vessels perfusion according to the Rentrop classification (p = 0.01) and baseline natriuretic peptide levels (p<0.05). Survival in the CDCS cohort was independently associated with baseline VEGF-A levels and (in males) with rs699947 genotype.This study is strongly suggestive that VEGF-A levels have value as a prognostic biomarker in coronary heart disease patients and SNPs in VEGF-A deserve further investigation as prognostic markers and indicators of angiogenic potential influencing the formation of collateral circulation."
https://openalex.org/W3180615301,"Background In 2016, over 11 million individuals were admitted to prisons and jails in the United States. Because the majority of these individuals will return to the community, addressing their health needs requires coordination between community and correctional health care providers. However, few systems exist to facilitate this process and little is known about how physicians perceive and manage these transitions. Objective The goal of this study was to characterize physicians’ views on transitions both into and out of incarceration and describe how knowledge of a patient’s criminal justice involvement impacts patient care plans. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted between October 2018 and May 2019 with physicians from three community clinics in Hennepin County, Minnesota. Team members used a hybrid approach of deductive and inductive coding, in which a priori codes were defined based on the interview guide while also allowing for data-driven codes to emerge. Results Four themes emerged related to physicians’ perceptions on continuity of care for patients with criminal justice involvement. Physicians identified disruptions in patient-physician relationships, barriers to accessing prescription medications, disruptions in insurance coverage, and problems with sharing medical records, as factors contributing to discontinuity of care for patients entering and exiting incarceration. These factors impacted patients differently depending on the direction of the transition. Conclusions Our findings identified four disruptions to continuity of care that physicians viewed as key barriers to successful transitions into and out of incarceration. These disruptions are unlikely to be effectively addressed at the provider level and will require system-level changes, which Medicaid and managed care organizations could play a leading role in developing."
https://openalex.org/W3181275444,"Southern fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are known to migrate from the Antarctic to mid-latitudes during winter for breeding, but the occurrence and distribution of this species is not well known in the waters around New Zealand. The 'doublet' calls are one of the main calls emitted specifically by fin whales and repeated in a regular pattern, which make the acoustic detection of these calls relevant to detect the presence of fin whales. Using a signal processing algorithm to detect 'doublet' calls emitted by fin whales, we studied the occurrence, characteristics and seasonality of these 'doublet' calls in two regions around New Zealand; Cook Strait in 2016/2017 and offshore Gisborne in 2014/2015. The call detection procedure consisted of binarization of the spectrogram and a cross-correlation between the binarized spectrogram and a template of binarized 'doublet' calls spectrogram. A binarization threshold for the data spectrograms and a cross correlation threshold were then determined through multiple trials on a training dataset and a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Fin whale 'doublet' calls occurred on the east side of New Zealand's Cook Strait during austral winter, specifically in June 2017 and offshore Gisborne in June-August 2014. No 'doublet' calls were detected on the west side of Cook Strait. The 'doublet' calls' Inter-Note Interval (INI) was similar in both datasets. However, there was a difference in alternation of the mean frequency for both HF components of 'doublet' calls in Cook Strait and Gisborne. As the song types were compared with those previously described in the literature, our findings suggest that some fin whales wintering in New Zealand waters may be part of a broader 'acoustic population' whose range extends west to southern Australia and south to Antarctica."
https://openalex.org/W3177517440,"Protein-interaction domains can create unique macromolecular complexes that drive evolutionary innovation. By combining bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses with structural approaches, we have discovered that the docking and dimerization (D/D) domain of the PKA regulatory subunit is an ancient and conserved protein fold. An archetypal function of this module is to interact with A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that facilitate compartmentalization of this key cell-signaling enzyme. Homology searching reveals that D/D domain proteins comprise a superfamily with 18 members that function in a variety of molecular and cellular contexts. Further in silico analyses indicate that D/D domains segregate into subgroups on the basis of their similarity to type I or type II PKA regulatory subunits. The sperm autoantigenic protein 17 (SPA17) is a prototype of the type II or R2D2 subgroup that is conserved across metazoan phyla. We determined the crystal structure of an extended D/D domain from SPA17 (amino acids 1-75) at 1.72 Å resolution. This revealed a four-helix bundle-like configuration featuring terminal β-strands that can mediate higher order oligomerization. In solution, SPA17 forms both homodimers and tetramers and displays a weak affinity for AKAP18. Quantitative approaches reveal that AKAP18 binding occurs at nanomolar affinity when SPA17 heterodimerizes with the ropporin-1-like D/D protein. These findings expand the role of the D/D fold as a versatile protein-interaction element that maintains the integrity of macromolecular architectures within organelles such as motile cilia."

The preference has been attributed to morphological and anatomical features and biochemical compounds. In the present manuscript a comparison has been made among the transcriptome of leaves of the two preferred cultivated varieties and three wild types species. While assembling, high quality transcriptomes of five genotypes were constructed with a total of 100930, 151245, 89724, 181761 and 102908 transcripts from ML, MN, MS, K2 and V1 samples respectively. Further, to compare them, orthologs were identified from these assembled transcriptome. A total of 22462, 23413, 23685, 24371, 18362, 22326, 20058, 18049, 17567 and 20518 clusters of orthologs were found in one to one comparison in KvsN, KvsL, KvsS, KvsV, LvsN, LvsS, LvsV, NvsS, NvsV, and SvsV respectively. 4236 orthologs with algebraic connectivity of 1.0 were then used to compare and to find out differentially expressed transcripts from all the genotypes. A total of 1037 transcripts expressed that include some of the important morphology, anatomy and biochemical pathways regulating transcription factors (AP2/ERFs and C2H2 Zinc fingers) and signalling components were identified to express differentially. Further, these transcriptomes were used find out markers (SSR) and variants and a total of 1101013, 537245, 970877, 310437, 675772, 338400, 581189, 751477, 514999 and 257107 variants including SNP, MNP, Insertions and deletions were found in one to one comparisons.

https://openalex.org/W3180840229,"Co-digestion of organic biomass mixed with inorganic amendments could have an impact on composting dynamics. Various studies highlighted fertilizers' role as an additive to lesser the nitrogen loss, while some studies focused on the addition of fertilizers to enhance the efficiency. The changes in carbon, nitrogen components, and humic substances during the organic-inorganic co-compost process were seldom studied. Clarifying these changes might help improve the production process and compost nutrients contents. Thus, this study's purpose is to investigate the effects of inorganic amendments on compost characteristics, compost temperature, biochemical methane production (BMP), and nutritional contents. The inorganic phosphorous (P), sulfur (S), and sulfur solubilizing agent (SSA) were added to Farmyard manure (FYM) mixed with biodegradable waste (BW), including wheat straw, corn stalks, and green lawn waste. The P and S amended treatments were carried out into two sets, with and without SSA. The mixed feedstocks were added in the insulated RBC composting pit (15 x 15 x 10 feet). The compost material's moisture content was maintained 50-65% during the entire composting process for optimum waste digestion i.e., the moisture content (MC) of FYM was 82.7% and for BW ranged 8.8-10.2%, while the C/N ratio was found 10.5 for FYM, 74.5 for wheat straw, 83.5 for corn stalks, and 84.8 for lawn waste. At the condition of compost maturity, the inorganic amendments have no significant effect on composted material's moisture content. The maximum organic matter of 69.7% and C/N ratio of 44.6 was measured in T1. On the 6th day of composting, the temperature reached to thermophilic range (>45 oC) in all the treatments due to aeration of compost increased microbial activities and waste decomposition rate and decreased gradually to mesophilic range (35-45 oC) because the supply of high-energy compounds becomes exhausted. The highest temperature was reached in T4 (58 oC) and lowest in CT (47 oC). The significantly maximum methane of 8.95 m3 and biogas burning was 818 minutes in CT, followed by T1 and T4. The results of this study revealed that P enriched compost is a feasible and sustainable way to overcome P deficiency in the soil as well as in plants and best way to use low-grade P and organic waste material."
https://openalex.org/W3182618508,"The secondary structure prediction (SSP) of proteins has long been an essential structural biology technique with various applications. Despite its vital role in many research and industrial fields, in recent years, as the accuracy of state-of-the-art secondary structure predictors approaches the theoretical upper limit, SSP has been considered no longer challenging or too challenging to make advances. With the belief that the substantial improvement of SSP will move forward many fields depending on it, we conducted this study, which focused on three issues that have not been noticed or thoroughly examined yet but may have affected the reliability of the evaluation of previous SSP algorithms. These issues are all about the sequence homology between or within the developmental and evaluation datasets. We thus designed many different homology layouts of datasets to train and evaluate SSP prediction models. Multiple repeats were performed in each experiment by random sampling. The conclusions obtained with small experimental datasets were verified with large-scale datasets using state-of-the-art SSP algorithms. Very different from the long-established assumption, we discover that the sequence homology between query datasets for training, testing, and independent tests exerts little influence on SSP accuracy. Besides, the sequence homology redundancy between or within most datasets would make the accuracy of an SSP algorithm overestimated, while the redundancy within the reference dataset for extracting predictive features would make the accuracy underestimated. Since the overestimating effects are more significant than the underestimating effect, the accuracy of some SSP methods might have been overestimated. Based on the discoveries, we propose a rigorous procedure for developing SSP algorithms and making reliable evaluations, hoping to bring substantial improvements to future SSP methods and benefit all research and application fields relying on accurate prediction of protein secondary structures."
https://openalex.org/W3182667133,"Supplier selection is an important decision-making problem, which involves many quantitative and qualitative factors incorporating vagueness and imprecision. This study proposes a novel fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making framework for supplier selection, which integrates quality function deployment (QFD) and interval data envelopment analysis (DEA). The proposed methodology allows for considering the relationships among the product features and supplier evaluation criteria (SEs) and the impacts of inner dependence among SEs by constructing a house of quality (HOQ). Considering that the number of supplier evaluation indicators is greater than the number of suppliers in some cases, the curse of dimensionality problem usually exists. To solve this problem, we combine the HOQ, interval DEA models, and forward-stepwise selection approach to screen supplier evaluation indicators and select the best supplier(s). Through the two-stage supplier selection method, we can achieve the double screening of indicators and determine the final supplier(s). Finally, the application of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis is also carried out to verify the stability of the proposed methodology. This study focuses on supplier selection based on the combination of fuzzy QFD and interval DEA, and also provide a new two-phase methodology for DEA indicator screening."
https://openalex.org/W3179726010,"Biomechanical features of the handstand, one of the most fundamental skills required for artistic gymnastics events, have not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to clarify the kinematics and joint moment profiles during straight arm press to handstand in different highly skilled male gymnasts. Fifty-nine male gymnasts performed a straight arm press to handstand on a force platform and were judged on their performance by experienced certified judges. Subjects were divided into two groups (highly-skilled and less-skilled). Kinematic data were obtained using a video camera synchronized with force platform. Joint moments (wrist, shoulder, hip) during each straight arm press to handstand were calculated using the inverse dynamics solution. Larger shoulder flexion moments were observed in less-skilled compared with highly- skilled performers (at 3–59%, p &lt; 0.001) while larger hip flexion moments were observed in highly- skilled performers at 52% ( p = 0.045) and 56% ( p = 0.048) and normalized time of straight arm press to handstand. Major differences between highly-skilled and less-skilled performers were observed in hip joint moment production as it shifted from extension to flexion from the leg horizontal position to the handstand position in highly-skilled gymnasts. Successful straight arm press to handstand techniques observed in highly-skilled performers were characterized as a more acute pike position at toe-off as well as hip flexor moments at latter phase of the straight arm press to handstand."
https://openalex.org/W3181817045,"Sales data in China indicate that slim cigarette consumption has increased dramatically over the last few years. This study examined who smoked slim cigarettes and the reasons for adopting these new products. A survey of an online panel from 19 Chinese cities was conducted from October 2018 to April 2019 with 20,055 members aged 16 and older. Among the 31.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 30.1–33.4] of panel members who reported currently smoking, 37.7% (95% CI = 34.8–40.5) smoked slim cigarettes. Among smokers, women were significantly more likely to smoke slim cigarettes than men [56.5% (95% CI = 50.8–62.2) vs. 35.5% (95% CI = 32.8–38.1)]. Smokers with a bachelor’s degree were more likely to smoke slim cigarettes than those without [41.3% (95% CI = 38.1–44.4) vs. 33.1% (95% CI = 30.0–36.1)]. Most slim cigarette smokers were dual smokers [77.7% (95% CI = 75.3–80.1)], smoking both regular and slim cigarettes. Among dual smokers, 97.5% (95% CI = 96.7–98.3) started smoking regular cigarettes before slim cigarettes. Of the many reasons given for smoking slim cigarettes, 37.0% (95% CI = 34.3–39.7) directly related to harm reduction with another 10.1% (95% CI = 8.4–11.7) reporting their reason as wanting “to reduce consumption of regular cigarettes,” a plausible indication of harm reduction. These findings suggest strong interest in harm reduction among the current Chinese smoking population and that the popularity of slim cigarettes is likely to increase, with the more educated as the early adopters. Given the absence of any evidence that these products actually reduce harm, it is urgent that the public health community be on high alert in order to avoid repeating the sad history of low-tar cigarettes, when a supposed harm-reduction product misled the field of tobacco control."
https://openalex.org/W3182441538,"In the United States non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease, affecting an estimated 80 to 100 million people. It occurs in every age group, but predominantly in people with risk factors such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. NAFLD is marked by fat accumulation in the liver leading to liver inflammation, which may lead to scarring and irreversible damage progressing to cirrhosis and liver failure. In animal models, genetic ablation of the protein G0S2 leads to alleviation of liver damage and insulin resistance in high fat diets. The research presented in this paper aims to aid in rational based drug design for the treatment of NAFLD by providing a pathway for a solution state NMR structure of G0S2. Here we describe the expression of G0S2 in an E . coli system from two different constructs, both of which are confirmed to be functionally active based on the ability to inhibit the activity of Adipose Triglyceride Lipase. In one of the constructs, preliminary NMR spectroscopy measurements show dominant alpha-helical characteristics as well as resonance assignments on the N-terminus of G0S2, allowing for further NMR work with this protein. Additionally, the characterization of G0S2 oligomers are outlined for both constructs, suggesting that G0S2 may defensively exist in a multimeric state to protect and potentially stabilize the small 104 amino acid protein within the cell. This information presented on the structure of G0S2 will further guide future development in the therapy for NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3177735102,"Though it is often taken as a truism that communication contributes to organizational productivity, there are surprisingly few empirical studies documenting a relationship between observable interaction and productivity. This is because comprehensive, direct observation of communication in organizational settings is notoriously difficult. In this paper, we report a method for extracting network and speech characteristics data from audio recordings of participants talking with each other in real time. We use this method to analyze communication and productivity data from seventy-nine employees working within a software engineering organization who had their speech recorded during working hours for a period of approximately 3 years. From the speech data, we infer when any two individuals are talking to each other and use this information to construct a communication graph for the organization for each week. We use the spectral and temporal characteristics of the produced speech and the structure of the resultant communication graphs to predict the productivity of the group, as measured by the number of lines of code produced. The results indicate that the most important speech and network features for predicting productivity include those that measure the number of unique people interacting within the organization, the frequency of interactions, and the topology of the communication network."
https://openalex.org/W3178710395,"Background Changes in plasma volume, a marker of plasma volume expansion and contraction, are gaining attention in the field of cardiovascular disease because of its role in the prevention and management of heart failure. However, it remains unknown whether a 1-year change in plasma volume is a risk factor for all-cause, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular mortality in the general population. Methods and results We used a nationwide database of 134,291 subjects (age 40–75 years) who participated in the annual “Specific Health Check and Guidance in Japan” check-up for 2 consecutive years between 2008 and 2011. A 1-year change in plasm volume was calculated using the Strauss–Davis-Rosenbaum formula. There were 220 cardiovascular deaths, 1,001 non-cardiovascular deaths including 718 cancer deaths, and 1,221 all-cause deaths during the follow-up period of 3.9 years. All subjects were divided into quintiles based on the 1-year change in plasma volume. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that the highest 5 th quintile had the greatest risk among the five groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated that a 1-year change in plasma volume was an independent risk factor for all-cause, cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular, and cancer deaths. The addition of a 1-year change in plasma volume to cardiovascular risk factors significantly improved the C-statistic, net reclassification, and integrated discrimination indexes. Conclusions Here, we have demonstrated for the first time that a 1-year change in plasma volume could be an additional risk factor for all-cause, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular (mainly cancer) mortality in the general population."

The low frequency vibration generated by the engine and ground excitation is similar to the natural frequency of human organs. Long term operation in this environment will resonate with the organs and affect drivers' health. To investigate this possibility, in this paper we carried out a collection experiment of human physiological indicators relevant to vibration fatigue. Four physiological signals of surface electromyography, skin electricity, skin temperature, and photoplethysmography signal were collected while the subjects experienced vibration. Several features of physiological signals as well as the law of signal features changing with fatigue are studied. The test results show that with the increase of human fatigue, the overall physiological parameters show the following trends: The median frequency of the human body surface electromyography and the slope of skin surface temperature decreases, the value of skin conductivity and the mean value of the photoplethysmography signal increases. Furthermore, this paper proposes a vibration comfort evaluation method based on multiple physiological parameters of the human body. An artificial neural network model is trained with test samples, and the prediction accuracy rate reaches 88.9%. Finally, the vibration conditions are changed by the shock-absorbing suspension of a tractor, verifying the effectiveness of the physiological signal changing with the vibration of the human body. The established prediction model can also be used to objectively reflect the discomfort of the human body under different working conditions and provide a basis for structural design optimization."
https://openalex.org/W3179138001,"Domestic dogs have been shown to reciprocate help received from conspecifics in food-giving tasks. However, it is not yet known whether dogs also reciprocate help received from humans. Here, we investigated whether dogs reciprocate the receipt of food from humans. In an experience phase, subjects encountered a helpful human who provided them with food by activating a food dispenser, and an unhelpful human who did not provide them with food. Subjects later had the opportunity to return food to each human type, in a test phase, via the same mechanism. In addition, a free interaction session was conducted in which the subject was free to interact with its owner and with whichever human partner it had encountered on that day. Two studies were carried out, which differed in the complexity of the experience phase and the time lag between the experience phase and test phase. Subjects did not reciprocate the receipt of food in either study. Furthermore, no difference was observed in the duration subjects spent in proximity to, or the latency to approach, the two human partners. Although our results suggest that dogs do not reciprocate help received from humans, they also suggest that the dogs did not recognize the cooperative or uncooperative act of the humans during the experience phase. It is plausible that aspects of the experimental design hindered the emergence of any potential reciprocity. However, it is also possible that dogs are simply not prosocial towards humans in food-giving contexts."

The current study aims to assess the association between higher altitudes on survival time among at-risk neonates.Retrospective survival analysis. Setting: Ecuadorian neonates who died at ≤28 days of life. Patients: We analyzed the nationwide dataset of neonatal deaths from the Surveillance System of Neonatal Mortality of the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador, registered from 126 public and private health care facilities, between January 2014 to September 2017. Main outcome measures: We retrospectively reviewed 3016 patients. We performed a survival analysis by setting the survival time in days as the primary outcome and fixed and mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for each altitude stratum of each one of the health care facilities in which those neonates were attended, adjusting by individual variables (i.e., birth weight, gestational age at birth, Apgar scale at 5 minutes, and comorbidities); and contextual variables (i.e., administrative planning areas, type of health care facility, and level of care).Altitudes of health care facilities ranging from 80 to <2500 m, 2500 to <2750m, and ≥2750 m were associated respectively with 20% (95% CI: 1% to 44%), 32% (95% CI:<1% to 79%) and 37% (95% CI: 8% to 75%) increased HR; compared with altitudes at <80 m.Higher altitudes are independently associated with shorter survival time, as measured by days among at-risk neonates. Altitude should be considered when assessing the risk of having negative health outcomes during neonatal period."
https://openalex.org/W3182089502,"We describe a new species of the Dendropsophus decipiens Group, morphologically most resembling D. haddadi but genetically more closely related to D. oliveirai and likely endemic from the Atlantic Forest biome, northeastern Brazil. The new species can be distinguished from all species of the D. decipiens Group based on the combination of morphological features, advertisement call and phylogenetic position based on mitochondrial DNA gene sequences. The new species emits simple calls in series of 3-9 notes, each with 9-29 pulses, and dominant frequency varying from 5578-6422 Hz, and exhibit a minimum of 8% genetic distance (16S mitochondrial gene) in comparison to its congeners. The new taxa represent the sixth species of the D. decipiens Group, which likely harbors more undescribed taxa, corroborating the view that Neotropical species richness is fairly underestimated."

https://openalex.org/W3179265513,"In order to prevent evictions, it is important to gain more insight into factors predicting whether or not tenants receive an eviction order. In this study, ten potential risk factors for evictions were tested. Tenants who were at risk of eviction due to rent arrears in five Dutch cities were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, and six months later their housing associations were asked to provide information about the tenants' current situation. Multiple logistic regression analyses with data on 344 tenants revealed that the amount of rent arrears was a strong predictor for receiving an eviction order. Furthermore, single tenants and tenants who had already been summoned to appear in court were more likely to receive an eviction order. These results can contribute to identifying households at risk of eviction at an early stage, and to develop targeted interventions to prevent evictions."
https://openalex.org/W3179648901,"There do not appear to be many studies which have examined the socio-economic burden and medical factors influencing the mortality and hospital costs incurred by patients with cardiac arrest in South Korea. We analyzed the differences in characteristics, medical factors, mortality, and costs between patients with national health insurance and those on a medical aid program.We selected patients (≥20 years old) who experienced their first episode of cardiac arrest from 2004 to 2015 using data from the National Health Insurance Service database. We analyzed demographic characteristics, insurance type, urbanization of residential area, comorbidities, treatments, hospital costs, and mortality within 30 days and one year for each group. A multiple regression analysis was used to identify an association between insurance type and outcomes.Among the 487,442 patients with cardiac arrest, the medical aid group (13.3% of the total) had a higher proportion of females, rural residents, and patients treated in low-level hospitals. The patients in the medical aid group also reported a higher rate of non-shockable conditions; a high Charlson Comorbidity Index; and pre-existing comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure with a lower rate of providing a coronary angiography. The national health insurance group reported a lower one-year mortality rate (91.2%), compared to the medical aid group (94%), and a negative association with one-year mortality (Adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.76). While there was no significant difference in short-term costs between the two groups, the medical aid group reported lower long-term costs, despite a higher rate of readmission.Medical aid coverage was an associated factor for one-year mortality, and may be the result of an insufficient delivery of long-term services as reflected by the lower long-term costs and higher readmission rates. There were differences of characteristics, comorbidities, medical and hospital factors and treatments in two groups. These differences in medical and hospital factors may display discrepancies by type of insurance in the delivery of services, especially in chronic healthcare services."
https://openalex.org/W3179687575,"To adapt communications concerning vaccine prevention, we studied knowledge, beliefs and practices around meningitis risk and prevention in a young adult population in Burkina Faso in 2016, 5 years after the MenAfriVac® mass campaign and one year before the vaccine's inclusion in the infant immunization schedule.In a representative sample of the population aged 15 to 33 years (N = 220) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, study nurses administered a standardized paper questionnaire consisting of predominantly open questions, collecting information on meningitis risk factors and prevention, and on exposure to dry air and kitchen fire smoke. We identified themes and analyzed their frequency. We created a meningitis knowledge score (range 0 to 4) based on pre-defined best responses and analyzed the determinants of knowledge score levels ≥2 (basic score) and ≥3 (high score) using multivariate logistic regression.Biomedically supported facts and good practices were known by the majority of participants (eg vaccine prevention, 84.5%). Younger women aged 15-20 years had a higher frequency of low scores <2 (17.0%) compared to older women aged 21-33 years (6.3%) and men of both age groups (3.8%). Junior secondary School attendance explained the differences between the two groups of women, the gender gap for the older, but not the young women, and explained score differences among young women. Local understandings and practices for risk and prevention were commonly reported and used (risk from unripe mango consumption and prevention through nasal application of shea nut butter).This study shows a gender gap in knowledge of meningitis risk and prevention, largely due to education-level inequalities. Women below 21 years had particularly low levels of knowledge and may need interventions outside schools and perinatal care. Our study suggests a strong adherence to local understandings of and practices around meningitis risk and prevention, which should be taken into account by vaccination promotion."

https://openalex.org/W3181472933,"The Saving Lives at Birth (SL@B) funding partners joined in 2011 to source, support, and scale maternal and newborn health (MNH) innovations to improve maternal and newborn survival by focusing on the 24 hours around the time of birth. A multi-methods, retrospective portfolio evaluation was conducted to determine SL@B's impact. Forty semi-structured, key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with experts in global MNH based in low- and middle-income and in high-income countries to assess the SL@B program. KIIs were conducted with global MNH technical experts, innovators, government officials in low- and middle-income countries, donors, private investors, and implementing partners to include the full spectrum of voices involved in identifying and scaling innovations. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Stakeholders believe the SL@B program has been successful in changing the way maternal and newborn health programs are delivered with a focus on doing things differently through innovation. The open approach to sourcing innovation was seen as positive to the extent that it brought more interdisciplinary stakeholders to think about the problem of maternal and newborn survival. However, a demand-driven approach that aims to source innovations that address MNH priority needs and takes into account the needs of end users (e.g. individuals and governments) was suggested as a strategy for ensuring that more innovations go to scale."
https://openalex.org/W3182116582,"Introduction Motor imagery (MI) is the mental rehearsal of a motor task. Between real and imagined movements, a functional equivalence has been described regarding timing and brain activation. The primary study aim was to investigate the feasibility of MI training focusing on the autonomic function in healthy young people. Further aims were to evaluate participants’ MI abilities and compare preliminary effects of activating and relaxing MI on autonomic function and against controls. Methods A single-blinded randomised controlled pilot trial was performed. Participants were randomised to the activating MI (1), relaxing MI (2), or control (3) group. Following a MI familiarisation, they practiced home-based kinaesthetic MI for 17 minutes, 5 times/week for 2 weeks. Participants were called once for support. The primary outcome was the feasibility of a full-scale randomised controlled trial using predefined criteria. Secondary outcomes were participants’ MI ability using the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised, mental chronometry tests, hand laterality judgement and semi-structured interviews, autonomic function. Results A total of 35 participants completed the study. The feasibility of a larger study was confirmed, despite 35% attrition related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excellent MI capabilities were seen in participants, and significant correlations between MI ability measures. Interview results showed that participants accepted or liked both interventions. Seven major themes and insider recommendations for MI interventions emerged. No significant differences and negligible to medium effects were observed in MI ability or autonomic function between baseline and post-intervention measures or between groups. Conclusions Results showed that neither activating nor relaxing MI seems to change autonomic function in healthy individuals. Further adequately powered studies are required to answer open questions remaining from this study. Future studies should investigate effects of different MI types over a longer period, to rule out habituation and assess autonomic function at several time points and simultaneously with MI."
