The amino-acid composition2 of the active substance (MSH) is consistent with the view that it is an octadecapeptide containing the following amino-acid residues: Arg1 Asp2, Glu2, Gly2, His1, Lys2, Met1 Phe1 Pro3, Ser1 Try1, Tyr1"

https://openalex.org/W1977395374,"A FEW years ago, Lederberg and his co-workers1,2 found that in Bact. coli K-12 there was a difference in sex-compatibility between the two mating cells, one having a transmissible agent, F, and the other lacking this agent. Hayes3 demonstrated that these mating types were very stable heritable characters; but the accidental disappearance of the F factor was found by Lederberg et al. 1, and by Hayes4. The study reported here reveals that it is possible to obtain F − cells at will from F + cells under certain environmental conditions. This phenomenon may be called ‘F elimination’. The environmental factor responsible for F elimination is the cobalt or nickel concentration in the medium (Co(NO3)2, CoCl2, etc.; Ni(NO3)2, NiSO4, etc.)."

A slight reduction in sensitivity of adult rats to whole-body irradiation has also been shown3 by reduction of their body temperature to 18° or 19° C. The development of a technique for inducing hypothermia in rats by Andjus and Smith4, and recently extended to mice by Goldzweig and Smith5, has enabled us to demonstrate considerable protection in adult mice irradiated at a body temperature of 0–1° C."

In continuation of these studies it was found that a partially purified enzyme preparation was inactivated by dialysis and reactivated by a thermostable factor from liver. This factor has been isolated and identified as hypoxanthine. EXPERIMENTAL"

The early researches of Kruckenberg (1882) and of MacMunn (1883) on the pigments of Helix pomatia revealed the presence of a not well-characterized carotenoid and of some chlorophyll in the liver of this snail. Lonnberg studied extensively the pigments of marine molluscs, and Lederer described two new carotenoids in the marine species Pectunculus glycymeris and Pecten maximus
