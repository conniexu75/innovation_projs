https://openalex.org/W1567148937,"A method is presented for the preparation of a native epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-kinase complex of molecular weight 170,000 from A-431 cells. Although this receptor complex is capable of binding EGF, noncovalently, in quantities similar to the previously isolated 150,000 complex (Cohen, S., Carpenter, G., and King, L., Jr. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4834-4842), the 170,000 preparation has 5 to 10 times the intrinsic kinase activity (autophosphorylation). However, the 170,000 kinase activity toward other proteins is lower than that of the 150,000 preparation. Both the 170,000 and 150,000 kinase activities are enhanced by EGF. The 170,000 and 150,000 proteins are also capable of forming covalent linkages to 125I-EGF, and each is precipitated by antisera directed against the 170,000 protein. We suggest the 150,000 protein is a proteolytic degradation product of the 170,000 protein. The EGF-enhanced kinase activity of the 170,000 preparation remains associated with the 125I-EGF-binding activity following EGF affinity chromatography, electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels, or immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel-purified 170,000 protein. These results indicate that the receptor, kinase, and substrate domains are linked, possibly covalently."

https://openalex.org/W2082720444,"Seventy-five Tn5 and three Tn3 insertions were generated, characterized and mapped in the pTiA6NC plasmid sequences which are stably integrated in crown gall tumors (T-DNA). Four mutants containing Tn5 insertions in a specific region of the T-DNA incited tumors that no longer synthesized octopine. No single insertion resulted in complete loss of oncogenicity. Twenty-five transposon insertions defined three distinct loci affecting tumor morphology. The first group (tml), of seven mutants, contained Tn5 insertions within a 1.25 kilobase (kb) region and incited tumors two to three times larger than normal. The second group (tmr), of nine mutants, incited tumors with a massive amount of roots proliferating from the tumor callus and contained Tn5 insertions in a 1 kb cluster. The third group (tms), of nine mutants, incited tumors with shoots growing from the tumor callus and contained three Tn3 insertions and six Tn5 insertions distributed over a 3.1 kb region. Each of these loci was separated by Tn5 insertions that did not noticeably change tumor formation. We identified two more regions of the T-DNA where transposon insertions did not appear to affect tumor morphology: one contained 28 Tn5 insertions distributed over 3.2 kb; the other contained 17 Tn5 insertions distributed over 7 kb and the octopine synthesis locus. A detailed functional map of the T-DNA of pTiA6NC resulted from the characterization of these insertions. The incorporation of Tn5 sequences into the plant genome was also demonstrated. We discuss these results in relation to the map location of tumor-derived RNA transcribed from the T-DNA, the role of phytohormones in crown gall tumorigenesis and the eventual use of the Ti plasmid as a vehicle for introducing genes of choice into the genomes of higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2039571451,"Cross hybridization between maize mitochondrial DNA fragments and a specific yeast mitochondrial DNA probe from the oxi 1 gene has been used to identify and isolate the maize mitochondrial gene coding cytochrome oxidase subunit II, mox 1. The DNA sequence reveals two coding regions separated from each other by a single centrally located intervening sequence. Hybridization of mox 1 DNA probes to mitochondrial RNA from plants shows that te gene is transcribed and indicates that several transcripts are spliced. TGA codons, which code Trp in the mitochondria of all species examined to date, do not occur in this gene. However, alignment of the mox 1 gene sequence with the amino acid sequences of subunit II from other organisms strongly suggests that codon CGG (normally Arg) codes for Trp in maize mitochondria, in addition to the standard Trp codon TGG."
https://openalex.org/W2167110107,"A DNA segment close to the 5' end of the chicken adult beta-globin gene contains a hypersensitive site for nuclease action. Using a variety of endonucleases, we show that this hypersensitive site is in fact an accessible region, which extends from approximately 60 to approximately 260 base pairs 5' from the start of mRNA transcription. The presence of this hypersensitive region is correlated with gene activity; it is observed in nuclei isolated from the definitive erythrocytes of 14-day chicken embryos, but is not observed in nuclei isolated from the primitive erythrocytes of 5-day embryos (which do not express this gene) or in brain nuclei or purified DNA. The close spacing of accessible digestion sites on this DNA segment is not consistent with the presence of a normal nucleosome. Furthermore, a 115 base pair DNA fragment contained within this nuclease-sensitive region can be excised by Msp I digestion and released from nuclei, in at least 50% yield. Approximately one third of the released fragments behave as protein-free DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2001851867,"We have prepared several infectious stocks of an avian retrovirus, spleen necrosis virus, containing the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (tk) gene. The viruses were produced after cotransfection of chicken cells with DNA from recombinants between cloned spleen necrosis virus and tk DNAs and DNA of cloned reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A. removal of sequences in the tk gene for the end of tk mRNA increased a thousand fold the yield of infectious recombinant virus. Infection of chicken or rat tk- cells with the recombinant virus transformed them to a tk+ phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1533883995,"The nucleotide sequence of the yeast gene TRP5 and its 5' and 3' flanking regions was determined. The deduced coding sequence for tryptophan synthase contains 2,127 base pairs. The protein chain has a calculated molecular weight of 76,544. Yeast tryptophan synthase, a bifunctional protein, has a primary structure which corresponds to an Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase alpha chain-beta chain fusion. An NH2-terminal 239 amino acid segment of yeast tryptophan synthase is homologous with E. coli tryptophan synthase alpha subunit, while a distal 389 amino acid residue segment is homologous to the E. coli tryptophan synthase beta chain. This order of segments of the yeast enzyme is the reverse of the chromosomal order characteristic of all prokaryotes that have been examined. The two segments are joined by a connecting region of 28 residues in the yeast enzyme which is not homologous to either the alpha or beta chains of the bacterial enzyme. A portion of the connecting region of yeast tryptophan synthase exhibits nucleotide sequence similarity to the 3' terminus of E. coli trpC and the trpC-trpB intercistronic region. Active site cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues in the beta 2 subunit of E. coli tryptophan synthase are conserved in the yeast enzyme. Also conserved in the yeast enzyme are 6/8 amino acid residues having an important role in maintaining the structure and function of the E. coli tryptophan synthase alpha subunit. S1 nuclease mapping was used to identify three major mRNA transcripts with different 5' termini. Potential T-A-T-A sites for transcription initiation were identified, as well as other sequences that occur frequently in yeast genes. A 5' flanking region of TRP5 was shown by DNA/DNA hybridization to be present in multiple copies in the yeast genome. TRP5 mRNA levels, measured by RNA/DNA hybridization, increased 2- to 7-fold in response to starvation for either tryptophan or histidine, indicating transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1510003654,"Many polypeptides translated in the cytosol enter the chloroplast where they assemble into macromolecular complexes. The transport of these polypeptides into the plastid can be examined in vitro by mixing isolated chloroplasts with pea poly(A) RNA translation products. Following optimization of both translation in the wheat germ system and the conditions during in vitro uptake, we observe the post-translational transport of over 100 polypeptides; many remain in the soluble phase of the organelle while others integrate into the thylakoid membranes. Most products transported in vitro co-migrate with in vivo products on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, with the improved conditions, we demonstrate the transport of plastocyanin, ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase into isolated plastids. While we have not been able to detect any cell-free translation product that is immunologically related to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, both plastocyanin and ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase are synthesized as precursors in vitro. These precursors are imported into the organelle where they are processed to the size of their mature counterparts. As determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of the precursor to plastocyanin is 15,000 larger than the mature product and the precursor to ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase is 8,000 larger than the mature product."
https://openalex.org/W2049406279,"The mating-type locus (MAT) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a complex locus that codes for the regulators of cell type. Two unique messages are transcribed from each MAT allele. Using the in vitro mutagenesis technique whereby synthetic oligonucleotides containing restriction sites (linkers) were inserted into plasmids, we have constructed a series of mutations in cloned DNA containing either the MATa or MATα locus. The new restriction site associated with each “linker” mutation has allowed the mutation to be mapped and sequenced. We have complemented genetically defined mutations (mata1, matα1 and matα2) with plasmids containing these in vitro mutations by yeast transformation, thereby mapping the genes onto the DNA sequence. MATa1 has been localized to the MATa unique region (Ya) from which the a1 message is transcribed. We find no function for the other MATa message by using our complementation assay. MATα1 maps to the MATα unique (Yα) and adjacent (Z) region from which the α1 message is transcribed. MATα2 maps to the other major message found in the common (X) region of the MATα loci. Although most linker mutations that have a mutant phenotype appear to disrupt the translated portion of each gene, two mutations may disrupt transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1570782502,"Hen oviduct nuclei were subjected to pancreatic DNase I treatment under conditions known to preferentially degrade transcriptionally active genes (Weintraub, H., and Groudine, M. (1976) Science (Wash. D. C.) 93, 848-856). The ovalbumin gene, its structurally related genes, X and Y, and the spacer and flanking DNA were all found to exist in a DNase I-sensitive configuration. The DNase I-sensitive region was extended more than 20 kilobases beyond the 5‘ end of the X gene and approximately an equal distance beyond the 3‘ end of the ovalbumin gene before it became DNase I-resistant. The transition from a DNase I-sensitive to a -resistant conformation in oviduct chromatin occurred in a gradient fashion with 10 kilobases of DNA. Thus, ovalbumin and its related genes, X and Y, exist in a 100-kilobase DNase-sensitive domain in the oviduct tissue. In contrast, the entire domain was resistant to DNase I in spleen, liver, and erythrocyte nuclei. When the transcription of ovalbumin, X, and Y genes was eliminated by the withdrawal of hormone from estrogen-stimulated chicks, the entire domain remained in a DNase I-sensitive configuration. We conclude that DNase I-sensitive domains may provide the structural capability for gene expression and appear to be a result of the differentiation process since they are cell-specific and contain potentially expressible genes of that cell type. Repetitive sequences within this domain have been mapped and the possible relationship of these repetitive sequences to the DNase I-sensitive structure is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2088018982,"Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (T-MuEV) is the agent of a persistent, demyelinating infection of the central nervous system of mice, T-MuEV RNA was detected in histological sections of brain and spinal cord of experimentally infected animals by in situ hybridization. Both neurons and glial cells contained viral RNA during the early acute phase of the disease, The amount of viral RNA in neurons, however, was considerably higher than in glial cells. During the late demyelinating phase of the disease, viral RNA was found in low amounts only in glial cells of the white matter of spinal cord. At that stage, no viral RNA was found in neurons. These results demonstrate that T-MuEV persists in glial cells of the white matter. A reconstruction of the pathogenesis of this persistent infection is proposed, based on the different levels of virus replication in neurons and glial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1527373967,"Incorporation of 32P into yeast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) was observed after addition of glucose to a cell suspension incubated with (32P)orthophosphoric acid. The 32P counts were coincident with the enzyme band when immunoprecipitates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of phosphate was associated with a decrease in enzyme activity. Approximately 1 mol of phosphate was incorporated/mol of enzyme. The phosphate is bound to the enzyme in a phosphoester linkage with a serine residue. Release of 32P accompanying enzyme reactivation was observed both in vivo and in cell-free extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1521628010,"Activation of the desulfo forms of milk xanthine oxidase, chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase with S2- is greatly facilitated in the presence of reducing agents. Upon anaerobic incubation with 1 mM S2- and 1 mM dithionite, desulfo xanthine oxidase and chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase prepared by cyanide treatment of active enzymes, are activated to the specific activity predicted by their molybdenum content. Routine preparations containing desulfo molecules are also similarly activated to the extent predicted. Cyanide-inactivated chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase was reconstituted with 35S2- in the presence of dithionite. 85% of enzyme-bound radioactivity was shown to be in the form of cyanolyzable sulfur, by comparison of enzyme activity, bound radioactivity, and 35SCN- yields from exposure of labeled enzyme to cyanide. This radiolabeled enzyme allowed the determination of the following. 1) The cyanolyzable sulfur is largely removed from the polypeptide by incubation at 37 degrees C for one hour in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 7, or for 15 min in 6 M guanidinium chloride, pH 6.2. 2) The cyanolyzable sulfur is acid labile. [35S]Methylene blue is formed in the theoretical quantity from oxidized or substrate-reduced enzyme under the standard conditions for labile sulfur analysis by the methylene blue method. These data strongly support the conclusion that the cyanolyzable sulfur is a terminal sulfur ligand of the Mo atom, and is not part of an organic moiety."

https://openalex.org/W2107900773,"One measurable biological activity of early adenovirus genes is their ability to promote growth of the defective adeno-associated virus, AAV. We have identified an ordered sequence of communications among the early genes of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) that results in expression of the helper activity. We purified DNA fragments and mRNAs corresponding to early Ad2 regions E1, E2A, E3 and E4 and injected them via glass capillaries into AAV-infected cells. DNAs were placed in the nucleus, mRNAs in the cytoplasm. AAV DNA and proteins synthesized in response to the injected Ad2 nucleic acids were extracted from as few as 100 cells and identified by gel electrophoresis. Our results reveal a cascade of early Ad2 gene regulation, E1 → E2A → E4, with E4 providing the helper effect for AAV."

https://openalex.org/W2135005590,"The rRNA genes of Xenopus blood cells are heavily methylated, but there are two regions in the spacer that frequently contain unmethylated CpG. The undermethylated regions coincide with two regions containing a 60 nucleotide tandemly repeated sequence, and they are present in all somatic tissues that we have tested. Sperm rDNA, by contrast, is fully methylated at these sites in the spacer, and indirect evidence suggests that this may also be the case in oocytes. Loss of methyl groups occurs progressively over the first 20 hr of development, the same period in which embryonic rRNA synthesis initiates and increases in rate."
https://openalex.org/W2095301565,"In Dictyostelium discoideum most of the rRNA genes are known to be present as linear, extrachromosomal palindromic molecules. Here we report the identification, molecular cloning and partial DNA sequence analysis of the terminal Eco RI restriction fragment (Eco RI 1) of the rDNA. We identify a length heterogeneity confined to the most distal region of uncloned Eco RI 1, and demonstrate, by DNA sequence analysis of five independently isolated recombinant plasmids containing the Eco RI 1 fragment, that the heterogeneity can be accounted for by variable tracts of an unprecedented irregular satellite sequence with the general formula [CnT]m; n varies from 1 to 8 and accounts for the irregularity, while m varies from 18 to 34 and accounts for the length heterogeneity. The proximal [CnT]m pattern is identical (albeit irregular) in all five clones of Eco RI 1, while the distal [CnT]m sequence appears to vary between clones. Immediately proximal to the CnT satellite are found four nearly perfect tandem repeats of a 29 bp sequence. We discuss the evolution of these simple sequences at the rDNA termini and speculate about possible functions for the CnT satellite. Using the cloned terminal restriction fragment as probe, we also show that virtually all the rDNA in Dictyostelium exists in the linear palindromic form."

https://openalex.org/W2061294734,"In sequencing a 2200 bp region of the Neurospora crassa mitochondrial DNA encoding the 3' end of the large rRNA gene and a cluster of six tRNA genes, we have found that the tRNA genes are flanked by highly conserved GC-rich palindromic DNA sequences. An 18 bp long core sequence, 5'-CC CTGCAG TA CTGCAG GG-3', containing two closely spaced Pst I sites, is common to all these palindromic sequences. Each of the eight Pst I sites mapped in the 2200 bp region consists of two closely spaced Pst I sites; thus this 2200 bp long segment actually contains 16 Pst I sites. Between 5-10% of the N. crassa DNA may consist of these GC-rich palindromic sequences that include the 18 base long core sequence. The same core sequence is present within both the 5' and 3' side of the intervening sequence of the large rRNA gene, close to, but not at, the intron-exon boundaries. We discuss probable roles for these sequences in N. crassa mitochondrial function, including their role as signals either in the synthesis or processing (or both) of RNA in the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2022673076,"An examination of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuL V)-hematopoietic cell interaction in cultures of fetal tissues reveals that A-MuLV can stimulate the formation of two different types of colonies. One type of colony is white and composed of A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells that can develop into established cell lines. These cells are indistinguishable in morphology from typical adult-derived lymphoid transformants. The second type of colony is pink or red and composed of erythroid cells in various stages of differentiation. Although A-MuLV is required to induce the erythroid colonies, and at least some cells in all of these colonies are infected with the virus, no permanently growing cell lines have been established from the cells in these colonies. The frequency of the two types of colonies varies depending upon the tissue and the gestational age of the embryo. Erythroid colonies are found following infection of early and mid gestation tissues while lymphoid colonies are found following infection of mid and late gestation tissues. Mixing experiments indicate that the two types of colonies arise from distinct target cells. Because A-MuLV mutants that are defective for lymphoid cell transformation are also defective for erythroid colony induction, expression of a functional Abelson protein is probably required for colony induction. Thus A-MuLV is capable of stimulating the cells of two distinct hematopoietic lineages. In one case, infection leads to transformation, while in the second, it leads to growth and differentiation. Both types of interaction are mediated, at least in part, by the same A-MuLV gene product, a molecule previously considered to induce transformation in all stably infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2004639615,"Closed superhelical replicative intermediates of SV40 DNA were stable during incubation at elevated temperatures for prolonged times. However, when the replicative intermediates were nicked or made linear by digestion either outside or inside of the replication loop, the nascent DNA strands were spontaneously extruded at a measurable rate even at 37 degrees C. The extruded DNA was double-stranded. The rate-limiting step in the extrusion was not the rate of branch migration. The instability of replication loops suggested a method for the isolation of replication origins. The method has been tested by a reconstruction experiment in which a small amount of linear SV40 replicative intermediates was mixed with a vast excess of cellular DNA. The mixture was heated overnight at 55 degrees C, and the spontaneously extruded nascent strands were isolated and inserted into pBR322. Plasmids containing SV40 DNA of less than genomic size, symmetrically distributed about the SV40 replication origin, were isolated. This result suggests that the method is generally applicable to the isolation of replication origins."
https://openalex.org/W1517922725,"It is known that the administration of parathyroid hormone to dogs results in phosphaturia and decreased phosphate transport in brush-border vesicles isolated from the kidneys of those dogs. Parathyroid hormone has been shown to activate adenylate cyclase at the basal-lateral membrane of the renal proximal tubular cell. It has been postulated that parathyroid hormone-induced phosphaturia is effected through phosphorylation of brush-border protein by membrane-bound cAMP-dependent protein kinase. An experimental system was designed such that phosphorylation of brush-border vesicles and Na+-stimulated solute transport could be studied in the same preparations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of membrane vesicles revealed cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of 2 protein bands (Mr = 96,000 and 62,000), which was enhanced by exposure of the inside of the membrane vesicles to ATP and cAMP. Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of brush-border vesicles was accompanied by inhibition of Na+-stimulated Pi but not D-glucose transport or 22Na+ uptake. When renal brush-border vesicles from parathyroidectomized and normal dogs were phosphorylated in vitro in the presence and absence of cAMP, both the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of Na+-stimulated Pi transport were greater in vesicles isolated from kidneys of parathyroidectomized dogs relative to control animals. We conclude that the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of brush-border membrane-vesicle proteins is associated with specific inhibition of Na+-stimulated Pi transport. The phosphaturic action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) could be mediated through the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of specific brush-border membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1566665463,"Analogs of a synthetic heptapeptide substrate corresponding to the sequence around a phosphorylation site in histone H2B were used to assess the substrate specificity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. cGMP-dependent kinase phosphorylated the oligopeptide Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu with favorable kinetic parameters as compared to those for cAMP-dependent kinase (Glass, D. B., and Krebs, E. G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9728-9738). The contribution of each amino acid to the ability of the peptide to be phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent or cAMP-dependent kinase was studied by replacement of individual residues and evaluation of the kinetic constants of the substituted peptides. Peptides containing acetylated lysine residues or nitroarginine residues were poor substrates for both kinases. Substitution of either arginine 29 or lysine 30 with alanine increased the Km values and decreased the Vmax values for both kinases. Substitution of lysine 34 with alanine increased the Vmax values for both kinases but did not affect the Km values for either enzyme. Substitution of the phosphorylatable serine with a threonine residue greatly depressed the Vmax for both kinases. Peptides in which arginine 31 or arginine 33 were replaced by an alanine residue revealed several apparent differences in the specificity requirements between cGMP-dependent and cAMP-dependent kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1511852607,"Carbon monoxide:methylene blue oxidoreductase, the key enzyme of CO-oxidation in energy metabolism of the carboxydobacterium Pseudomonas carboxydovorans, has been isolated in good yield and purity and found to contain FAD, molybdenum, iron, and labile sulfide in the ratio of 1:1:4:4. The enzyme is, therefore, a new molybdenum-containing iron-sulfur flavoprotein, exhibiting chemical and spectral properties quite similar to those of xanthine oxidase. Analytical data on the spectral characteristics of the enzyme in the oxidized and various reduced states are presented. Carbon monoxide:methylene blue oxidoreductase turned out to be photoreducible in the presence of EDTA and urea and was subject to reoxidation by air oxygen; no flavoprotein semiquinone was formed. Unphysiological electron acceptors, e.g. methylene blue, were used as oxidizing substrates whereas NAD or NADP turned out to be ineffective. Methylene blue reduction with CO was not affected by the presence of allopurinol, and carbon monoxide:methylene blue oxidoreductase was not able to catalyze the reduction of methylene blue with xanthine, adenine, or aldehydes. CO was the only reducing substrate used by the enzyme. Carbon monoxide:methylene blue oxidoreductase formed no sulfite adduct, and the reactivity with ferricyanide or cytochrome c was significant but slow. As known for other molybdenum hydroxylases, carbon monoxide:methylene blue oxidoreductase was rapidly inactivated by methanol, but the enzyme exhibited no ability to catalyze the oxidation of NADH with methylene blue, and NAD was not able to overcome methanol inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2053758858,"The nature of the cell-derived (bas) sequences of BALB-MuSV, a spontaneous mouse sarcoma virus isolate, was determined. Molecularly cloned bas sequences demonstrated no detectable homology with the onc genes of other mouse transforming viruses, but exhibited a high degree of sequence homology with the ras gene of the rat-derived Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) genome. The Ha-MuSV cell-derived sequence (ras) shared a colinear 750 bp region of homology with bas. Moreover, BALB-MuSV transformation was associated with the expression of high levels of a 21,000 dalton protein, immunologically related to the ras gene products, p21. Thus bas and ras represent retroviral transforming gene homologs that were independently transduced by mouse type C viruses from the genomes of different species."
https://openalex.org/W1501136907,"Using cultured GHI cells, we have studied the organization in chromatin of the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor. We have previously shown that the receptor protein can be extracted from nuclei with 0.4 M KC1 as a 3.8 S species, and that micrococcal nuclease excises the receptor as an abundant 6.5 S form and a less abundant 12.5 S form (Samuels, H. H., Stanley, F., Casanova, J., and Shao, T. C. (1980) J Biol. Chem. 255, 2499-2508). These studies suggested that the 12.5 S form represents the receptor excised in association with mononucleosomes, while the 6.5 S form represents receptor excised in association with linker DNA and possibly other components. In this study, DNase I digestion was used to further characterize the structure of the 6.5 S receptor. We have found that DNase I excises the receptor initially as a 6.5 S form which is then converted to a series of slower sedimenting peaks approaching 3.8 S. The 6.5 S form does not bind duplex DNA, while the DNase I-generated smaller forms are DNA binding species, indicating that DNA may be a component of the 6.5 S species. In addition, using ultracentrifugation in DZO-containing gradients and Sepharose CL-GB column chromatography, we have determined the density (p) , Stokes radius (Rs), and frictional ratio due to shape ( f / f o ) s h a p e for the 6.5 S and 3.8 s forms. For the 3.8 S form, M, = 54,000, R, = 3.3 nm, p = 1.36 g/cm3, and ( f / f i ) & , p e = 1.212, indicating a relatively globular structure. For the 6.5 S form, M, = 149,000, R, = 6.0 nm, p = 1.42 g/cm3, and ( f / f o ) * h a p e = 1.36, indicating a more asymmetric form. The density of the 3.8 S form is characteristic of protein, and assuming that the density increment of the 6.5 S form reflects an associated DNA fragment, the 6.5 S species was calculated to be composed of 85% protein (Mr = 127,000) and 15% DNA (Mr = 22,000) equivalent to 36 base pairs. These results suggest that the receptor may exist as an oligomer in chromatin or in association with other discrete proteins complexed with DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2032358077,"A syndrome of germline abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster called hybrid dysgenesis is thought to be caused by transposable genetic elements known as P factors. Several lines of evidence presented here show that the chromosomal positions of at least some P factors can be identified as points of frequent chromosome breakage (hotspots). Starting with a strain (pi 2) in which four hotspots had been identified on the X chromosome, we found individual hotspots vanished when their part of the chromosome was replaced by the homologous part from a strain known to lack P factors. All hotspots in the non-substituted parts of the chromosome remained functional, indicating that they can act autonomously. We also observed a new breakage site coinciding with the appearance of an unstable mutation at the singed bristle locus (snW). This mutation was dysgenesis-induced, and previous genetic evidence suggested that it was caused by the insertion of a P factor at that locus. We also present preliminary evidence for rapid scrambling of the positions of hotspots under certain conditions, and we describe a new procedure for efficiently determining the positions of hotspots on a given chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2105199301,"Harvey and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses have previously been shown to transform fibroblastic cells in culture, and type C virus pseudotypes of these viruses cause erythroleukemia in susceptible mice. We report a cell culture assay for quantitating the growth-promoting effect of Harvey and Kirsten viruses on erythroid cells. Murine hemopoietic cells were infected in vitro with Harvey or Kirsten sarcoma virus, and then cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of relatively low concentrations of erythropoietin. Under these conditions, large colonies of erythroid cells form in the semi-solid culture media 6 to 8 days after infection. The induction of erythroid bursts was not caused by the murine type C helper viruses used to pseudotype either Ha-MuSV or Ki-MuSV, or by media from cells carrying the Ki-MuSV and Ha-MuSV genomes. Induction of the erythroid colonies is under genetic control at the Fv1 susceptibility locus, but not at the Fv2 susceptibility locus. A striking feature of the erythroid colonies induced by the Harvey and Kirsten viruses was that they not only proliferated to large size but also differentiated along the erythroid lineage and synthesized hemoglobin. The results indicate that Ha-MuSV and Ki-MuSV can induce proliferation of erythroid precursor cells apparently without interfering with the differentiation program of the cells. The relation between the growth-promotion effect of these viruses on erythroid precursor cells and their ability to induce erythroleukemia is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1529674136,"The BC3H1 nonfusing muscle cell line possesses binding sites for [3H]prazosin. These binding sites are typically alpha 1 adrenergic receptors as shown by their greater affinity (3700-fold) for prazosin than for yohimbine. Both kinetic and equilibrium analyses indicated that [3H]prazosin interacted with only one category of independent binding sites with the following characteristics. KD = 0.13 +/- 0.01 nM. Bmax = 97 +/- 5 fmol/mg of protein corresponding to 25,000 sites/cell (n = 17). Biosynthesis of the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor was investigated at cell confluency (when the number of cells and their total protein content were constant). Phenoxybenzamine (10(-9) M) irreversibly blocked 50% of the alpha 1 receptors in intact cells. More than 95% blockade of receptors was obtained with 10(-7) M phenoxybenzamine. After this blockade, new alpha 1 adrenergic receptors reappeared in the cells with monoexponential kinetics. These new receptors corresponded to synthesized receptors since their appearance was blocked by cycloheximide (1 micrograms/ml). The cycloheximide action was reversible. If one makes the simple and probable hypotheses that the receptor production is constant and that degradation is a monoexponential process, the analysis of the kinetics of reappearance allows the determination of the rate constant for receptor degradation (k = 0.03 h-1) and the rate of receptor production (r = 3.2 fmol/mg/h) corresponding to the synthesis of about 760 receptors/cell/h. The half-life of the receptor was 23 h."
https://openalex.org/W2092157851,"We previously showed that in vitro translation of M-MuSV virion RNA yielded a 62 kd gag gene product and an overlapping set of four proteins with approximate molecular weights of 37,000, 33,000, 24,000 and 18,000. In this paper we show, by use of hybrid arrest translation with cloned recombinant DNAs containing M-MuSV v-mosMo sequences, that the 37, 33, 24 and 18 kd proteins are synthesized in their entirety from the v-mosMo gene. Analysis of the primary sequence of these proteins shows that each one is initiated independently from AUG codons within the v-mosMo gene and utilizes the long open reading frame predicted from the v-mosMo DNA sequence. Antisera against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C terminus of the predicted v-mosMo gene product precipitate all four in vitro v-mosMo proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1508904094,"Translation of globin mRNA in a micrococcal nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate was studied in the presence of increasing amounts of Mengovirus RNA, under conditions in which the number of translation initiation events remains constant as judged by the transfer of label from N-formyl[35S]methionyl-tRNAf into protein. The translation of globin mRNA is progressively inhibited by low concentrations of Mengovirus RNA, free of detectable traces of double-stranded RNA, concomitant with the increasing synthesis of Mengovirus RNA-directed products. On a molar basis, Mengovirus RNA apparently competes about 35 times more effectively than globin mRNA for a critical component in translation. The competition is relieved by the addition of highly purified eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). Addition of eIF-2 does not stimulate overall protein synthesis, but shifts it in favor of globin synthesis. No stimulation of globin mRNA translation by eIF-2 is seen when Mengovirus RNA is absent. These experiments show that Mengovirus RNA competes, directly or indirectly, with globin mRNA for eIF-2. In direct binding experiments using isolated mRNA and eIF-2, Mengovirus RNA is shown to compete with globin mRNA for eIF-2 and to exhibit a 30-fold higher affinity for this factor. The binding of Mengovirus RNA to eIF-2 is much more resistant to increasing salt concentrations than is the binding of globin mRNA, again reflecting its high affinity. These results reveal a direct correlation between the ability of these mRNA species to compete in translation and their ability to bind to initiation factor eIF-2. They suggest that the affinity of a given mRNA species for eIF-2 is essential in determining its translation, relative to that of other mRNA species. Messenger RNA competition for eIF-2 may contribute significantly to the selective translation of viral RNA in infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023078955,"Abstract Classical genetic methods have previously been used to show that the DEL1 mutator gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces a high rate of multisite mutations that encompass three genes adjacent to itself: CYC1, OSM1 and RAD7 . To determine the molecular nature of these multisite mutations, we purified DNA from a DEL1 strain (SL403-4D) and ten independently isolated multisite mutations derived from it. The DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases, separated on agarose gels, blotted to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized with various probes previously cloned from the CYC1 region of strains S288C and B-596. Our results indicate that the CYC1 region of DEL1 strain SL403-4D differs from that of another yeast strain, S288C, whose restriction map had previously been determined by other investigators. Relative to S288C, the DEL1 strain contains two pieces of extra DNA of about 6 kb each that are homologous to Ty1, and that surround an approximately 13 kb piece of DNA which is essentially identical to its counterpart in S288C. This 13 kb piece includes the entire CYC1 gene, but excludes sup4 . Each of the ten independently isolated multisite mutations obtained from SL403-4D is missing the 13 kb piece of single copy DNA surrounded by the Ty elements, but is not missing any of the DNA on the other sides of the elements. Thus the multisite mutations are physical deletions. Furthermore, the ten mutations are not identical, but fall into five distinct classes, which seem to differ in the presence or orientation of parts of the surrounding Ty elements. These results suggest that the Ty elements directly participate in the formation of these deletions, as do transposable elements in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1483039208,"Abstract Previous 77Se NMR relaxation time studies established the utility of 77Se NMR spectroscopy in studying low molecular weight (less than 500) selenium-containing molecules. Since the spin rotation and chemical shift anisotrophy mechanisms contributed significantly to the 77Se spin-lattice relaxation in these compounds, it was questionable as to whether the latter mechanism would be efficient enough to enable 77Se resonances to be observed in a reasonable period in high molecular weight selenobiomolecules. Thus, to address this problem, disulfide bonds of ribonuclease-A and lysozyme were reductively cleaved under denaturing conditions, and the resulting 7-8 sulfhydryl groups were treated with a new sulfhydryl group reagent containing selenium, 6,6'-diselenobis(3-nitrobenzoic acid), to give proteins containing covalently attached selenium in the form of selenenyl sulfides. The observation of high resolution 77Se NMR spectra of these proteins under denaturing conditions was accomplished. Five to six 77Se NMR resonances, which fell in a chemical shift range of 14-15 ppm, were observed for each protein and are compared to the chemical shifts of several model selenenyl sulfides derived from cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1571265449,"We have studied regulation of synthesis of long chain bases in human fibroblasts using 3 different radioactive precursors and 2 different hydrolysis and separation procedures. Serum and low density lipoproteins inhibited synthesis. Inhibition of long chain base synthesis by various concentrations of low density lipoproteins paralleled inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. This inhibition was dependent on the low density lipoprotein receptor pathway since fibroblasts from homozygous familial hypercholesterolemic patients did not show the inhibition observed with normal fibroblasts. Incorporation of precursor palmitate into free or total long chain bases was inhibited by low density lipoproteins to the same extent as incorporation into sphingomyelin long chain bases. We thus propose that an enzyme in the pathway leading to sphinganine synthesis, probably palmitoyl-CoA:L-serine C-palmitoyltransferase (decarboxylating) EC 2.3.1.50, is regulated by low density lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1623702843,"Pro-opiomelanocortin, the common glycoprotein precursor to adrenocorticotropin and beta-lipotropin, is the most abundant protein synthesized in rat neurointermediate lobes. Dissected rat neurointermediate lobes were incubated in the presence of canavanine, an analog of arginine, to determine (a) whether canavanine could be incorporated into pro-opiomelanocortin molecules and (b) if incorporation occurs, whether there is any effect on the processing mechanism of the prohormone. Preincubation of rat neurointermediate lobes for 16 h in the presence of 10 mM canavanine results in the production of pro-opiomelanocortin molecules in which most, if not all, the arginine residues have been replaced by canavanine. Identification of canavanine-containing pro-opiomelanocortin forms was done by two-dimensional electrophoresis, tryptic and chymotryptic peptide mapping, as well as by analysis, on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, of the fragments resulting from a partial digestion with chymotrypsin. During pulse-chase experiments, canavanine-containing pro-opiomelanocortin molecules were found to be processed at a much slower rate than the normal precursor forms: after a 2-h chase, conversion of approximately 25% of the analog-containing prophormone was observed compared to 83% of the nonanalog-containing precursors. Moreover, the small proportion of canavanine-containing precursor molecules which had undergone cleavage during the chase yielded atypical large molecular weight peptides. These results indicate that canavanine incorporation into neurointermediate lobe proteins considerably slows down the conversion of pro-opiomelanocortin into its different end products."
https://openalex.org/W2057750790,"Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) exhibit increases in both a cell-associated and a secreted form of plasminogen activator (PA). The mechanism whereby the membrane-bound, cell-associated form of PA is processed to an extracellular, soluble form has been examined in cultures of chicken fibroblasts transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of RSV. We report that chymostatin, a protease inhibitor of limited specificity, inhibits the release of PA from tsRSVCEF while causing accumulation of cell-associated PA. Chymostatin's effect on PA release is specific, reversible and appears to be due to its anti-proteolytic capacity. Chymostatin does not inhibit cellular protein synthesis or interfere in the assay used to measure PA. A chymostatin-sensitive protease activity has been found in a membrane fraction isolated from tsRSVCEF."
https://openalex.org/W1555740660,"The hormonal regulation of glycogen synthase has been studied with isolated perfused hearts that were depleted of 85% of their endogenous glycogen. Glycogen depletion alone promoted a 3-fold activation of glycogen synthase and magnified by 3-fold the response to insulin. Glycogen depletion also facilitated the detection of epinephrine-promoted glycogen synthase inactivation. Hormonal effects on glycogen synthase have been correlated with changes in phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, and tissue cAMP levels. Insulin activation of glycogen synthase was observed within 90 s of hormone addition and was maximal by 4 min. A half-maximum effect was obtained at an insulin concentration of 100 microunits/ml. Insulin-dependent activation is reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and glucagon. Each promote the same degree of inactivation and the maximum extent of inactivation produced by each is independent of whether or not the tissue has been stimulated with insulin. beta-Adrenergic agonists and glucagon act via cAMP, alpha-agonists most likely act via intracellular Ca2+ translocation, and insulin action would appear to be independent of either cAMP or Ca2+. The action of epinephrine on cardiac glycogen synthase is mediated by interaction with both alpha- and beta-receptors. As indicated by dose-response curves, receptor occupancy of each occurs to an almost equal extent at suboptimal epinephrine concentrations. Regulation of cardiac glycogen synthase by epinephrine thus is mediated by two second messenger systems which converge to produce the end physiological response."
https://openalex.org/W1551868792,"A homogeneous class of enkephalin receptors found in murine neuroblastoma clone N1E-115 (Chang, K.-J., and Cuatrecasas, P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2610-2618) has been confirmed using a centrifugation assay employing cellular membranes. In intact N1E-115 cells, synthetic methionine5-enkephalin inhibited prostaglandin E1-induced intracellular cyclic AMP formation in a naloxone-sensitive manner. Upon demonstrating intracellular methionine5-enkephalin immunocytochemically (Knodel, E., and Richelson, E. (1980) Brain Res. 197, 565-570), analyses of crude N1E-115 extract were made by radioimmunoassay or opiate receptor binding assay following fractionation by molecular sieve chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography on a mu-Bondapak C18 column. Extracted methionine5-enkephalin immunoreactive material behaved similarly to synthetic methionie5-enkephalin in these analyses. Growth curve studies of the N1E-115 cells indicated that the quantity of methionine5-enkephalin immunoreactive material synthesized per milligram of cellular protein and the maximum number of enkephalin receptor sites per milligram of membrane protein increased as the cells progressed from logarithmic to stationary phase, with no change in the apparent affinity of the enkephalin receptors for [3H]methionine5-enkephalin. These data suggest that adrenergic clone N1E-115 has functional methionine5-enkephalin membrane receptors, that this clone synthesizes methionine5-enkephalin, and that both the enkephalin receptor number and the content of stored methionine5-enkephalin are regulated with respect to cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1592768658,"The factors regulating glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) activity and substrate specificity in hepatic microsomes were studied by determining the rate-limiting reaction for the hydrolysis of glucose-6-P, and by examining the effect of detergent activation on phosphotransferase activity. Examination of the pre-steady state kinetics of glucose-6-phosphatase revealed that the steady state rate is determined by the rate of hydrolysis of the enzyme-P intermediate. Treatment of the enzyme with detergent does not alter the extent of the rapid release of glucose per mg of protein, but activates the steady state rate of catalytic turnover. Specificity of the enzyme was evaluated by comparing the effects of mannose and glucose as phosphate acceptors in the phosphotransferase reaction catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase. Untreated glucose-6-phosphatase discriminates against mannose as compared with glucose in that mannose and glucose bind to the enzyme-P intermediate of untreated enzyme, but mannose is not an acceptor of Pi. Mannose is an acceptor, however, after treatment of microsomes with detergent. These data cannot be explained in terms of the currently accepted compartmentation model for the regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase. The detergent-induced changes in kinetic properties appear to reflect alterations in the intrinsic characteristics of glucose-6-phosphatase, which could result from interaction with its membrane environment."

https://openalex.org/W1539223811,"A detailed map of the initiation sites recognized by the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (holoenzyme) on simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA has been constructed. An approach is described in order to compare the sites recognized on supercoiled as well as relaxed linear DNA. For localization of the initiation sites on supercoiled DNA, RNA polymerase-SV40 DNA Form I binary complexes are stabilized by incubation with three ribonucleoside triphosphates. The stable initiation complexes are cleaved with single cut restriction endonucleases in order to generate termination sites at precisely defined locations. Elongation of the RNA chains up to the cleavage site produces a defined set of discrete RNA species, whose size can be determined with accuracy by agarose gel electrophoresis following glyoxal denaturation. Each transcript is oriented by following two different experimental approaches. 1) The DNA of an SV40 deletion mutant is used as a template in comparison with that of wild type SV40; and 2) the RNAs synthesized after cleavage with different single cut restriction endonucleases are compared. Determination of the length and polarity of these RNAs allows us to accurately position the initiation sites on the physical map of the SV40 genome. A similar analysis was conducted for the mapping of the initiation sites recognized on precut linear SV40 DNA. Comparison of the two templates (supercoiled and linear) reveals that modification of the DNA conformation affects selection by the enzyme of certain promoters. Although most of the promoters are common to both templates, four are specifically recognized on superhelical DNA, while two others are used exclusively on linear SV40 DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1557021705,"We have investigated the thermodynamic properties of triiodothyronine (T3)-solubilized hepatic nuclear receptor interaction. These studies revealed that the equilibrium constant was markedly dependent on temperature and van't Hoff plots revealed a significant deviation from linearity. Both enthalpy and entropy changes decreased with increasing temperature such that at 37 degrees C both were negative. (delta H0 -27.1 kcal/mol; delta S0, -45.1 cal/mol.deg; and the heat capacity delta Cp0 (25 degrees C), -759 cal/mol.deg). Several T3 analogues revealed similar thermodynamic characteristics. Our finding that the T3-receptor interaction is characterized by a negative heat capacity is compatible with the previous proposal of hydrophobic bonding by Jorgensen. The large negative entropy change at 37 degrees C for T3-receptor reaction is in contrast to the more positive entropy values for several T3-plasma protein reactions. One possible explanation of this difference in entropy values between the nuclear receptor and plasma proteins is that T3 induces a conformational change in the receptor, a concept supported by previous data from our laboratory indicating that the occupation of the T3 receptor results in an alteration in the chromatographic migration of the receptor."
