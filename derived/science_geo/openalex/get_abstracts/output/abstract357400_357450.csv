https://openalex.org/W2076491580,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the archetypal multipotent progenitor cells derived in cultures of developed organs, are of unknown identity and native distribution. We have prospectively identified perivascular cells, principally pericytes, in multiple human organs including skeletal muscle, pancreas, adipose tissue, and placenta, on CD146, NG2, and PDGF-Rbeta expression and absence of hematopoietic, endothelial, and myogenic cell markers. Perivascular cells purified from skeletal muscle or nonmuscle tissues were myogenic in culture and in vivo. Irrespective of their tissue origin, long-term cultured perivascular cells retained myogenicity; exhibited at the clonal level osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic potentials; expressed MSC markers; and migrated in a culture model of chemotaxis. Expression of MSC markers was also detected at the surface of native, noncultured perivascular cells. Thus, blood vessel walls harbor a reserve of progenitor cells that may be integral to the origin of the elusive MSCs and other related adult stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070306500,"There is an emerging understanding of the importance of the vascular system within stem cell niches. Here, we examine whether neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) lie close to blood vessels, using three-dimensional whole mounts, confocal microscopy, and automated computer-based image quantification. We found that the SVZ contains a rich plexus of blood vessels that snake along and within neuroblast chains. Cells expressing stem cell markers, including GFAP, and proliferation markers are closely apposed to the laminin-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding vascular endothelial cells. Apical GFAP+ cells are admixed within the ependymal layer and some span between the ventricle and blood vessels, occupying a specialized microenvironment. Adult SVZ progenitor cells express the laminin receptor alpha6beta1 integrin, and blocking this inhibits their adhesion to endothelial cells, altering their position and proliferation in vivo, indicating that it plays a functional role in binding SVZ stem cells within the vascular niche."
https://openalex.org/W2108340830,"Stem cells reside in specialized niches that regulate their self-renewal and differentiation. The vasculature is emerging as an important component of stem cell niches. Here, we show that the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cell niche contains an extensive planar vascular plexus that has specialized properties. Dividing stem cells and their transit-amplifying progeny are tightly apposed to SVZ blood vessels both during homeostasis and regeneration. They frequently contact the vasculature at sites that lack astrocyte endfeet and pericyte coverage, a modification of the blood-brain barrier unique to the SVZ. Moreover, regeneration often occurs at these sites. Finally, we find that circulating small molecules in the blood enter the SVZ. Thus, the vasculature is a key component of the adult SVZ neural stem cell niche, with SVZ stem cells and transit-amplifying cells uniquely poised to receive spatial cues and regulatory signals from diverse elements of the vascular system."
https://openalex.org/W2026598324,"Neural stem cells (NSCs, B1 cells) are retained in the walls of the adult lateral ventricles but, unlike embryonic NSCs, are displaced from the ventricular zone (VZ) into the subventricular zone (SVZ) by ependymal cells. Apical and basal compartments, which in embryonic NSCs play essential roles in self-renewal and differentiation, are not evident in adult NSCs. Here we show that SVZ B1 cells in adult mice extend a minute apical ending to directly contact the ventricle and a long basal process ending on blood vessels. A closer look at the ventricular surface reveals a striking pinwheel organization specific to regions of adult neurogenesis. The pinwheel's core contains the apical endings of B1 cells and in its periphery two types of ependymal cells: multiciliated (E1) and a type (E2) characterized by only two cilia and extraordinarily complex basal bodies. These results reveal that adult NSCs retain fundamental epithelial properties, including apical and basal compartmentalization, significantly reshaping our understanding of this adult neurogenic niche."
https://openalex.org/W2013016395,"Recent efforts to translate basic research to the treatment of clinical disorders have led to a growing interest in exploring mechanisms for diminishing fear. This research has emphasized two approaches: extinction of conditioned fear, examined across species; and cognitive emotion regulation, unique to humans. Here, we sought to examine the similarities and differences in the neural mechanisms underlying these two paradigms for diminishing fear. Using an emotion regulation strategy, we examine the neural mechanisms of regulating conditioned fear using fMRI and compare the resulting activation pattern with that observed during classic extinction. Our results suggest that the lateral PFC regions engaged by cognitive emotion regulation strategies may influence the amygdala, diminishing fear through similar vmPFC connections that are thought to inhibit the amygdala during extinction. These findings further suggest that humans may have developed complex cognition that can aid in regulating emotional responses while utilizing phylogenetically shared mechanisms of extinction."

We report on a cavity optomechanical system in which a collective density excitation of a Bose-Einstein condensate serves as the mechanical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. A few photons inside the ultrahigh-finesse cavity trigger strongly driven back-action dynamics, in quantitative agreement with a cavity optomechanical model. We approach the strong coupling regime of cavity optomechanics, where a single excitation of the mechanical oscillator substantially influences the cavity field. The results open up new directions for investigating mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime and the border between classical and quantum physics."
https://openalex.org/W2083879582,"The processes that control climate in the tropics are poorly understood. We applied compound-specific hydrogen isotopes (δD) and the TEX 86 (tetraether index of 86 carbon atoms) temperature proxy to sediment cores from Lake Tanganyika to independently reconstruct precipitation and temperature variations during the past 60,000 years. Tanganyika temperatures follow Northern Hemisphere insolation and indicate that warming in tropical southeast Africa during the last glacial termination began to increase ∼3000 years before atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. δD data show that this region experienced abrupt changes in hydrology coeval with orbital and millennial-scale events recorded in Northern Hemisphere monsoonal climate records. This implies that precipitation in tropical southeast Africa is more strongly controlled by changes in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and the winter Indian monsoon than by migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone."
https://openalex.org/W2049284181,"In adult planarians, the replacement of cells lost to physiological turnover or injury is sustained by the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells known as neoblasts. Neoblast lineage relationships and the molecular changes that take place during differentiation into the appropriate cell types are poorly understood. Here we report the identification and characterization of a cohort of genes specifically expressed in neoblasts and their descendants. We find that genes with severely downregulated expression after irradiation molecularly define at least three discrete subpopulations of cells. Simultaneous BrdU labeling and in situ hybridization experiments in intact and regenerating animals indicate that these cell subpopulations are related by lineage. Our data demonstrate not only the ability to measure and study the in vivo population dynamics of adult stem cells during tissue homeostasis and regeneration, but also the utility of studies in planarians to broadly inform stem cell biology in adult organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2077640709,"Current approaches to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent iPSCs utilize viral transduction of different combinations of transcription factors. These protocols are highly inefficient because only a small fraction of cells carry the appropriate number and stoichiometry of proviral insertions to initiate the reprogramming process. Here we have generated genetically homogeneous ""secondary"" somatic cells, which carry the reprogramming factors as defined doxycycline (DOX)-inducible transgenes. These cells were obtained by infecting fibroblasts with DOX-inducible lentiviruses, isolating ""primary"" iPSCs in the presence of the drug, and finally differentiating to ""secondary"" fibroblasts. When ""secondary"" fibroblast lines were cultured in the presence of DOX without further viral infection, up to 2% of the cells were reprogrammed to pluripotent ""secondary"" human iPSCs. This system will facilitate the characterization of the reprogramming process and provides a unique platform for genetic or chemical screens to enhance reprogramming or replace individual factors."
https://openalex.org/W2032232458,"Previous work has demonstrated that the character of mouse cortical interneuron subtypes can be directly related to their embryonic temporal and spatial origins. The relationship between embryonic origin and the character of mature interneurons is likely reflected by the developmental expression of genes that direct cell fate. However, a thorough understanding of the early genetic events that specify subtype identity has been hampered by the perinatal lethality resulting from the loss of genes implicated in the determination of cortical interneurons. Here, we employ a conditional loss-of-function approach to demonstrate that the transcription factor Nkx2-1 is required for the proper specification of specific interneuron subtypes. Removal of this gene at distinct neurogenic time points results in a switch in the subtypes of neurons observed at more mature ages. Our strategy reveals a causal link between the embryonic genetic specification by Nkx2-1 in progenitors and the functional attributes of their neuronal progeny in the mature nervous system.

Genetic studies have indicated that in response to extrinsic signals (predominantly Shh and FGF8) the subpallium gives rise to a wide diversity of GABAergic neurons—both striatal projection and cortical interneurons (Gutin et al., 2006Gutin G.

While the range of neurons arising from each eminence is quite diverse, the MGE and CGE together give rise to the majority, if not all, cortical interneurons. Beginning with the classic studies of Ramon y Cajal, a large body of work from numerous groups has indicated that cortical interneurons comprise a diverse array of subtypes defined on the basis of a number of immunohistochemical, morphological, and electrophysiological criteria (Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997Gonchar Y.

Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that the MGE and CGE give rise to distinct nonoverlapping populations of cortical interneurons (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J. Fuccillo M. Nery S. Noctor S. Kriegstein A. Corbin J.G. Fishell G.

The MGE produces the majority of cortical interneurons, and these contribute to all cortical layers. By contrast, CGE-derived cortical interneurons primarily reside in superficial cortical layers. Current analysis from numerous labs demonstrates that the parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-expressing subtypes are MGE derived, and the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and calretinin (CR)-expressing populations are predominantly generated within the CGE (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J.

Consistent with these immunohistochemical findings, morphological and physiological analyses suggest that the PV-expressing fast-spiking (FS) basket and chandelier interneurons and SST-expressing intrinsic burst spiking (IB) and non-fast-spiking (NFS) Martinotti neurons arise from the MGE (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J.

What then is the molecular mechanism utilized within these two eminences to give rise to distinct populations of cortical interneurons? At present, Nkx2-1 is the only known transcription factor that with reasonable precision delineates MGE from CGE progenitors. It is expressed by all progenitors within the MGE and is entirely excluded from the CGE (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J. Fuccillo M. Nery S. Noctor S. Kriegstein A. Corbin J.G. Fishell G.

Moreover, Nkx genes and their homologs are known regulators of neuronal cell fate. Both the ventral nervous system defective (vnd) gene in Drosophila and the Nkx2-2, Nkx6-1, and Nkx6-2 genes in the mouse spinal cord act to direct progenitors to adopt specific ventral neural identities while repressing the fates of neighboring regions (Briscoe et al., 1999Briscoe J.

Consistent with this, previous loss-of-function analysis has indicated that in Nkx2-1 null mutants the MGE takes on the molecular character of the LGE (Sussel et al., 1999Sussel L. Marin O. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L. Loss of Nkx2-1 homeobox gene function results in a ventral to dorsal molecular respecification within the basal telencephalon: evidence for a transformation of the pallidum into the striatum.Development. 1999; 126: 3359-3370PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, as Nkx2-1−/− mice die at birth the impact of this gene on the generation of the interneuron diversity observed in the mature cortex (Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) is unclear. In this manuscript, we utilize a conditionally null Nkx2-1 (Nkx2-1c) (Kusakabe et al., 2006Kusakabe T. Kawaguchi A. Hoshi N. Kawaguchi R. Hoshi S. Kimura S. Thyroid-specific enhancer-binding protein/NKX2–1 is required for the maintenance of ordered architecture and function of the differentiated thyroid.Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1796-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) allele to investigate the consequences of removal of Nkx2-1 gene function on the specification of cortical interneuron subtypes. We have previously determined the temporal origins of cortical interneurons arising from the MGE using an inducible genetic fate-mapping strategy using the Olig2 CreERTM driver line (Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). By performing a similar analysis in the context of the conditional Nkx2-1 allele, we were able to study how the removal of Nkx2-1 affects the neuronal subtypes that developmentally arise from the MGE. An attractive aspect of this analysis is that our strategy allowed us to simultaneously remove Nkx2-1 gene function while genetically marking the MGE precursors with a fluorescent EGFP reporter, so that their fate can be followed. We observed that both early and late removal of Nkx2-1 dramatically alters the fate of MGE-derived precursors in a temporally specific manner. At both time points examined, we noted that cortical interneurons are respecified, such that they adopt the character of CGE-derived neurons (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J. Fuccillo M. Nery S. Noctor S. Kriegstein A. Corbin J.G. Fishell G. The temporal and spatial origins of cortical interneurons predict their physiological subtype.Neuron. 2005; 48: 591-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Specifically, we observed that VIP/CR, adapting firing interneurons, and late-spiking neurogliaform interneurons are generated at the expense of PV-expressing, fast-spiking basket neurons and SST-expressing, non-fast-spiking Martinotti populations. In addition, removal of Nkx2-1 gene function at E10.5 resulted in a substantial reduction in cortical interneuron numbers and a concomitant increase in the production of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN). We conclude that Nkx2-1 function is required throughout neurogenesis both for the production of MGE-derived cortical interneuron subtypes and the suppression of surrounding cell fate programs. To examine how the fate of MGE-derived progenitors is affected by the loss of Nkx2-1 gene function, we used a genetic fate-mapping strategy together with an Nkx2-1 loxP-flanked conditional loss-of-function allele (Figure 1A) (Kusakabe et al., 2006Kusakabe T. Kawaguchi A. Hoshi N. Kawaguchi R. Hoshi S. Kimura S. Thyroid-specific enhancer-binding protein/NKX2–1 is required for the maintenance of ordered architecture and function of the differentiated thyroid.Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1796-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our fate-mapping approach employed a tamoxifen-inducible form of the Cre recombinase (Feil et al., 1997Feil R. Wagner J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Regulation of Cre recombinase activity by mutated estrogen receptor ligand-binding domains.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) under the control of the endogenous Olig2 locus (Olig2 CreER; Takebayashi et al., 2002Takebayashi H. Nabeshima Y. Yoshida S. Chisaka O. Ikenaka K. Nabeshima Y. The basic helix-loop-helix factor olig2 is essential for the development of motoneuron and oligodendrocyte lineages.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1157-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B). By using this Cre driver line in the context of a compound Z/EG (a Cre-responsive fluorescent reporter (Novak et al., 2000Novak A. Guo C. Yang W. Nagy A. Lobe C.G. Z/EG, a double reporter mouse line that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein upon Cre-mediated excision.Genesis. 2000; 28: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) ;Nkx2-1c/−background, we were able to genetically label MGE-derived precursors (as previously described in Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), while simultaneously removing Nkx2-1 gene function from this MGE progenitor population (E10.5, Figure 1C; E9.5 data not shown). Use of this experimental strategy had a number of benefits. First, it allowed us to conditionally remove Nkx2-1 at specific time points during neurogenesis. Second, we were able to overcome the perinatal lethality observed in the null mutant, as Cre under the control of the Olig2 locus is not expressed within the developing lung and thyroid primordium. Finally, as Z/EG recombination is restricted to temporally distinct cohorts of MGE-derived precursors, we could readily assess the cell-autonomous effects of gene removal on cellular phenotype. The Olig2CreER allele and Z/EG transgene were utilized for genetic fate-mapping purposes in all experimental crosses—thus, our experimental group was Olig2CreER;Z/EG;Nkx2-1c/− mice, while our control group was Olig2CreER;Z/EG;Nkx2-1c/+ (which are heterozygous for Nkx2-1 after tamoxifen-induced recombination). Both groups of embryos were treated with tamoxifen at specific time points between E9.5 and E12.5. For clarity, we will subsequently refer to these mice with reference to the time point of tamoxifen treatment (i.e., Nkx2-1E9.5LOF Nkx2-1E10.5LOF, Nkx2-1E12.5LOF for the experimental [i.e., loss of function, LOF] groups and Nkx2-1E9.5Ctrl, Nkx2-1E10.5Ctrl, or Nkx2-1E12.5Ctrl for the control [Ctrl] groups). To confirm the degree to which our strategy was effective in conditionally removing Nkx2-1 expression in E10.5 MGE progenitor populations, we conducted short-term immunological and in situ hybridization analyses of Nkx2-1 protein and its downstream transcriptional targets (Figures 1C, 2A, and 2D). We observed that Cre-mediated recombination occurs more efficiently at the Nkx2-1 locus than at the Z/EG locus (see Figure 1C). Thus, we assume that tamoxifen-induced recombination at E10.5 results in the loss of Nkx2-1 gene function in all cells that express EGFP. Additionally, Nkx2-1 target genes, encoding both the signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (Jeong et al., 2006Jeong Y. El-Jaick K. Roessler E. Muenke M. Epstein D.J.

Despite these changes, there was no discernible alteration in the gross morphology or size of the MGE in these animals compared to control littermates. This is in contrast to the pronounced reduction in the size of the MGE observed in Nkx2-1−/− animals (Sussel et al., 1999Sussel L. Marin O. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L. Loss of Nkx2-1 homeobox gene function results in a ventral to dorsal molecular respecification within the basal telencephalon: evidence for a transformation of the pallidum into the striatum.Development. 1999; 126: 3359-3370PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that Cre expression from the Olig2 locus effectively recombines the Nkx2-1 conditional allele, allowing us to observe the cell-autonomous effects of Nkx2-1 in specifying cell identity. A previous study reported that in Nkx2-1 null mice markers normally restricted to the LGE expand into the MGE (Sussel et al., 1999Sussel L. Marin O. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L. Loss of Nkx2-1 homeobox gene function results in a ventral to dorsal molecular respecification within the basal telencephalon: evidence for a transformation of the pallidum into the striatum.Development. 1999; 126: 3359-3370PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate how gene expression in the MGE is affected in Nkx2-1E10.5LOF mice, we examined whether alterations occur in the regional expression of a series of transcription factors within the subpallium. In comparison to Nkx2-1E10.5Ctrl littermates, mutant mice exhibited a shift in the expression of markers that are normally expressed in the CGE (Coup-TFII) as well as the ventricular zone of the sulcus region between the MGE and LGE (Nkx6-2, Gli1, and Coup-TFII). Expression of all three markers is strongly expanded in Nkx2-1E10.5LOF mice, such that they extended ventromedially throughout the VZ of the MGE (Figure 2C). In particular, the observed expansion of Gli1 expression seen in these mutants is surprising, as it occurs in the context of reduced Shh expression. Although the expression of Gli1 is known to be absolutely dependent on hedgehog signaling (Bai et al., 2004Bai C.B. Stephen D. Joyner A.L. All mouse ventral spinal cord patterning by hedgehog is Gli dependent and involves an activator function of Gli3.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the relationship between temporal changes in hedgehog signaling and Gli1 expression is complex (Harfe et al., 2004Harfe B.D. Scherz P.J. Nissim S. Tian H. McMahon A.P. Tabin C.J. Evidence for an expansion-based temporal Shh gradient in specifying vertebrate digit identities.Cell. 2004; 118: 517-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In addition, and consistent with what has been reported previously (Sussel et al., 1999Sussel L. Marin O. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L. Loss of Nkx2-1 homeobox gene function results in a ventral to dorsal molecular respecification within the basal telencephalon: evidence for a transformation of the pallidum into the striatum.Development. 1999; 126: 3359-3370PubMed Google Scholar), precursors leaving the MGE VZ of the Nkx2-1E10.5LOF mice upregulated Islet1—a LIM homeodomain transcription factor normally associated with the LGE and the generation of striatal projection neurons (Stenman et al., 2003Stenman J.

Importantly, the persistence of early pan-ventral markers (Dlx2, Gad67; Figure 2B) after Nkx2-1 removal suggests that GABAergic neurogenesis was not grossly altered. It therefore appears that our strategy of using Olig2 CreER™ to remove Nkx2-1 in a precise temporal manner may not significantly alter the numbers of GABAergic neurons generated from the ventral eminences per se. It does however result in a shift in the expression of several ventral transcription factors that might in turn have consequences on neuronal subtype specification. In contrast to Nkx2-1 null animals, conditionally mutant mice were viable postnatally, irrespective of the time of tamoxifen administration (Nkx2-1E9.5LOF until P10, Nkx2-1E10.5LOF mice until P13–P17, and Nkx2-1E12.5LOF at least until P30), probably due to sparing of the developing lung fields and thyroid (Kimura et al., 1996Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. The T/ebp null mouse: thyroid-specific enhancer-binding protein is essential for the organogenesis of the thyroid, lung, ventral forebrain, and pituitary.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Despite their prolonged viability, many of these mutant animals showed profound behavioral abnormalities as juveniles. Nkx2-1E9.5LOF (Movie S1) and Nkx2-1E10.5LOF showed pronounced spontaneous seizures. Alterations in behavior were characterized by prolonged periods of quiescence, punctuated by violent tremors and an absence or reduction in voluntary movement. Electrocorticographic recordings were obtained using subcranial electrodes from freely moving control (Nkx2-1E10.5Cont) and mutant (Nkx2-1E10.5LOF) animals. Monitoring of Nkx2-1E10.5LOF juvenile animals revealed that visible seizures correlated with the occurrence of prolonged abnormal bursting activity within the cortex (Figure 3B–3D). Control Nkx2-1E10.5Ctrl littermates never exhibited such activity but rather showed seemingly normal low-amplitude desynchronized EEG activity (Figure 3A). On occasion, activity in Nkx2-19.5LOF or Nkx2-1E10.5LOF animals resembled a myoclonic seizure with a phase of periodic interictal discharges (Figure 3B) followed by large-amplitude rhythmic spike (Figure 3C) and spike-wave (Figure 3D) seizure discharge that terminated after a period of 30 s or more. Nkx2-1E10.5LOF showed a reduced incidence of seizures when compared with Nkx2-19.5LOF animals. By contrast, Nkx2-1E12.5LOF animals never exhibited overtly abnormal behavior or synchronized bursting discharge in the EEG (Movie S2). Post hoc marker and genetic fate-mapping analysis of Nkx2-1E10.5LOF mice revealed that the occurrence of behavioral abnormalities closely correlated with a reduction in the numbers of cortical GABAergic interneurons (Figure 3F). In situ hybridization analysis of either Nkx2-1E9.5LOF (data not shown) or Nkx2-1E10.5LOF (Figure 3E) animals exhibited a gross deficit in total Gad67 neurons (Figures 3E and 3F) and, more specifically, MGE-derived cortical interneurons, as indicated by a pronounced reduction in cortical Lhx6 expression (Figures 3E and 3F). We are uncertain as to the precise origin of the observed seizures. However, the decrease in interneuron numbers may cause the susceptibility of Nkx2-1E9.5LOF or Nkx2-1E10.5LOF mice to seizures, a phenotype also observed in other mutants that affect the number of GABAergic interneurons in the forebrain (Cobos et al., 2006Cobos I.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 622-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While removal of Nkx2-1 at or prior to E10.5 had a significant effect on the numbers of GABAergic interneurons present in the juvenile neocortex, removal of Nkx2-1 at E12.5 resulted in only a minor decrease in the total numbers of Gad67-positive cortical interneurons (Figure 3F). To evaluate the effect of Nkx2-1 removal on cortical interneuron diversity, we performed immunohistochemistry for known markers of interneuron subtypes in both control (Nkx2-1E10.5Ctrl and Nkx2-1E12.5Contl) and conditi"

We used hepatocytes from an aneuploid mouse strain carrying human chromosome 21 to determine, on a chromosomal scale, whether interspecies differences in transcriptional regulation are primarily directed by human genetic sequence or mouse nuclear environment. Virtually all transcription factor-binding locations, landmarks of transcription initiation, and the resulting gene expression observed in human hepatocytes were recapitulated across the entire human chromosome 21 in the mouse hepatocyte nucleus. Thus, in homologous tissues, genetic sequence is largely responsible for directing transcriptional programs; interspecies differences in epigenetic machinery, cellular environment, and transcription factors themselves play secondary roles."

P1, located in the dorsal posterior brain near the mushroom body, is composed of 20 interneurons, each of which has a primary transversal neurite with extensive ramifications in the bilateral protocerebrum. P1 is fated to die in females through the action of a feminizing protein, DsxF. A masculinizing protein Fru is required in the male brain for correct positioning of the terminals of P1 neurites. Thus, the coordinated actions of two sex determination genes, dsx and fru, confer the unique ability to initiate male-typical sexual behavior on P1 neurons.

Thus, the coordinated actions of two sex determination genes, dsx and fru, confer the unique ability to initiate male-typical sexual behavior on P1 neurons. The animals that engage in sexual reproduction typically exhibit conspicuous gender differences in a variety of behaviors, including mating behavior itself. Such gender specificity in behavior is believed to derive from a sexual dimorphism in neural mechanisms underlying behavior, although a causal link between the neural sexual dimorphism and behavioral gender difference has been firmly demonstrated only in limited cases (for review see Bocklandt and Vilain, 2007Bocklandt S. Vilain E. Sex differences in brain and behavior: hormones versus genes.Adv. Genet. 2007; 59: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The studies of mating behavior in gynandromorphic Drosophila represent one of the few exceptional examples in which the sex of particular neural structures has been successfully correlated to a gender-typed behavior (Hall, 1979Hall J.C. Control of male reproductive behavior by the central nervous system of Drosophila: dissection of a courtship pathway by genetic mosaics.Genetics. 1979; 92: 437-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tompkins and Hall, 1983Tompkins L. Hall J.C. Identification of brain sites controlling female receptivity in mosaics of Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1983; 103: 179-195PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, a male displays a series of complex stereotypic acts in courting a female (Hall, 1994Hall J.C. The mating of a fly.Science. 1994; 264: 1702-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, Yamamoto et al., 1997Yamamoto D. Jallon J.-M. Komatsu A. Genetic dissection of sexual behavior in Drosophila melanogaster.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 551-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After orienting his body axis toward a target female, the male fly commences to chase her (following) while vibrating only one of two wings at a time (singing). This unilateral wing vibration generates species-specific sounds known as love songs, which exert an aphrodisiac effect on a female, who otherwise takes actions to escape from the courting male. In response to the love songs, the female slows down locomotion and occasionally stops her motion, allowing the male to lick her genitalia (licking) and attempt to mount her (attempted copulation). When the female is fully receptive, she opens her wings and vaginal plates, two critical actions that make it physically possible for a male to copulate with her. During copulation, the male remains mounted on the female for about 20 min, after which he releases the genital contact. Hall, 1979Hall J.C. Control of male reproductive behavior by the central nervous system of Drosophila: dissection of a courtship pathway by genetic mosaics.Genetics. 1979; 92: 437-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar demonstrated that if a gynandromorphic fly has male tissue on one side of the dorsal posterior brain, it initiates male courtship behavior with a high probability when paired with a female. However, these gynandromorphic flies did not proceed beyond the step of wing vibration in courtship. To perform the late steps of male-type courtship behavior, such as licking, attempted copulation, and copulation, gynandromorphic flies require additional male tissues in other areas of the brain (Hall, 1979Hall J.C. Control of male reproductive behavior by the central nervous system of Drosophila: dissection of a courtship pathway by genetic mosaics.Genetics. 1979; 92: 437-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent gynandromorph study identified a brain site that governs the female receptivity to copulation (Tompkins and Hall, 1983Tompkins L. Hall J.C. Identification of brain sites controlling female receptivity in mosaics of Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1983; 103: 179-195PubMed Google Scholar). About 15 years later, the Gal4-UAS targeted gene expression system was used to sexually transform parts of the male brain with a feminizing factor known as transformer (tra), in an attempt to identify the anatomical foci crucial for male courtship (Ferveur et al., 1995Ferveur J.-F.

Greenspan R.J. Courtship behavior of brain mosaics in Drosophila.J. Neurogenet. 1998; 12: 205-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet another study employed forced activation of neurons with an activated form of a K channel, or forced inactivation with the synaptic blocker shibirets (shits), in brain regions defined by particular Gal4 enhancer trap expressions, to elucidate brain sites responsible for generating male courtship behavior (Broughton et al., 2004Broughton S.J.

Biol. 2004; 14: 538-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The results of these studies supported the pioneering work by Hall, 1979Hall J.C. Control of male reproductive behavior by the central nervous system of Drosophila: dissection of a courtship pathway by genetic mosaics.Genetics. 1979; 92: 437-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar by documenting the importance of the dorsal posterior brain in initiating male courtship, while revealing additional regions important for male performance of mating behavior. Although these studies collectively suggest that a few brain areas play a pivotal role in initiating male sexual behavior, nothing is known about the identity of neurons and their circuits in these brain sites which are central to the generation of male courtship behavior. The above-mentioned studies suffered from a technical limitation in that their experimental manipulations involved hundreds to thousands of neurons, making it practically impossible to evaluate the roles of single cells in the regulation of behavior. To circumvent this problem, we decided to employ the MARCM (mosaic analysis with a repressive cell marker) method (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), which allowed us to sexually transform a few clonal groups of cells or even a single cell and to specifically label such cells with a specific marker. We focused our attention on cells that express fruitless (fru), a neural sex determination gene situated just downstream of tra in the sex determination cascade (Usui-Aoki et al., 2000Usui-Aoki K.

According to the prevailing view, fru functions in parallel with another Tra target, doublesex (dsx) (Burtis and Baker, 1989Burtis K.C. Baker B.S.

The male-specific Fru protein is expressed in small groups of neurons scattered throughout the CNS of males, but not of females (Lee et al., 2000Lee G. Foss M. Goodwin S.F. Carlo T. Taylor B.J.

The fru gene has been proposed to be the master control gene that directs the organization of brain centers for sexual behavior (Demir and Dickson, 2005Demir E.

Dickson B.J. fruitless splicing specifies male courtship behavior in Drosophila.Cell. 2005; 121: 785-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and because of its loss-of-function mutant phenotypes in males that are characterized by reduced levels of courtship and an enhanced preference for males over females as courtship targets (Ito et al., 1996Ito H. Fujitani K. Usui K. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Tanaka S. Yamamoto D.

Extended reproductive roles of the fruitless gene in Drosophila melanogaster revealed by behavioral analysis of new fru mutants.Genetics. 1997; 147: 1107-1130PubMed Google Scholar). As some fru-expressing cells exhibit a remarkable sexual dimorphism or are male specific (Kimura et al., 2005Kimura K. Ote M. Tazawa T. Yamamoto D. fruitless specifies sexually dimorphic neural circuitry in the Drosophila brain.Nature. 2005; 438: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), they are considered to be the most promising candidates for neurons that determine gender-typed behaviors. Assuming that there exist a few executive neurons that initiate a series of courtship rituals as indicated by the aforementioned results with mosaic flies, one can anticipate that even a female fly performs male-typical behavior, provided that such neurons are masculinized. In the present study, a few tra1 homozygous, masculinized clones were generated by MARCM in the brains of more than 200 female flies, the behavioral gender of which were then determined, and the masculinized cells in their brains were subsequently identified by a marker that is specifically expressed in tra1 homozygous cells. We identified a fru-expressing cell cluster, P1, as an important neuronal element that can initiate male-type courtship behavior. Interestingly, P1 is actively eliminated in the female by DsxF, the female-specific Dsx isoform. The male-specific Fru enables the male neurons to extend their neurites toward the correct targets. The male-specific formation of the P1 cluster with the ability to induce male-type courtship is secured by dual control mechanisms involving two sex-determination proteins, Fru and Dsx. Fru-expressing neurons in the brain form discrete clusters that have been classified into 15 groups (Lee et al., 2000Lee G. Foss M. Goodwin S.F. Carlo T. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Spatial, temporal, and sexually dimorphic expression patterns of the fruitless gene in the Drosophila central nervous system.J. Neurobiol. 2000; 43: 404-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on the projection and dendritic branching patterns of fru-expressing neurons revealed by single-cell labeling with the MARCM method (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar) using a Gal4 reporter inserted into the fru locus (fruNP21) (Kimura et al., 2005Kimura K. Ote M. Tazawa T. Yamamoto D. fruitless specifies sexually dimorphic neural circuitry in the Drosophila brain.Nature. 2005; 438: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we were able to resolve and identify distinct groups of cells (Figure 1 and see Table S1 available online) that corresponded with the fru-expressing neural clusters classified previously (Lee et al., 2000Lee G. Foss M. Goodwin S.F. Carlo T. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Spatial, temporal, and sexually dimorphic expression patterns of the fruitless gene in the Drosophila central nervous system.J. Neurobiol. 2000; 43: 404-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The total number of neurons with fruNP21 reporter expression, except for Kenyon cells of the mushroom body, is 480.4 ± 19.0 (mean ± SD per brain hemisphere, n = 5; Table S1) in males. Eighty-two percent of the neurons (394.8 ± 12.9, per brain hemisphere) labeled with the fruNP21 reporter expressed Fru, although several clusters with fruNP21 reporter expression were not stained with the anti-Fru antibody under our experimental conditions (Table S1). Conversely, some Fru-expressing neurons in our experiments were not labeled with the fruNP21 reporter, suggesting that we did not see some of the neurons that were present. Nevertheless, we chose to use fruNP21 to identify fru-positive cells, because other reporters of fru were less accurate, for unknown reasons, in monitoring endogenous fru expression (for example, fruGal4 generated by Stockinger et al., 2005Stockinger P. Kvitsiani D. Rotkopf S. Tirian L. Dickson B.J. Neural circuitry that governs Drosophila male courtship behavior.Cell. 2005; 121: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar expressed Gal4 in 1041.5 cells per hemibrain on average, indicating that half of the GAL4-positive cells do not express Fru endogenously). Among the fru-expressing neurons that were labeled with the fruNP21 reporter, at least two clusters (M and P1) were male specific (Table S1). Overt sexual dimorphism in the number of cells composing a cluster was observed in the clusters aSP2, aSP3, mAL, mcAL, P2, P4, and pL; males had significantly more cells than females in these clusters (Figure 1 and Table S1). Some neurons of other clusters may show sexual dimorphisms in their fine structures, as reported recently in terminal arborization patterns of AL3 (Datta et al., 2008Datta S.R. Vasconcelos M.L. Ruta V. Luo S. Wong A. Demir E. Flores J. Balonze K. Dickson B.J. Axel R. The Drosophila pheromone cVA activates a sexually dimorphic neural circuit.Nature. 2008; 452: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These sexually dimorphic and sex-specific clusters are promising candidates for anatomical substrates of neural centers that control male sexual behavior. The intensity of courtship behavior can be quantified by calculating the courtship index (CI), which represents the percentage of time that a fly spends in performing any one of a set of courtship acts within a 30 min observation period. In contrast to the control females (CI = 0), tra1 homozygous females, in which sexually dimorphic cells were entirely masculinized (Figures S1C and S1D cf. S1A and S1B), exhibited high rates of courtship behavior (CI = 69) comparable to those exhibited by wild-type males (CI = 78) (Table S2). We generated small clonal patches of neurons that are homozygous for tra1 and are thus masculinized in otherwise female individuals (see Experimental Procedures). The masculinized fru-expressing cell clone was readily recognized by its reactivity to an anti-Fru antibody and by GFP expression (Figures S1E–S1G). We estimated the courtship index (CI) in 205 tra1 mosaic females, each of which carried a few neural clusters that were masculinized by tra1. The majority of these tra1 mosaic females were “noncourters,” meaning they never showed any male-type behaviors. However, 16 flies were “courters,” meaning they did perform the early components of courtship, including orientation, following, tapping, and briefly vibrating their wings (Figure 2A and Movie S1). Although the courters initiated unilateral wing vibration, they soon terminated it. Moreover, these courters never displayed the advanced courtship steps such as licking, attempted copulation, or copulation. We determined which neuronal clusters were GFP positive (masculinized) or GFP negative (nonmasculinized) in all 205 mosaic flies (Figures 2B–2D) and looked for a possible correlation between GFP expression in a particular fru-positive cluster and the occurrence of male-type courtship behavior (Figure 2E). For each cluster, the proportion of mosaic flies in which that particular cluster was masculinized and thus labeled with GFP (the masculinization rate, MR) was estimated for the courters (black bars in Figure 2E) and the noncourters (white bars in Figure 2E). Given that “cluster X” is masculinized in 19 out of 189 noncourters (or courters), the MR is 10%. Among 48 fru-expressing clusters scored, all but P1 did not show a significant difference in MR between the courters and noncourters according to Fisher's exact probability test (p > 0.01; Figure 2E). A significant difference between the courters and noncourters was found only in the P1 cluster (Fisher's exact probability test, p < 0.0001). Thirteen out of sixteen courters had a GFP-positive P1 on at least one side of the brain (Figures 2B–2D; Table S3). Ten tra1 mosaic females showed CIs over 1.0 and all of them had a GFP-positive P1 cluster (Table S3). These results indicate that those tra1 mosaic females with a masculinized P1 cluster have a high probability of exhibiting courtship behavior. However, the masculinization of P1 is not obligatory for exhibiting courtship behavior, because nearly 20% of tra1 mosaic females showed courtship behavior without having a GFP-positive P1. Likewise, all tra1 mosaic females with a GFP-positive (masculinized) P1 do not necessarily display male-type courtship behavior, as 12 out of 189 tra1 mosaic flies that did not show any courtship behavior had GFP-positive P1 clusters under our experimental conditions. To further substantiate the role of the P1 cluster in initiating male-type courtship behaviors, we made an attempt to conditionally inactivate P1 neurons in courting males with the aid of a temperature sensitive dominant-negative form of shibire (shits), which blocks synaptic transmission at restrictive temperatures above 29°C while without effect at submissive temperatures below 25°C (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Male flies with MARCM clones expressing shits as driven by fruNP21 were classified into courters or noncourters by observing their behavior when paired with a virgin female at 30°C. Subsequently, courtship assays were repeated at 20°C for each mosaic male. In 34 out of 132 male flies with MARCM clones, shits was expressed in P1 unilaterally. Most of them courted a target female in both permissive and restrictive temperatures, although some of them showed a reduction in courtship activities. We obtained two male flies carrying bilateral P1 clones with shits expression. Both of them did not court at all when the temperature was 30°C and did court when the temperature was returned to 20°C. This implies that male courtship behavior is not blocked unless P1 is bilaterally inhibited. P1 is a male-specific neuronal cluster in the dorsal posterior brain, located mediolaterally to the mushroom body (Figures 3A, 3B, and 4A). It is composed of about 20 Fru-expressing neurons (Table S1; see also Figures 5A–5E). P1 neurons extend a primary neurite anterodorsally, which ramifies extensively toward the lateral and medial protocerebrum regions (Figures 3D–3F and S2). A long prominent neurite crosses the midline through the anterosuperior medial protocerebrum, ending at the corresponding contralateral region. The presynaptic marker synaptotagmin-HA is localized bilaterally on the medial side of the inferior lateral protocerebrum and the ventral lateral protocerebrum in addition to the region along the midline neurite, indicating that these regions represent the output sites of P1. The ipsilateral region of the ventrolateral and ventromedial protocerebrum is likely an input site of P1.Figure 4Roles of Sex-Determination Genes in the P1 FormationShow full caption(A) Presence (circled with a solid line) or absence (circled with a broken line) of P1 in male (XY) or female (XX) adult brains, doubly stained with the anti-GFP antibody (green) and nc82 Mab (magenta) in wild-type and mutants of sex-determination genes (the simplified genotypes are indicated in the left-hand-most column).

We compared CO2 variations on millennial time scales between 20,000 and 90,000 years ago with an Antarctic temperature proxy and records of abrupt climate change in the Northern Hemisphere. CO2 concentration and Antarctic temperature were positively correlated over millennial-scale climate cycles, implying a strong connection to Southern Ocean processes. Evidence from marine sediment proxies indicates that CO2 concentration rose most rapidly when North Atlantic Deep Water shoaled and stratification in the Southern Ocean was reduced. These increases in CO2 concentration occurred during stadial (cold) periods in the Northern Hemisphere, several thousand years before abrupt warming events in Greenland."

Our results demonstrate a role for the cell-fate determinant Nkx2-1 in regulating neuronal migration by direct transcriptional regulation of guidance receptors in postmitotic cells. During development of the nervous system, migrating neurons and axons are guided to their final destination by the coordinated activity of multiple extracellular cues that act on specific membrane receptors to steer their movement in the right direction (Dickson, 2002Dickson B.J. Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance.Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. The molecular biology of axon guidance.Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). Because neuronal guidance typically involves a complex set of instructions even in the simplest organisms, adoption of a specific program of migration requires that neurons respond to guidance cues in a highly regulated pattern, both in time and space. Transcriptional regulation is a key determinant in this process, as it ultimately represents one of the primary mechanisms controlling the repertoire of receptors expressed by neurons (Butler and Tear, 2007Butler S.J. Tear G. Getting axons onto the right path: the role of transcription factors in axon guidance.Development. 2007; 134: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Polleux et al., 2007Polleux F. Ince-Dunn G. Ghosh A. Transcriptional regulation of vertebrate axon guidance and synapse formation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transcription factors regulating neuronal fate specification typically function before the last division of progenitor cells, while guidance decisions are made at later stages of development (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that transcription factors expressed in postmitotic neurons are responsible for activating specific migration and axon guidance programs. In the vertebrate spinal cord, for example, the expression of a specific combination of transcription factors in postmitotic motoneurons appears to encode their axon trajectory and final targeting (Kania et al., 2000Kania A.

Interestingly, some of the same transcription factors that regulate axon guidance also play a major role in the early specification of different neuronal pools, suggesting that the same transcription factors may carry on different functions depending on the cellular context (De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008De Marco Garcia N.V.

In addition to demonstrating the function of transcription factors in the regulation of axon guidance, studies over the past few years have begun to identify possible candidate genes that would function as downstream effectors of these factors. For example, it has been suggested that Lim1 expression in LMC neurons may regulate the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4, which is essential for the final targeting of their axonal projections to the limb mesenchyma (Kania and Jessell, 2003Kania A.

Similarly, the role of the transcription factor Zic2 in regulating midline crossing by retinal axons appears to involve the regulation of another member of the Eph family, EphB1 (García-Frigola et al., 2008García-Frigola C. Carreres M.I. Vegar C. Mason C. Herrera E.

Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since migrating neurons and growing axons are instructed toward their final destination by similar guidance molecules (Bagri and Tessier-Lavigne, 2002Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M.

However, the function of specific transcription factors in the migration and positioning of neurons is still very limited (McEvilly et al., 2002McEvilly R.J. de Diaz M.O. Schonemann M.D. Hooshmand F.

In the developing telencephalon, the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) is the origin of interneurons that migrate tangentially to the striatum and cerebral cortex (Lavdas et al., 1999Lavdas A.A.

In utero fate mapping reveals distinct migratory pathways and fates of neurons born in the mammalian basal forebrain.Development. 2001; 128: 3759-3771PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that sorting of striatal and cortical interneurons to their respective target territories depends on neuropilin/semaphorin interactions (Marín et al., 2001Marín O. Yaron A. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Rubenstein J.L. Sorting of striatal and cortical interneurons regulated by semaphorin-neuropilin interactions.Science. 2001; 293: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated the transcriptional mechanisms regulating this process. We found that downregulation of postmitotic Nkx2-1 expression is a necessary event for the migration of interneurons to the cortex, whereas Nkx2-1 expression is required for interneuron migration to the striatum. Forced Nkx2-1 expression in MGE-derived cells prevents interneuron migration to the cortex, whereas loss of Nkx2-1 function reduces the number of interneurons that accumulate in the striatum. Nkx2-1 exerts this role in the migration of MGE-derived interneurons by directly regulating the expression of Neuropilin-2 (Nrp2), the receptor of Semaphorin-3F (Sema3F). Our results demonstrate that direct transcriptional regulation of guidance receptors in postmitotic neurons is an essential mechanism in neuronal migration. Nkx2-1 is one of the earliest genes expressed in the mouse forebrain (Sussel et al., 1999Sussel L. Marín O. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L. Loss of Nkx2.1 homeobox gene function results in a ventral to dorsal molecular respecification within the basal telencephalon: evidence for a transformation of the pallidum into the striatum.Development. 1999; 126: 3359-3370PubMed Google Scholar). At embryonic day (E) 13.5, the peak of interneuron generation in the mouse, Nkx2-1 is strongly expressed by cells in several progenitor domains of the subpallium, including the MGE, the preoptic area, and part of the septum, whereas it is absent from the lateral ganglionic eminence (Figure 1A). At this stage, Nkx2-1 expression was also observed in many postmitotic neurons derived from the MGE, such as striatal interneurons (Figures 1A and 1C; Marín et al., 2000Marín O. Anderson S.A. Rubenstein J.L. Origin and molecular specification of striatal interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Nkx2-1 expression was not detected in cortical interneurons at this or any other embryonic stages (Figures 1A and 1B and data not shown), even though many of them originate in the MGE (Lavdas et al., 1999Lavdas A.A.

In utero fate mapping reveals distinct migratory pathways and fates of neurons born in the mammalian basal forebrain.Development. 2001; 128: 3759-3771PubMed Google Scholar). There are two possible hypotheses that would explain the differential expression of Nkx2-1 in postmitotic striatal and cortical interneurons. One possibility is that MGE progenitors producing cortical interneurons never express Nkx2-1. Alternatively, Nkx2-1 might be expressed by MGE progenitors giving rise to both striatal and cortical interneurons, but this latter population would rapidly downregulate Nkx2-1 expression soon after leaving the MGE. To test these alternative hypotheses, we first quantified the percentage of cells expressing Nkx2-1 located within 100 μm of the ventricle in the MGE of E13.5 embryos. Virtually all cells present in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the MGE expressed Nkx2-1 at this stage (Figures 1D and 1D′; 99.2% ± 0.4% of propidium iodine cells, average ± SEM). We next quantified the number of progenitor cells expressing Nkx2-1 in the VZ of the MGE in E13.5 embryos. In agreement with previous reports (Xu et al., 2005Xu Q. Wonders C.P. Anderson S.A. Sonic hedgehog maintains the identity of cortical interneuron progenitors in the ventral telencephalon.Development. 2005; 132: 4987-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we found that almost every cell in the MGE that incorporated the S-phase marker BrdU at this stage also expressed Nkx2-1 (Figures 1E and 1E′; 96.9% ± 1.1% of BrdU cells, average ± SEM), reinforcing the view that all MGE progenitors express this transcription factor. To specifically test whether MGE-derived interneurons downregulate Nkx2-1 expression while migrating toward the cortex, we performed experiments in which a piece of E13.5 MGE VZ from a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing transgenic mouse brain was transplanted into the same region of wild-type host slices. After 18 hr in culture, we analyzed the expression of Nkx2-1 in GFP migrating cells (Figures 1F and 1F′; n = 3 experiments, 132 GFP cells analyzed). The majority of GFP-expressing cells derived from the transplant were found in a corridor deep to the striatal mantle through which most interneurons reach the cortex (Flames et al., 2004Flames N. Long J.E. Garratt A.N. Fischer T.M. Gassmann M. Birchmeier C. Lai C. Rubenstein J.L. Marín O. Short- and long-range attraction of cortical GABAergic interneurons by neuregulin-1.Neuron. 2004; 44: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and they did not contain detectable levels of Nkx2-1 protein (Figures 1F′ and 1G; 67.0% ± 14.3% of GFP cells, average ± SEM). About 22% of the GFP-expressing cells were also located in the corridor and contained traces of Nkx2-1 (Figures 1F′ and 1G; 22.2% ± 14.8% of GFP cells, average ± SEM), suggesting that these cells might be undergoing downregulation of this protein. Finally, a small proportion of GFP-expressing cells was located in the ventrolateral aspect of the prospective striatum and expressed high levels of Nkx2-1 protein (Figures 1F′ and 1H; 10.9% ± 4.3% of GFP cells, average ± SEM). These experiments suggest that MGE-derived interneurons migrating toward the cortex rapidly downregulate the expression of Nkx2-1 after leaving the MGE, whereas those interneurons migrating to the striatum maintain the expression of this transcription factor. Our previous observations raised the intriguing possibility that downregulation of Nkx2-1 in MGE-derived interneurons might be necessary to acquire a cortical migratory fate. To test this hypothesis, we forced the expression of Nkx2-1 in MGE progenitor cells through focal electroporation in E13.5 slices (Figure 2A). In control experiments, Gfp-expressing cells migrated to the cortex following their normal route (>90 cells per cortex in 22/22 slices; Figures 2C and 2H), and only a minority of cells was found in the striatum. In contrast, in slices coelectroporated with Gfp and Nkx2-1, the majority of MGE-derived cells accumulated in the basal ganglia, and only occasional cells were found in the cortex (<20 cells per cortex in 22/22 slices; Figures 2D and 2H). To exclude the possibility that overexpression of Nkx2-1 prevents interneuron migration rather than changing their direction, we electroporated small MGE explants with either Gfp alone or Gfp and Nkx2-1 and cultured them in three-dimensional Matrigel matrices. After 36 hr in culture, cells were found to migrate a similar distance in the two experimental conditions (data not shown; see also Figures 6B and 6D), suggesting that expression of Nkx2-1 in postmitotic interneurons does not impair cell migration but appears to specifically disrupt their target selection. Nkx2-1 belongs to the NK-2 class of homeodomain (HD) transcription factors (Harvey, 1996Harvey R.P. NK-2 homeobox genes and heart development.Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In addition to the HD, two other peptide domains are conserved within the NK-2 class of transcription factors. The short TN domain (Tinmam motif), located at the N-terminal region, has been suggested to underlie the function of the NK-2 proteins as repressors during neural patterning events in the ventral neural tube (Muhr et al., 2001Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Groucho-mediated transcriptional repression establishes progenitor cell pattern and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The function of the NK-2 specific domain (NK-2-SD) is not fully understood. In Nkx2-2, NK-2-SD has been shown to act as an intra-molecular inhibitor of a transcriptional activator domain located at the C terminus of the protein (Watada et al., 2000Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Intramolecular control of transcriptional activity by the NK-2-specific domain in NK-2 homeodomain proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism through which Nkx2-1 may regulate the migration of MGE-derived cells, we performed a structure-function analysis in organotypic slices. We first evaluated the role of the TN motif by electroporating a truncated form of Nkx2-1 missing the first 20 amino acids (Nkx2-1ΔTN; Figure 2B). Analysis of slices electroporated with Gfp and Nkx2-1ΔTN revealed that MGE-derived cells also failed to reach the cortex in the absence of the TN motif (<20 cells per cortex in 17/17 slices; Figures 2E and 2H). To investigate if a putative C terminus activator domain plays a role in the migration of MGE-derived cells, we used a truncated form of Nkx2-1 missing four amino acids of the NK-2-SD domain and the remaining C-terminal of the protein (Nkx2-1ΔCt; Figure 2B). Analysis of slices electroporated with Gfp and Nkx2-1ΔCt showed that MGE-derived cells also failed to reach the cortex in the absence of the C terminus activator domain and an intact NK-SD motif (<20 cells per cortex in 11/11 slices; Figures 2F and 2H). Finally, we assessed the role of the HD in this process by performing a single amino acid substitution in the position 35 of the Nkx2-1 HD (Nkx2-1A35T; Figure 2B). This mutated form of Nkx2-1 binds to DNA target sequences with 50-fold less affinity than wild-type Nkx2-1 (Xiang et al., 1998Xiang B. Weiler S. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Structural basis of an embryonically lethal single Ala–> Thr mutation in the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 7412-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Analysis of slices electroporated with Gfp and Nkx2-1A35T revealed that MGE-derived cells expressing this construct were able to migrate toward the cortex like in control slices (>90 cells per cortex in 14/15 slices; Figures 2G and 2H). Similar results were obtained when a different point mutation in the HD (Nkx2-1Y54M) was used (>90 cells per cortex in 18/19 slices; data not shown). Of note, the A35T replacement does not appear to decrease the stability of the protein (which would have explained the absence of a phenotype), since Gfp/Nkx2-1A35T-expressing cells migrating toward the cortex have detectable levels of Nkx2-1 (see Figure S1 available online). Altogether, these experiments revealed that the mechanism through which Nkx2-1 prevents MGE-derived cells from migrating toward the cortex requires an intact HD and does not rely on interactions involving the TN and the C terminus activator/SD domains. If Nkx2-1 regulates the sorting of cortical and striatal interneurons, loss of Nkx2-1 function in postmitotic cells should lead to a reduction in the number of MGE-derived cells that accumulate in the striatum. To test this hypothesis, we bred mice carrying floxed alleles of the Nkx2-1 locus (Kusakabe et al., 2006Kusakabe T. Kawaguchi A. Hoshi N. Kawaguchi R. Hoshi S. Kimura S. Thyroid-specific enhancer-binding protein/NKX2.1 is required for the maintenance of ordered architecture and function of the differentiated thyroid.Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1796-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with transgenic mice in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of Lhx6 (Fogarty et al., 2007Fogarty M. Grist M. Gelman D. Marín O. Pachnis V. Kessaris N. Spatial genetic patterning of the embryonic neuroepithelium generates GABAergic interneuron diversity in the adult cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10935-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), a LIM-HD transcription factor expressed by MGE-derived neurons that drives recombination almost exclusively in postmitotic cells (Figure S2). To verify the efficiency and specificity of recombination, we analyzed the distribution of cells expressing Nkx2-1 protein in the subpallium of E15.5 control and Lhx6-Cre;Nkx2-1Fl/Fl mutant embryos. As expected, we found that expression of Nkx2-1 in the MGE VZ was not affected whereas the number of Nkx2-1 expressing cells throughout the subpallial mantle, including the developing striatum, was dramatically reduced in Lhx6-Cre;Nkx2-1Fl/Fl mutant embryos (Figure S3). The presence of Nkx2-1 mRNA in some striatal cells suggests that either they have yet to recombine the two Nkx2-1 alleles or that a fraction of striatal interneurons may not express Lhx6 or, at least, the Lhx6-Cre transgene (Figure S3). To assess the impact of postmitotic loss of Nkx2-1 function in the development of striatal interneurons, we analyzed the expression of several markers for striatal interneurons, such as Lhx6, Lhx7 (also known as Lhx8), Er81 and Somatostatin (Sst) (Kawaguchi et al., 1995Kawaguchi Y.

We found that the striatum of E15.5 Lhx6-Cre;Nkx2-1Fl/Fl mutant embryos contained significantly fewer Lhx6-, Lhx7-, Er81- and Sst-expressing neurons than controls (n = 3; Figure 3). We next analyzed the distribution of interneurons in the striatum of postnatal day 25 control and Lhx6-Cre;Nkx2-1Fl/Fl mutant mice.

CPu, caudate putamen. Scale bar = 100 μm. The previous results were consistent with the hypothesis that loss of Nkx2-1 function prevents the migration of MGE-derived interneurons to the striatum. There were, however, alternative possibilities to explain these results. For example, loss of Nkx2-1 could lead to increased cell death in striatal interneurons. Quantification of the density of apoptotic cells (marked by cleaved Caspase3 expression) revealed no differences in the MGE and striatum of E13.5 control and Lhx6-Cre;Nkx2-1Fl/Fl mutant embryos (n = 3; MGE, 77.2% ± 3.3% [control] and 70.2% ± 4.4% [mutant]; striatum, 49.0% ± 0.7% [control] and 45.5 ± 5.7% [mutant]; average ± SEM). Similar results were observed at E12.5 and E14.5 (data not shown), suggesting that this was not the case. Nkx2-1 could also be required to induce or maintain the expression of striatal interneuron markers, and so the observed decrease in the number of striatal interneurons could merely reflect a failure in the expression of those genes. This seems unlikely, because similar numbers of Lhx6 and Lhx7-expressing cells were found throughout the telencephalon outside the striatum in control and mutant mice (Figure S4). How"
https://openalex.org/W1974762968,"Adiponectin is a major insulin-sensitizing, multimeric hormone derived from adipose tissue that acts on muscle and liver to regulate whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we describe a novel and highly conserved paralog of adiponectin designated as C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) 9. Of all the CTRP paralogs, CTRP9 shows the highest degree of amino acid identity to adiponectin in its globular C1q domain. CTRP9 is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue and females expresses higher levels of the transcript than males. Moreover, its expression levels in ob/ob mice changed in an age-dependent manner, with significant up-regulation in younger mice. CTRP9 is a secreted glycoprotein with multiple post-translational modifications in its collagen domain that include hydroxylated prolines and hydroxylated and glycosylated lysines. It is secreted as multimers (predominantly trimers) from transfected cells and circulates in the mouse serum with levels varying according to sex and metabolic state of mice. Furthermore, CTRP9 and adiponectin can be secreted as heterooligomers when cotransfected into mammalian cells, and in vivo, adiponectin/CTRP9 complexes can be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated from the serum of adiponectin and CTRP9 transgenic mice. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that adiponectin and CTRP9 associate via their globular C1q domain, and this interaction does not require their conserved N-terminal cysteines or their collagen domains. Furthermore, we show that adiponectin and CTRP9 form heterotrimers. In cultured myotubes, CTRP9 specifically activates AMPK, Akt, and p44/42 MAPK signaling pathways. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CTRP9 in obese (ob/ob) mice significantly lowered serum glucose levels. Collectively, these results suggest that CTRP9 is a novel adipokine, and further study of CTRP9 will yield novel mechanistic insights into its physiological and metabolic function."
https://openalex.org/W1965644332,"Although rod and cone photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate retina are anatomically connected or coupled by gap junctions, a type of electrical synapse, rod-cone electrical coupling is thought to be weak. Using tracer labeling and electrical recording in the goldfish retina and tracer labeling in the mouse retina, we show that the retinal circadian clock, and not the retinal response to the visual environment, controls the extent and strength of rod-cone coupling by activating dopamine D(2)-like receptors in the day, so that rod-cone coupling is weak during the day but remarkably robust at night. The results demonstrate that circadian control of rod-cone electrical coupling serves as a synaptic switch that allows cones to receive very dim light signals from rods at night, but not in the day. The increase in the strength and extent of rod-cone coupling at night may facilitate the detection of large dim objects."
https://openalex.org/W1999591105,"Reverse signaling by ephrin-As upon binding EphAs controls axon guidance and mapping. Ephrin-As are GPI-anchored to the membrane, requiring that they complex with transmembrane proteins that transduce their signals. We show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) serves this role in retinal axons. p75(NTR) and ephrin-A colocalize within caveolae along retinal axons and form a complex required for Fyn phosphorylation upon binding EphAs, activating a signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal changes. In vitro, retinal axon repulsion to EphAs by ephrin-A reverse signaling requires p75(NTR), but repulsion to ephrin-As by EphA forward signaling does not. Constitutive and retina-specific p75(NTR) knockout mice have aberrant anterior shifts in retinal axon terminations in superior colliculus, consistent with diminished repellent activity mediated by graded ephrin-A reverse signaling induced by graded collicular EphAs. We conclude that p75(NTR) is a signaling partner for ephrin-As and the ephrin-A- p75(NTR) complex reverse signals to mediate axon repulsion required for guidance and mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2083901174,"Center-surround receptive fields are a fundamental unit of brain organization. It has been proposed that olfactory bulb mitral cells exhibit this functional circuitry, with excitation from one glomerulus and inhibition from a broad field of glomeruli within reach of the lateral dendrites. We investigated this hypothesis using a combination of in vivo intrinsic imaging, single-unit recording, and a large panel of odors. Assuming a broad inhibitory field, a mitral cell would be influenced by >100 contiguous glomeruli and should respond to many odors. Instead, the observed response rate was an order of magnitude lower. A quantitative model indicates that mitral cell responses can be explained by just a handful of glomeruli. These glomeruli are spatially dispersed on the bulb and represent a broad range of odor sensitivities. We conclude that mitral cells do not have center-surround receptive fields.

Instead, each mitral cell performs a specific computation combining a small and diverse set of glomerular inputs. Lateral inhibition is a prominent motif in many neuronal circuits, in which each neuron receives inhibition from the output of other cells in the same population. Sometimes, the field of lateral connections is broad and dense, collecting input from every neuron within some range. Classic examples are the inhibitory fields of photoreceptors (Hartline et al., 1956Hartline H.K. Wagner H.G. Ratliff F. Inhibition in the eye of Limulus.J. Gen. Physiol. 1956; 39: 651-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), bipolar cells (Werblin and Dowling, 1969Werblin F.S. Dowling J.E. Organization of the retina of the mudpuppy, Necturus maculosus. II. Intracellular recording.J. Neurophysiol. 1969; 32: 339-355PubMed Google Scholar), and ganglion cells (Kuffler, 1953Kuffler S.W. Discharge patterns and functional organization of mammalian retina.J. Neurophysiol. 1953; 16: 37-68PubMed Google Scholar) in the retina. In other cases, the lateral interactions are rather sparse and specific, for example the horizontal connections in visual cortex (Sincich and Blasdel, 2001Sincich L.C. Blasdel G.G. Oriented axon projections in primary visual cortex of the monkey.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4416-4426PubMed Google Scholar, Yoshioka et al., 1996Yoshioka T. Blasdel G.G. Levitt J.B. Lund J.S.

Cortex. 1996; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The computational role of these two arrangements is likely different: dense lateral inhibition in the retina can serve to enhance local stimulus differences and suppress broadly correlated input (Ratliff and Hartline, 1959Ratliff F.

By comparison, sparse lateral connectivity likely serves more specific computations involving select features, such as crossorientation suppression (Olshausen and Field, 2005Olshausen B.A. Field D.J. How close are we to understanding V1?.Neural Comput. 2005; 17: 1665-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, Sincich and Blasdel, 2001Sincich L.C. Blasdel G.G. Oriented axon projections in primary visual cortex of the monkey.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4416-4426PubMed Google Scholar). Which of these scenarios applies in the olfactory bulb? Receptor neurons in the olfactory epithelium send their axons to terminate in discrete glomeruli on the surface of the olfactory bulb (Mombaerts, 2006Mombaerts P. Axonal wiring in the mouse olfactory system.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 713-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Each glomerulus receives input from one or a few olfactory receptor types and thus represents a distinct channel of olfactory information. The circuits of the olfactory bulb combine signals from these input channels into the responses of mitral cells, whose axons project to downstream brain areas (Shepherd and Greer, 2004Shepherd G.M. Greer C.A. Olfactory bulb.in: Shepherd G.M. The Synaptic Organization of the Brain. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York2004: 165-216Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Each mitral cell sends a single apical dendrite into a primary glomerulus, where it receives excitation from the receptor neurons. It receives inhibition from interneurons in the glomerular layer, originating both locally and in distant glomeruli (Aungst et al., 2003Aungst J.L. Heyward P.M. Puche A.C. Karnup S.V. Hayar A. Szabo G. Shipley M.T. Centre-surround inhibition among olfactory bulb glomeruli.Nature. 2003; 426: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Wachowiak and Shipley, 2006Wachowiak M. Shipley M.T. Coding and synaptic processing of sensory information in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The mitral cell also extends a broad field of lateral dendrites that form reciprocal synapses with granule cells (Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998Isaacson J.S. Strowbridge B.W. Olfactory reciprocal synapses: dendritic signaling in the CNS.Neuron. 1998; 20: 749-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Egger and Urban, 2006Egger V. Urban N.N. Dynamic connectivity in the mitral cell-granule cell microcircuit.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By this route, a mitral cell receives disynaptic inhibition from other mitral cells (Figure 1A), and given the anatomical extent of the lateral dendrites, this inhibitory influence might derive from a dense field with many hundreds of glomeruli (Figure 1B). Indeed, a prior study concluded in favor of this view (Luo and Katz, 2001Luo M. Katz L.C. Response correlation maps of neurons in the mammalian olfactory bulb.Neuron. 2001; 32: 1165-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the functional extent of these lateral interactions. Which of the many glomeruli actually influence a mitral cell's firing? Following prior usage, we will call this set of glomeruli the mitral cell's “receptive field” (Luo and Katz, 2001Luo M. Katz L.C. Response correlation maps of neurons in the mammalian olfactory bulb.Neuron. 2001; 32: 1165-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To probe the structure of this receptive field, we used a large panel of odors to activate the glomeruli in many possible patterns and monitored these input patterns by optical imaging. We also recorded the firing of mitral cells under the same stimuli and devised a response analysis that could detect any change in firing pattern with high sensitivity. It emerged that the firing of a typical mitral cell is governed by just a few glomeruli (Figure 1C) that are spatially dispersed and functionally diverse. Apparently, only a few of the many possible lateral connections dominate the response of a mitral cell. We recorded the firing of 179 individual mitral cells in the olfactory bulb of anesthetized rats. The stimulus consisted of odor pulses delivered to the nose, 10–20 s in duration, interleaved with exposure to clean air. The animal sampled the odors through periodic inhalations, and this breathing rhythm imposes a strong pattern on the firing of mitral cells (Adrian, 1942Adrian E.D. Olfactory reactions in the brain of the hedgehog.J. Physiol. 1942; 100: 459-473PubMed Google Scholar, Onoda and Mori, 1980Onoda N. Mori K. Depth distribution of temporal firing patterns in olfactory bulb related to air-intake cycles.J. Neurophysiol. 1980; 44: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of an odor, the firing pattern changes (Macrides and Chorover, 1972Macrides F. Chorover S.L. Olfactory bulb units: activity correlated with inhalation cycles and odor quality.Science. 1972; 175: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Chaput et al., 1992Chaput M.A. Buonviso N. Berthommier F. Temporal patterns in spontaneous and odour-evoked mitral cell discharges recorded in anaesthetized freely breathing animals.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the present study, we required a very sensitive measure of these changes in order to resolve the influence of different glomeruli on the mitral cell's response. The most commonly used measure of the odor response is the total number of spikes fired during an inhalation (Davison and Katz, 2007Davison I.G. Katz L.C.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Fletcher and Wilson, 2003Fletcher M.L. Wilson D.A.

USA. 1995; 92: 3371-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). However, we observed that many odors did not affect the average firing rate but altered the distribution of spikes throughout the inhalation period (Macrides and Chorover, 1972Macrides F. Chorover S.L. Olfactory bulb units: activity correlated with inhalation cycles and odor quality.Science. 1972; 175: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Chaput et al., 1992Chaput M.A. Buonviso N. Berthommier F. Temporal patterns in spontaneous and odour-evoked mitral cell discharges recorded in anaesthetized freely breathing animals.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, instead of simply counting each respiration's spikes, we chose a graphical display that indicates the position or “phase” of each spike during the respiration cycle (Figure 2). For some neurons, the response behavior seemed to be wholly captured by changes in the firing rate (Figure 2A). Other cells however, showed very clear odor responses as judged by phase plots, without any change in the firing rate (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2E). Furthermore, two odors can produce responses with a similar change in firing rate but qualitatively distinct phase plots (Figure 2D). When the same sequence of odors was repeated, these cells produced identical firing patterns (Figures 2A–2D), indicating that the respiration-locked phase shifts are indeed reliable indicators of the odor response. On this background, the goal was to reliably detect subtle changes in the firing pattern as the stimulus switches from air to odor. As is apparent from the phase plots in Figure 2, the changes were usually restricted to one or a few portions of the respiration cycle, while others remained unchanged. Ideally, a weighted average would be applied to emphasize the phases that show the largest odor-related change in firing. Of course, this weighting would need to be chosen appropriately for each different neuron. To generalize this linear weighting approach, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of spike trains in all respiration cycles (see Experimental Procedures). This method identifies one or more linear weighting schemes that best discriminate between air and odor exposure. For most mitral cells, we found that a single principal component accounted for almost all of the explainable variance in the data set (Figure 3A). The remaining variance was dominated by stimulus-independent noise, as estimated by a shuffle test (Figure 3A and Experimental Procedures). Thus, we measured the mitral cell's response by the projection of the firing pattern onto the first principal component, computed individually for each mitral cell (Figure 3B). This yields a single scalar response number for every respiration cycle. Responses of different sign can be captured, and in general, larger changes in the firing pattern translate into larger response magnitudes (Figure 3B). Overall, this sensitive measure of mitral cell firing detected ∼3-fold more odor responses than the average firing rate (Figure 4A). With this response measure in hand, we sought to identify which odors actually elicit a change in a mitral cell's firing. Since there is always some stochastic variation in firing, one needs to identify changes that significantly exceed this background noise. For this purpose, each odor presentation was divided into three segments of equal duration: the first half of the air exposure prior to the odor, the second half, and the odor exposure itself. The firing response was computed for each segment. Then we computed the response change between air and odor and compared that to the change between the two air presentations. To determine which of these responses are significant, we used the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC), a method derived from signal-detection theory (Green and Swets, 1974Green D.M. Swets J.A. Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics. R.E. Krieger Pub. Co., Huntington, NY1974Google Scholar). Briefly, one chooses a threshold above which a change in firing pattern is called significant. When applied to the air/odor comparison, this threshold will deliver a number of “hits.” When applied to the air/air comparison, it produces a number of “false alarms,” which are due to stochastic variations in firing. As the threshold is gradually raised from zero, the number of hits and false alarms change at different rates, yielding the ROC curve (Figure 4A). On this curve, we chose a threshold that accepts ten false alarms for every 100 hits. Note that the traditional response measure using firing rate alone would yield a much inferior ROC curve that detects 3-fold fewer hits for the same fraction of false alarms. From an initial panel of ∼200 odors, a set of 40 were selected because they prominently activate glomeruli in the dorsal olfactory bulb (see Table S2, List A). Among these 40 odors, the average mitral cell produced a significant response for only 2.0 odors (Figure 4B). Surprisingly, half of the mitral cells did not respond to any odors in the set (Figure 4B). If the mitral cell had a dense receptive field among the glomeruli, one might expect that any odor activating a glomerulus within reach of the lateral dendrites should produce a detectable change in firing. In this case, the notable lack of responses could be explained if the odor panel activated glomeruli located at a great distance from half of the recorded mitral cells, for example glomeruli clustered mainly on one side of the bulb. Alternatively, the mitral cell might have a sparse receptive field, dominated by just a few glomerular inputs. To interpret the influence of glomeruli on mitral cell responses, we followed the activity patterns among glomeruli under the same panel of odors. We used the method of intrinsic signal imaging. When the bulb surface is illuminated with deep red light, activated glomeruli appear as spots of decreased reflectance (Rubin and Katz, 1999Rubin B.D. Katz L.C. Optical imaging of odorant representations in the mammalian olfactory bulb.Neuron. 1999; 23: 499-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, Uchida et al., 2000Uchida N.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1351-1360PubMed Google Scholar). For each of the glomeruli identified this way, its activity was measured by the intensity of the spot (see Experimental Procedures). For statistical controls, a number of nonresponsive regions on the bulb surface were identified, and their intensity changes analyzed in the same way as for the overt spots (Figure 5A). Following the same strategy applied to mitral cell recordings, we then identified the response of a glomerulus as significant if the intensity change exceeded a certain threshold. By varying that threshold, we followed the number of hits among glomeruli and the number of false alarms in the control regions, resulting in the ROC curve of Figure 5B. Again, we chose a threshold admitting a 10% rate of false alarms. With this criterion for significance, one can analyze how many odors activate a glomerulus (Figure 5C). About 200 glomeruli are within view on the dorsal olfactory bulb preparation (Meister and Bonhoeffer, 2001Meister M. Bonhoeffer T. Tuning and topography in an odor map on the rat olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1351-1360PubMed Google Scholar), and ∼3/4 of these were not activated by any of the 40 odors. On average, each glomerulus responded to 1.2 odors in that panel, but the histogram shows a strong tail with considerably more promiscuous glomeruli (Figure 5C). The glomeruli activated by the odor panel were not clustered, but rather evenly distributed on the dorsal olfactory bulb (Figure 5A). The mitral cells we recorded were all situated near the middle of this field. In this light, the observation that over half of these mitral cells did not respond to any odor (Figure 4B) becomes more compelling: all of them should have had at least one strongly activated glomerulus within reach of the lateral dendrites. The next section will investigate this in more detail. Whereas the previous section quantified how responsive mitral cells and glomeruli are, we now use a simple model to compare these numbers. If one assumes that the mitral cell has a dense receptive field among glomeruli (Figure 1B), then its activity should be influenced by all glomeruli within the area covered by its secondary dendrites. We did not reconstruct the dendritic trees of the recorded mitral cells, but for concreteness we will suppose that the lateral dendrites integrate information from glomeruli over an area of radius 880 μm, a typical radius for the dendritic field (Egger and Urban, 2006Egger V. Urban N.N. Dynamic connectivity in the mitral cell-granule cell microcircuit.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Onoda and Mori, 1980Onoda N. Mori K. Depth distribution of temporal firing patterns in olfactory bulb related to air-intake cycles.J. Neurophysiol. 1980; 44: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar). Note that this is a conservative choice, since a mitral cell can connect via intermediary granule cells to another mitral cell up to two dendritic radii away. On the other hand, a morphological analysis concluded that the density of connections is likely negligible beyond one radius (Egger and Urban, 2006Egger V. Urban N.N. Dynamic connectivity in the mitral cell-granule cell microcircuit.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To predict the odor responses of a mitral cell at a given location on the dorsal bulb, we centered the integration circle at that location and counted how many of the odors activate at least one glomerulus within the circle (Figure 6A). Under these assumptions, a mitral cell recorded in the middle of this olfactory bulb should produce a substantial response to ∼26 of the 40 odors (Figure 6B). Averaging this analysis over glomerular recordings from six olfactory bulbs, the number of effective odors for an average mitral cell in the dorsal area should be 22 (Figure 6C). This exceeds by more than 10-fold the experimentally observed number of 2.0 odors (Figure 4B). Recall in this context that our measure of the mitral cell response is sensitive to any change in activity, not just the overtly excitatory or inhibitory responses. In principle, this discrepancy could be reduced if one assumes a smaller integration radius around each mitral cell, so we repeated the above calculation for different radii (Figure 6C). In order to reconcile the predicted number of effective odors with the observations, the radius must be reduced to an implausibly small 150 μm. Effectively, this would allow only two to three nearest-neighbor glomeruli to contribute to the mitral cell's activity, clearly inconsistent with the reach of the lateral dendrites. Another way to reconcile the results would be to alter the thresholds applied to mitral cell responses (Figure 4) or glomerular responses (Figure 5). By either admitting fewer glomerular responses or more mitral cell responses, one might find a relation consistent with a large integration radius for the mitral cell. We performed the entire analysis parametrically in these thresholds (Figure S1). To match the predictions from a large integration radius, one has to adopt absurd threshold values that either reject obvious responses among glomeruli (Figure S1A) or accept clear false positives among mitral cells (Figure S1C). Finally one might object that the experimental response measures are imperfect. Specifically, it is possible that intrinsic signal imaging fails to detect weak responses among glomeruli. Of course, if the true response rate among glomeruli were greater, that would further increase the discrepancy here between predicted and measured results. On the side of mitral cells, we are already using very sensitive methods, recording all action potentials and analyzing them for subtle variations. Thus, one concludes that the vast majority of glomeruli within reach of a mitral cell's secondary dendrites do not produce any noticeable response when activated individually. We will consider two ways of explaining this result. First, it is possible that the mitral cell has a dense but very weak receptive field surround. In that case, the influence of any single glomerulus, other than the principal one, may remain below the threshold of what is recognized as an odor response. Alternatively, the receptive field may be composed of the principal and just a few other glomeruli, each with a strong influence on the mitral cell response. Both the hypotheses mentioned above call for a model that allows for subthreshold summation of more subtle glomerular influences. Thus, instead of using the binary categorization into responses above or below threshold, we searched for a model that would quantitatively match the magnitude of activity in mitral cells. The simplest form of such a model involves linear summation: each mitral cell pools inputs from a set of glomeruli, and the signal in each glomerulus is weighted by a factor representing its “connection strength” (Equation 3). One can now compare different hypotheses for these weighting factors. To implement a dense but weak surround, we gave the cell's primary glomerulus a strong weight and all other glomeruli a small weight, decreasing with distance from the primary glomerulus. The primary glomerulus was taken to be the one whose odor-response spectrum was most highly correlated with that of the mitral cell. The weights of the surrounding glomeruli declined as a Gaussian function of distance (Equation 5 and Figure 7A). In fitting this receptive field, we adjusted the strength of the contributions of the primary glomerulus and the surround to minimize the difference between the simulated and the observed odor responses (see Experimental Procedures). In general, the resulting fit quality was quite poor. One of the best examples is displayed in Figure 7: note that there is significant discrepancy between the predicted and measured odor-response spectrum (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the surround in this fit makes very little contribution to the response (Figure 7C). To implement a sparse receptive field, we assumed that just a few glomeruli made strong contributions (Figure 8A). Given the earlier observation that only a handful of glomeruli are needed to explain the frequency of mitral cell responses (Figure 6C), we allowed for four glomeruli in this receptive field model. However, unlike in Figure 6C, these glomeruli were not restricted to adjacent locations. For any given mitral cell, the identities and weights of those glomeruli were optimized. The fits obtained with this sparse model were markedly better (Figure 8B). For many mitral cells, the residual of the fit was comparable to the trial-to-trial noise in the response (Figure 8B). This means that the model can predict mitral cell responses from glomerular activity with the same accuracy at which the brain produces them. For some mitral cells with low noise, we encountered interesting discrepancies, where the response to certain odors could not be fitted at all (Figure 8B). In those cases, the odor in question did not activate any glomerulus that we recorded; presumably, the glomerulus that caused the mitral cell response was outside the dorsal window of view. Note that such discrete failures are a hallmark of the sparse receptive field model, and not expected under a dense receptive field hypothesis. To summarize results from this analysis over many mitral cells, we compared the goodness of fit for the different receptive field models (Figure 9A). To enhance confidence in the results, this analysis was restricted only to mitral cells with the most reproducible responses (see Experimental Procedures). We found that the sparse receptive field performed significantly better than either a dense receptive field or a field consisting of a single glomerulus (Figure 9A). Note that the sparse receptive field model (Figure 8A) has a few more degrees of freedom than the dense receptive field (Figure 7A). One might be concerned that these additional parameters allow for “overfitting” of the response data, namely an improvement of the fit quality without extracting any underlying structure in the data. To explore this, we performed a shuffle test: the measured odor-response spectrum of each glomerulus was shuffled randomly, and the analysis was repeated. The resulting sparse fits were poor, comparable to the dense and single-glomerular fits (Figure 9A). We conclude that the sparse receptive field model does not suffer from overfitting and truly represents a superior description of the interactions between glomeruli and mitral cells. Given that a mitral cell is only influenced by a few glomeruli, we asked whether these glomeruli have any distinguishing features in common. First, we considered their spatial proximity on the olfactory bulb. It emerged that the glomeruli used to compose a mitral cell's receptive field are no closer together than any randomly selected glomeruli within the dorsal observation window (Figure 9B). Then, we inspected their odor-response spectra and analyzed their degree of overlap (see Experimental Procedures). By this criterion as well, the glomeruli contributing to a mitral cell response are no more similar than any glomeruli picked by chance (Figure 9C). In this study, we investigated the functional connectivity patterns between inputs and outputs of the olfactory bulb. Specifically, we tested the relationship between signals in glomeruli and the responses of mitral cells. It has been suggested that a mitral cell gets excited by a single central glomerulus and receives broad and predominantly inhibitory inputs from a large surrounding field of glomeruli. We found that this dense receptive field model is inconsistent with the observed odor responses (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 9). Instead, a small number of glomeruli seem to contribute strongly to the mitral cell's activity and can account for most of its odor response (Figure 8, Figure 9). Furthermore, the glomeruli that constitute this sparse receptive field tend to be chemically dissimilar and spatially dispersed on the bulb (Figure 9). This represents a fundamental revision of the nature of signal flow in the olfactory bulb. We discuss briefly the basis for these conclusions and their implications for the nature of odor processing. Individual mitral cells responded to very few odors in our panel (Figure 4): about 50% gave no response, and the other neurons detected a median of 3 of the 40 odors. Although it is difficult to compare such percentages across studies, the sparse odor sensitivities observed here are similar to other recordings from mitral cells at low odor concentrations (Davison and Katz, 2007Davison I.G.

Using simultaneous EEG recordings directly from deep brain structures and the scalp, we show that the human thalamus systematically reacts to syntactic and semantic parameters of auditorily presented language in a temporally interleaved manner in coordination with cortical regions. In contrast, two key structures of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internus and the subthalamic nucleus, were not found to be engaged in these processes. We therefore propose that syntactic and semantic language analysis is primarily realized within cortico-thalamic networks, whereas a cohesive basal ganglia network is not involved in these essential operations of language analysis.

Since then our ideas on how language is represented in the human brain have undergone considerable changes (for recent reviews see Friederici, 2002Friederici A.D.

This cortico-centric view is supplemented by models that additionally propose language-related functions for subcortical structures; i.e., the basal ganglia (BG) and/or thalamic nuclei (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E.

In this context, it has been proposed that linguistic processing might be organized in parallel to nonlinguistic operations coded in cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical circuitries (Ullman, 2006Ullman M.T.

The declarative/procedural model of lexicon and grammar.J. Psycholinguist. Res. 2001; 30: 37-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Other researchers have proposed a “lexical selection model” (Wallesch and Papagno, 1988Wallesch C.W. Papagno C. Subcortical aphasia.in: Rose F.C. Whurr R. Wyke M.A. Aphasia.

Logop. 2001; 53: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), in which (1) the BG match context-bound phonological word representations in fronto-cortical areas with appropriate lexical information from temporo-parietal areas and (2) the BG, in conjunction with the thalamus, primes the cortex for language production. Finally, the “selective engagement model” of Crosson, 1985Crosson B. Subcortical functions in language: a working model.Brain Lang. 1985; 25: 257-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar suggests that language capacities are realized in cortico-thalamic networks, whereas BG functions are essentially nonlinguistic. This model suggests that specific thalamic nuclei flexibly gate the flow of language-related information between frontal and temporo-parietal cortices by monitoring the activity and connectivity states of these areas (Crosson, 1985Crosson B. Subcortical functions in language: a working model.Brain Lang. 1985; 25: 257-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar; also cf. Johnson and Ojemann, 2000Johnson M.D. Ojemann G.A.

Crosson B. Subcortical aphasia.Brain Lang. 1997; 58: 355-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The above concepts are mainly based on the correlation of aphasic syndromes with focal brain damage, and on language studies using functional imaging or scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) methods, namely event-related potentials (ERPs). Naturally, each of these methods has specific limitations. With respect to clinico-pathological correlations, ascribing specific language functions to particular subcortical structures is somewhat complicated due to variations in the site and volume of cerebral lesions and the heterogeneous nature of neuropsychological effects in aphasic patients (cf. Nadeau and Crosson, 1997Nadeau S.E. Crosson B. Subcortical aphasia.Brain Lang. 1997; 58: 355-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, Craver and Small, 1997Craver C.F. Small S.L. Subcortical aphasia and the problem of attributing functional responsibility to parts of distributed brain processes.Brain Lang. 1997; 58: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Additionally, functional imaging studies can provide detailed anatomical information but, due to the relatively poor temporal resolution of this technique, discerning the precise relationship between the eliciting events in a complex language task and the subsequent measured activity—especially since such tasks trigger numerous brain processes at short intervals—is difficult. Finally, while scalp ERPs provide reasonable information on the timing of brain processes, they are naturally remote to subcortical activity and therefore poorly suited for the functional study of deep brain structures. However, the temporal advantages of ERP can be complimented by the use of subcortical Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) to obtain detailed spatial information as well (Benabid et al., 2000Benabid A.L.

Med. 2000; 342: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). For a short time during this procedure, recordings can be performed from the externalized electrode leads to BG or thalamic structures; e.g., the Globus pallidus internus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). Using this approach, we aimed to clarify whether both the BG and the thalamus participated in the analysis of syntactic and semantic language information as central linguistic categories. To this end, scalp and depth ERPs were recorded in patients with GPi, STN, or VIM electrodes (the respective target depended on the underlying disease for which DBS was being administered), who engaged in two well-established language tasks (Figure 1). They were asked to judge the correctness of acoustically presented German sentences that were either accurate or containing violations with respect to structure (syntactic error) or meaning (semantic error). For the scalp recordings, we predicted the previously described physiological pattern of language-related ERP (Friederici et al., 1993Friederici A.D. Pfeifer E. Hahne A.

Reading senseless sentences: brain potentials reflect semantic incongruity.Science. 1980; 207: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar); i.e., upon syntactic errors, an early left anterior negativity (ELAN) would be followed by a late parietal positivity (P600), whereas semantic errors would elicit a broad central negativity (N400). Although these ERPs were primarily related to language violations, they were assumed to be indices of regular, though augmented, syntactic and semantic analysis processes (Friederici, 2002Friederici A.D.

Hillyard S.A. Reading senseless sentences: brain potentials reflect semantic incongruity.Science. 1980; 207: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). The idea behind this hypothesis is that brain regions involved in decoding language would raise operating expenses in accordance with how much ongoing input deviates from an expectation caused by a verbal sequence (Kutas and Hillyard, 1980Kutas M. Hillyard S.A.

Therefore, relatively simple and correctly set syntactic parameters would generally not cause sufficient neuronal activity to result in macroscopically discernable ELAN and P600. The assumption that activity of attenuated magnitude occurs without linguistic violations has been corroborated by a number of findings. For example, ELAN and P600 components have been identified in the context of correct, but complex, phrase structures, suggesting that high parsing demands lead to enhanced processing in these two time windows (Friederici et al., 1998Friederici A.D.

Further, with the aid of source modeling, the generators of the ELAN have been localized to inferior frontal and fronto-opercular cortical regions (Friederici et al., 2000aFriederici A.D. Wang Y.

Auditory language comprehension: an event-related fMRI study on the processing of syntactic and lexical information.Brain Lang. 2000; 74: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Specifically, the ELAN appears to reflect the automatic fontal detection of a grammatically incorrect sentence continuation as compared against a regularly expected phrase structure (Friederici et al., 2000aFriederici A.D.

Brain Mapp. 2000; 11: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas the P600 is functionally related to the controlled temporo-parietal “integration and repair” of the perceived structural violation (Hahne and Friederici, 1999Hahne A.

In this study simultaneous scalp and thalamic/BG EEG recordings are used to provide insights into the cortico-basal organization of language analysis by referring depth-recorded ERPs elicited by syntactic versus semantic phrase violations to their scalp-recorded counterparts (ELAN, P600, and N400). Patients easily complied with the task demands and exhibited very low error rates. There were no significant differences in task performance between the groups. The rates of correctly handled trials, provided separately for correct / syntactically incorrect / semantically incorrect sentences were 97.7% ± 2.1%, 97% ± 2.7%, and 97.7% ± 2.5% for VIM patients; 97.1% ± 2.5%, 97.2% ± 3.2%, and 97.4% ± 2.9% for STN patients; and 97.5% ± 2.8%, 97.8% ± 2.4%, and 97.2% ± 2.9% for GPi patients (respectively), amounting to an overall accuracy of 97.4% ± 2.6%. The averaging of ERPs was based on correctly handled trials free of eye-blink or technical artifacts. The number of retained trials out of 48 possible per ERP, provided separately for the correct / syntactically incorrect / semantically incorrect condition, was 40.7 ± 4.1, 39.6 ± 3.8, and 40.9 ± 4.3 for VIM patients; 39.7 ± 4, 39.4 ± 4.5, and 39.4 ± 4.2 for STN patients; and 39.8 ± 3.9, 40.0 ± 4.1, and 38.9 ± 4.5 for GPi patients, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups and conditions. In all patient groups, the previously described language-related ERP effects that resulted from the differences between processing correct versus syntactically/semantically incorrect sentences were identified as expected. Following syntactic phrase violations, the ELAN (Friederici et al., 1993Friederici A.D. Pfeifer E. Hahne A.

Lang. 1992; 31: 785-806Crossref Scopus (1088) Google Scholar), at electrode Pz, whereas following semantic incongruities, the N400 was maximal at Cz (Kutas and Hillyard, 1980Kutas M. Hillyard S.A. Reading senseless sentences: brain potentials reflect semantic incongruity.Science. 1980; 207: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). These differences were significant for the VIM group (Figure 2A), STN group (Figure 2B), and GPi group (Figure 2C) at p < 0.0005, p < 0.005, and p < 0.005 in the time interval for ELAN (100–250 ms); at p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001 in the time interval for P600 (500–1000 ms); and at p < 0.005, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01 in the time interval for N400 (300–700 ms), respectively (Figures 3A–3C). The average amplitude differences in the respective intervals were −2.14 ± 0.5 μV, −1.99 ± 0.5 μV, and −2.07 ± 0.6 μV for ELAN; 3.35 ± 0.5 μV, 3.09 ± 0.6 μV, and 3.26 ± 0.6 μV for P600; and −2.58 ± 0.5 μV, −2.47 ± 0.7 μV, and −2.56 ± 0.4 μV for N400, respectively. The peak latencies were 169 ± 34 ms, 160 ± 56 ms, and 168 ± 45 ms for ELAN; 738 ± 92 ms, 725 ± 65 ms, and 698 ± 51 ms for P600; and 535 ± 52 ms, 501 ± 26 ms, and 516 ± 54 ms for N400; respectively. No statistically significant differences were obtained between groups, neither for the reported amplitudes nor for the latencies.Figure 3Scalp Activations upon Semantic ViolationsShow full captionThe known spatio-temporal EEG pattern indicating the processing of semantic phrase elements was obtained across all groups, i.e. in patients with VIM, STN and GPi electrodes for DBS (for each of these groups [A, B, and C, respectively], grand averages are shown).

The presentation of a semantic sentence violation induced a larger ERP than the presentation of correct sentences did. As expected, this difference peaked over centro-parietal scalp regions as the well-known N400, conceptualized as increased semantic retrieval in bitemporal and frontal networks consequent to lexico-semantic mismatch. In all patients with thalamic DBS electrodes, activity related to syntactic and semantic phrase violations was discernable in the monopolar recordings from VIM to linked mastoid electrodes. In contrast, no language-related ERPs were obtained in any of the monopolar derivations from STN and GPi. In bipolar depth recordings no language-related ERPs were found in any of the groups. Following syntactic phrase violations, the pattern obtained from VIM was consistent across patients as two sequential negative potentials. These ERPs occurred in an early time window from 100 ms to 300 ms (early TW) and in a late time window from 400 ms to 900 ms (late TW) following the onset of the used participle (see Experimental Procedures). The components in these intervals were significantly larger in the incorrect condition (as compared with the correct condition) in both the left and right hemispheres (left and right, early TW: p < 0.01; left and right, late TW: p < 0.01). The average differences in ERP amplitudes between correct and syntactically violated conditions for the left and right hemispheres were −2.11 ± 0.6 μV and −1.09 ± 0.74 μV in the early time interval and −3.66 ± 0.7 μV and −1.91 ± 0.6 μV in the late interval, with peak latencies at 207 ± 38 ms and 203 ± 36 ms and at 595 ± 64 ms and 582 ± 78 ms, respectively. Following lexico-semantic phrase violations, the ERP in the correct condition was superimposed with a broad, large negative potential in the N400 time window between 300 and 700 ms. The average amplitude in this interval was significantly larger in the incorrect condition as compared with the correct condition for the left and right hemispheres (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), with the difference of magnitudes at −3.31 ± 0.6 μV and −1.95 ± 0.6 μV, respectively. This monophasic component peaked at 537 ± 59 ms in the left hemisphere and 539 ± 63 ms in the right. Generally, the difference potentials between correct and syntactically or semantically violated conditions were larger in the left hemisphere than in the right (syntactic violation, early TW: p < 0.05; late TW: p < 0.05; semantic violation: p < 0.05). Although no language-related potentials were visually discernable in any bipolar depth recording from VIM or in monopolar derivations from STN and GPi, subtle ERP differences between conditions might have been present in any of these recordings (Figure 4). Therefore, putative activations in the above intervals were additionally compared between conditions. However, with respect to both syntactic and semantic violations, these comparisons failed to reveal any task-related ERP differences. The original ERPs following correctly versus incorrectly used participles were contrasted to determine if the obtained pattern was exclusively due to the processing of presented linguistic anomalies, or if language-related activations were also discernable upon the presentation of correct phrases. It became evident that the residual thalamic activities of “syntactically incorrect minus correct” stem from the augmentation of biphasic thalamic potentials already present in the correct condition. The average amplitude values across the two intervals, in which the correct and incorrect conditions diverged from each other, were significantly different from the average amplitude value across a 500 ms prephrase baseline (early TW: 100–300 ms; late TW: 400–900 ms following the onset of the used participle; p < 0.01 for left and right hemispheres and for both intervals). Upon lexico-semantic violations, this basic pattern was superimposed with a broad monophasic component with a similar time course to scalp N400. In contrast, no language-related activity was found in the recordings from STN or GPi, in neither the correct nor the incorrect conditions (Figure 5). Accordingly, no differences from baseline amplitude values could be identified (all p > 0.05). To study the chronometric relations between language-related activations at either brain level, depth ERPs evoked upon syntactic violations were compared with scalp ELAN at F7 and with P600 at Pz. Depth ERPs evoked upon semantic violations were compared with scalp N400 at Cz. Thalamic values were determined at the left monopolar recordings because of the larger task effect in this hemisphere. For syntax-related ERPs, the individual peak latencies of the early thalamic component (T1) and the ELAN were compared to each other, as were those of the late thalamic component (T2) and the P600, based on the temporal proximity of these components between levels: T1 was found to peak after the ELAN, and T2, prior to the P600 (ELAN-T1, p < 0.05; T2-P600, p < 0.001; Figure 6). For semantically related ERPs, no significant difference between the peak latencies of N400 and the concomitant depth ERP was identified. The group-average pattern of language-related ERPs in the monopolar recordings from VIM, along with their absence in other depth recordings, could be confirmed intraindividually by simultaneous recordings from VIM and GPi because two patients received bilateral DBS in both VIM and GPi; i.e., four DBS electrodes. In these two patients, biphasic thalamic activation was present for the left and the right hemisphere following syntactic phrase violations, whereas monophasic negative potentials followed semantic incongruities. No language-related ERP effects were obtained in the concomitant recordings from GPi (Figure 7). Finally, we investigated whether the mastoidal reference might have contributed to the results in the monopolar thalamic recordings. ERPs to these electrode sites might possibly dominate recordings in which the thalamic contact would be inert. Therefore, the paradigm and the scalp recordings were run in five healthy subjects who, in addition to the scalp array used in other patients, had EEG electrodes positioned over either acromion, referenced to the respective ipsilateral mastoid electrode: in these additional channels language-related activity should only be detectable if picked up by the mastoidal electrodes because EEG signals cannot stem from acromial recording sites. The typical pattern upon syntactic and semantic violations was obtained in all subjects with ELAN at F7 and P600 at Pz or N400 at Cz. In contrast to this, no ERP and no difference between correct versus incorrect conditions could be identified in the derivation from the acromia to the mastoidal electrodes. Our data suggest that syntactic and semantic language processing largely involves cortico-thalamic networks and, contrary to prior suggestions, does not utilize a BG network. In particular, we found that the violation of syntactic as well as semantic phrase attributes elicited ERPs in recordings from the VIM of the thalamus, but not in recordings from adjacent BG structures. Importantly, neither disease status nor DBS electrode implantation interfered with regular surface ERP expression; all patients displayed the expected language-related scalp ERP, i.e., an ELAN followed by a P600 in case of syntactic phrase violations, and an N400 in case of semantic incongruities. Specifically, the peak latencies of ELAN and P600 following syntactic violations framed an accompanying biphasic thalamic activation, whereas the time course of thalamic and scalp-recorded activities related to semantic incongruities was not significantly different between thalamic and scalp level. Subcortical ERPs were detectable only from the monopolar, and not from the bipolar, thalamic channels within the VIM. No language-related activity was obtained in any of the recordings from STN and GPi, be they monopolar or bipolar, although GPi, STN, and VIM patients shared the well-established pattern of language-related ERPs at scalp level. Moreover, the shared mastoid reference in the monopolar recordings from GPi, STN, and VIM excludes the possibility that language-related activity, only present in the monopolar VIM channels, stems from the mastoid elec"
https://openalex.org/W2075904779,"In the hematopoietic system, Notch signaling specifies T cell lineage fate, in part through negative regulation of B cell and myeloid lineage development. However, we unexpectedly observed the development of megakaryocytes when using heterotypic cocultures of hematopoietic stem cells with OP9 cells expressing Delta-like1, but not with parental OP9 cells. This effect was abrogated by inhibition of Notch signaling either with γ-secretase inhibitors or by expression of the dominant-negative Mastermind-like1. The importance of Notch signaling for megakaryopoietic development in vivo was confirmed by using mutant alleles that either activate or inhibit Notch signaling. These findings indicate that Notch is a positive regulator of megakaryopoiesis and plays a more complex role in cell-fate decisions among myeloid progenitors than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2048376510,"Although cell-penetrating peptides are able to deliver cargo into cells, their uptake mechanism is still not fully understood and needs to be elucidated to improve their delivery efficiency. Herein, we present evidence of a new mechanism involved in uptake, the membrane repair response. Recent studies have suggested that there might be a direct penetration of peptides in parallel with different forms of endocytosis. The direct penetration of hydrophilic peptides through the hydrophobic plasma membrane, however, is highly controversial. Three proteins involved in target cell apoptosis--perforin, granulysin, and granzymes--share many features common in uptake of cell-penetrating peptides (e.g., they bind proteoglycans). During perforin uptake, the protein activates the membrane repair response, a resealing mechanism triggered in cells with injured plasma membrane, because of extracellular calcium influx. On activation of the membrane repair response, internal vesicles are mobilized to the site of the disrupted plasma membrane, resealing it within seconds. In this study, we have used flow cytometry, fluorescence, and electron microscopy, together with high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, to present evidence that the membrane repair response is able to mask damages caused during cell-penetrating peptide uptake, thus preventing leakage of endogenous molecules out of the cell."

The peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of FKBP65 was previously shown to have only marginal effects on the rate of triple helix formation (Zeng, B., MacDonald, J. R., Bann, J. G., Beck, K., Gambee, J. E., Boswell, B. A., and Bächinger, H. P. (1998) Biochem. J. 330, 109–114). Here we show that FKBP65 is a monomer in solution and acts as a chaperone molecule when tested with two classic chaperone assays: FKBP65 inhibits the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase and is active in the denatured rhodanese refolding and aggregation assay. The chaperone activity is comparable to that of protein-disulfide isomerase, a well characterized chaperone. FKBP65 delays the in vitro fibril formation of type I collagen, indicating that FKBP65 is also able to interact with triple helical collagen, and acts as a collagen chaperone.

Immunophilins are intracellular receptors of two immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine A and FK506, and these receptors were divided into two classes in accordance with their binding ability of the immunosuppressant drugs. Proteins that bind to cyclosporine A are called the cyclophilins. FKBPs bind FK506 and are highly conserved and found in bacteria, yeast, and many tissues of higher eukaryotes. Almost every cellular compartment contains a member of this protein family. The FKBP class includes FKBP9, FKBP12, FKBP13, FKBP25, FKBP52, FKBP54, FKBP60, and FKBP65. All these proteins contain the binding motif for FK506. Both protein families have peptidylprolyl cistrans-isomerase (PPIase) activity. FKBP65 was first identified in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (1Coss M.C. Winterstein D. Sowder 2nd, R.C. Simek S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29336-29341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it consists of four basic FKBP13 domains. It was originally thought that FKBP65 interacts with c-Raf-1 (2Coss M.C. Stephens R.M. Morrison D.K. Winterstein D. Smith L.M. Simek S.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar), in analogy to the function of FKBP52 in stabilizing the glucocorticoid receptor (3Tai P.K. Albers M.W. Chang H. Faber L.E. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) or FKBP12 in stabilizing the ryanodine (4Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (5Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, it was shown later that FKBP65 is a luminal rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER)-resident protein that co-localized with tropoelastin (6Patterson C.E. Schaub T. Coleman E.J. Davis E.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the PPIase activity of FKBP65 is important for the folding of the proline-rich tropoelastin (7Davis E.C. Broekelmann T.J. Ozawa Y. Mecham R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of collagens involves a large number of post-translational modifications in which many different rER-resident proteins are involved (8Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). After the translocation of the growing polypeptide chains of procollagens into the rER, proline residues become 4-hydroxylated by prolyl 4-hydroxlase. 4-Hydroxylation of proline residues increases the stability of the triple helix and is a key element in the folding of the triple helix. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase requires an unfolded chain as a substrate. The chain selection and association for triple helix formation is determined by the C-terminal propeptides in fibrillar collagens. Premature association between procollagen chains is thought to be prevented by chaperones such as PDI, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and HSP47 and collagen modifying enzymes until the biosynthesis of the individual chain is completed. Additional modifications are the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues by the P3H1/CRTAP/cyclophilin B complex, the hydroxylation of lysine residues by lysyl hydroxylases and glycosylation. The chains are then selected, and trimers are formed by association of the C-terminal propeptides. Disulfide bonds between the chains are formed, and this formation is most likely catalyzed by protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). Triple helix formation proceeds from the C-terminal end toward the N-terminal end in a zipper-like fashion. The rate-limiting step in this process is the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds. This process can be catalyzed by peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerases (cyclophilins and FKBPs). Because procollagen molecules are only marginally stable, it was proposed that folding of procollagen molecules inside cells requires special chaperones (9Makareeva E. Leikin S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with HSP47 as a potential candidate. Given the complexity of this process, it is not surprising that so many different proteins in the rER are involved and that these proteins interact and function as “folding machines.” Additionally, collagen molecules have a strong tendency to aggregate and ultimately form insoluble complexes that stabilize connective tissues such as tendons, bone, and skin. This process must be inhibited inside the cells and allowed only after secretion into the extracellular space. The functional importance of collagen chaperones is further shown by the embryonic lethality of HSP47 knockout mice (10Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and the accumulation of BiP/GRP78 in cells with mutations in the collagen chains (11Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18226-18233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously isolated and characterized FKBP65 from chick embryos on a gelatin-Sepharose column (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of FKBP65 had only a marginal effect on the rate of folding of the collagen triple helix (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K.

Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a process that is rate-limited by cis-trans isomerizations (14Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This process is catalyzed by cyclophilin B (15Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Given the marginal effect of FKBP65 on the rate of triple helix formation, other functions for FKBP65 were considered. FKBP13, another rER-resident FKBP, was shown to be up-regulated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins (17Bush K.T. Hendrickson B.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Partaledis J.A. Berlin V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5450-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and recently FKBP22 was shown to be an rER chaperone that interacts with BiP (19Tremmel D. Duarte M. Videira A. Tropschug M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2036-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Tremmel D. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Why does FKBP65 interact with gelatinSepharose and what is the role of FKBP65 during collagen biosynthesis? In this report we show that FKBP65 acts as a chaperone. Purification of Chicken FKBP65—FKBP65 was isolated from 15- to 17-day-old chick embryos following a previously published protocol (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with slight modifications to improve the yield and purity. Briefly, 12 dozen chick embryos were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 m sucrose and protease inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Homogenization was carried out in a Waring blender at maximum speed for 3 min. This and all subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 × g in an H-6000A rotor (Sorvall) to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 125,000 × g in a 45-Ti rotor (Beckman). This pellet was enriched in rER vesicles and was resuspended in twice the volume of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2 m NaCl and the same protease inhibitors as above, treated with 1 μl/ml diisopropyl fluorophosphate and gently stirred for 4 h on ice. The extract was centrifuged for 1 h at 125,000 × g, filtered through cheesecloth and Miracloth, and applied to a gelatin-Sepharose 4B column (2.6 × 30 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). The column was washed with two bed volumes of buffer A, followed by one bed volume of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. After an additional one bed volume wash with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with a pH gradient from 7.5 to 5.0 with buffer A. Peak fractions containing FKBP65 were pooled, dialyzed into PBS, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter prior to loading on the P3H1 monoclonal antibody column (21Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23615-23621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The flow-through fractions from this column were dialyzed against 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and washed with 20 ml of the same buffer. Elution was done with a 30-ml gradient of 20 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, from 50 mm NaCl to 500 mm NaCl. The first peak containing pure FKBP65 was pooled and dialyzed against each enzyme assay and reaction buffers. N- and O-Glycosidase Treatment of FKBP65—Purified FKBP65 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was denatured with 0.1% SDS and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol (final concentrations), and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 30 mm and 0.1 unit/ml N-glycosidase F (Calbiochem) or 0.05 unit/ml O-glycosidase (Roche Applied Science) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and overnight, respectively. After the reaction, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel and developed by Western blotting using a commercial antibody against FKBP65 (BD Bioscience). Laser Light Scattering—FKBP65 was analyzed in a multi-angle laser light scattering instrument (Dawn EOS, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). A Superose 6 size exclusion column (10 × 300 mm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm NaCl, was used with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in conjunction with in-line UV, refractive index, and light scattering detectors. The signals from the detectors were normalized using bovine serum albumin and the Astra software (Wyatt Technology) was used for the analysis. CD Measurements—CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) using a Peltier thermostatted cell holder and a 1-mm path length cell (Starna Cells, Atascadero, CA). Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The spectra represent the average of at least 10 scans recorded at a wavelength resolution of 0.1 nm. The proteins were measured in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The spectra were analyzed using the CD Spectra Deconvolution software (22Böhm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Citrate Synthase Thermal Aggregation Assay—The inhibition of the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase has been widely used as an activity assay for chaperones (23Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 24Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Citrate synthase (Sigma) was diluted 200-fold to a final concentration of 0.15 μm into pre-warmed 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, at 43 °C. The aggregation of citrate synthase was monitored at 500 nm as a function of time in a Cary4 spectrophotometer (Varian). The absorbance change recorded is due to the increase in light scattering upon aggregation of citrate synthase. All protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. A stock solution of 0.5 mm FK506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan) was prepared in DMSO and further diluted to a final concentration of 1 μm (0.2% DMSO). FKBP65 was incubated with FK506 at 4 °C for 1 h. FKBP12 was obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. Denatured Rhodanese Refolding and Aggregation Assay—Another frequently used assay for chaperone activity is the inhibition of aggregation of chemically denatured rhodanese (26Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 27Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine rhodanese was denatured in 30 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C for 1 h, then diluted 100-fold to a final concentration of 0.2 μm in 30 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm KCl. The aggregation of denatured rhodanese was monitored at 320 nm with a Cary4 spectrophotometer. All protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Stock solutions of 0.5 mm FK506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals) and cyclosporin A (Calbiochem) were prepared in DMSO and further diluted to a final concentration of 1 μm (0.2% DMSO). FKBP65 was incubated with FK506 or cyclosporin A at 4 °C for 1 h. Binding Assay Using Gelatin-Sepharose and Type I Collagen Beads—Type I collagen was prepared from fetal bovine skin and immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Purified FKBP65 in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl, was mixed with gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or type I collagen beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant by centrifugation, the beads were washed in two bed volumes of reaction buffer and then sequentially eluted with the same amount of low pH buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl) and high salt buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 m NaCl). After the elution, the beads were mixed with the same amount of SDS sample buffer and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min to recover irreversibly bound FKBP65. Fractions were run on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, and the gel was stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent. Thermal Stability of Type I and Type III Collagens Measured by Optical Rotary Dispersion—The thermal stability of bovine type I and type III collagens was monitored at 365 nm using a 341MC polarimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a 10-cm path-length thermostatted cell. The temperature was controlled by a circulating water bath and programmable temperature controller (RCS, Lauda Division, Brinkman Instruments) and measured with a digital thermometer (Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, CT) and a thermistor inserted into the cell. Both the temperature and the optical rotatory dispersion signals were recorded and digitized on an HP9070A measurement and plotting system (Hewlett-Packard). The temperature was increased from 25 °C to 50 °C at a rate of 10 °C/h. Stock solutions of type I and type III collagen (final concentration, 0.08 μm) in 10 mm acetic acid were diluted into 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 m NaCl. Type I Collagen Fibril Formation Assay—A stock solution of type I collagen in 50 mm acetic acid was diluted to a final concentration of 0.3 μm in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm NaCl. The absorbance (light scattering) was monitored at 313 nm as a function of time. All protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Characterization of FKBP65—FKBP65 was isolated from chick embryos by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose. Many of the rER proteins associated with the biosynthesis of procollagens are bound by gelatin-Sepharose. Fig. 1A shows the elution of bound proteins with low pH buffer. Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1), CRTAP, and cyclophilin B, which form a strong complex (21Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 127: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), can be removed from the mixture by an affinity chromatography step with a monoclonal antibody against P3H1. FKBP65 was further purified from the flow-through by ion exchange chromatography. Fig. 1B shows a SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the purified FKBP65. When FKBP65 was treated with N- and O-glycosidase, it was apparent that FKBP65 contains N-linked, but not O-linked oligosaccharides, as shown in the Western blots in Fig. 1C. Purified FKBP65 was analyzed on a Superose 6 column with UV, refractive index, and light scattering detectors. Fig. 2A shows the detector responses as a function of elution time. The main peak of FKBP65 elutes around 30 min with a small amount eluting at 27 min. The large light scattering peak observed at 15 min is due to a small number of very large particles. These elute at the excluded volume of the column. The concentration-dependent UV and refractive index detectors showed no response at 15 min. The solvent peak at 40 min defines the included volume of the column. Fig. 2B shows the light scattering and normalized refractive index detector response from 24 to 32 min. The molecular mass calculated from these two detectors is shown for both peaks. The main peak of FKBP65 shows a molecular mass of 81,500 Da. The peak around 27 min shows the presence of some dimers and higher aggregates. However, most of the material elutes as a monomer. The CD spectrum of FKBP65 is shown in Fig. 2C. The secondary structural content of FKBP65 is ∼8.3% α-helix, 26.6% β-sheets, 22.9% turns, and 41.9% other structures. For comparison the spectrum of FKBP12 is included, which gives a deconvolution of 7.4% α-helix, 28.8% β-sheets, 17.4% turns, and 43.4% other structures. These data confirm that the overall structure of FKBP65 resembles that of the common FKBP domains, as shown previously by sequence comparison and analytical ultracentrifugation (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chaperone Activity of FKBP65—To test whether FKBP65 is a molecular chaperone, several established assays for chaperone activity were used. The thermal aggregation of citrate synthase has been used (23Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 24Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to assess chaperone activity. Absorbance at 500 nm is observed as a function of time. The absorbance increases due to an increase in light scattering by the aggregate formation of citrate synthase. Fig. 3A shows the concentration-dependent inhibition of the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase by FKBP65. Fig. 3B compares the activity of FKBP65 with the known chaperone PDI (29Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and includes the negative controls FKBP12 and RNase. The influence of the PPIase activity inhibitor FK506 on the chaperone activity of FKBP65 is shown in Fig. 3C. The chaperone activity of FKBP65 is barely affected by the presence of FK506, and FK506 alone has no chaperone activity. Another frequently used assay is the aggregation of denatured rhodanese (27Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows the concentration-dependent inhibition of rhodanese aggregation by FKBP65. Increasing concentrations of FKBP65 lead to an increase in the inhibition. Fig. 4B shows a comparison with RNase, PDI, and FKBP12. RNase is not active in this assay. In contrast to the citrate synthase assay, FKBP12 shows some activity toward rhodanese aggregation. However, the effect is smaller than that of PDI or FKBP65. In Fig. 4C the presence of immunosuppressant drugs was tested in this assay. Due to the limited solubility of the immunosuppressants the buffer system was altered to contain 0.2% DMSO. The presence of 0.2% DMSO changed the amplitude of the control measurement. 0.2 μm RNase, 1 μm FK506, and 1 μm cyclosporin A alone had no effect. 0.2 μm FKBP65 alone showed inhibition as described in Fig. 4A. If 0.2 μm FKBP65 is mixed with 0.2 μm RNase, there was no additional inhibition. However, when 0.2 μm FKBP65 is mixed with either 1 μm FK506 or 1 μm cyclosporin A an additional increase in inhibition was observed (Fig. 4C). FKBP65 Interacts with Folded and Unfolded Type I Collagen—Purified FKBP65 was shown to interact with gelatin-Sepharose beads and with folded type I collagen beads (Fig. 5A). These interactions are relatively weak, as expected for the proposed function as a molecular chaperone, where transient interactions are required to assist in the folding process. The binding of FKBP65 to both folded and unfolded collagens could influence the thermal stability of the triple helix, as has been suggested for HSP47 (9Makareeva E. Leikin S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The thermal stabilities of type I collagen (Fig. 5B) and type III collagen (Fig. 5C) in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of FKBP65 are shown to be slightly increased. Collagen Chaperone Activity of FKBP65—A test for rER chaperone activity during the biosynthesis of procollagens is the prevention of the premature association of triple helical procollagen molecules. This can be tested by adding the chaperones to a collagen fibril formation assay. Fig. 6A shows the concentration-dependent delay in fibril formation of type I collagen by FKBP65. This effect is compared with the known inhibitor HSP47 (30Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and to the negative controls RNase in Fig. 6B and FKBP12 in Fig. 6C. We previously observed that FKBP65 can be extracted from the rER of chick embryos on a gelatin-Sepharose column (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When the gelatin-Sepharose column is eluted with a low pH buffer, the two most abundant proteins are HSP47 and FKBP65. Other proteins known to be involved in the biosynthesis of procollagens, such as the α-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the β-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PDI), cyclophilin B, P3H1, and CRTAP, are present in smaller amounts. The peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of FKBP65 is not important for the formation of the procollagen triple helix (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Bächinger H.P. Morris N.P. Davis J.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we show that FKBP65 is not only a PPIase, but is also an rER chaperone. Purified FKBP65 is mostly a monomeric protein that contains a significant amount of N-linked oligosaccharides. FKBP65 consists of four FKBP domains with short linkers between the domains. The individual domains contain a single disulfide bond, which is also found in the rER-resident FKBP13. The structure of FKBP13 is nearly identical to the cytoplasmic FKBP12 with the exception of the disulfide bond, which is absent in FKBP12. However, our previous analysis showed that the cis-trans-isomerase activity of only one of the four domains of FKBP65 can be inhibited by FK506, and surprisingly also by cyclosporine A (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of FKBP65 was tested with two chaperone assays. Both show that FKBP65 is as active as PDI, a known rER-resident chaperone, in these assays. In the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase assay FKBP12 and RNase do not show any activity, whereas FKBP65 has an activity similar to PDI. This indicates that the presence of a single FKBP domain is not sufficient for chaperone activity; rather, multiple FKBP domains are required in a single molecule to function as a chaperone. The presence of multiple domains might increase the protein-binding capacity of FKBP65 in a cooperative way compared with FKBP12. The results of the rhodanese refolding and aggregation assay are very similar. In this assay FKBP12 shows some activity, probably due to the catalysis of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerizations in the refolding process of rhodanese. However, the effect of FKBP65 is more pronounced when compared with FKBP12. Furthermore, when the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 or cyclosporine A are added, the chaperone activity of FKBP65 is further increased. This was not observed in the citrate synthase aggregation assay. It was shown previously that the addition of rapamycin (another immunosuppressant drug) stabilizes the folded state of FKBP12 (31Main E.R. Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We can only speculate that the addition of these drugs changes the conformation of FKBP65 and strengthens the recognition and effective folding of the substrate, because the two drugs alone have no effect in the assay. These experiments for the first time establish that FKBP65 is a chaperone molecule. FKBP22 has both PPIase activity and chaperone activity like FKBP65, however, the chaperone activity is completely blocked by the addition of FK506 (20Tremmel D. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, FKBP65 retains its chaperone activity, probably due to the presence of four FKBP domains, of which only one can bind FK506 (12Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). FKBP65 interacts with unfolded and folded (triple helical) collagens and in this regard seems to resemble HSP47. Despite the low binding affinity to triple helical type I collagen, FKBP65 can efficiently delay fibril formation of type I collagen in vitro, whereas FKBP12 does not have this activity. Because of the rER location of FKBP65, this transient interaction could be an important function of FKBP65. It may prevent the premature association of procollagen molecules inside the rER of a cell, a function that is also performed by HSP47 (30Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the functions of HSP47 cannot be compensated for by FKBP65, because the HSP47 knockout mice are not viable (10Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that HSP47 stabilizes the triple helix in the rER (9Makareeva E. Leikin S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). FKBP65 increases the thermal stability of the triple helix of type I and type III collagens in vitro slightly at a 10-fold molar excess. These results differ from data obtained with HSP47, where a slight decrease in the stability of pN type III collagen was found and no change in the stability of type I collagen at an ∼10-fold excess of HSP47 was observed (32Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The optical rotatory dispersion signal in the presence of FKBP65 shows a concentration-dependent change in the temperature range of unfolded collagen. This is likely due to a conformational change of FKBP65 upon binding to unfolded collagen chains. Fig. 5 (B and C) shows the thermal transitions of the collagens converted to fraction folded, a transformation that does not influence the melting temperature. Further studies are required to characterize this conformational change of FKBP65. The high abundance of FKBP65 in the rER might allow it to be part of a multiprotein complex when it interacts with denatured or folded collagen chains. We have not been able to identify binding partners of FKBP65 in the rER yet, but there is precedence for multiprotein complexes in the rER that are involved in the biosynthesis of procollagens: P3H1 forms a strong complex with CRTAP and cyclophilin B. The absence of CRTAP in a mouse model shows that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of type I collagen is severely diminished or absent (28Morello R. Bertin T.K. Chen Y. Hicks J. Tonachini L. Monticone M. Castagnola P. Rauch F. Glorieux F.H. Vranka J. Bächinger H.P. Pace J.M. Schwarze U. Byers P.H. Weis M. Fernandes R.J. Eyre D.R. Yao Z. Boyce B.F. Lee B. Cell. 2006; 127: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Recently FKBP22 was shown to interact with BiP/GRP78 (20Tremmel D. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It was shown that the FKBP domain of FKBP22 interacts with BiP/GRP78. On the gelatin-Sepharose column, BiP/GRP78 is bound, but does not elute with low pH buffer. Its elution is easily accomplished using an ATP-containing buffer after the low pH elution. Therefore, BiP/GRP78 has to be considered as a candidate for interaction with FKBP65. This will be the subject of further studies. FKBP65 co-localizes in the rER with tropoelastin (6Patterson C.E. Schaub T. Coleman E.J. Davis E.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and it was hypothesized that the PPIase activity of FKBP65 is important for the folding of the proline-rich tropoelastin (7Davis E.C. Broekelmann T.J. Ozawa Y. Mecham R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It seems therefore likely that the chaperone activity of FKBP65 is also important for the tropoelastin biosynthesis. Tropoelastin also forms insoluble aggregates in the extracellular matrix, a process that has to be prevented from occurring inside the cell. A 67-kDa elastin-binding protein has been identified as a chaperone (33Hinek A. Keeley F.W. Callahan J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Hinek A. Pshezhetsky A.V. von Itzstein M. Starcher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3698-3710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and FKBP65 could also act in this role. We thank Kerry Maddox for amino acid analyses and Lauren Hayashi and Elena Pokidysheva for their help with the extraction of chick embryos."

Caspase-1 activates this cytokine, but other proteases are likely involved in maturation. Because meprin metalloproteinases have been implicated in IBD, the interaction of these proteases with proIL-18 was studied. The results demonstrate that the meprin β subunit of meprins A and B cleaves proIL-18 into a smaller 17-kDa product. The cleavage is at the Asn51–Asp52 bond, a site C-terminal to caspase-1 cleavage. The cleavage occurred in vitro with a Km of 1.3 μm and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with meprin β when proIL-18 was added to the culture medium.

To determine the physiological significance of the interactions of meprins with proIL-18, an experimental model of IBD was produced by administering dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to wild-type and meprin β knock-out (βKO) mice, and the serum levels of active IL-18 were determined. DSS-treated meprin βKO mice had lower levels of the active cytokine in the serum compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, in meprin αKO mice, which express meprin β but not α, active IL-18 was elevated in the serum of DSS-treated mice compared with wild-type mice, indicating that the meprin isoforms have opposing effects on the IL-18 levels in vivo. This study identifies proIL-18 as a biologically important substrate for meprin β and implicates meprins in the modulation of inflammation.

Dinarello C.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These two cytokines are synthesized as inactive proforms that lack signal sequences and are expressed in a variety of cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and epithelial cells. Caspase-1 has been identified as one of the proteases able to generate biologically active mature forms of IL-18 and IL-1β in response to a signal such as endotoxin (1Fantuzzi G. Dinarello C.A. J.

Matters G.L. Banerjee S. Dusheck R.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3317-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Lottaz D. Hahn D. Muller S. Muller C. Sterchi E.E. Eur. J.

The localization of meprins at the interface with the external environment, in leukocytes at inflammatory sites, and in response to bacterial infections implicates them in host defense. Furthermore, the observation that leukocytes from mice lacking the meprin β gene have a diminished ability to disseminate through the extracellular matrix indicates that meprins affect leukocyte infiltration (9Crisman J.M. Zhang B. Norman L.P. Bond J.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4510-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that meprins are capable of cleaving extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin, collagens IV and V, fibrinogen, and cytokines such as osteopontin, bradykinin, and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1) (10Kruse M.N.

Thus, meprins are capable of cleaving a variety of substrates that are intimately involved in the host response to injury. Meprins are composed of two multidomain subunits (α and β) that are encoded on different chromosomes (α on human chromosome 6 and mouse chromosome 17; β on chromosome 18 in humans and mice) and share ∼40% amino acid identity. Despite the fact that the subunits are evolutionarily related, they have different substrate specificities and different structural properties. For example, the meprin β subunit has a preference for cleavage of peptide bonds flanked by negatively charged amino acids, whereas the meprin α subunit cleaves at bonds flanked by small or hydrophobic amino acids (11Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13248-13255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both subunits contain signal sequences that direct the proteins to the secretory pathway, prosequences that keep the enzymes inactive, proteolytic domains of the “astacin family of metalloproteinases,” and other C-terminal non-catalytic domains (13Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The subunits form homo- or heteromeric dimers that are linked by disulfide bonds (14Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Ishmael S.S. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13895-13901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). During biosynthesis, the meprin α subunit is proteolytically cleaved near the C terminus and thus loses its epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. Thus, dimers of meprin α are secreted into the extracellular space. The meprin β subunit retains its epidermal growth factor, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains and moves to the plasma membrane as a type 1 membrane-bound protein (15Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34856-34864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As a consequence, homo-oligomers of meprin α (called homomeric meprin A) are secreted into the extracellular space; heterodimers of meprins α and β (heteromeric meprin A) form tetramers and are membrane-bound; and homo-oligomers of meprin β form membrane-bound dimers (meprin B) (5Bond J.S. Matters G.L. Banerjee S. Dusheck R.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3317-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Bertenshaw G.P. Norcum M.T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2522-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The interactions of meprin isoforms with cytokines have not been studied systematically. It has been demonstrated, however, that meprin B is capable of activating IL-1β in vitro (17Herzog C. Kaushal G.P. Haun R.S. Cytokine. 2005; 31: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because of the structural similarity between IL-1β and IL-18 and the importance of these cytokines in inflammatory processes, we chose to determine whether the latter is also a substrate for meprin β in the heteromeric isoform of meprin A and homomeric meprin B. Furthermore, studies aimed to determine whether meprins generate biologically active forms of the cytokine using a cell-based functional assay that tested the ability of meprin β-processed IL-18 to activate NF-κB. In addition, we asked whether mice lacking the meprin β gene produce altered levels of active IL-18 in an experimental model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Several groups have reported high levels of IL-18 in patients with active IBD, and this observation is mirrored in various mouse models of experimental IBD, where intestinal damage can be attenuated by blocking IL-18 (18Monteleone G.

The results indicate that the meprin β subunit of heteromeric meprin A and homomeric meprin B is able to generate a physiologically active form of IL-18 and that this subunit affects the levels of active IL-18 in vivo in a mouse model of IBD. Expression and Purification of ProIL-18—Full-length mouse IL-18 containing an N-terminal histidine tag with a thrombin cleavage site in the linker region was constructed in a bacterial expression system. ProIL-18 obtained as pCR3.1::IL-18 (a gift from Camille Locht, Institute Pasteur de Lille) was cloned into pET30::IL-18 using NcoI-EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. The induced protein showed anomalous mobility and, upon further purification, gave unsatisfactory yield. Therefore, proIL-18 was subcloned into pET28a. NcoI of pET30::IL-18 was mutated to an NdeI site by site-directed mutagenesis using primers 5′-CGA CGA CGA CGA CAA CAT ATG GCT GCC ATG TCA G-3′ (sense) and 5′-C TGA CAT GGC AGC CAT ATG TTG TCG TCG TCG TCG-3′ (antisense) to generate pET30::IL-18-NdeI. ProIL-18 was excised and inserted into pET28a using NdeI-EcoRI to generate pET28a::IL-18 (Fig. 1A). Recombinant murine proIL-18 with an N-terminal histidine tag (His6-proIL-18) was transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RIL Codon Plus strain and purified from bacterial extracts, 4 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen Inc.) under native purification conditions (Fig. 1B). Fractions containing His6-proIL-18 were pooled and treated with thrombin-agarose using a RECOMT Thrombin CleanCleave kit (Sigma) to remove the N-terminal linker region. Uncut His6-proIL-18, as well as the histidine tag, was removed by subjecting the protein to another round of Ni2+ purification (Fig. 1C). Protein samples after each treatment were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue or silver staining. The protein concentrations were determined using a Micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Activation of Recombinant Meprins—Secreted forms of recombinant histidine-tagged mouse meprin α (homomeric meprin A), rat meprin β (meprin B) and rat meprin αβ (heteromeric meprin A) were purified from stably transfected HEK-293 cells overexpressing the respective proteins as described previously (22Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Villa J.P. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42545-42550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Meprin α and β subunits are secreted as disulfide-linked dimers. One molar unit of homomeric meprin A and meprin B was an α/α and β/β dimer, respectively; 1 molar unit of heteromeric meprin A was a βα/αβ tetramer. Meprin isoforms (1–4 μm) were activated by limited proteolysis by trypsin (20:1 molar ratio) at 37 °C for 1 h and passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (Sigma) to remove trypsin. Activities of meprin α and β subunits were assayed using their respective fluorogenic peptide substrates, BK+ (a bradykinin analog; 2-aminobenzoyl-RPPGFSPFRK-(dinitrophenyl)-G-OH) and OCK+ (an orcokinin and cholecystokinin analog; 2-aminobenzoic acid-MGWMDEIDK-2,4-dinitrophenyl-SG-OH), as described previously. Actinonin (3.5 μm) was used to inhibit the activities of both subunits (22Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cleavage of ProIL-18 by Meprins—ProIL-18 (2.2 μm) was incubated with homomeric meprin A (0.11 μm) and heteromeric meprin A (0.11 μm) and meprin B (0.11 μm or 2 nm) in 20 mm Tris-Cl and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl for up to 12 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA (5 μm), and the samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixtures were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and proteins were visualized by silver staining or transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with rabbit anti-mouse IL-18 polyclonal antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare), and the signal was detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal Dura substrate (Pierce). The detection limit for the anti-IL-18 antibody was 50 ng. For meprin B inhibition studies, reaction mixtures were incubated in the presence or absence of actinonin (35 μm) at 37 °C. Identification of the ProIL-18 Site of Cleavage—ProIL-18 (2.2 μm) incubated with meprin B (0.11 μm) for 30 min was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and proteins were detected by silver staining. The cleavage product was excised and prepared for mass spectrometry. After destaining, the sample was alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide and in gel-digested with mass spectrometry-grade trypsin gold (Sigma). The resultant peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and suspended in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was added to a C18 nanoflow column and then subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The peaks obtained were searched against the theoretical peaks generated by proIL-18 trypsin digestion using FindPept (ExPASy), and the peak list was submitted for data base searching using the MASCOT MS/MS Ions Search computer program (Matrix Sciences) with parameters set for semi-trypsin digestion. The identified peak was further subjected to collision-induced dissociation followed by MS/MS for sequence analysis. Kinetic Measurements—The rate of product formation of proIL-18 by cleavage by meprin isoforms was determined using quantitative Western analysis. ProIL-18 (0.5–8 μm) was incubated with 0.1 μm meprin B or heteromeric meprin A at 37 °C in total volume of 8 μl in 20 mm Tris-Cl and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) for varying times (0–5 min). Samples of the incubated mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and product formation was quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The rates of product formation were plotted against substrate concentration using GraphPad Prism to calculate Km and Vmax. The catalytic constant (kcat) and specificity constant (kcat/Km) were further calculated. Meprin β Transfection and IL-18 Interaction in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) Cells—MDCK cells were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with HEPES (0.049 g/liter) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Full-length rat meprin β cDNA was transfected into MDCK cells grown to 30% confluence in a 24-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Meprin β was activated by limited trypsin proteolysis 36 h after transfection. MDCK cells were washed twice with serum-free medium; 10 μl of trypsin (1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5)) was added to 1 ml of serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The medium was removed, cells were washed with serum-free medium, and 10 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 mg/ml in water) was added in 1 ml of serum-free medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. MDCK cells were washed again before addition of proIL-18 (1 μg in 1 ml of serum-free minimum essential medium) and incubated at 37 °C for 22 h. Controls were subjected to the same treatment without trypsin. The culture media were collected, subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-IL-18 polyclonal antibody. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated, and proteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and probed with anti-meprin β antibody. NF-κB Activation in EL-4 Cells by IL-18—IL-18 bioactivity was tested as a function of NF-κB activation in EL-4 cells. EL-4 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in serum-free medium to a concentration of 1 million cells/ml. ProIL-18 (2.2 μm) and meprin B (0.11 μm) was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and 200 ng of meprin B-treated proIL-18 was added to 1 ml of EL-4 cells and incubated for 30 min. Control incubation mixtures contained meprin B alone or proIL-18 alone at equivalent amounts of respective proteins. Cell lysates were prepared, and total protein was quantified using a Micro-BCA kit. Total protein (50 μg) was used for the NF-κB activation assay using a p65 TransAM kit (Active Motif), and absorbance was determined at 450 nm. Nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells served as the positive controls for the NF-κB assay. Induction of IBD and Measurement of Serum IL-18 by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—IBD was induced in 8–9-week-old male meprin α knock-out (αKO) mice (on a C57BL/6×129 mixed background), meprin βKO mice (on a congenic C57BL/6 background), and their corresponding wild-type (WT) mice by administering 3.5% DSS in their drinking water for 4 days and normal water on the 5th day (9Crisman J.M. Zhang B. Norman L.P. Bond J.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4510-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Control groups received normal drinking water over the 5-day study period. Mice (n = 5) from all of the different groups were killed by inhalation of isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into an EDTA-coated Microvette (Sarstedt). The blood sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain serum. The serum was tested for active IL-18 levels using a murine IL-18 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (MBL International Corp.). The antibodies in this assay recognize only the active form of IL-18. The detection limit of this assay is 25 pg/ml. Statistical Analysis—The unpaired two-tailed t test was used for all statistical analysis. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Interaction of Meprins with ProIL-18—ProIL-18 was incubated with purified preparations of activated recombinant meprins, and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A and B). Both heteromeric meprin A and meprin B cleaved proIL-18 (24 kDa) and generated a 17-kDa fragment (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 4–6 and 7–9, respectively). Little or no decrease in the amount of proIL-18 or the appearance IL-18 fragments was detected when proIL-18 was incubated with homomeric meprin A (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1–3; and in repeated experiments not shown). In addition, repeated experiments showed meprin B to be capable of generating greater amounts of the 17-kDa cleaved product than heteromeric meprin A under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 5–6 and 8–9). At meprin B concentrations of 0.11 μm or higher and during prolonged incubations, meprin B was capable of degrading the 17-kDa product (Fig. 2A, lane 9). However, at lower meprin B concentrations (e.g. 2 nm), the 17-kDa product accumulated over a 12-h time period (Fig. 2D). Actinonin, an inhibitor of meprins A and B, clearly inhibited the cleavage of IL-18 (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6). Biochemical Characterization of ProIL-18 Cleavage by Meprins—The rate of IL-18 product formation (generation of the 17-kDa fragment) over time was determined by quantitative Western blotting and densitometric analysis. The kinetic constants Km and kcat and the specificity constant kcat/Km for the reactions were calculated by directly plotting the rates of product formation against substrate concentration using the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis (Table 1). Meprin B had a significantly lower Km (∼5-fold) and a slightly greater kcat/Km for hydrolysis of proIL-18 compared with heteromeric meprin A, indicating greater affinity and efficiency.TABLE 1Kinetic constant determination of proIL-18 cleavageKmkcatkcat/Kmm × 10-6s-1(m-1 s-1) × 106Meprin B (meprin β/β)1.31 ± 0.001*6.79 ± 0.55*5.19 ± 0.47**Heteromeric meprin A (meprin βα/αβ)5.49 ± 0.2716.44 ± 0.243.0 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab Identification of the Site of Cleavage of ProIL-18 by Meprin B—To identify the site of proIL-18 cleavage, the products of proIL-18 cleaved by meprin B were separated by electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A peak corresponding to the C terminus of IL-18 was found in the spectrum, indicating that the cleavage removed an N-terminal fragment from the protein. Comparison of the peaks generated against the theoretical peaks predicted for limited trypsin digestion of proIL-18 revealed a 1119-Da fragment, which could result from a semi-trypsin digestion (i.e. a trypsin cleavage on the C terminus and a non-trypsin cleavage on the N terminus). The amino acid sequence of the fragment was identified by further subjecting it to collision-induced dissociation followed by MS/MS. From the set of y ions thus generated, the sequence was deduced to be (N)DQVLFVDKR(Q) (Fig. 3). The identified cleavage is consistent with previously established substrate preferences for meprin B, i.e. an acidic residue in the P1′ position (11Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13248-13255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The meprin B cleavage site was distinct from caspase-1, caspase-3, and proteinase-3 (PR-3) cleavage sites, as shown in Fig. 3. Caspase-1 and PR-3, which cleave N-terminally to the meprin β cleavage site, activate proIL-18, whereas caspase-3, which cleaves C-terminally to the meprin β cleavage site, is known to inactivate IL-18 (1Fantuzzi G. Dinarello C.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine how meprin B affects IL-18 activity. Meprin B and ProIL-18 Interaction in a Cell Culture System—To determine whether proIL-18 could be cleaved in a cell-based system, meprin β was transfected into MDCK cells. After activation of rat meprin B as described under “Experimental Procedures,” proIL-18 was added to the cell culture medium. The cell culture medium was collected after 22 h, and the presence of IL-18 was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). No endogenous IL-18 was detected in the cell culture medium from MDCK cells (upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). Full-length IL-18 was detected intact after 22 h in the medium from untransfected cells, irrespective of trypsin treatment (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). The medium from MDCK cells expressing latent meprin B also contained comparable levels of full-length proIL-18 (lane 5). However, MDCK cells expressing active meprin B contained considerably less IL-18 in the culture medium (lane 6). The meprin B-generated 17-kDa fragment was not detected, implying that it was either taken up by the cells and/or further degraded by meprin B or other proteases. Meprin B Cleavage Results in Activation of ProIL-18—To determine whether the meprin B cleavage product of proIL-18 was biologically active, EL-4 cells containing receptors for IL-18 were used. EL-4 cells were treated with proIL-18 alone, meprin B alone, or proIL-18 preincubated with meprin B for 30 min, and the cell lysates were assayed for NF-κB activity (Fig. 5). As IL-18 is capable of enhancing NF-κB activity (24Kojima H. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Nishida Y. Arai N. Ikeda M. Ikegami H. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), NF-κB activation reflects, in turn, the levels of active IL-18 present. EL-4 cells treated with proIL-18 alone showed a 1.5-fold increase in NF-κB activity over untreated EL-4 cells. There was a 2.6-fold increase in NF-κB activity in EL-4 cells when proIL-18 preincubated with meprin B was added to the cells (p < 0.02). Comparing the two treatments, meprin B-cleaved IL-18 had 1.8-fold higher NF-κB activity than proIL-18. These results indicate that meprin B activated proIL-18. Meprin βKO Mice Show Decreased Levels of Serum IL-18—To determine whether meprins affect the levels of IL-18 in vivo,an experimental model of IBD was induced by administering DSS to mice of different meprin genotypes, and the serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whereas both the WT and meprin βKO mice showed elevated levels of active IL-18 upon DSS treatment, the elevation was less marked in the βKO mice, and the difference between the two genotypes was significant (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6A). This was consistent with the in vitro data that showed that meprin B cleavage was capable of generating active IL-18. In similar experiments with the meprin αKO mice, the elevation in the levels of active IL-18 after DSS-induced colitis was significantly greater than that in the WT mice (p < 0.0015) (Fig. 6B). This striking contrast between the two KO groups is a clear indication that the meprin B-mediated activation of proIL-18 is physiologically relevant. The work described herein identifies proIL-18 as a good substrate for theβ subunit of meprin B and heteromeric meprin A and shows that the hydrolysis results in a biologically active form of IL-18. Furthermore, deletion of the meprin β gene results in a decrease in the serum levels of active IL-18 observed in response to intestinal injury, indicating the functional significance of this reaction in vivo. IL-18 is a marker for the severity of IBD in patients, and the cytokine contributes to the cascade of reactions that increase the pathological consequences of the chronic inflammation. Thus, meprins must be considered along with caspase-1 and PR-3 as important factors in the generation of active forms of this cytokine. ProIL-18 is one of the best meprin B substrates identified to date (11Bertenshaw G.P. Turk B.E. Hubbard S.J. Matters G.L. Bylander J.E. Crisman J.M. Cantley L.C. Bond J.S. J. Biol.

Previously, gastrin 17, a regulatory molecule of the gastrointestinal tract, was found to be the best meprin B substrate, with a Km of 1.0 μm and a specificity constant of 10.6 × 106 m–1 s–1 (22Bertenshaw G.P. Villa J.P. Hengst J.A. Bond J.S. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The kinetic values for proIL-18 found herein (1.3 μm and 5.2 × 106 m–1 s–) are comparable to those for gastrin and some of the best peptide substrates found for other metalloproteinases. For example, the specificity constant of TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme) for a synthetic substrate corresponding to its physiological substrate, tumor necrosis factor-α, is 0.17 × 106 m–1 s–1 (25Mohan M.J. Seaton T. Mitchell J. Howe A. Blackburn K. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Patel I. Waitt G.M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Milla M.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9462-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). An excellent fluorescent substrate ((7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu-Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(2,4-dinitrophenol)-NH2) for stromelysin has a kcat/Km of 0.22 × 106 m–1 s–1 (26Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the kinetic constants of meprin B for proIL-18 are similar to those of caspase-1. For meprin B, the estimated Km for proIL-18 is 1.3 μm; for caspase-1, the Km is 0.6 μm. The catalytic efficiency of caspase-1 is 2–3-fold greater than that of meprin (1.4 × 107 compared with 0.52 × 107 m–1 s–1), a modest difference (27Gu Y. Kuida K. Tsutsui H. Ku G. Hsiao K. Fleming M.A. Hayashi N. Higashino K. Okamura H. Nakanishi K. Kurimoto M. Tanimoto T. Flavell R.A. Sato V. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. Science. 1997; 275: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of the protease domain of the meprin β subunit showed multiple basic residues in the active site that can potentially form salt bridges with acidic residues in the substrates (11Bertenshaw G.P.

In conformity with its preference for acidic residues in the P1′ position, meprin B cleaves proIL-18 between Asn51 and Glu52, thereby activating the cytokine. It is somewhat unusual for a metalloproteinase to cleave peptide bonds at negatively charged residues; however, there are notable exceptions to this generality. Thus, meprin B shares the ability to hydrolyze peptide bonds at acidic residues with metalloproteinases such as aggrecanases, BMP-1, and stromelysin (28Nagase H. Kashiwagi M. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2003; 5: 94-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol.

Caspases, intracellular cysteine proteases, have stringent requirements for a four-amino acid peptide sequence (XXXD), and as mentioned above, these proteases can activate (caspase-1) or inactivate (caspase-3) IL-18. Thus, several peptide bonds in the N-terminal region of proIL-18 appear to be accessible to proteases, but the specificity of the proteases determines whether activation or inactivation results from hydrolysis. Meprins, abundant proteases of intestinal epithelial cells and mesenteric leukocytes, are likely responsible for activating a portion of the proIL-18 secreted at intestinal sites as a result of tissue damage in IBD (31Bankus J.M. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Dumermuth E. Eldering J.A. Grunberg J. Jiang W. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the basis of the serum values of IL-18 in WT and βKO mice determined in the experimental model of IBD, we suggest that the β subunit of meprin isoforms contributes to ∼20% of the active IL-18. There is evidence that proIL-18 is actively released from live (epithelial and leukocytic) cells and passively from dead cells, thereby exposing the procytokine to extracellular proteases. PR-3, a membrane-bound protease of the azurophil granules of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, has been shown to activate proIL-18 at the plasma membrane via a caspase-1-independent pathway (33Sugawara S. Uehara A. Nochi T. Yamaguchi T. Ueda H. Sugiyama A. Hanzawa K. Kumagai K. Okamura H. Takada H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6568-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Clearly, in meprin βKO mice, there is a decrease in the serum levels of active IL-18 after tissue damage. Meprins may be responsible for this decrease directly or may be involved in the homeostasis of cytokine-producing cells, thereby indirectly contributing to the observed phenotype. In meprin αKO mice, only meprin β is expressed, and therefore, meprin B will be the only isoform of meprins found. Our data show that there are similar levels of expression of meprin β in WT and meprin αKO mice, 3S. Banerjee and J. S. Bond, unpublished data. and when both meprin α and β subunits are expressed, most of the β subunit is found as heteromeric meprin A (16Bertenshaw G.P. Norcum M.T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2522-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The observation that the meprin αKO mice have higher levels of serum IL-18 compared with the WT mice implies that meprin B is more efficient than heteromeric meprin A in producing active IL-18. The in vitro studies indicate that meprin B has a 5-fold greater affinity for proIL-18 compared with heteromeric meprin A (1 versus 5μm), and perhaps this influences the observed outcome. There is increasing evidence that matrix metalloproteinases are intimately involved in processing cytokines in vivo in the immune system (34Parks W.C. Wilson C.L. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). This work provides new evidence that meprins can influence the concentration of IL-18, a key cytokine in the inflammatory response, and provides insight into the molecular mechanism that effects activation of IL-18.

https://openalex.org/W2061626915,"Binding of the complement regulatory protein, factor H, to C-reactive protein has been reported and implicated as the biological basis for association of the H402 polymorphic variant of factor H with macular degeneration. Published studies utilize solid-phase or fluid-phase binding assays to show that the factor H Y402 variant binds C-reactive protein more strongly than H402. Diminished binding of H402 variant to C-reactive protein in retinal drusen is posited to permit increased complement activation, driving inflammation and pathology. We used well validated native human C-reactive protein and pure factor H Y402H variants to test interactions. When factor H variants were incubated with C-reactive protein in the fluid phase at physiological concentrations, no association occurred. When C-reactive protein was immobilized on plastic, either non-specifically by adsorption in the presence of Ca2+ to maintain its native fold and pentameric subunit assembly or by specific Ca2+-dependent binding to immobilized natural ligands, no specific binding of either factor H variant from the fluid phase was observed. In contrast, both factor H variants reproducibly bound to C-reactive protein immobilized in the absence of Ca2+, conditions that destabilize the native fold and pentameric assembly. Both factor H variants strongly bound C-reactive protein that was denatured by heat treatment before immobilization, confirming interaction with denatured but not native C-reactive protein. We conclude that the reported binding of factor H to C-reactive protein results from denaturation of the C-reactive protein during immobilization. Differential binding to C-reactive protein, thus, does not explain association of the Y402H polymorphism with macular degeneration.

Activation is controlled by a group of C regulatory proteins that includes factor H (fH), the plasma protein responsible for regulating the alternative pathway, an amplification loop that is pivotal in physiological and pathological activation of C (2Thurman J.M. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). fH is a single-chain serum glycoprotein of 150 kDa consisting of a string of 20 homologous units, each of about 60 amino acids, called short consensus repeats (SCR). Deficiency of fH causes unregulated consumption of C with secondary deficiency of C3 (3S Reis E. Falcão D.A. Isaac L. Scand. J. Immunol. 2006; 63: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although fH is a plasma protein, many of its activities occur on the cell membrane. Indeed, mutations in the carboxyl terminus of fH that affect membrane binding capacity cause defective C regulation at the membrane and are associated with the renal disease, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (4Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Esparza Gordillo J. Goicoechea de Jorge E. Lopez-Trascasa M. Sánchez-Corral P. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Within the fH molecule there are multiple binding sites for C3b, heparin, and several other ligands (5Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Hellwage J. Jokiranta S.T. Meri S. Brade V. Kraiczy P. Noris M. Remuzzi G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). An interaction of fH with the plasma pentraxin molecule, C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical major acute phase reactant, was first reported almost 25 years ago. Mold et al. (6Mold C. Kingzette M. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 882-885PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CRP coating of pneumococci had divergent effects, increasing activation of the classical pathway while inhibiting the alternative pathway; this latter effect was fH-dependent and associated with a doubling of fH binding to the CRP-coated pneumococcus. The same group later provided direct evidence of fH binding to plastic-immobilized CRP, although when the assay format was reversed and fluid phase CRP was offered to immobilized fH, less than 1% of added CRP bound (7Mold C. Gewurz H. Du Clos T.W. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In a surface plasmon resonance study, when CRP was covalently immobilized on the chip surface through amine coupling in the absence of Ca2+, calcium-dependent binding of the recombinant fH fragments comprising both SCR 7 and SCRs 8–11 was seen (8Jarva H. Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3957-3962PubMed Google Scholar). The seventh SCR of fH is a “hotspot” for ligand interactions with reported binding to heparin, CRP, and streptococcal M-protein (9Giannakis E. Jokiranta T.S. Male1 D.A. Ranganathan S. Ormsby R.J. Fischetti V.A. Mold C. Gordon D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When a fH polymorphism, resulting in a single amino acid change (Y402H) in SCR7 was implicated as a powerful risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (10Edwards A.O. Ritter III, R.

Several groups have lately reported that the fH Y402 and H402 variants show differential binding affinity for CRP (13Laine M. Jarva H. Seitsonen S. Haapasalo K. Lehtinen M.J. Lindeman N.

Each used similar methods with CRP directly immobilized on a surface (ELISA plate or surface plasmon resonance chip) and either intact fH variants or recombinant fragments in the fluid phase. All concluded that both fH variants bound CRP and that the H402 variant bound less well than the Y402 variant. C proteins are present in drusen, the hallmark of the retinal pathology of AMD, but there is controversy about CRP, some reporting that it is absent (18Gerl V.B. Bohl J. Pitz S. Stoffelns B. Pfeiffer N. Bhakdi S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1104-1108PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others find it in the retinal layers and drusen deposits and more abundantly in H402 homozygotes than Y402 homozygotes (19Johnson P.T. Betts K.E. Radeke M.J. Hageman G.S. Anderson D.H. Johnson L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17456-17461Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that binding of fH to CRP in the retina limits C activation and the H402 variant because it binds less well and permits more C activation, thus, predisposing to disease. This has potentially important therapeutic implications, especially with the recent development of the first specific inhibitor of CRP ligand binding and pathogenic function in vivo (20Pepys M.B. Hirschfield G.M. Tennent G.A. Gallimore J.R. Kahan M.C. Bellotti V. Hawkins P.N. Myers R.M. Smith M.D. Polara A. Cobb A.J.A. Ley S.V. Aquilina J.A. Robinson C.V. Sharif I. Gray G.A. Sabin C.A. Jenvey M.C. Kolstoe S.E. Thompson D. Wood S.P. Nature. 2006; 440: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). As a first step toward evaluation of this suggestion, we have investigated the interaction between CRP and fH under conditions in which CRP retains its native fold and homopentameric assembly of protomers and which are, thus, most likely to be of physiological and pathophysiological relevance. Here we report that there is no interaction between fH and intact native CRP in the fluid phase or with CRP immobilized directly to plastic in the presence of Ca2+ or immobilized via its specific Ca2+-dependent binding to its natural ligands. fH binds CRP only after the CRP has been denatured, either before immobilization or by coating onto plastic in the absence of Ca2+. We conclude that the reported binding of fH to CRP is likely caused by denaturation of CRP, which has long been known to result from its adsorption to plastic surfaces in the non-physiological absence of Ca2+ (21Potempa L.A. Maldonado B.A. Laurent P. Zemel E.S. Gewurz H. Mol. Immunol. 1983; 20: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. Fiedel B.A. Potempa R.T. Gewurz H. Mol.

Alternative mechanisms for the strong association of the fH H402 variant with AMD should be sought. Materials—Chemicals and reagents were from Fisher or Sigma unless otherwise stated below.

Purification of Endogenous fH Y402 and H402 Variants from Human Plasma—Healthy volunteers homozygous for either the Y402 or H402 polymorphic variants of fH were identified by PCR analysis. Venous blood was taken into EDTA, leukocytes were harvested, genomic DNA was extracted using proteinase K/phenol/chloroform, and ethanol was precipitated. A fragment of 458 bp containing exon 9 of the CFH gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using specific primers derived from the 5′ and 3′ intronic sequences (forward, 5′-CCT TTG TTA GTA ACT TTA GTT CGT C-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGT CCA TTG GTA AAA CAA GG-3′) and the Platinum® Blue PCR SuperMix polymerase kit (Invitrogen). Product was verified by electrophoresis on a 1.6% agarose gel and purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed using one of the amplification primers on an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). fH was purified from plasma of individuals homozygous for either the Y402 or H402 variants by a sequential three-step fast protein liquid chromatography method at 4 °C onÄKTA Prime chromatography station (GE Healthcare). First, filtered plasma (100 ml) was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) to which 30 mg of mouse anti-human fH mAb 35H9 (generated in house) was coupled. Bound protein was eluted at low pH, and fractions containing fH (identified by ELISA) were pooled, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap-Heparin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS. Bound proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline. Fractions containing fH were pooled and polished by gel filtration either on Superdex-200 preparative grade matrix in a XK16/70 column or a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and preparations of fH-H402 and fH-Y402 were obtained without any detectable aggregates or contaminants, specifically free of fH-like-1 and fH-related proteins. Purification and Denaturation of CRP—Intact, fully functional native CRP was isolated at >99.9% purity from malignant effusion fluids by DEAE anion exchange followed by calcium-dependent binding to immobilized phosphoethanolamine and elution with free phosphocholine (26Vigushin D.M. Pepys M.B. Hawkins P.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The final product was separated from phosphocholine by the addition of EDTA to 10 mm final concentration followed by buffer exchange into 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and then the addition of CaCl2 to 2 mm final concentration before concentration to 4–6 g/liter. Pure CRP was stored frozen at –80 °C. The CRP preparations were thoroughly characterized by overloaded SDS 8–18% gradient PAGE, analytical gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, crystallization, and solution of the x-ray three-dimensional structure (27Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Concentration was measured in both Roche MIRA and Dade-Behring BNII latex enhanced immunoassays for CRP standardized on the World Health Organization International Reference Standard for CRP Immunoassay (85/506) (28WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization 37th ReportWHO Technical Report Series. 1987; 760: 21-22Google Scholar). Binding to phosphocholine was measured in solution by isothermal titration calorimetry, binding by C1q was demonstrated using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance assays, and classical pathway C activation with pneumococcal C-polysaccharide as ligand was monitored by C3 binding and cleavage (29de Beer F.C. Baltz M.L. Munn E.A. Feinstein A. Taylor J. Bruton C. Clamp J.R. Pepys M.B. Immunology. 1982; 45: 55-70PubMed Google Scholar). These exhaustive tests confirmed that the material was pure, not aggregated, and retained full native structure, immunochemical integrity, and functional properties. CRP at 1 g/liter in TBS was completely and irreversibly denatured either by heating at 70 °C for 1 h (30Taylor K.E. van den Berg C.W. Immunology. 2007; 120: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or by incubation in 8 m urea, 10 mm EDTA for 1 h (21Potempa L.A. Maldonado B.A. Laurent P. Zemel E.S. Gewurz H. Mol. Immunol. 1983; 20: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Bíró A. Rovó Z. Papp D. Cervenak L. Varga L. Füst G. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Prohászka Z. Immunology. 2007; 121: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After heating, denaturation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE using reduced amounts of SDS and without boiling the sample, as described (30Taylor K.E. van den Berg C.W. Immunology. 2007; 120: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Aggregated material was removed by centrifugation, the remaining solution was filtered (0.2 μm), and protein concentration (A280 nm) measured. Although there was ongoing aggregation of the residual soluble protein, it could be used to coat plates. After urea-chelation denaturation of CRP spiked with a tracer of 125I-labeled CRP (26Vigushin D.M. Pepys M.B. Hawkins P.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the CRP was dialyzed into TBS and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 in the Åkta Explorer system (GE HealthCare), in comparison with the native starting material. The binding of native and denatured CRP to phosphocholine immobilized on Sepharose beads was also tested. Although more than 90% of radiolabeled CRP offered to phosphocholine-Sepharose absolutely showed calcium dependent binding, about 60% of denatured CRP became bound regardless of the presence or absence of calcium. Trypsin sensitivity of native and urea-chelation denatured CRP was compared in the presence (TBS) and absence (10 mm phosphate, 15 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) of Ca2+ by incubation at 1 mg/ml with trypsin (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Samples of the digestion mixture were taken at intervals and analyzed by 8–18% SDS-PAGE. Binding of C1q was sought by coating native or denatured CRP (10 μg/ml in TBS) on 96-well Microtiter plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Invitrogen), blocking with bovine serum albumin, then incubating with various dilutions of biotinylated C1q (made in-house). Wells were washed, and bound C1q was detected using avidin-peroxidase (Bio-Rad; 1:1000). Production and Purification of Polyclonal Immunoglobulins—Monospecific polyclonal rabbit antisera against CRP and fH were raised by immunization with the respective antigens. Anti-fH antibodies were isolated by affinity chromatography on fH (5 mg) immobilized on a Hi-Trap N-hydroxysuccinimide column (GE Healthcare) and labeled with horseradish peroxidase using the EZ-Link Plus Activated Peroxidase kit (Pierce). Interaction of fH and CRP in the Fluid Phase—Equal volumes of isolated fH (either Y402 or H402) and CRP, each in VBS2+ at 1 g/liter, were mixed, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 (HR 10/30; GE Healthcare) equilibrated and eluted with VBS2+. The individual proteins were similarly analyzed for comparison. Absorbance at 280 nm of the eluted fractions was monitored. Individual proteins or protein mixtures (each at 0.2 g/liter in VBS2+; preincubated 2 h at 37 °C as above) were also sedimented at different velocities (5,000, 7,000, 9,000, and 16,000 rpm) with absorbance monitored at 230, 250, and 280 nm, depending on the experiment, using short columns (80 μl) on a Proteomelab XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV-VIS detection and 12 mm double-sector flow-through centerpiece (Beckman-Coulter Inc., High Wycombe, UK). The equilibrium data were analyzed globally using the program SEDPHAT to obtain the corresponding molar masses and interaction parameters (complex stoichiometry and affinity constants) (32Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Interaction of fH with CRP Directly or Indirectly Immobilized on a Solid Phase—Microtiter plates (96-well Nunc MaxiSorp, Invitrogen) were directly coated with CRP (10 mg/liter in TBS, HEPES-buffered saline, VBS2+, or ELISA buffer) at 37 °C for 1 or 16 h. In some experiments coating was at 4 °C and for up to 96 h. In others, heat-denatured or urea-denatured CRP was substituted for native CRP. Wells were then blocked by incubation with 1% w/v bovine serum albumin in VBS2+ for 1 h at 37 °C. Immobilization of CRP, native or denatured, under the various conditions was confirmed by incubating representative wells with rabbit anti-CRP antiserum (1:5000 in VBS2+), and binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad; 1:10000 in VBS2+). In other wells serial dilutions in VBS2+ of native fH Y402 and H402 variants were added and incubated. Binding of fH was detected by incubating with peroxidase-labeled affinity-purified rabbit anti-fH antibodies (1:5000 in VBS2+). In some experiments CRP-coated wells were incubated with various dilutions of biotin-labeled C1q; binding of C1q was detected using avidin-peroxidase. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 1 h unless otherwise indicated. Between each step the wells were washed extensively with VBS2+ containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20 (VBS2+-T). Wells treated only with coating buffer served as negative controls. Bound peroxidase was detected with OPD chromogenic substrate (Dako, Cambridgeshire, UK), and absorbance was read at 492 nm. All the experiments testing for binding of fH to CRP were repeated at least twice with triplicate samples. In some experiments, recombinant bacterially expressed CRP (Calbiochem) was substituted for natural human CRP. N-Hydroxysuccinimide-activated ELISA plates (Corning Costar, Bucks, UK) were derivatized by covalent attachment of 6-aminohexanoic acid as a molecular spacer from the plastic surface. Each well was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 200 μl of 6-aminohexanoic acid at 50 g/liter in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6, and then washed with the same buffer before blocking residual active groups with 0.2 m Tris pH 8.0 (300 μl/well) for 30 min. After further washing with water, different plates were then coupled with either phosphoethanolamine or p-aminophenylphosphocholine. These ligands were each dissolved at 10 g/liter in H2O, the pH was adjusted to 4.5 with HCl, and 150 μl was added to each well followed by 50 μl per well of a fresh 0.4 m solution of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide-HCl in H2O. Plates were then incubated on a shaker for 90 min at room temperature with frequent monitoring and adjustment of pH to 4.5 with 0.1 m NaOH or 0.1 m HCl. After a further 2 h, the reaction mixture was removed, and 0.2 m Tris, pH 6.8, was added for 30 min to block the remaining active groups. Plates were then washed in H2O, tightly sealed, and stored at 4 °C until use. Optimal binding of CRP to immobilized phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine was first determined by incubating dilutions of CRP in VBS2+ in coated wells at 4 °C, room temperature, or 37 °C, then washing with VBS2+ before detection with rabbit anti-CRP and peroxidase labeled anti-rabbit IgG as described above. Denatured CRP does not bind specifically to either phosphoethanolamine or phosphocholine (27Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and was not tested in this assay. Plates optimally coated with CRP were washed in VBS2+, and dilutions of fH in VBS2+-bovine serum albumin was added to the wells and incubated for between 1 and 24 h at 37 °C. Binding of fH was detected using anti-fH antibody as described above. Binding of fluid phase native CRP by immobilized fH was tested using MaxiSorp plates that had been coated with native fH Y402 or H402, each at 10 mg/liter in ELISA buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in VBS2+, serial dilutions of CRP in VBS2+ were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were washed in VBS2+-T, and bound CRP was detected by incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-CRP antiserum (1:5000) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and developed as described above. As a positive control for this experiment, binding of fluid phase C3b by fH immobilized as described above was tested. Serial dilutions of C3b in VBS2+ were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were washed in VBS2+-T, and bound C3b was detected by incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-C3b antibody (C3-30, 10 mg/liter) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and developed as described above. fH Does Not Bind CRP in the Fluid Phase—When CRP and fH, each at 1 g/liter, were incubated together in Ca2+-containing buffer then fractionated by size exclusion chromatography in the presence of Ca2+, no complex formation was evident. The elution profile in the fractionated mixture was identical to the sum of the profiles for the proteins fractionated in isolation (Fig. 1, A–C). No species of molecular weights greater than the individual free proteins were detected. Of note, there was a small but consistent difference in the elution of the fH H402Y variants, the Y402 variant eluting later (Fig. 1B). When CRP was incubated with fH in the presence of Ca2+ as above and the mixture was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation, there was again no evidence of complex formation. Fig. 2A shows the sedimentation profile at 9000 rpm and 280 nm for CRP and the Y402 and H402 variants of fH run alone and the respective mixtures of fH and CRP. The proteins were each individually gel filtered immediately before the coincubation step to ensure that only monomer was analyzed (Fig. 2, B and C). The sedimentation equilibrium distributions of the individual proteins taken at several rotor speeds and wavelengths are best described by a model for single monomer species with molar masses of 124 ± 7, 167 ± 8, and 155 ± 9 kDa for CRP and the Y402 and H402 variants of fH, respectively, values that, within the experimental uncertainty, are compatible with the expected size of the corresponding non-aggregated native proteins (CRP, 115 kDa; fH, 165 kDa). When CRP and either fH variant were mixed before analysis, the sedimentation equilibrium gradients were globally well fitted by a model in which the two proteins do not interact and sediment independently as monomers, with no evidence of higher molecular weight species suggestive of complexes between fH and CRP. As a control to confirm that sedimentation equilibrium analysis would detect interactions of fH with a protein ligand of comparable mass, interaction between fH variants and C3b was tested. Fig. 2D shows the sedimentation equilibrium gradients at 9000 rpm and 280 nm of the H402 and Y402 variants of fH and C3b alone and the respective mixtures. C3b was gel-filtered immediately before the coincubation step to ensure that only monomer was analyzed (Fig. 2E). Individual gradients are well fitted by a model for single species with average molar masses that correspond to the expected values of the protein monomers. As expected, the sedimentation distribution of the C3b/fH mixtures is steeper, indicating a molecular interaction. The inset in Fig. 2D illustrates the gradients for the individual species and also demonstrates the gradients that would result if the two proteins were combined but did not interact (dotted line) or combined and did interact (dashed line). It can be seen from this inset that the gradient resulting from the mixture of fH and C3b is intermediate between these two theoretical curves. Further analysis reveals that the gradient represents a mixture of the two individual monomers and a 1:1 complex of C3b and fH with a mass fraction of complex of ∼0.4; this"
https://openalex.org/W2117532763,"The genetic mechanisms that regulate neurodegeneration are only poorly understood. We show that the loss of one allele of the p53 family member, p73, makes mice susceptible to neurodegeneration as a consequence of aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Behavioral analyses demonstrated that old, but not young, p73+/− mice displayed reduced motor and cognitive function, CNS atrophy, and neuronal degeneration. Unexpectedly, brains of aged p73+/− mice demonstrated dramatic accumulations of phospho-tau (P-tau)-positive filaments. Moreover, when crossed to a mouse model of AD expressing a mutant amyloid precursor protein, brains of these mice showed neuronal degeneration and early and robust formation of tangle-like structures containing P-tau. The increase in P-tau was likely mediated by JNK; in p73+/− neurons, the activity of the p73 target JNK was enhanced, and JNK regulated P-tau levels. Thus, p73 is essential for preventing neurodegeneration, and haploinsufficiency for p73 may be a susceptibility factor for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2003000287,"Operant conditioning is a ubiquitous but mechanistically poorly understood form of associative learning in which an animal learns the consequences of its behavior. Using a single-cell analog of operant conditioning in neuron B51 of Aplysia, we examined second-messenger pathways engaged by activity and reward and how they may provide a biochemical association underlying operant learning. Conditioning was blocked by Rp-cAMP, a peptide inhibitor of PKA, a PKC inhibitor, and by expressing a dominant-negative isoform of Ca2+-dependent PKC (apl-I). Thus, both PKA and PKC were necessary for operant conditioning. Injection of cAMP into B51 mimicked the effects of operant conditioning. Activation of PKC also mimicked conditioning but was dependent on both cAMP and PKA, suggesting that PKC acted at some point upstream of PKA activation.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1927Google Scholar) are two major forms of associative learning, and they are exhibited by all animals, including humans. Operant conditioning involves an association between a behavior and its consequence. Classical conditioning involves an association between a typically neutral stimulus and a subsequent more salient stimulus. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of classical conditioning have been explored in great depth (Lechner and Byrne, 1998Lechner H.A. Byrne J.H.

In contrast, although operant conditioning has been studied extensively in many different animal model systems (Hoyle, 1979Hoyle G.

The molecular biology of memory storage: a dialogue between genes and synapses.Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2541) Google Scholar). Some progress has been made in analyzing mechanisms of appetitive operant conditioning in rodents. For example, appetitive instrumental learning is impaired by blocking D1-type dopamine receptors (Smith-Roe and Kelley, 2000Smith-Roe S.L. Kelley A.E. Coincident activation of NMDA and dopamine D1 receptors within the nucleus accumbens core is required for appetitive instrumental learning.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7737-7742PubMed Google Scholar) or inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase within the nucleus accumbens (Baldwin et al., 2002Baldwin A.E. Sadeghian K. Holahan M.R. Kelley A.E. Appetitive instrumental learning is impaired by inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase within the nucleus accumbens.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2002; 77: 44-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the complete signaling pathways have not been elucidated nor is it known how these signaling cascades mediate the associative convergence between the behavior and reward signals. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of appetitive operant conditioning is essential for a deeper understanding of reward-related learning and may provide insight into related disorders, such as addiction. Furthermore, a mechanistic understanding of operant conditioning allows for a comparison between the molecular mechanisms of these two major forms of associative learning. Feeding behavior of the marine mollusk Aplysia can be operantly conditioned with an appetitive protocol. The neural circuitry that underlies feeding is well characterized and amenable to biophysical and biochemical analyses. Appetitive operant conditioning of ingestive feeding behavior leads to an increase in the expression of this behavior, and that increase is associated with changes in the biophysical properties of neuron B51 (Brembs et al., 2002Brembs B. Lorenzetti F.D. Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). B51 is a “decision-making” neuron that displays an all-or-nothing several second level of activity, which is denoted as a plateau potential (Plummer and Kirk, 1990Plummer M.R. Kirk M.D. Premotor neurons B51 and B52 in the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica: synaptic connections, effects on ongoing motor rhythms, and peptide modulation.J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 63: 539-558Google Scholar). The threshold for eliciting the plateau potential is decreased and the input resistance is increased following in vivo operant training (Brembs et al., 2002Brembs B. Lorenzetti F.D. Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). B51 is critical for the expression of ingestive behavior (Nargeot et al., 1999aNargeot R. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. In vitro analog of operant conditioning in Aplysia. I. Contingent reinforcement modifies the functional dynamics of an identified neuron.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2247-2260Google Scholar, Nargeot et al., 1999bNargeot R. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H.

Changes in neuronal excitability serve as a mechanism of long-term memory for operant conditioning.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; (in press. Published online September 7, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.2184Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and both changes to the membrane properties of B51 make the cell more likely to generate a plateau potential, which can contribute to the conditioned increase in the expression of ingestive behavior. Furthermore, the ganglia that contain the circuitry necessary for generating the feeding response can be removed from naive animals and be successfully trained with an in vitro analog of operant conditioning in which fictive ingestion is contingently reinforced with an esophageal nerve shock (Nargeot et al., 1997Nargeot R. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Contingent-dependent enhancement of rhythmic motor patterns: an in vitro analog of operant conditioning.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8093-8105Google Scholar). The esophageal nerve likely mediates the food reward signal (Lechner et al., 2000Lechner H.A. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Classical conditioning of feeding in Aplysia: I. Behavioral analysis.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3369-3376Google Scholar, Brembs et al., 2002Brembs B. Lorenzetti F.D. Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and is rich with dopamine-containing fibers (Kabotyanski et al., 1998Kabotyanski E.A. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Identification and characterization of catecholaminergic neuron B65, which initiates and modifies patterned activity in the buccal ganglia of Aplysia.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 605-621Google Scholar). This in vitro training protocol produces an increase in fictive ingestion and, as was also the case with the in vivo conditioning, an increase in the input resistance of B51 and a decrease in its burst threshold (Nargeot et al., 1999aNargeot R. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. In vitro analog of operant conditioning in Aplysia. I. Contingent reinforcement modifies the functional dynamics of an identified neuron.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2247-2260Google Scholar). Burst activity in B51 is pivotal for the expression of the reinforced behavior, so it can be used as a substitute for the behavior in the training protocol. Indeed, if plateau potentials generated in B51 are contingently reinforced with esophageal nerve shock, then the input resistance and the burst threshold of B51 are altered in the same way as with the previous training protocols, and fictive feeding is increased (Nargeot et al., 1999bNargeot R. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. In vitro analog of operant conditioning in Aplysia. II. Modifications of the functional dynamics of an identified neuron contribute to motor pattern selection.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2261-2272Google Scholar). Also, in vitro operant conditioning can be blocked by using a dopamine receptor antagonist (Nargeot et al., 1999cNargeot R. Baxter D.A. Patterson G.W. Byrne J.H. Dopaminergic synapses mediate neuronal changes in an analogue of operant conditioning.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 1983-1987Google Scholar), indicating that the reward signal is likely mediated by dopamine. Because the behavior can be represented by activity in B51 and the reinforcement can be represented with dopamine, the in vitro analog can be reduced to the level of a single cell. B51 can be isolated and placed in cell culture. Plateau potentials can be used as the analog of behavior, and dopamine can be iontophoretically applied to B51 as the analog of reinforcement (Figure 1A). This single-cell analog of operant conditioning produces the same increase in the input resistance of B51 and the same decrease in the burst threshold, as observed with the previous operant training methods (Brembs et al., 2002Brembs B. Lorenzetti F.D. Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, applying dopamine in a noncontingent manner does not alter the membrane properties of B51 (Brembs et al., 2002Brembs B. Lorenzetti F.D. Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). From the behaving animal, to the neural network, to the level of the single cell, the same changes in the membrane properties of B51 are consistently observed following each operant protocol, justifying the reductionist approach. In the present report, we exploited the advantages of the single-cell analog to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying operant conditioning. Dopamine appears to mediate the reward signal in this example of operant reward learning similar to its role in many other model systems (Schultz, 2002Schultz W. Getting formal with dopamine and reward.Neuron. 2002; 36: 241-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Single-cell PCR was used to examine whether the Aplysia D1-like dopamine receptor was expressed in B51. As illustrated by the band in the left lane of Figure 1B, the mRNA for the D1-like receptor was detected in B51, which was confirmed by a negative control (right lane, Figure 1B) with RNase treatment of the cellular contents prior to the reverse transcriptase reaction, which showed only a faint band remaining. Furthermore, a D1-dopamine receptor antibody revealed that the receptors were localized to the axon hillock region of B51 (Figure 1C). This localization is consistent with an observation that, during conditioning, the tip of the dopamine-containing iontophoretic electrode needed to be positioned near the axon hillock region of B51 to elicit a response in the membrane potential (Figure 1D). A similar response in the membrane potential of B51 was observed if the D1 receptor agonist chloro-APB (Barbas et al., 2006Barbas D. Zappulla J.P. Angers S. Bouvier M. Mohamed H.A. Byrne J.H. Castellucci V.F. DesGroseillers L. An Aplysia dopamine1-like receptor: molecular and functional characterization.J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 414-427Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was iontophoresed onto B51 (Figure 1D). To further test the hypothesis that a D1-like dopamine receptor mediates reinforcement, we replicated the original findings of the single-cell analog of operant conditioning (Brembs et al., 2002Brembs B. Lorenzetti F.D. Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar) by iontophoresing chloro-APB onto B51 in place of dopamine. Two experimental groups were examined. In one group, seven plateau potentials were each contingently reinforced with brief iontophoretic puffs of chloro-APB. The second group received the same amount of chloro-APB, but it was not contingent on the expression of a plateau potential. Contingently reinforcing activity with chloro-APB produced an increase in the input resistance and a decrease in the burst threshold of B51 as compared to the noncontingent control (Figures 1E and 1F), and these results are similar to previous results obtained when dopamine is used as the reinforcement (Brembs et al., 2002Brembs B. Lorenzetti F.D. Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar; see also Figure 2, Figure 7, Figure 8). The D1-like dopamine receptors in B51 are likely coupled to adenylyl cyclase and increase the production of cAMP when dopamine is bound (Barbas et al., 2006Barbas D. Zappulla J.P. Angers S. Bouvier M. Mohamed H.A. Byrne J.H. Castellucci V.F. DesGroseillers L. An Aplysia dopamine1-like receptor: molecular and functional characterization.J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 414-427Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, cAMP and PKA are likely to be important elements of the intracellular signaling cascade underlying reinforcement. To test the hypothesis that cAMP is necessary for the conditioning, Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (Rp-cAMP) was used to block the cAMP pathway during conditioning. Three experimental groups were examined. In one group, seven plateau potentials were each contingently reinforced with dopamine delivery. A second group received the same contingent reinforcement protocol but in the presence of 2 mM bath-applied Rp-cAMP. The third group received the same application of Rp-cAMP but in the absence of plateau potentials or reinforcement. Contingent reinforcement decreased the burst threshold (Figures 2A1 and 2A3) and increased the input resistance of B51 (Figures 2B1 and 2B3), similar to previous observations (Nargeot et al., 1999aNargeot R. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. In vitro analog of operant conditioning in Aplysia. I. Contingent reinforcement modifies the functional dynamics of an identified neuron.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2247-2260Google Scholar, Nargeot et al., 1999bNargeot R. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. In vitro analog of operant conditioning in Aplysia. II.

Reyes F.D. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Rp-cAMP by itself did not appear to appreciably alter the membrane properties of B51. However, the effects of conditioning were blocked in the presence of Rp-cAMP (Figures 2A2, 2A3, 2B2, and 2B3). Thus, the cAMP cascade appeared to be necessary for the conditioning, and cAMP appears to act via PKA, because a peptide inhibitor for PKA also blocked the conditioning (see Figure 7). In order to monitor the activation of PKA by the single-cell analog of operant conditioning, we used an antibody against Aplysia CREB1 peptide with the target residue for PKA, Ser85, phosphorylated (Mohamed et al., 2005Mohamed H.A. Yao W. Fioravante D. Smolen P.D. Byrne J.H. cAMP-response elements in Aplysia creb1, creb2, and Ap-uch promoters: implications for feedback loops modulating long term memory.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27035-27043Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immediately after training with the single-cell analog, cells were processed to measure the immunoreactivity for phospho-CREB1. Cells that received contingent reinforcement had significantly higher levels of phospho-CREB1 as compared to cells that received noncontingent reinforcement (Figure 2C). Because the PKA site on CREB1 could have been phosphorylated by a kinase other than PKA, we repeated the experiment in the presence of Rp-cAMP to validate the use of the phospho-CREB1 assay as an indicator of activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway. In the presence of Rp-cAMP, the increase in the level of phospho-CREB1 normally seen following contingent reinforcement was blocked (Figure 2C). These results indicate that the single-cell analog induced a rapid phosphorylation of CREB1 at a PKA site, which suggests that PKA was activated by contingent reinforcement. The next step was to determine the second messenger cascade elicited by the analog of the behavior. One possibility is that Ca2+ entry during the plateau potential (Plummer and Kirk, 1990Plummer M.R. Kirk M.D. Premotor neurons B51 and B52 in the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica: synaptic connections, effects on ongoing motor rhythms, and peptide modulation.J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 63: 539-558Google Scholar) activates PKC similar to how burst firing in an Aplysia sensory neuron activates PKC (Jones et al., 2001Jones, L.M., Izu, L.T., and Abrams, T.W. (2001). PKC activation during burst-dependent protection in Aplysia sensory neurons: modeling the calcium dependence. Paper presented at the 31st Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, San Diego, CA.Google Scholar). In fact, the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoform apl-I can be translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where PKC becomes active, with Ca2+ influx alone (Zhao et al., 2006Zhao Y. Leal K. Abi-Farah C. Martin K.C. Sossin W.S. Klein M. Isoform specificity of PKC translocation in living Aplysia sensory neurons and a role for Ca2+-dependent PKC APL I in the induction of intermediate-term facilitation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8847-8856Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-dependent isoform of PKC was detected in B51 (Figure 3A). A fusion protein of PKC apl-I and EGFP was expressed in B51, and bath application of 1 μM of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin caused translocation of PKC apl-I from the cytosol of B51 to the plasma membrane (Figure 3C). There are some regions of the cell depicted in Figure 3C1 where the translocation appears to be internal to the plasma membrane. However, the majority of translocation appears to be at the plasma membrane, which is supported by the summary data in Figure 3C2. Also, modest translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane was observed following a single plateau potential in B51 (Figure S1 available online). However, iontophoresing dopamine with the same parameters as with the single-cell analog did not appear to cause any translocation of PKC (data not shown). The Ca2+-independent isoform PKC apl-II was not detected in B51 (Figure 3A), although our PCR primers were able to detect this isoform in sensory neurons of Aplysia (Figure 3A). To test the hypothesis that PKC is involved in the conditioning, bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis) was used to inhibit PKC during conditioning. Three experimental groups were examined. One group received the contingent reinforcement protocol. Another group received the same contingent reinforcement protocol, but in the presence of 10 μM bath-applied Bis. The third group received the same application of Bis, but in the absence of plateau potentials or reinforcement. Contingent reinforcement again produced the typical decrease in burst threshold (Figure 2A4) and increase in input resistance (Figure 2B4). Although Bis by itself did not appear to appreciably alter the membrane properties of B51, the effects of conditioning were blocked in the presence of Bis (Figures 2A4 and 2B4). Thus, PKC appears to be necessary for the conditioning. Both PKC and PKA appear to be essential elements underlying operant conditioning. The two kinases could act either in series or in parallel. They could act in parallel if both kinases need to phosphorylate a common substrate at different sites, which would then lead to the modulation of B51 (Figure 4A). Alternatively, the kinases could act in series if PKC phosphorylates some molecule upstream of the activation of PKA (e.g., adenylyl cyclase), causing an increased activation of PKA when the reward signal is given, which would be necessary to enact the changes in B51 (Figure 4B). Another way for the kinases to act in series is if the PKC activation is involved somewhere downstream of PKA activation (Figure 4C). To test these hypotheses, activators of PKA and PKC were used in concert with the inhibitors Rp-cAMP and Bis. First, cAMP was injected into cultured B51 neurons. The cAMP injection elicited the same decrease in burst threshold (Figures 5A1 and 5A4) and increase in input resistance (Figures 5B1 and 5B4) as observed with conditioning previously (Nargeot et al., 1999aNargeot R.

Operant reward learning in Aplysia: neuronal correlates and mechanisms.Science. 2002; 296: 1706-1709Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar), whereas injecting a group of B51 neurons with vehicle did not appreciably alter the membrane properties (Figures 5A2, 5A4, 5B2, and 5B4). The cAMP injection alone was sufficient to mimic the conditioning, which likely rules out the parallel pathway hypothesis (Figure 4A). A third group consisted of B51 neurons injected with cAMP while being bathed in 10 μM of the PKC inhibitor Bis. This PKC inhibitor, at the same concentration used to block the contingent reinforcement (Figures 2A4 and 2B4), did not block the changes in the membrane properties elicited by cAMP (Figures 5A3, 5A4, 5B3, and 5B4). Thus, the modulation of the membrane properties by cAMP appears to be independent of the activation of PKC, which likely excludes the pathway illustrated in Figure 4C, where PKC acts downstream of cAMP synthesis. If cAMP and PKC are acting in series during this form of operant reward learning and PKC acts upstream of cAMP synthesis, then it is possible that PKC phosphorylates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the production of cAMP and priming it for an enhanced activation if dopamine is delivered soon thereafter (Figure 4B). Some isoforms of adenylyl cyclase exhibit this type of PKC sensitivity such as type II (Jacobowitz et al., 1993Jacobowitz O. Chen J. Premont R.T. Iyengar R.

Three isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (A, B, and C) have been identified in Aplysia (sequence data available through accession numbers AY843025-7). Single-cell PCR was performed to determine which of these isoforms are expressed in B51 (Figure 3B). The A and B isoforms of adenylyl cyclase were detected in B51, whereas C was not. The C isoform could be detected in sensory neurons of Aplysia. The A isoform is most closely related to the type I adenylyl cyclase, which is a Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive form, whereas the B isoform is most closely related to the type II adenylyl cyclase, which displays a high degree of PKC sensitivity (Jacobowitz et al., 1993Jacobowitz O.

To test the model depicted in Figure 4B, it is necessary to verify that PKC mimics the conditioning and that it engages the cAMP/PKA pathway in B51. To test this hypothesis, PDAc (2 μM) was bath applied to cultured B51 neurons. After 5 min, the PDAc application produced the same decrease in burst threshold (Figures 6A1 and 6A3) and increase in input resistance (Figures 6B1 and 6B3) as seen in previous conditioning experiments, indicating that a 5 min treatment with PDAc alone was sufficient to mimic the conditioning, whereas 2 min of PDAc treatment was insufficient to alter the membrane properties of B51 (data not shown). Another group of neurons received the same 2 μM treatment of PDAc while being bathed in 2 mM Rp-cAMP. This inhibitor blocked the changes in the membrane properties elicited by PDAc (Figures 6A2, 6A3, 6B2, and 6B3). Thus, the ability of PKC to mimic the conditioning was dependent on cAMP, which is consistent with a model (Figure 4B) in which PKC acts upstream of cAMP synthesis. To further examine the possibility that PKC increases the level of cAMP and thereby mimics conditioning, the level of phosphorylated"

We postulated that polymorphisms in MMP genes might affect MMP function in preterm lungs and thus influence the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).Two hundred and eighty-four consecutive neonates with a gestational age of <28 weeks were included in this prospective study. Forty-five neonates developed BPD. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were sought in the MMP2, MMP14 and MMP16 genes. After adjustment for birth weight and ethnic origin, the TT genotype of MMP16 C/T (rs2664352) and the GG genotype of MMP16 A/G (rs2664349) were found to protect from BPD. These genotypes were also associated with a smaller active fraction of MMP2 and with a 3-fold-lower MMP16 protein level in tracheal aspirates collected within 3 days after birth. Further evaluation of MMP16 expression during the course of normal human and rat lung development showed relatively low expression during the canalicular and saccular stages and a clear increase in both mRNA and protein levels during the alveolar stage. In two newborn rat models of arrested alveolarization the lung MMP16 mRNA level was less than 50% of normal.MMP16 may be involved in the development of lung alveoli. MMP16 polymorphisms appear to influence not only the pulmonary expression and function of MMP16 but also the risk of BPD in premature infants."
https://openalex.org/W2078823381,"M-type K(+) channels, consisting of KCNQ1-5 (Kv7.1-7.5) subunits, form a variety of homomeric and heteromeric channels. Whereas all the subunits can assemble into homomeric channels, the ability of the subunits to assemble into heteromultimers is highly variable. KCNQ3 is widely thought to co-assemble with several other KCNQ subtypes, whereas KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 do not. However, the existence of other subunit assemblies is not well studied. To systematically explore the heteromeric assembly of KCNQ channels in individual living cells, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan fluorescent protein- and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged KCNQ subunits expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in which excitation light only penetrates several hundred nanometers into the cell, thus isolating membrane events. We found significant FRET between homomeric subunits as expected from their functional expression in heterologous expression systems. Also as expected from previous work, robust FRET was observed between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. KCNQ3 and KCNQ4 also showed substantial FRET as did KCNQ4 and KCNQ5. To determine functional assembly of KCNQ4/KCNQ5 heteromers, we performed two types of experiments. In the first, we constructed a mutant tetraethylammonium ion-sensitive KCNQ4 subunit and tested its assembly with KCNQ5 by patch clamp analysis of the tetraethylammonium ion sensitivity of the resulting current; however, those data were not conclusive. In the second, we co-expressed a KCNQ4 (G285S) pore mutant with KCNQ5 and found the former to act as a dominant negative, suggesting co-assembly of the two types of subunits. These data confirm that among the allowed assembly conformations are KCNQ3/4 and KCNQ4/5 heteromers."

Three fluorescence resonance energy transfer levels were observed during rotation driven by ATP hydrolysis corresponding to the three resting positions of the rotor subunits, γ or ϵ, relative to the a subunit of the stator. Comparison of these positions of the rotor sites with those previously determined relative to the b subunit dimer indicates the position of a as adjacent to the b dimer on its counterclockwise side when the enzyme is viewed from the cytoplasm. This relationship provides stability to the membrane interface between a and b2, allowing it to withstand the torque imparted by the rotor during ATP synthesis as well as ATP hydrolysis.

This relationship provides stability to the membrane interface between a and b2, allowing it to withstand the torque imparted by the rotor during ATP synthesis as well as ATP hydrolysis. F0F1-ATP synthases are the membrane-embedded rotary enzymes in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria that provide ATP through oxidative and photophosphorylation (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, ATP synthesis from ADP and phosphate is driven by the flow of ions, usually H+, down an electrochemical potential difference across the plasma membrane (2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Ion flow through the membrane-integral F0 sector drives the rotation of the turbine-like ring of c subunits. Extensive analysis of the accessibility of sites within the adjacent a subunit supports the model that this subunit provides two half-channels allowing the proton to access the H+ binding site on the c subunit from either side of the membrane (3Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Rotation of the c ring by one subunit relative to a is required for net ion translocation by the system. The γ and ϵ subunits of the membrane-peripheral F1 sector interact with the c ring and turn with it. Rotation of these subunits relative to the catalytic sites housed in the three αβ pairs drive conformational changes that are linked to the binding of substrates as well as the synthesis and release of ATP. The overall structure of the Escherichia coli F0F1-ATP synthase has been visualized by electron microscopy (4Bottcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Graber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Single particle analysis and three-dimensional image reconstruction reveal that in addition to the central γϵ stalk connecting F1 and F0 a second peripheral stalk links the two sectors. A number of lines of evidence show this peripheral stalk to be composed to two copies of the highly extended b subunit that interact with the single δ subunit near the top of the α3β3 hexamer. Because the function of the peripheral stalk is to hold the a subunit and α3β3 stationary to one another while the γϵc10 rotor turns, it is sometimes called the stator stalk. Although the details of interaction of b2δ with α3β3 and with the a subunit are unknown, their arrangement and strength must be adequate to withstand the torque imparted by the turning rotor. Limited high resolution structural information is available for the F0 part of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the c ring from a Na+-driven enzyme of Ilyobacter tartaricus has been solved at 2.4-Å resolution (5Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Additional information for the N-terminal parts of the b subunits connecting the membrane portion with the F1 headpiece was obtained by NMR (6Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the dimerization domain of the b2 subunits has been crystallized (7Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of much of the stator stalk of bovine mitochondrial ATPase has been reported (8Dickson V.K. Silvester J.A. Fearnley I.M. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2911-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but this assembly is of a much different design, containing single copies of four different subunits. Structural details of subunit a are unavailable for any system, and the relative position of the a subunit in the membrane with respect to the b subunit remains unclear (see Fig. 1). In electron microscopic images, the hydrophobic membrane-embedded a subunit is covered by detergent molecules. Cross-linking experiments show the a subunit to be in contact with at least one of the b subunits, but the arrangement is uncertain. Mutational analyses imply that b2 makes contact with both the a and the c subunits (9Kumamoto C.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10037-10042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kumamoto C.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3060-3064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here to determine the relative positions of the a and b2 subunits and to discriminate between a symmetric arrangement between the two b subunits (indicated as position B in Fig. 1) or an asymmetric position, we used a triangulation approach using a set of intersubunit distance measurements derived from single molecule analyses of ATP synthase. Previously we established the relationship of the b subunit dimer to the positions that can be occupied by ϵ using a similar method (11Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Graber P. Borsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We use Förster-type fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 3The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; P, proximity factor; TCSPC, time-correlated single photon counting; L, low FRET efficiency; M, medium FRET efficiency; H, high FRET efficiency. as an appropriate method for distance measurements in the range of 2-8 nm (12Forster T. Ann. Phys. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4985) Google Scholar, 13Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). It is based on the distance-dependent, non-radiative energy transfer between two fluorophores. Bulk FRET analysis has been used successfully to predict the subunit arrangement in a number of proteins, but this approach is limited by problems of ensemble averaging. For example, achieving specific and complete labeling of a single site is often challenging. Multiple conformations of a protein or conformational fluctuations during the measurement time require resolution of more than one distance simultaneously. These limitations may be overcome by observing only a single molecule in a given time interval (14Ha T. Ting A.Y. Liang J. Chemla D.S. Schultz P.G. Weiss S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A386Google Scholar). Single molecule FRET measurements were introduced about a decade ago, and the method has now matured as a standard fluorescence technique (15Deniz A.A. Laurence T.A. Dahan M. Chemla D.S. Schultz P.G.

Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using several pairs of amino acid positions, single molecule triangulation methods result in an accuracy of about 0.5 nm for the three-dimensional localization of the fluorophores (17Antonik M. Felekyan S. Gaiduk A. Seidel C.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 6970-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 18Andrecka J. Lewis R. Bruckner F. Lehmann E. Cramer P. Michaelis J. Proc. Natl.

F0F1-ATP synthase is a non-synchronizable enzyme with an intrinsic 3-fold pseudosymmetry arising from the number and arrangement of the three αβ pairs and the three associated positions of the central γ and ϵ subunits during catalysis. In the current work, we used the three-stepped rotation of γ and ϵ to obtain a set of three distance measurements to a-EGFP within a single enzyme. To assign the three-dimensional position of the FRET donor EGFP fused to subunit a, we made use of the distance constraints between the EGFP and the N terminus of the c subunits and of the previously demonstrated distinct dwell times of the three positions of the rotating ϵ subunit (11Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Graber P. Borsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with EGFP fused to the C terminus of the a subunit. To construct this plasmid, a sequence encoding EGFP was amplified using the following oligonucleotide primers: GCTCTGATCATGGATCCATGGTGAGC and GCTCAGATCTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC (restriction sites for BclI and BglII are indicated in bold). The product was cut with BclI and BglII and cloned into pVF172, which carries part of the unc operon with a BglII site introduced at the 3′-end of uncB, which encodes the a subunit (20Valiyaveetil F.I.

A transformant bearing the insert in the proper direction for expression of an a-EGFP fusion protein was called pSD165. The 1573-bp PflMI/AvaI fragment of pSD165 was ligated with the 366-bp AvaI/PpuMI fragment of pSC5 (19Kuo P.H. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K.

Specific labeling of ϵ56 or γ106 with Alexa568-maleimide (Molecular Probes) was carried out to a labeling efficiency of about 30% (25Borsch M. Diez M. Zimmermann B. Reuter R. Graber P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The specificity of the labeling was checked by the fluorogram of a SDS-PAGE gel. Plasmid pSD166 carrying the EGFP fusion protein was expressed in strain RA1, and cell growth kinetics were similar to those of strain RA1 expressing pRA114. ATP synthase was purified as described previously (26Fischer S. Graber P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The isolated F1F0-EGFP was reconstituted into preformed liposomes (diameter, ∼120 nm), and F1 was exchanged with Alexa568-labeled F1 carrying the ϵH56C or γT106C mutations as described in Reference 11Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Graber P. Borsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, resulting in membrane-integrated F0F1 labeled with both the FRET donor (EGFP) and the acceptor (Alexa568). Spectral analysis of the original preparation of ATP synthase carrying the a-EGFP fusion revealed impurities with a pH-dependent absorption band around 425 nm that could correspond to porphyrins or cytochromes. These impurities were non-fluorescent at the emission wavelengths used for the subsequent FRET measurements and were not anticipated to disturb the single molecule measurements for two reasons. (i) In the subsequent step of the preparation, the F1 parts were removed and replaced by Alexa568-labeled F1 to yield the intramolecular FRET system in the F0F1-ATP synthase. (ii) Remaining impurities in the lipid membrane that, in principle, could act as FRET acceptors will not show a stepping FRET level sequence during ATP hydrolysis and therefore would be discarded automatically as non-rotating FRET sources in the single molecule data analysis. Rates of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis were measured at 23 and 37 °C, respectively, as described previously (11Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Graber P. Borsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the presence of 60 μm 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, ATP synthesis activity of reconstituted F0F1-ATP synthase was completely abolished.

The laser beam was attenuated to 150 microwatts on the back aperture of the microscope objective and focused by a water immersion objective (UPlanSApo 60×, numerical aperture 1.2, Olympus) into a droplet of buffer solution placed on a microscope coverslide. The fluorescence emission was separated from the excitation light by a dichroic beam splitter (c488RDC, AHF analysentechnik AG, Tübingen, Germany). Emission of the two fluorophores was split by a second dichroic beamsplitter (HQ 575, AHF analysentechnik AG). Single photons were detected separately by two avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-AQR-14, EG&G, Quebec, Canada) after passing an interference filter (HQ 532/70, AHF analysentechnik AG) for EGFP or a long pass filter (LP595, AHF analysentechnik AG) for Alexa568. Detection efficiencies were ηD = 0.364 for EGFP and ηA = 0.404 for Alexa568. A cross-talk of 6.3% from donor fluorescence in the acceptor channel was corrected. Photons were counted by a TCSPC card (SPC630, Becker & Hickl, Berlin, Germany) in first-in-first-out (FIFO) mode with 50-ns time resolution using the router electronics (HRT-82, Becker & Hickl) to assign the FRET channel information for each photon. The TCSPC data also contained the arrival time information for the laser pulse for FRET donor fluorescence lifetime measurements with picosecond resolution. Fluorescence anisotropies of single EGFP-a-F0F1 (linear polarized excitation with 488 nm) or F0-Alexa568-ϵ-F1 (linear polarized excitation with 561 nm; continuous wave laser Jive, Cobolt, Stockholm, Sweden) in liposomes were measured separately in the confocal microscope using a polarizing beamsplitter in the fluorescence pathway. Signals of the two avalanche photodiodes were recorded by two synchronized, fast TCSPC cards (SPC152, Becker & Hickl). Intensity thresholds were applied to identify individual photon bursts, and fluorescence anisotropy values were calculated for each burst after correction for the avalanche photodiode detection efficiencies. Solutions of rhodamine 110, erythrosine, rhodamine 101, and a new perylene dye (31Peneva K. Mihov G. Herrmann A. Zarrabi N. Borsch M. Duncan T.M. Mullen K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 5398-5399Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in water were used as anisotropy references. Data Analysis—Fluorescence intensity time trajectories were binned to 1 ms using the custom-made software “Burst_ Analyzer” (32Zarrabi N. Zimmermann B. Diez M. Graber P. Wrachtrup J. Borsch M. Proc. Soc. Photo-Opt. Instrum. 2005; 5699: 175-188Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Photon bursts of single F0F1-ATP synthases were identified by intensity thresholds for the FRET donor and acceptor channels after substraction of a background signal of about 2-5 counts/ms. FRET levels and changes of FRET levels were assigned manually within each photon burst as described previously (33Diez M. Zimmermann B. Borsch M. Konig M. Schweinberger E. Steigmiller S. Reuter R. Felekyan S. Kudryavtsev V. Seidel C.A. Graber P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Only FRET levels from photon bursts showing two or more FRET transitions were included in the FRET efficiency histograms. Fitting the histogram by Gaussian distributions yielded the mean values for the distinct distances assuming the previously determined fluorescence quantum yields of EGFP and Alexa568. The regular sequence of FRET transitions upon ATP hydrolysis was revealed from the maxima in the two-dimensional FRET transition density plot according to Ref. 34McKinney S.A. Joo C. Ha T. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1941-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar. Lower and upper FRET efficiency limits for the three mean FRET levels were assigned from the FRET transition density plot. Subsequently each FRET level within a photon burst was attributed to one of the three main FRET states. The subset of photon bursts with three or more FRET levels in the regular FRET transition sequence was selected to calculate the dwell times (from the intermediate FRET levels only) and to triangulate one single position of the EGFP chromophore by each set of three consecutive FRET levels. The single molecule FRET triangulation approach to localize subunit a of F0 relies initially on determination of distances to the three stopping positions of the rotating ϵ or γ subunits of F1 during ATP hydrolysis. In a subsequent step, the dwell times of previous single molecule FRET measurements between ϵ and the b subunit dimer are compared with the dwell times obtained for the new FRET experiments to allow correlation of the three stopping positions so that the relationship of the positions of a and b2 may be established. This approach requires that four specific goals be achieved: (a) specific labeling of subunit a,(b) functional reassembling of the labeled F0 with a specifically labeled ϵ or γ subunit of F1,(c) discrimination of the three FRET efficiencies depending on the relative orientations of γ or ϵ, and (d) correlation of the different dwell times obtained in the FRET experiments of ϵ rotation versus subunit b to the dwell times obtained in the FRET experiments of the rotation of ϵ or γ versus subunit a. The Fusion of EGFP to the C terminus of Subunit a—To specifically label the subunit a of F0F1 with a fluorophore for intramolecular FRET distance measurements we fused the autofluorescent protein EGFP to the C terminus of subunit a, which is located on the cytosolic side of the membrane. In fluorescence microscopic images, the EGFP fusion to F0F1 is located at the cell membrane (see supplemental Fig. S1). Few cells showed fluorescent inclusion bodies. The ATP synthase plasmid carrying the a-EGFP fusion supported growth of cells on non-fermentable carbon sources (acetate and succinate) at rates comparable to those of the wild type. We conclude that the fusion of EGFP did not impair the functionality of the F0F1-ATP synthase in E. coli. The enzyme was isolated from the plasma membranes and reconstituted into lipid vesicles to yield a ratio of not more than one ATP synthase per liposome. ATP synthesis (vS = 32 s-1 at 23 °C) and hydrolysis (vH = 330 s-1 at 37 °C) activities were measured. The fluorescence spectra of EGFP fused to subunit a of F0F1 in the presence of 0.1% dodecylmaltoside showed a small (2-nm) red shift of the fluorescence excitation maximum at pH 8.8 compared with free EGFP, and the emission maximum at 510 nm was nearly identical to published data (35Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quantum yield for the EGFP fusion, ΦFl = 0.4, was measured previously (36Duser M.G. Zarrabi N. Bi Y. Zimmermann B. Dunn S.D. Borsch M. Proc. Soc. Photo-Opt. Instrum. 2006; 6092: 60920HGoogle Scholar). The single molecule brightness of EGFP on subunit a was found to be lower than that of rhodamine 110 in solution using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Nevertheless a mean number of detected photons n = 55 kHz per EGFP was achievable by excitation at 488 nm with a laser power of 150 microwatts at the back focal plane of the microscope objective. The fluorescence lifetime of EGFP fused to F0F1 was found to consist of two components in the absence of a FRET acceptor. The major fraction had a lifetime τ ∼2.7 ns, whereas a minor fraction showed a lifetime τ ∼2.2 ns in accordance with the literature (37Cotlet M. Goodwin P.M. Waldo G.S. Werner J.H. Chemphyschem. 2006; 7: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To summarize, the fluorescence properties of the EGFP fused to the a subunit were as expected, and the fluorophore seemed to be suitable for the single molecule FRET distance measurements. Single Molecule FRET Levels from a-EGFP to Positions ϵ56 or γ106 during ATP Hydrolysis—The quantitative removal of the F1 part from F0F1-ATP synthase in lipid membranes was accomplished in the absence of Mg2+. Afterwards the enzyme was reassembled in the presence of Mg2+ with F1 labeled with Alexa568 at position ϵ56 or γ106. The mean ATP synthesis activity was measured as vS = 40 ATP s-1 at 23 °C; this is comparable to previously measured synthesis rates for labeled enzymes, which show modest reductions compared with unlabeled forms (33Diez M. Zimmermann B. Borsch M. Konig M. Schweinberger E. Steigmiller S. Reuter R. Felekyan S. Kudryavtsev V. Seidel C.A. Graber P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 38Zimmermann B. Diez M. Borsch M. Graber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the single molecule measurements, proteoliposomes carrying single FRET-labeled ATP synthase molecules were diluted to ∼100 pm. Confocal excitation in a femtoliter-sized volume was achieved by focusing the 488 nm laser line of an argon ion laser (or 476 nm of a krypton ion laser for F0F1-ATP synthase labeled with the FRET acceptor at the γ subunit) into a microscope objective. As a single ATP synthase diffused freely into the confocal volume, a burst of photons was generated that was registered in the two spectral ranges corresponding to the FRET donor and FRET acceptor. Photon bursts of single liposome-embedded F0F1, containing a-EGFP and ϵ56-Alexa568, are shown in Fig. 2. In the presence of 1 mm ATP, the rotation of subunit ϵ with the attached FRET acceptor relative to EGFP on the non-rotating a subunit caused a stepwise change of the relative fluorescence intensities (Fig. 2, lower panels) with the rotor stopping at the catalytic dwell (39Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We calculated the proximity factor P for each time bin as follows. P = IA/(IA + ID)(Eq. 1) where IA and ID are the background-corrected fluorescence intensities in the FRET acceptor or donor channel, respectively. We manually assigned the switching points of the FRET levels (Fig. 2, upper panels). These changes are related to the distance changes between the two fluorophores and were analyzed as FRET efficiency changes. Three main FRET levels were identified in photon bursts showing fluctuations: the mean low FRET efficiency (L) level was found at P = 0.2 ± 0.03, the mean medium FRET efficiency (M) was at P = 0.5 ± 0.08, and the mean high FRET efficiency (H) was at P = 0.86 ± 0.03 (Fig. 3A). For more than 79% of the FRET-labeled ATP synthases showing subunit rotation during ATP hydrolysis, the sequence of the FRET level transitions was → L → M → H → L →.FIGURE 3Proximity factor distribution (A) and FRET transition density plot (B) of F0F1-ATP synthases during ATP hydrolysis. At least two distinct FRET levels had to be detected within a photon burst to be added to the histograms.

B, FRET transition density plot with chromophore distances between EGFP and Alexa568 bound to ϵ56.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to measuring FRET between a-GFP and position ϵ56, we measured single molecule FRET to Alexa568 at residue 106 of the γ subunit of F0F1 during ATP hydrolysis, yielding an independent set of distances (see supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). As with the samples containing labeled ϵ, three distinct FRET efficiency levels were found in fluctuating photon bursts according to the stepwise rotation of the γ subunit. The sequence of FRET level transitions was → L → M → H for about 80% of the photon bursts in accordance with the sequence observed above. In contrast, during proton-driven ATP synthesis in the presence of Mg2+, ADP, and phosphate the direction of rotation was reversed (see supplemental material) as deduced from the opposite order of FRET level transitions. The sequence of FRET levels observed here during ATP hydrolysis are apparently opposite to the sequence observed previously when the enzymes were labeled at γ and the b subunit dimer (38Zimmermann B. Diez M. Borsch M. Graber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and also for the single molecule FRET measurements between ϵ and b (11Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Graber P. Borsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This difference must reflect the different positions of a-EGFP and b2 in the enzyme. A position of the FRET donor EGFP on one side of the peripheral b subunit dimer but not a position symmetrically in between the two b subunits, position “B” in Fig. 1, results in the observed change in sequence. FRET distances for a-EGFP versus ϵ56—Assuming a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.66 (40Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Bishop-Stewart J. Bhalgat M.K. Millard P.J. Mao F. Leung W.Y. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) for Alexa568 at ϵ56, the proximity factor values can be transformed to FRET efficiencies, EFRET. EFRET = IA/(IA + γID) (Eq. 2) where γ is a correction factor for spectral detection efficiencies and fluorescence quantum yields of the FRET donor and acceptor. Alternatively the FRET efficiency is calculated from the FRET donor lifetime in the absence of an acceptor, τD, and in the presence of an acceptor, τDA. EFRET = 1 − (τDA/τD)(Eq. 3) The distances rDA between the fluorophores are related to EFRET by EFRET = R06/(R06 + rDA6)(Eq. 4) according to the Förster theory with R0 being the Förster radius, that is the distance for 50% EFRET. We calculated R0 = 4.9 nm for EGFP and Alexa568 using the fluorescence quantum yields given above. For each FRET level, the distance values can be plotted in pairs to obtain the FRET transition density plot shown in Fig. 3B. The maximum of each FRET level was obtained by fitting the histograms shown in Fig. 3A with three Gaussians distributions, and the corresponding mean distances between the labels were calculated to be 6.8 nm for the low FRET orientation, 5.4 nm for the medium FRET orientation, and 4.0 nm for the high FRET orientation.

Here, we investigate the mechanism and role of rhodopsin inactivation. We determined the lifetime of activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin = M∗) in whole-cell recordings from Drosophila photoreceptors by measuring the time window within which inactivating M∗ by photoreisomerization to rhodopsin could suppress responses to prior illumination. M∗ was inactivated rapidly (τ ∼20 ms) under control conditions, but ∼10-fold more slowly in Ca2+-free solutions. This pronounced Ca2+ dependence of M∗ inactivation was unaffected by mutations affecting phosphorylation of rhodopsin or arrestin but was abolished in mutants of calmodulin (CaM) or the CaM-binding myosin III, NINAC. This suggests a mechanism whereby Ca2+ influx acting via CaM and NINAC accelerates the binding of arrestin to M∗. Our results indicate that this strategy promotes quantum efficiency, temporal resolution, and fidelity of visual signaling.

Our results indicate that this strategy promotes quantum efficiency, temporal resolution, and fidelity of visual signaling. In any signaling cascade, it is important that each step is appropriately terminated in a timely fashion. This is particularly true in phototransduction where rapid response termination is essential for high temporal resolution, and perhaps nowhere more so than in flies, which have the fastest known G protein-coupled signaling cascade (reviews: Montell, 1999Montell C.

In Drosophila, the key elements of this cascade, from rhodopsin to the light-sensitive channels, are localized in a tightly packed array of microvilli forming the light-guiding rhabdomere. Two classes of channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) and TRP-like (TRPL), are activated downstream of phospholipase C (PLC), most likely by lipid products of PLC such as diacylglycerol (DAG), polyunsaturated fatty acids, and/or the reduction in phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) (reviewed by Minke and Parnas, 2006Minke B.

The dominant channel is highly Ca2+ selective and encoded by the trp gene (Montell and Rubin, 1989Montell C. Rubin G.M.

Activation of a single rhodopsin molecule by one photon results in a discrete electrical event, the quantum bump ∼10 pA in amplitude, mediated by activation of ∼15 TRP channels after a variable latency of ∼20–100 ms (Henderson et al., 2000Henderson S.R.

The associated Ca2+ influx transiently raises [Ca2+] to near millimolar levels in the affected microvillus (Postma et al., 1999Postma M. Oberwinkler J. Stavenga D.G.

This Ca2+ influx is critical for response kinetics and amplification, mediating both positive and negative feedback via multiple molecular targets (Hardie, 1991Hardie R.C.

However, despite extensive investigation, in most instances the precise mechanisms underlying this feedback are still only poorly understood. The first stage of excitation is the photoisomerization of rhodopsin (R) to active metarhodopsin (M∗) by the 11-cis to all-trans photoisomerization of the chromophore (3-hydroxy-retinal); M∗ is subsequently inactivated by binding to arrestin (see Figure 8). In vertebrate photoreceptors, M∗ inactivation is Ca2+ dependent because M∗ must first be phosphorylated by a Ca2+ (and recoverin) dependent rhodopsin kinase before arrestin can bind M∗ (Kawamura, 1993Kawamura S. Rhodopsin phosphorylation as a mechanism of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase regulation by S-modulin.Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, in flies, M∗ phosphorylation appears not to be required for arrestin binding (Plangger et al., 1994Plangger A. Malicki D. Whitney M. Paulsen R.

USA. 2004; 101: 11874-11879Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether M∗ lifetime can be modulated by Ca2+ and, if so, how? One possibility was suggested by finding that arrestin itself is rapidly phosphorylated by CaMKII (Matsumoto et al., 1994Matsumoto H. Kurien B.T. Takagi Y. Kahn E.S. Kinumi T. Komori N. Yamada T. Hayashi F. Isono K.

However, a subsequent study reported that this was not required for arrestin binding to M but instead was required for arrestin to subsequently dissociate from R after M had been photoreisomerized (Alloway and Dolph, 1999Alloway P.G. Dolph P.J. A role for the light-dependent phosphorylation of visual arrestin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6072-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), leaving no known mechanism for Ca2+-dependent M∗ inactivation in Drosophila. Here, we measured M∗ lifetime by exploiting the bistable nature of invertebrate rhodopsins (Hillman et al., 1983Hillman P. Hochstein S. Minke B. Transduction in invertebrate photoreceptors: role of pigment bistability.Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 668-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Stavenga, 1996Stavenga D.G. Insect retinal pigments: Spectral characteristics and physiological functions.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 231-259Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereby M∗ can be instantaneously inactivated by photoreisomerization to the inactive R state (Hamdorf and Kirschfeld, 1980Hamdorf K. Kirschfeld K. Reversible events in the transduction process of photoreceptors.Nature. 1980; 283: 859-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Richard and Lisman, 1992Richard E.A. Lisman J.E. Rhodopsin inactivation is a modulated process in Limulus photoreceptors.Nature. 1992; 356: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We found that M∗ inactivation in Drosophila is indeed strongly Ca2+ dependent. Our results further suggest that this is achieved by a mechanism whereby Ca2+ influx acting via CaM and myosin III (NINAC) promotes the binding of arrestin to metarhodopsin. This strategy, combined with the ultracompartmentalization afforded by the photoreceptors' microvillar design, promotes quantum efficiency, temporal resolution, and fidelity of visual signaling. In order to measure the lifetime of M∗ in vivo, we used a powerful but rarely used strategy that involves exciting the cell with a test flash and then inactivating M∗ by photoreisomerization (Hamdorf and Kirschfeld, 1980Hamdorf K. Kirschfeld K. Reversible events in the transduction process of photoreceptors.Nature. 1980; 283: 859-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Richard and Lisman, 1992Richard E.A. Lisman J.E. Rhodopsin inactivation is a modulated process in Limulus photoreceptors.Nature. 1992; 356: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The logic is that photoreconversion of M∗ should suppress the response to a prior test flash as long as M∗ is still active, but not if M∗ has already been inactivated. Critically, the strategy relies on the ability to rapidly reconvert the very same M∗ molecules that had been initially excited, necessitating the delivery of brief, extremely intense flashes capable of hitting all ∼108 rhodopsin molecules in the cell. For the case of the major rhodopsin in Drosophila (Rh1), the overlap of the M and R absorption spectra makes such an approach impractical, as the reconverting flash itself would also activate sufficient new R molecules to generate a near-saturating response. We therefore used flies (p[Rh3]) in which Rh1 had been replaced by the UV-absorbing rhodopsin, Rh3 (Feiler et al., 1992Feiler R. Bjornson R. Kirschfeld K. Mismer D. Rubin G.M. Smith D.P. Socolich M.

Cytosolic calcium transients: Spatial localization and role in Drosophila photoreceptor cell function.Neuron. 1994; 13: 837-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), where the R and M spectra are sufficiently widely separated that long-wavelength light can reconvert M with minimal excitation of R (Figure 1F). We first characterized Rh3-mediated responses in order to test whether they resembled responses mediated by Rh1 (Figure 1). In whole-cell voltage-clamped recordings from dissociated ommatidia, responses to brief UV flashes in p[Rh3] cells showed similar, albeit slightly slower, kinetics to responses from wild-type photoreceptors; quantum bumps were also similar in waveform, though slightly larger than in wild-type. Importantly for this study, responses showed a similar dependence on Ca2+, with an ∼10-fold slowing of both onset and offset kinetics when extracellular Ca2+ was removed (Figure 1C), indicating that both positive and negative feedback by Ca2+ influx were intact. Since M∗ inactivation is believed to be mediated by binding to arrestin (Dolph et al., 1993Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Arrestin function in inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), it was important to ask whether Rh3 interacts with arrestin in a similar fashion to Rh1. Drosophila photoreceptors express two arrestin isoforms: Arr2, which is the dominant isoform required for rapid inactivation of Rh1; and Arr1, which can terminate the response more slowly in the absence of Arr2 (Dolph et al., 1993Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Arrestin function in inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A potential complication is that both arrestins translocate to the rhabdomere during illumination (Kiselev et al., 2000Kiselev A. Socolich M. Vinos J. Hardy R.W. Zuker C.S. Ranganathan R.

Immunocytochemistry showed that both Arr2 and Arr1 were similarly distributed in p[Rh3] flies and that both translocated reversibly in response to UV illumination (Figure 1G). We also confirmed by western analysis that Arr2 was expressed at wild-type levels in p[Rh3] flies (Table 1 and Figure S1 available online).Table 1Arrestin Levels in Mutant BackgroundsWTp[Rh3]ninaCP235ninaCKDcamarr25/+Arr2 level100%136%50% ± 17%30% ± 16%28% ± 8%59% ± 12%n18214534Values determined by densitometry of western blots (mean ± SD, normalized to levels in wild-type using tubulin as standard), see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 for further details.

To confirm functional involvement of Arr2 in inactivation of Rh3, we used a null allele of the arr2 gene (arr25) and found that responses in p[Rh3];arr25 flies showed a deactivation defect very similar to that previously described in arr2 mutants. Namely, responses initially inactivated normally due to Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channels but then failed to rapidly reach baseline, leaving a secondary peak or shoulder that decayed over several seconds (Figure 1D). Finally, the phenotypes of several other phototransduction mutants, including norpA (PLC), Gαq, ninaC, and cam (calmodulin), were reproduced when investigated on the p[Rh3] background (Figure S2 and see below). These results clearly establish that Rh3 interacts with Arr2 and Arr1 in a similar fashion to Rh1 and utilizes the same excitation and inactivation signaling machinery. The R and M states of Rh3 absorb maximally at 330 nm and 460 nm, respectively (Figure 1F; Feiler et al., 1992Feiler R. Bjornson R. Kirschfeld K. Mismer D. Rubin G.M. Smith D.P. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Ectopic expression of ultraviolet-rhodopsins in the blue photoreceptor cells of Drosophila: visual physiology and photochemistry of transgenic animals.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3862-3868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a long-wavelength cut-off filter (Schott GG495), it was possible to reconvert >90% of M to R within the duration of a brief flash (∼1 ms) delivered by a high-voltage Xe flash lamp. By itself, this yellow (Y) flash generated a modest response equivalent to ∼200 effectively absorbed photons, due to residual absorption by the long-wavelength flank of the R absorption spectrum. When delivered 5 ms prior to a brief (1 ms) UV test flash, the responses summated, generating responses approximately equal to the sum of the responses to Y and UV flashes delivered alone (Figure 2B). However, when the Y flash was delivered 2–5 ms after the UV flash, the response was greatly reduced and was barely larger than the response to the Y flash delivered alone (Figure 2C). This indicated that virtually all of the M molecules generated by the UV flash were reconverted to R by the Y flash before they had had a chance to activate downstream elements of the transduction cascade. The effective lifetime of active M∗ was then probed by varying the timing of the Y reconverting flash relative to UV excitation. Y flashes almost completely suppressed the response to the UV flash when delivered within 5 ms, but then their ability to suppress the response decreased exponentially with a time constant of ∼20 ms, and flashes delivered more than ∼50 ms after the UV flash no longer caused significant suppression of the response. Comparison of suppressed responses with the control response (UV alone) showed that suppression first started ∼20 ms after the reconverting flash (Figure 2E). This delay probably represents the persistence of Gq α subunits and PLC molecules already activated by M∗ prior to the reconverting flash and which are still capable of generating a response. The suppression reflects inactivation (by reconversion to R) of M∗ molecules, which had not yet activated sufficient G proteins to overcome threshold for bump generation. Following this delay, the suppressed responses inactivated rapidly with a time course τdec ∼7 ms, which is similar to the time course of inactivation of single quantum bumps and is probably mediated by the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of TRP channels. These experiments indicate that, under physiological conditions, M∗ is effectively inactivated with a time constant of ∼20 ms. We next asked whether this rapid inactivation depended upon Ca2+ influx by repeating the experiments in Ca2+-free solutions where responses are prolonged ∼10-fold. Strikingly, reconverting (Y) flashes delivered even at very late times (>500 ms) during such Ca2+-free responses were always capable of suppressing the tail of the response (n = 14), demonstrating that M∗ had remained active throughout most of the response and was required to sustain the response over these durations (Figure 3). Suppression of such responses by M∗ reconversion again first started after a short delay of ∼25 ms. The response then decayed with a time constant of ∼80 ms, providing a direct measurement of the inactivation time course of events downstream of rhodopsin, such as inactivation of the G protein-PLC complex and/or the removal of excitatory messenger (e.g., metabolism of DAG by DAG kinase) under Ca2+-free conditions. To avoid inaccuracies that might arise from subtraction of the Y flash response template, we also recorded from flies that had been raised on a vitamin A-deprived (VA–) diet that reduced Rh3 concentration ∼350-fold. Under these conditions, the Y flash now elicited virtually no response at all by itself, so that suppression by M∗ reconversion and its kinetics could be directly recorded without needing to subtract a template. Examples shown in Figure 3D directly confirm complete suppression with similar kinetics (τdec 82 ± 14 ms, n = 7) to that derived after template subtraction in flies reared on normal diet (85 ± 16 ms, n = 8). These results directly demonstrate that, in the absence of Ca2+ influx, M∗ lifetime is the rate-limiting step controlling response duration and decay. With this knowledge, and since the response under Ca2+-free conditions scales strictly linearly with intensity (R.C.H., unpublished data), the effective lifetime of M∗ under Ca2+-free conditions can be most conveniently estimated by simply fitting an exponential to the final tail of the flash response. This yielded values of ∼500 ms in p[Rh3] flies and 200–300 ms (mean 227 ± 44 ms, n = 13) in wild-type photoreceptors (Figure 1E). The dramatic ∼10-fold increase in the lifetime of active M∗ in Ca2+-free solutions indicates that, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, M∗ inactivation is rapidly accelerated by the Ca2+ influx associated with the quantum bump. These results demonstrate that M∗ inactivation is strongly Ca2+ dependent in photoreceptors expressing Rh3. The similar Ca2+ dependence of Rh1- and Rh3-mediated responses (Figure 1) implies that this is also the case in wild-type photoreceptors; nevertheless, we sought independent confirmation that inactivation of M∗ by Arr2 is also rate limiting under Ca2+-free conditions for Rh1. If this is the case, then increasing Arr2 levels would be predicted to accelerate response inactivation. To test this, we recorded from p[Arr2] flies expressing two extra copies of a wild-type arr2 transgene, resulting in an approximate doubling of Arr2 protein level (Dolph et al., 1993Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S.

Stevens C.F. Arrestin binding determines the rate of inactivation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Cell. 1995; 81: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As predicted, when recorded under Ca2+-free conditions, photoreceptors from p[Arr2] flies (four independent transformant lines) showed a greatly accelerated response deactivation, with a decay time constant of 94 ms (Figure 4B). This was not significantly different from the time constant of response inactivation following M > R reconversion under Ca2+-free conditions. Paradoxically, and contrary to a previous report (Ranganathan and Stevens, 1995Ranganathan R. Stevens C.F. Arrestin binding determines the rate of inactivation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Cell. 1995; 81: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in the presence of physiological Ca2+-containing solutions, responses in p[Arr2] flies actually decayed significantly more slowly than in wild-type photoreceptors (τdec ∼40 ms, cf. ∼12 ms in wild-type), indicating that inactivation of M∗ by Arr2 is not rate limiting under physiological conditions (Figure 4A). Further analysis revealed that the slow “decay” reflected the generation of quantum bumps with longer latencies (data not shown). In addition, sensitivity to light was substantially reduced due to an ∼5 fold reduction in effective quantum efficiency (Q.E.) and an ∼2-fold reduction in bump amplitude (Figures 4D and 4E). While initially surprising, these phenotypes can be readily reconciled with current models of quantum bump generation. Thus, bump generation and amplification are thought to involve the sequential and stochastic activation of approximately five or more G proteins and PLC molecules during the bump latent period (Hardie et al., 2002Hardie R.C. Martin F. Cochrane G.W. Juusola M. Georgiev P. Raghu P. Molecular basis of amplification in Drosophila phototransduction. Roles for G protein, phospholipase C, and diacylglycerol kinase.Neuron. 2002; 36: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reduction in Q.E. in p[Arr2] flies is presumably due to the increased levels of Arr2 resulting in a high probability that M∗ is inactivated before it has a chance to activate a G protein (or sufficient G proteins to initiate a quantum bump). Furthermore, if only one or two G proteins are activated, the reduction in net PLC activity can be expected to result in production of smaller bumps with longer latencies. In these respects, these phenotypes resemble those of hypomorphic G protein mutants (Gαq), which also have reduced Q.E. and bump amplitude and prolonged bump latencies (Scott et al., 1995Scott K.

Since M∗ is quenched by binding to the dominant arrestin isoform Arr2 (Dolph et al., 1993Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Arrestin function in inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), our results imply that inactivation of M∗ by Arr2 is strongly Ca2+ dependent. If this is the case, it may be predicted that the Ca2+ dependence of M∗ termination would be altered or eliminated in arr2 mutants. We therefore investigated the Ca2+ dependence of responses in the null arr25 mutant. As previously reported (Dolph et al., 1993Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Arrestin function in inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), responses to brief flashes in arr25 flies show a prolonged decay lasting several seconds, the tail of which could be fitted with a single exponential of ∼1400 ms (Figures 5A and 5E). In confirmation of an earlier study (Scott et al., 1997Scott K. Sun Y.M. Beckingham K. Zuker C.S. Calmodulin regulation of Drosophila light-activated channels and receptor function mediates termination of the light response in vivo.Cell. 1997; 91: 375-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the slow deactivation was seen to be due to the ability of single effectively absorbed photons to excite trains of quantum bumps (Figure 5B). This is interpreted as the ability of active M∗ to reactivate the transduction cascade after a refractory period, probably induced by the massive Ca2+ influx in the microvillus that supports the bump (Postma et al., 1999Postma M.

The duration of this refractory period was estimated from the interval distribution between bumps in such trains and peaked at ∼100–150 ms, with shortest intervals of ∼50 ms (Figure 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2130189983,"DLC-1 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) and negative regulator of specific Rho family proteins (RhoA-C and Cdc42). DLC-1 is a multi-domain protein, with the RhoGAP catalytic domain flanked by an amino-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) and a carboxyl-terminal START domain. The roles of these domains in the regulation of DLC-1 function remain to be determined. We undertook a structure-function analysis involving truncation and missense mutants of DLC-1. We determined that the amino-terminal SAM domain functions as an autoinhibitory domain of intrinsic RhoGAP activity. Additionally, we determined that the SAM and START domains are dispensable for DLC-1 association with focal adhesions. We then characterized several mutants for their ability to regulate cell migration and identified constitutively activated and dominant negative mutants of DLC-1. We report that DLC-1 activation profoundly alters cell morphology, enhances protrusive activity, and can increase the velocity but reduce directionality of cell migration. Conversely, the expression of the amino-terminal domain of DLC-1 acts as a dominant negative and profoundly inhibits cell migration by displacing endogenous DLC-1 from focal adhesions."

In the helical-screw model, the positively charged fourth transmembrane segment S4 slides and rotates along negative counter charges in S2 and S3, while in the paddle model, S4 carries the extracellular part of S3 (S3b) as a cargo. Here, we show that S4 slides 16–26 Å along S3b. We introduced pairs of cysteines in S4 and S3b of the Shaker K channel to make disulfide bonds. Residue 325 in S3b makes close and state-dependent contacts with a long stretch of residues in S4. A disulfide bond between 325 and 360 was formed in the closed state, while a bond between 325 and 366 was formed in the open state. These data are not compatible with the voltage-sensor paddle model, but support the helical-screw model."
https://openalex.org/W2033125759,"Serpentine soil, which is naturally high in heavy metal content and has low calcium to magnesium ratios, comprises a difficult environment for most plants. An impressive number of species are endemic to serpentine, and a wide range of non-endemic plant taxa have been shown to be locally adapted to these soils. Locating genomic polymorphisms which are differentiated between serpentine and non-serpentine populations would provide candidate loci for serpentine adaptation. We have used the Arabidopsis thaliana tiling array, which has 2.85 million probes throughout the genome, to measure genetic differentiation between populations of Arabidopsis lyrata growing on granitic soils and those growing on serpentinic soils. The significant overrepresentation of genes involved in ion transport and other functions provides a starting point for investigating the molecular basis of adaptation to soil ion content, water retention, and other ecologically and economically important variables. One gene in particular, calcium-exchanger 7, appears to be an excellent candidate gene for adaptation to low CaratioMg ratio in A. lyrata."
https://openalex.org/W2013651567,"Previously, we have demonstrated the induction of Src in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. In this study, we observed that pharmacological blockade or knockout of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) reduced LPS-mediated Src induction and macrophage migration.

In addition, Src family kinase (SFK)-specific inhibitor, PP2, inhibited SNAP- and 8-Br-cGMP-evoked motility implicating the involvement of SFKs downstream of NO/cGMP.

Furthermore, LPS-mediated Src induction led to increased FAK Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861, which was also iNOS-dependent.

Macrophages are important participants in innate immunity. Due to their ability to eliminate opsonized pathogens through a spectrum of surface receptors and antigen presentation to cells of the adaptive immunity, macrophage recruitment to sites of infection is an important physiological process in host defenses. Disturbed regulation of this event results in a variety of diseases such as sepsis, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune disorders.

Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). Three distinct isoforms of the enzyme have been identified and characterized. Whereas Ca+2/calmodulin can regulate the activity of neuronal (n) and endothelial (e) NOS that are constitutively expressed, the activity of inducible (i) NOS is independent of Ca+2/calmodulin and only induced by bacterial products as well as inflammatory cytokines. A low level of constitutively produced NO is a crucial mediator for a spectrum of physiological functions such as regulation of neurotransmission, vasodilation, smooth muscle relaxation, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. In contrast, a high level of NO generated by macrophages and other effector cells under inducible conditions mediates host defense, including antibacterial and antitumor functions (2Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar, 3Duffield J.S. Clin. Sci. 2003; 104: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, it is also well documented that some pathological processes such as inflammation and tumor can be induced by sustained, chronically produced NO (4Moncada S. Higgs E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5758) Google Scholar, 5Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). As a main target of NO, sGC is a cytosolic, heme-containing heterodimer of α and β subunits (6Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). When NO binds to the sGC heme prosthetic group, it activates the enzyme to convert guanosine 5′-triphosphate to cGMP, an intracellular second messenger (7Krumenacker J.S. Hanafy K.A. Murad F. Brain Res. Bull. 2004; 62: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cGMP results in transmission of NO signals to the downstream effectors such as cGMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterase, and cGMP-gated cation channels, leading to physiological and pathological responses (8Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar). The SFKs are membrane-associated, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that have been implicated in multiple signaling pathways, dictating a wide spectrum of cell physiology (9Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 10Ishizawar R. Parsons S.J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The SFKs comprise nine members that share similar structural and biochemical properties. Although Src, Yes, and Fyn are widely expressed in most tissues, the distribution of Lck, Lyn, Fgr, Hck, Blk, and Yrk exhibits a more tissue-specific fashion, mainly in hematopoietic cells (11Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). For example, the myeloid-specific Src members, Lyn, Fgr, and Hck, are predominantly expressed in macrophages (12Meng F. Lowell C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The presence of alternatively spliced isoforms is quite common for SFKs (13Korade-Mirnics Z. Corey S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 603-613PubMed Google Scholar). Mounting evidence indicates that regardless the stimulus and receptor type, these SFKs amplify and diversify the signal leading to proliferation, cell survival, adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis in leukocytes (13Korade-Mirnics Z. Corey S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 603-613PubMed Google Scholar). LPS, an outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria, activates macrophages via Toll-like receptor 4 signaling (14Miggin S.M. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Because tyrosine kinases are important in LPS-mediated macrophage signaling (16Weinstein S.L. Gold M.R. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4148-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 17Weinstein S.L. June C.H. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3829-3838PubMed Google Scholar), the myeloid-specific Src members are speculated to play crucial roles in this process. However, macrophages derived from mice with three-combined deficiency of Lyn, Fgr, and Hck still retain full LPS responsiveness (12Meng F. Lowell C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of one or more elusive, compensating tyrosine kinase(s). Indeed, in our previous report, we demonstrated the up-regulation of Src in LPS-stimulated macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. The abrogation of LPS-elicited responses by PP2 (the inhibitor for SFKs) implicated that Src might functionally compensate for its myeloid-specific relatives and restored LPS-induced activation in lyn–/–fgr–/–hck–/– macrophages. In other words, albeit Src is barely detectable in resting macrophages, its ready enhancement upon LPS exposure implicates that it might have an unperceived role in transmitting LPS signaling (18Leu T.-H. Charoenfuprasert S. Yen C.-K. Fan C.-W. Maa M.-C. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given that 1) NOS inhibitors attenuated human monocyte chemotaxis (19Belenky S.N. Robbins R.A. Rubinstein I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); 2) reduced polymorphonuclear granulocyte extravasation in peritoneal cavity was observed in zymosan-challenged iNOS-deficient mice (20Ajuebor M.N. Virag T. Flower R.J. Perretti M. Szabo C. Immunology. 1998; 95: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), NO was speculated to modulate leukocyte locomotion during inflammation and tissue injury. In this study, we demonstrated that iNOS was required in LPS-mediated macrophage movement, which was PP2-sensitive. Unlike its myeloid relatives, the expression of Src was LPS-, NO-, and cGMP-inducible, which was required for FAK Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861. Around 80% of LPS-, SNAP-initiated motility was inhibited by src siRNA in Raw264.7 macrophages, which could be recovered by ectopic avian c-Src, corroborated the importance of Src in this process. Studies conducted with wild-type (WT) and iNOS knockout (iNOS–/–) macrophages provided further definitive evidence regarding the concomitant induction of Src and increased motility by the NO/cGMP pathway. These data establish a role for Src in LPS-induced macrophage motility that depends on iNOS.

Animals—Rats (Sprague-Dawley) were utilized to prepare peritoneal macrophages (PEMs). C57BL/6 inducible nitric-oxide synthase knockout (C57BL/6-Nostm1Lau) (iNOS–/–) and WT mice of the same age and sex were used to assess the role of iNOS in LPS-induced Src expression in macrophages. These mutant mice were normal in appearance, histology, growth rate, and reproduction. But their PEMs failed to generate NO when stimulated with LPS (21Laubach V.E. Shesely E.G. Smithies O. Sherman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10688-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). All experiments using laboratory animals were done in accordance with China Medical University guidelines. Cell Culture and Collection of PEMs—The murine macrophage cell line, Raw264.7 (American Type Culture Collection), was cultured and propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air. PEMs were collected by peritoneal lavage from rats (Sprague-Dawley) or wild-type and iNOS-null mice given an intraperitoneal injection of 8 ml and 1 ml of thioglycollate broth, respectively, 4 days before harvest. The PEMs were washed with Ca+2- and Mg+2-free phosphate-buffered saline and plated in fetal calf serum-containing RPMI medium overnight. Then the cells were washed with medium to remove nonadherent cells. In addition, according to morphological and phagocytic criteria, the resultant macrophage monolayer was >98% pure and ready for experimentation. Generation of Raw264.7 Macrophages Expressing src siRNA—To generate cells expressing src siRNA (siRNA) or the nonspecific siRNA (Ctrl), Raw264.7 macrophages were transfected with plasmid DNA pLKO.1-msrc (puro) (targeted sequence: 5′-CGAGCCGCCAATATCCTAGTA-3′) or the negative control pSilencer plasmid (which contains sequences not present in mouse genome and provided by Ambion Inc.) by the Lipofectamine Plus method (Invitrogen) followed by puromycin or hygromycin selection. To generate Src-attenuated cells expressing ectopic Src, Raw264.7 cells expressing src siRNA were cotransfected with pBabe (hygro) DNA and a plasmid DNA encoding avian c-Src (22Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) followed by hygromycin selection. Pretreatment with PP2—Raw264.7 cells (or PEMs) were cultured with PP2 (10 μm) for 30 min prior to the addition of SNAP and 8-Br-cGMP. These SNAP (or 8-Br-cGMP)-stimulated or -nonstimulated cells were then harvested, and their migratory ability was determined. Administration of SNP and 8-Br-cGMP—SNP and 8-Br-cGMP were dissolved in autoclaved phosphate-buffered saline. Rats were injected with SNP (6 mg/kg) (23Lin W. Wei X. Xue H. Kelimu M. Tao R. Song Y. Zhou Z. Mutat. Res. 2000; 466: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or 8-Br-cGMP (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. 48 h after SNP or 8-Br-cGMP injection, PEMs were harvested and analyzed. Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Lysis of the cells was carried out with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffers as described before (24Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Methods for immunoblotting analysis have been described (25Leu T.-H. Yeh H.H. Huang C.-C. Chuang Y.-C. Su S.L. Maa M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9875-9881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were resolved in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with respective antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detected by Enhanced Chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, lysates of interest were immunoprecipitated with Src or Hck antibody as described previously (24Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—The amount of src and gapdh transcript was semiquantitated by RT-PCR as previously described (26Lee J.C. Maa M.-C. Yu H.-S. Wang J.-H. Yen C.-K. Wang S.-T. Chen Y.-J. Liu Y. Jin Y.-T. Leu T.-H. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 43: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The following program is for both src and gapdh PCR reaction: the cDNA was denatured for 3 min at 95 °C and amplified for 30 cycles under the following conditions: 95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 45 s; followed by a 5-min elongation step at 72 °C. Sequences of primer pairs used were as follows: src: forward, 5′-CTGCTGGACTTTCTCAAGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTACAGAGCAGCTTCAGGGG-3′; gapdh: forward, 5′-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′; PCR products were resolved in 2% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Migration—The migration of cells of interest exposed to LPS, SNAP, SNP, or 8-Br-cGMP was determined by using a modified Boyden chamber as described before (27Leu T.-H. Su S.L. Chuang Y.-C. Maa M.-C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells with or without 48-h LPS, SNAP, SNP, or 8-Br-cGMP exposure were added to the upper wells (48-multiwell Boyden microchambers) at 2 × 104 cells per well. The migrated cells will traverse a polycarbonate filter (8 μm) from the upper chamber to the lower chamber, which contains 10% fetal bovine serum as a chemoattractant. After 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab, and the cells that traversed and spread on the lower membrane surface were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa stain (Modified solution, Sigma). By utilizing a microscope with a 40× objective, the number of migratory cells per membrane was enumerated. Four random fields in each filter were examined. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and migration was expressed as the mean ± S.D. of total cells counted per field. The motility of Raw264.7 and its derived Ctrl, siRNA-1, siRNA-1/Src6, siRNA-1/Src15 in response to LPS, and SNAP was also monitored using a Leica AS MDW system equipped with a Coolsnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific). Video images were collected at intervals of 20 min for 3 h. The positions of nuclei were tracked to quantify cell motility and analyzed with Metamorph Software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was performed at least three times. Unless indicated, the results were presented as means ± S.D. from a representative triplicate experiment. The significance of difference was assessed by Student's t test. Bonferronic correction was used for controlling type I error in multiple comparisons. iNOS Participates in LPS-induced Macrophage Migration—Stimulation of macrophages with LPS can provoke a spectrum of cellular activities including cell motility (13Korade-Mirnics Z. Corey S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 603-613PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tanno T. Fujiwara A. Sakaguchi K. Tanaka K. Takenaka S. Tsuyama S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this LPS-mediated migration was inhibited in the presence of 1400W, an iNOS-selective inhibitor (Fig. 1A). To confirm the importance of iNOS in macrophage motility by LPS, the migratory potential of PEMs derived from WT and iNOS–/– mice treated with or without LPS was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1B, compared with WT PEMs, reduced migration evoked by LPS was observed in iNOS null PEMs. This iNOS deficiency caused defect of LPS-induced motility was not due to the general inability of cells to mobilize, because analogues of iNOS downstream mediators, SNAP (a NO donor) and 8-Br-cGMP (a permeable cGMP analogue), could augment the migratory ability of iNOS-deficient macrophages comparable to that in WT macrophages (Fig. 1, C and D). These findings indicate the participation of the NO/cGMP pathway in LPS-mediated macrophage movement. LPS-induced Src Expression in Macrophages Is Sensitive to iNOS- and sGC-selective Inhibitors—In accordance with the participation of SFKs in cell motility, 1400W significantly suppressed LPS-elicited protein tyrosyl phosphorylation and Pi-Tyr-416 of SFKs in Raw264.7 cells (Fig. 2A). To further substantiate the importance of SFKs in cell motility, alteration of tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins and Pi-Tyr-416 of SFKs in WT and iNOS knockout PEMs in response to LPS, SNAP, and 8-Br-cGMP was examined. As shown in Fig. 2B, unlike WT PEMs, LPS failed to increase the content of protein tyrosyl phosphorylation and Pi-Tyr-416 of SFKs in PEMs derived from iNOS null mice (Fig. 2B, left). In addition, these defects did not occur when SNAP and 8-Br-cGMP were used as stimulants (Fig. 2B, right). These data suggested that one or more SFKs might contribute to the macrophage mobilization triggered by the LPS/iNOS pathway. Indeed, while PP2 (an SFK inhibitor) could abolish SNAP and 8-Br-cGMP-induced motility (Fig. 2C), it also reduced SNAP- and 8-Br-cGMP-elevated Pi-Tyr-416 of SFKs in rat PEMs (Fig. 2D). To pinpoint which SFK was required for LPS/iNOS-evoked macrophage migration, the expression of myeloid-specific SFKs (i.e. Lyn, Fgr, and Hck) as well as Src in LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 cells was analyzed. Although the expression of Lyn, Fgr, and Hck was almost unaltered, a significant time-dependent up-regulation of Src was detected (Fig. 3A). Further analysis of the expression profile of the four SFKs in LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 cells revealed that only the expression of Src was labile to 1400W (Fig. 3B). Similarly, compared with the three myeloid-specific Src relatives, only Src was ODQ (a sGC inhibitor)-sensitive (Fig. 3C). These findings suggested that Src might be the SFK critical in LPS/iNOS-elicited macrophage movement.FIGURE 3LPS-mediated Src induction was 1400W and ODQ sensitive.A, Raw264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for various time as indicated. B, Raw264.7 cells were pretreated without or with 1400W (100 μm) for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 48 h. Raw264.7 cells treated with 1400W alone were used as controls. C, Raw264.7 cells were either untreated as control or pretreated with or without ODQ (100 μm) for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 48 h. Equal amounts of lysates (100 μg) from each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Up-regulation of Src in SNAP- and 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated Raw264.7 Cells and Rat Peritoneal Macrophages—Because NO has been implicated in regulating gene expression (29Hemish J. Nakaya N. Mittal V. Enikolopov G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42321-42329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and LPS-mediated Src induction could be impaired by iNOS- and sGC-selective inhibitors, we wondered whether NO as well as cGMP might directly augment Src expression in macrophages. To address this, Raw264.7 cells were stimulated with 100 μm SNAP for various time points. As exhibited in Fig. 4A, compared with the constant expression of actin, a time-dependent up-regulation of Src was observed in SNAP-treated macrophages. Similar results were also obtained in Raw264.7 cells treated with another NO donor, SNP (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that NO-elevated Src expression is an in vitro artifact that only occurs in Raw264.7 cells, thioglycolate-elicited PEMs were utilized to address this issue. Similar Src induction could also be detected in PEMs after SNAP and SNP exposure (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Next, we utilized 8-Br-cGMP to stimulate both Raw264.7 cells and PEMs and studied its effect on Src expression. As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, a time-dependent increase of Src was also detected. Notably, up-regulation of Src did occur in PEMs recovered from SNP- and 8-Br-cGMP-challenged rats. These PEMs also exhibited an increased migratory potential as compared with those recovered from rats challenged with phosphate-buffered saline (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, the induction of Src by the NO/cGMP signaling pathway was confirmed. Further RT-PCR analysis utilizing specific primers for src revealed that LPS, SNAP, and 8-Br-cGMP led to an increase in the expected 273-bp fragment, whereas AG (another iNOS inhibitor) and ODQ abrogated its enhancement initiated by LPS (Fig. 4C). These findings implied that iNOS as well as sGC were involved in LPS-augmented Src expression, and this NO/cGMP-mediated increase in Src expression could be partly attributable to the increment of src transcript. LPS-, but Not SNAP- or 8-Br-cGMP-induced Src Expression Is Abrogated in iNOS Knockout Macrophages—To confirm that Src induction by LPS is iNOS-dependent, the expression of Src and its myeloid relatives in WT and iNOS–/– macrophages in the presence or absence of LPS was examined. As exhibited in Fig. 5A, concurrent with the absence of iNOS, diminished expression of Src (but not the myeloid-specific SFKs) was observed in LPS-stimulated PEMs devoid of iNOS. Interestingly, the expression of Src in iNOS null PEMs could be restored by SNAP and 8-Br-cGMP to a level comparable to that detected in WT PEMs (Fig. 5B). Again, the expression of Lyn in WT and iNOS–/– PEMs was not affected. Thus, our results further bolstered the up-regulation of Src by NO/cGMP pathway in LPS-exposed macrophages. Src Attenuation Reduces LPS/iNOS-elicited Macrophage Migration—Because SFKs were required for NO/cGMP-induced motility (Fig. 2, C and D), and there was a concomitant up-regulation of Src in LPS-, SNAP-, and 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated macrophages (Figs. 3, 4, 5); therefore, Src could be the main SFK required for macrophage locomotion. To prove this hypothesis, nonspecific and src-specific siRNA-bearing plasmids were introduced into Raw264.7 macrophages to obtain the corresponding control (Ctrl-1 and -2) and siRNA (siRNA-1 and -2) cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, remarkable Src induction was observed in parental and control but not in Src-attenuated Raw264.7 following 48-h LPS (Fig. 6A) and SNAP (Fig. 6B) stimulation. Notably, like parental and control cells, the expression of Lyn, Fgr, and Hck was not significantly altered in Src-attenuated cells in the presence or absence of LPS and SNAP. Further analysis of the mobility of these cells by Transwell assay, we observed that LPS- and SNAP-induced cell motility was significantly suppressed. To verify this result, we performed a rescue experiment. By time-lapse microscopy, reduced LPS-, and SNAP-mediated macrophage migration was observed in Src-attenuated (siRNA-1) cells, which could be restored by ectopic Src (Fig. 7). Similar results were observed in siRNA-2 and its derived Src-expressing cells (data not shown). Thus, the pivotal role of Src in macrophage movement elicited by LPS/iNOS pathway was confirmed.FIGURE 7Ectopic Src could restore migration in LPS- and SNAP-exposed Src-attenuated macrophages. The generation of siRNA-1 cells harboring plasmid-encoding avian Src (i.e. siRNA-1/Src6 and siRNA-1/Src15) was described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells of interest were stimulated without or with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. A, equal amounts of lysates (100 μg) from each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies as indicated. Movements of cells treated without or with LPS (100 ng/ml) (B) and SNAP (100 μm)(C) for 24 h were monitored by time-lapse video microscopy and tracked at 20-min intervals over a span of 3 h (B, top). Motility was calculated as velocity (μm/3 h) using image processing software as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data from three fields of cells (>20 cells/field) were collected and calculated in each cell line, and results were means ± S.D. of a representative experiment (bottom). ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Src Is the Main SFK Responsible for FAK Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861 in LPS-treated Macrophages—In addition to analysis of the protein expression of SFKs in LPS-exposed macrophages, we further analyzed the level Pi-Tyr-416 (an indicator of active SFKs) and Pi-Tyr-527 (an indicator of inactive SFKs) of Src relative to that of Hck in Raw 264.7 cells before and after LPS stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W1984623012,"Subunit a plays a key role in promoting H+ transport and the coupled rotary motion of the subunit c ring in F1F0-ATP synthase. H+ binding and release occur at Asp-61 in the middle of the second transmembrane helix (TMH) of F0 subunit c. H+ are thought to reach Asp-61 via aqueous pathways mapping to the surfaces of TMHs 2-5 of subunit a. TMH4 of subunit a is thought to pack close to TMH2 of subunit c based upon disulfide cross-link formation between Cys substitutions in both TMHs. Here we substituted Cys into the fifth TMH of subunit a and the second TMH of subunit c and tested for cross-linking using bis-methanethiosulfonate (bis-MTS) reagents. A total of 62 Cys pairs were tested and 12 positive cross-links were identified with variable alkyl length linkers. Cross-linking was achieved near the middle of the bilayer for the Cys pairs a248C/c62C, a248C/ c63C, a248C/c65C, a251C/c57C, a251C/c59C, a251C/c62C, a252C/c62C, and a252C/c65C. Cross-linking was achieved near the cytoplasmic side of the bilayer for Cys pairs a262C/c53C, a262C/c54C, a262C/c55C, and a263C/c54C. We conclude that both aTMH4 and aTMH5 pack proximately to cTMH2 of the c-ring. In other experiments we demonstrate that aTMH4 and aTMH5 can be simultaneously cross-linked to different subunit c monomers in the c-ring. Five mutants showed pH-dependent cross-linking consistent with aTMH5 changing conformation at lower pH values to facilitate cross-linking. We suggest that the pH-dependent conformational change may be related to the proposed role of aTMH5 in gating H+ access from the periplasm to the cAsp-61 residue in cTMH2."
https://openalex.org/W2026758702,"Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) and the C5a receptor (C5aR) are key effectors of the acute inflammatory response to IgG immune complexes (IC). Their coordinated activation is critical in IC-induced diseases, although the significance of combined signaling by these two different receptor classes in tissue injury is unclear. Here we used the mouse model of the passive reverse lung Arthus reaction to define their requirements for distinct phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activities in vivo. We show that genetic deletion of class IB PI3Kgamma abrogates C5aR signaling that is crucial for FcgammaR-mediated activation of lung macrophages. Thus, in PI3Kgamma(-/-) mice, IgG IC-induced FcgammaR regulation, cytokine release, and neutrophil recruitment were blunted. Notably, however, C5a production occurred normally in PI3Kgamma(-/-) mice but was impaired in PI3Kdelta(-/-) mice. Consequently, class IA PI3Kdelta deficiency caused resistance to acute IC lung injury. These results demonstrate that PI3Kgamma and PI3Kdelta coordinate the inflammatory effects of C5aR and FcgammaR and define PI3Kdelta as a novel and essential element of FcgammaR signaling in the generation of C5a in IC disease."
https://openalex.org/W2019779418,"The calcium binding S100A8/A9 complex (MRP8/14; calgranulin) is considered as an important proinflammatory mediator in acute and chronic inflammation and has recently gained attention as a molecular marker up-regulated in various human cancers. Here, we report that S100A8/A9 is expressed in breast cancer cell lines and is up-regulated by interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells. We identified the phospholipid-binding protein annexin A6 as a potential S100A8/A9 binding protein by affinity chromatography. This finding was verified by Southwestern overlay experiments and by coimmunoprecipitation with the S100A8/A9-specific monoclonal antibody 27E10. Immunocytochemical experiments demonstrated that S100A8/A9 and annexin A6 colocalize in SKBR3 breast cancer cells predominantly in membranous structures. Upon calcium influx both S100A8/A9 and annexin A6 are exposed on the cell surface of SKBR3 cells. Subcellular fractionation studies suggested that after A23187 stimulation membrane association of S100A8/A9 is not enhanced. However, both S100A8/A9 and annexin A6 are exposed on the cell surface of SKBR3 cells upon calcium influx. Experiments with artificial liposomes indicated that S100A8/A9 is able to associate with membranes independently of both annexin A6 and independently of calcium. Finally, cell surface expression of S100A8/A9 could not be observed in A23187-treated A431 and HaCaT cells. Both cell lines are known to be devoid of annexin A6. Repression of annexin A6 expression by small interfering RNA in SKBR3 cells abolishes the cell surface exposition of S100A8/A9 upon calcium influx, suggesting that annexin A6 contributes to the calcium-dependent cell surface exposition of the membrane associated-S100A8/A9 complex.

S100A8/A9 (MRP8/14; calgranulin) was originally discovered as immunogenic protein expressed and specifically released from neutrophils. Subsequently, it has emerged as a proinflammatory marker protein in many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Additionally, increased S100A8 and S100A9 levels have also been detected in various human cancers as breast and prostate cancer (1Gebhardt C. Németh J. Angel P. Hess J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 2Celis J.E. Gromova I. Gromov P. Moreira J.M. Cabezón T. Friis E. Rank F.

Although a number of putative functions have been proposed for S100A8/A9, its biological role particularly in cancer cells remains to be defined. Its expression pattern in inflammation and in cancer suggests that S100A8/A9 play a prominent role in inflammation-associated cancer. S100A8 and -A9 are constitutively expressed in myeloid cells. They are secreted by activated myeloid cells by a so far unidentified mechanism, and elevated sera levels have been found in patients suffering from several inflammatory disorders (3Foell D. Frosch M. Sorg C. Roth J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2004; 344: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In search for an extracellular function of the S100A8/A9 protein complex a number of interaction partners or receptors have been identified. Robinson et al. (2002) (4Robinson M.J. Tessier P. Poulsom R. Hogg N. J. Biol.

Kerkhoff et al. (5Kerkhoff C. Sorg C. Tandon N.N. Nacken W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) identified the FAT/CD36 as a receptor facilitating the uptake of the arachidonic acid bound to S100A8/A9. Furthermore, S100A8 has been shown to interact with TLR4, amplifying phagocyte activation during sepsis (6Vogl T. Tenbrock K. Ludwig S. Leukert N. Ehrhardt C. van Zoelen M.A. Nacken W.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been proposed to serve as cellular receptor of S100A8 and -A9, thereby mediating some of the activities described (12Herold K. Moser B. Chen Y. Zeng S. Yan S.F. Ramasamy R. Emond J. Clynes R. Schmidt A.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 82: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for a physical interaction of RAGE and S100A8/A9 has not been shown so far. Intracellularly, the S100 proteins are considered as calcium sensors, changing their conformation in response to calcium influx and then mediating the calcium signal by binding to other intracellular proteins. In migrating monocytes the S100A8/A9 complex has been found to be associated with cytoskeletal tubulin and to modulate transendothelial migration (13Vogl T. Ludwig S. Goebeler M. Strey A. Thorey I.S. Reichelt R. Foell D. Gerke V. Manitz M.P. Nacken W. Werner S. Sorg C. Roth J. Blood. 2004; 104: 4260-4268Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found that S100A8/A9 promotes NADPH oxidase activation by interaction with components of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase multienzyme complex (14Berthier S. Paclet M.H. Lerouge S.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two reasons prompted us to search for additional intracellular molecular targets of S100A8/A9 in breast cancer cells. First, beside their expression in myeloid cells, S100A8 and S100A9 are expressed under cancerous conditions in glandular epithelial tissues, and they are overexpressed in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (1Gebhardt C. Németh J. Angel P. Hess J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 2Celis J.E. Gromova I. Gromov P. Moreira J.M. Cabezón T. Friis E. Rank F. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2935-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mammalian cancer cells, however, have neither the high migratory potential of monocytes nor produce high amounts of reactive oxygen species as neutrophils, suggesting that the two S100 proteins may have a different intracellular function(s) in cancerous cells. Second, although most of S100A8/A9 resides in the cytoplasm, part of the proteins is associated with cellular membranes (17van den Bos C. Roth J. Koch H.G. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nacken W. Sorg C. Kerkhoff C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). So far nothing is known about interacting partners of the membrane-associated S100A8/A9. As mentioned above, besides myeloid cells, S100A8 and -A9 are expressed in cancerous cells of secretory tissues as breast and prostate. Cells originating from such glandular tissues are rich in membrane structures, suggesting that membrane-associated molecular targets for the S100A8/A9 proteins could be potentially found in these cells. Therefore, we used breast cancer cells to search for further molecular partners interacting with S100A8/A9. Here, we report that the phospholipid-binding protein annexin A6 is a potential molecular interacting partner of the S100A8/A9 complex. The interaction with annexin A6 links S100A8/A9 to membrane-related cellular events. Cell Culture and Cytokines—Breast cancer SKBR 3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 cells as well as keratinocyte like A431 cells and HaCaT cells were provided by the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkultur). All cell lines except MCF-7 were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium according to standard procedures. MCF-7 cells were propagated in RPMI1640 medium. IL-1β 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; RT, reverse transcriptase; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and tumor necrosis factor-α were purchased from Tebu/Preprotech. A23187 was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant Proteins—Generation and purification of recombinant S100 proteins are described elsewhere (18Nacken W. Sorg C. Kerkhoff C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding annexin A6 was amplified from pC3AnxA6 (provided by V. Gerke) via PCR and subcloned into pQE32. Expression of recombinant His-tagged annexin A6 in Escherichia coli carrying pQE32AnxA6 was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The annexin A6 containing E. coli lysate was used for Southwestern analysis. Purified recombinant annexin A6 was insoluble in physiological buffers and was not used for further studies. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Southwestern Analysis—SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed according to standard procedures and developed using the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-annexin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (annexin VI sc-1931; annexin II sc-30757). For Southwestern overlay analysis, three blots were incubated in Tris-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin. Two membranes were incubated with either S100A8/A9 or S100A9 protein (10 μg/ml in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 4 h at room temperature as indicated. Membranes were washed (4 × 5 min) with Tris-buffered saline in the presence of 0.2 mm CaCl2 and incubated with primary antibody. Membranes were washed again (4 × 5 min) with Tris-buffered saline in the presence of 0.2 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-(rabbit IgG)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Finally, membranes were washed (4 × 5 min) with Tris-buffered saline in the presence of 0.2 mm CaCl2, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. A third blot was stained with the annexin A6 antibody to verify the identity of annexin A6. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated according the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). For real-time RT-PCR, RNA from every experiment was analyzed in duplicate. cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA using reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas). Primers were designed using the Primer Express software package (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and obtained from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The procedures and conditions for real-time RT-PCR using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) were the same as described elsewhere (19Viemann D. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Klimmek K. Sorg C. Ludwig S. Roth J. Blood. 2004; 103: 3365-3373Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Gene expression was normalized with respect to the endogenous housekeeping control gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Affinity Chromatography—Affinity purification was performed according to Koltzscher et al. (20Koltzscher M. Neumann C. König S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, an affinity column was generated by immobilization of His-tagged S100A8/A9 protein on Ni-NTA-agarose. Five milligrams of purified, His-tagged S100A8 and His-S100A9, respectively, were dissolved in buffer C (30 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β mercaptoethanol, Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture “Complete,” EDTA-free, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and added to 2 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose equilibrated in the same buffer. The Ni-NTA-agarose/S100A protein slurries were then transferred to 10-ml polypropylene columns (Pierce) and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer C to remove unbound protein. A SKBR3 lysate was prepared in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, Complete medium, EDTA-free, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and cleared by subsequent centrifugation with 1,000 and 10,000 × g. The lysate was preincubated with equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose to eliminate unspecifically binding proteins. Before loading and while gentle stirring, CaCl2 was added carefully to the preincubated cell lysate to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. The preincubated SKBR3 lysate was then loaded onto the chromatography column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer C and finally with 10 column volumes buffer C1 (same as buffer C but with 0.7 mm EGTA instead of 0.7 mm CaCl2) to elute the potential interaction partners. Fractions were collected throughout, and aliquots were analyzed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. MALDI-TOF Analysis and Data Base Searches—MALDI-TOF analysis and data base search were performed as described earlier (20Koltzscher M. Neumann C. König S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, after SDS-PAGE the gel slice containing the protein band was excised, destained in 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% methanol, and washed in acetic acid/methanol/water (10/45/45, v/v/v) for 30 min and subsequently in water for 30 min. It was then shrunken in acetonitrile and dried. After trypsin digestion (Roche Applied Science) the peptide-containing supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube, and peptides were extracted 3 times with 70 μl of acetonitrile/water/formic acid (50/45/5, v/v/v). The lyophilized extract was dissolved in 7 μl of water/acetonitrile (95/5, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoric acid (Merck) and purified using ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Peptides were eluted with 8 μl of acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous trifluoric acid (70/30 v/v). For matrix preparation, 10 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) were washed with acetone and dissolved in 1 ml of 49.5/49.5/1 (v/v/v) acetonitrile, ethanol, 0.1% aqueous trifluoric acid. 0.5 μl of this matrix preparation was spotted onto the target followed by the same amount of peptide sample, and both solutions were mixed directly on the target for MALDI peptide mapping on TofSpec 2E (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). Digests were run in positive ion reflectron mode using a matrix suppression of 500. Masses were externally calibrated and internally corrected using the lock mass option of the instrument providing m/z values better than 50 ppm up to m/z 2500. Nanospray-tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides was performed using iontrap (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and quadrupole-TOF (Micromass). Data base searches were performed as described earlier (20Koltzscher M. Neumann C. König S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using available to the public via the internet. Coimmunoprecipitation—The S100A8/A9 heterodimer-specific monoclonal antibody 27E10 was purified from hybridoma supernatants using protein G-coupled Sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitation experiments were performed according to Kerkhoff et al. (21Kerkhoff C. Klempt M. Kaever V. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32672-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of the cell supernatants were subjected to preadsorption by incubation for 1 h after the addition of 100 μl/ml rabbit IgG (Calbiochem) followed by incubation for 1 h after the addition of 100 μl/ml protein G-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, 1 μg/ml nonspecific mouse IgG1 or 1 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 27E10 were added to the supernatants and incubated for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose (30 μl/ml) was added, and samples were further incubated for 1 h. Sepharose was collected by centrifugation, and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were resuspended in SDS loading buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed in calcium containing buffer (0.5 mm CaCl2). Immunocytochemistry—Cells fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After quenching in 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated in PBS supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with a rabbit anti S100A9 and a goat anti-annexin A6 antibody (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-1931) for 30 min and washed 3 times with PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, primary antibodies against annexin A6 and S100A9 were stained with Cy5- and Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively, or with Alexa594- and Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), respectively. Finally, cells were washed 3 times with PBS, once with distilled H2O, mounted in Mowiol, and analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany; LSM 510). Subcellular Fractionation—SKBR3 cells were Dounce-homogenized in ice-cold MES buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, complete protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science). Subsequently total cell lysates were differentially centrifuged at 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets and the final supernatant were harvested after the centrifugation steps and analyzed via Western blotting. Preparation of Endosomes—After cell lysis the homogenate was centrifuged, and the postnuclear supernatant served as a crude membrane extract. Early and late endosomes were prepared as described elsewhere (22de Diego I. Schwartz F. Siegfried H. Dauterstedt P. Heeren J. Beisiegel U. Enrich C. Grewal T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32187-32194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, post-nuclear supernatant was brought to a final 40.2% sucrose (w/v) concentration by adding 80% sucrose (3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and 35, 25, 16, and 10% sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged for 90 min at 35,000 rpm, 4 °C in a swing out Beckman SW40 rotor. After centrifugation, 1-ml fractions were collected from top to bottom, and the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Lipid Raft Fractionation Using a Sucrose Gradient—107 SKBR3 cells were incubated in MES buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors) containing 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 20 min and then homogenized using a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes). The homogenates (corresponding to 3 × 107 cells) were then adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of an equal volume of an 80% sucrose solution prepared in the above buffer but lacking Triton X-100, placed in the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes, and then overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient of 4 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose and 4 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose, both prepared in MES buffer lacking Triton X-100. The samples were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm (200,000 × g) in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 16–20 h, fractionated into 1-ml fractions sequentially from the top of the gradient, and concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were dissolved in denaturing Laemmli loading buffer. Equal quantities of each fraction were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed according to standard procedures and developed using the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Artificial Liposomes—Lipid vesicles were prepared by dissolving 30 mg of lipids of the liposome kit from Sigma (L4395) in chloroform and subsequent evaporation of the solvent under N2. MES buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, complete protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science) were added to the dried lipids. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by sonification of the hydrated lipids (suspended in buffer) with a Branson sonicator for at least 8 min on ice or until the suspension became opaque. Liposomes were subsequently incubated with a cell lysates or/and purified S100A8/A9 complex for 15 min at room temperature and were then adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of an equal volume of an 80% sucrose solution, placed in the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes, and then overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (1 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose, 1 ml of 20% sucrose, 1 ml of 10% sucrose, and 1 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose prepared in MES buffer). After centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 16 h, the samples were fractionated into 1-ml fractions sequentially from the top of the gradient and concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The fractions were loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel, and S100 proteins were detected by Western blotting. Small Interfering RNA Transfection—SKBR3 cells were transfected with annexinA6 small interfering RNA (Santa Cruz; sc-29688) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) or Hyperfect (Qiagen) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's protocols. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested. Part of the cells were lysed, an aliquot of the sample was loaded on a SDS-PAGE, and the remaining cells were used for further FACS analysis. Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometry, cells (5 × 105) were incubated in 150 μl of PBS, 1% fetal calf serum with the indicated antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in 1 ml of PBS, 1% fetal calf serum. Then a 1 μg/ml concentration of secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min on ice. Finally, cells were washed twice, resuspended in 500 μlof PBS, 1% fetal calf serum, and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with CellQuestPro software (BD Pharmingen). IgG1 was used as isotype control for the monoclonal antibody 27E10. S100A8/A9 Are Expressed in Breast Cancer Cell Lines—First, we investigated the expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in various breast cancer cell lines by Western blots and quantitative RT-PCR. Using Western blot analysis in MCF-7 cells, both proteins were hardly detected; in SKBR3 cells a moderate level of expression was found, and in MDA-MB-468 both proteins were highly expressed in comparison to the other two cell lines. These results were verified by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). However, the expression of both S100 proteins in breast cancer cells is at least 10-fold lower compared with that of granulocytes (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we found that IL-1β (Figs. 1C and 5) and tumor necrosis factor-α (data not shown) up-regulate the expression of both S100 genes in MCF-7 as well as in SKBR3 cells but not in MDA-MB-468 cells.FIGURE 5Subcellular fractionation.A, SKBR3 cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation. 1000 × g, nuclear pellet; 10,000 × g, organelle pellet; 100,000 × g, cell membrane pellet. The distribution of S100A9, annexin A2, and annexin A6 was independent of A23187-mediated calcium influx. IL-1β-dependent up-regulation of S100A9 in SKBR3 cells resulted in the detection of S100A9 in all fractions, confirming that part of the S100 proteins resides in membranes. A23187-induced calcium influx did not redistribute S100A8/A9 to cell membranes. B, the subcellular distribution of S100A9 was identical in A431 cells, which are considered as annexin A6 negative cells. However, minute amounts of annexin A6 were detected in the cytosolic supernatant. S100A9 was mainly located in the cytosolic fraction. However, after up-regulation with IL-1β, it was also localized in membranous fractions. 1000 × gP, nuclear pellet; 10,000 × gP, organelle pellet; 100,000 × gP, cell membrane pellet; 100,000 × gSN, cytosolic supernatant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Annexin A6 as a Potential S100A8/A9 Interacting Protein—For further experiments we decided to work with the moderately S100-expressing SKBR3 cells. Cleared lysates from SKBR3 cells were applied to S100A8/A9 affinity chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, a protein of ∼70 kDa in size was eluted from the S100A8/A9 affinity column using a calcium-free elution buffer. The experiment was repeated three times, and this protein species was eluted in all of the experiments. Other proteins that have also been eluted from the affinity column could only be isolated in one or two of the set of three experiments conducted. The 70-kDa protein band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and subjected to MALDI-mass spectrometry for peptide mass fingerprint. The data obtained were analyzed using Swissprot and NCBI databases. The identified protein was annexin A6. To confirm these data we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the S100A8/A9 hetero-oligomer-specific monoclonal 27E10 antibody. A SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 cell lysate was incubated with 27E10, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. A 70-kDa protein band was recognized by an anti annexin A6 antibody (Fig. 2B). Annexin A6 is also present in neutrophilic granulocytes. However, because of the high expression of S100A8/A9 in granulocytes there is a massive molar excess of S100A8/A9 compared with the annexin A6 (Fig. 1). We asked whether S100A8/A9 is bound to annexin A6 in granulocytes. Using a granulocyte lysate, the 27E10 antibody precipitates a 55-kDa protein species that was recognized by anti-annexin A6 antibody (data not shown). As shown earlier (24Nacken W. Kerkhoff C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5127-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), mild proteolytic digestion of annexin A6 in granulocyte lysate results in a 55-kDa band that is recognized by the annexin A6 antibody. Various protease inhibitors tested did not prevent the degradation in the granulocyte lysate. Thus, the 55-kDa protein might be regarded as a degradation product of the granulocytic annexin A6. We then performed overlay/Southwestern experiments to further confirm the interaction of S100A8/A9 with annexin A6. As shown in Fig. 2C, the S100A8/A9 complex binds to the blotted recombinant annexin A6. Neither S100A8 (data not shown) nor S100A9 (Fig. 2C) alone was bound to annexin A6 under the conditions used, suggesting that solely the hetero-oligomeric S100A8/A9 complex specifically interacts with annexin A6. Taken together we conclude from these data that annexin A6 is an interaction partner of the S100A8/A9 complex. S100A8/A9 and Annexin A6 Colocalize Particularly in Membranes of the SKBR3 Cells—Next, double fluorescence immunocytochemical analysis was used to examine the localization of S100A9 and annexin A6 in SKBR3 cells (Fig. 3). S100A9 expression is shown as green fluorescence in cytoplasm and membranes (Fig. 3, left panels). Annexin A6 expression is shown as red or blue fluorescence (Fig. 3, middle panels). The overlapping images (Fig. 3, right panels) revealed evidence for the colocalization of S100A9 and annexin A6 particularly in the cell membranes. Annexins are well known to be associated with membrane-related events as endocytosis and exocytosis. Therefore, we prepared endosomes from SKBR3 cells and analyzed them. As shown in Fig. 4A, S100A8/A9 and annexin A6 are present in both early and late"
https://openalex.org/W2035225414,"Background Insecticide-impregnated bed nets (ITNs) have been shown to be a highly effective tool against malaria in the endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There are however different opinions about the role of ITN social marketing and ITN free distribution in the roll-out of ITN programmes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of free ITN distribution through antenatal care services in addition to an ITN social marketing programme in an area typical for rural SSA. Methods A cluster-randomised controlled ITN trial took place in the whole Kossi Province in north-western Burkina Faso, an area highly endemic for malaria. Twelve clusters were assigned to long-term ITN (Serena brand) social marketing plus free ITN (Serena brand) distribution to all pregnant women attending governmental antenatal care services (group A), and 13 clusters to ITN social marketing only (group B). The intervention took place during the rainy season of 2006 and thereafter. The trial was evaluated through a representative household survey at baseline and after one year. Serena ITN household ownership was the primary outcome measure. Findings A total of 1052 households were visited at baseline in February 2006 and 1050 at follow-up in February 2007. Overall Serena ITN household ownership increased from 16% to 28% over the study period, with a significantly higher increase in group A (13% to 35%) than in group B (18% to 23%) (p<0.001). Interpretation The free distribution of ITNs to pregnant women through governmental antenatal care services in addition to ITN social marketing substantially improved ITN household ownership in rural Burkina Faso.

https://openalex.org/W1993201131,"Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) may be involved in the biotransformation of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), and the inactivation of ALDH2 by GTN may contribute to the phenomenon of nitrate tolerance. We studied the GTN-induced inactivation of ALDH2 by UV/visible absorption spectroscopy. Dehydrogenation of acetaldehyde and hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylacetate (p-NPA) were both inhibited by GTN. The rate of inhibition increased with the GTN concentration and decreased with the substrate concentration, indicative of competition between GTN and the substrates. Inactivation of p-NPA hydrolysis was greatly enhanced in the presence of NAD(+), and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of NADH. In the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) inactivation of ALDH2 was much slower. Dihydrolipoic acid (LPA-H(2)) was less effective than DTT, whereas glutathione, cysteine, and ascorbate did not protect against inactivation. When DTT was added after complete inactivation, dehydrogenase reactivation was quite modest (< or =16%). The restored dehydrogenase activity correlated inversely with the GTN concentration but was hardly affected by the concentrations of acetaldehyde or DTT. Partial reactivation of dehydrogenation was also accomplished by LPA-H(2) but not by GSH. We conclude that, in addition to the previously documented reversible inhibition by GTN that can be ascribed to the oxidation of the active site thiol, there is an irreversible component to ALDH inactivation. Importantly, ALDH2-catalyzed GTN reduction was partly inactivated by preincubation with GTN, suggesting that the inactivation of GTN reduction is also partly irreversible. These observations are consistent with a significant role for irreversible inactivation of ALDH2 in the development of nitrate tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2024313944,"Boston-type craniosynostosis is caused by a single amino acid substitution, P148H, in the transcription factor MSX2. The increased binding affinity of MSX2 (P148H) to the response element has led many to hypothesize that the substitution is a gain-of-function mutation. However, there have been conflicting reports on the function of MSX2, and by extension, the nature of the P148H mutation remains unclear. In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanism of MSX2 function and the nature of the P148H mutation. During cranial suture closure of rodent, Msx2 expression was detected in the suture space. Overexpression of wild type MSX2 in mesenchymal cells stimulated cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression, whereas P148H mutant did not. These results indicated that MSX2 is involved in maintaining the suture space by stimulating suture mesenchymal cell proliferation and that P148H is defective in this process. The protein levels of P148H were lower than wild type Msx2 (Msx2-WT), and pulse-chase experiments indicated that the mutant protein has a shorter half-life than the Msx2-WT protein. The ubiquitylation level of P148H was greater than that of Msx2-WT. The degradation of Msx2 was mediated by Praja1, and the P148H mutant was degraded more effectively than WT. The ubiquitylation of Msx2-WT was higher in the presence of Msx2 (P148H), which indicated that P148H functions as a dominant-negative mutant. Collectively, the primary function of MSX2 in suture closure is the induction of cell proliferation and suture maintenance, and the mutation results in an increased susceptibility of both wild type and mutant MSX2 to proteasomal degradation. Boston-type craniosynostosis is caused by a single amino acid substitution, P148H, in the transcription factor MSX2. The increased binding affinity of MSX2 (P148H) to the response element has led many to hypothesize that the substitution is a gain-of-function mutation. However, there have been conflicting reports on the function of MSX2, and by extension, the nature of the P148H mutation remains unclear. In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanism of MSX2 function and the nature of the P148H mutation. During cranial suture closure of rodent, Msx2 expression was detected in the suture space. Overexpression of wild type MSX2 in mesenchymal cells stimulated cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression, whereas P148H mutant did not. These results indicated that MSX2 is involved in maintaining the suture space by stimulating suture mesenchymal cell proliferation and that P148H is defective in this process. The protein levels of P148H were lower than wild type Msx2 (Msx2-WT), and pulse-chase experiments indicated that the mutant protein has a shorter half-life than the Msx2-WT protein. The ubiquitylation level of P148H was greater than that of Msx2-WT. The degradation of Msx2 was mediated by Praja1, and the P148H mutant was degraded more effectively than WT. The ubiquitylation of Msx2-WT was higher in the presence of Msx2 (P148H), which indicated that P148H functions as a dominant-negative mutant. Collectively, the primary function of MSX2 in suture closure is the induction of cell proliferation and suture maintenance, and the mutation results in an increased susceptibility of both wild type and mutant MSX2 to proteasomal degradation. Msx2 was originally identified as a homolog of the Drosophila muscle segment homeobox gene msh and is one of the major molecular switch proteins in osteoblast differentiation (1Ryoo H.M. Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 366: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The expression of Msx2 is specifically induced during vertebrate embryonic development in regions of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction (2Liu Y.H. Ma L. Wu L.Y. Luo W. Kundu R. Sangiorgi F.

There have been controversial reports in the literature on the molecular mechanism of Msx2 function in craniofacial bone formation. Several studies have shown that Msx2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of bone marker genes through interactions with other homeodomain proteins, as well as components of the core transcription complex (9Zhang H.

Msx2 is required for osteoblast differentiation and has been shown to suppress the gene promoters of the major bone maker genes alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and Runx2-II in cell culture systems (9Zhang H.

In addition to the transcriptional repression of bone marker genes, Msx2 also inhibits the function of key osteogenic regulators, such as Runx2, Dlx3, and Dlx5, through the DNA binding-independent protein-protein interactions and/or the binding competition on the same DNA sequences (9Zhang H.

Moreover, Msx2 expression is higher in periodontal ligament and tendon cells than in osteoblastic cells (16Yoshizawa T. Takizawa F. Iizawa F. Ishibashi O. Kawashima H. Matsuda A. Endo N. Kawashima H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3460-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which suggests that Msx2 functions in a molecular defense capacity to prevent the ossification of the periodontal space. These results implicate Msx2 in the negative regulation of osteogenesis. On the other hand, studies have implicated Msx2 as a positive regulator of osteogenesis. Transient transduction studies using a retroviral expression system have shown that Msx2 suppresses the adiopogenic differentiation of aortic myofibroblast cells through the inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (17Cheng S.L.

In addition, Msx2 has been shown to promote cardiovascular calcification through the activation of paracrine Wnt signal (18Towler D.A. Shao J.S. Cheng S.L. Pingsterhaus J.M. Loewy A.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1068: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Shao J.S. Cheng S.L. Pingsterhaus J.M. Charlton-Kachigian N. Loewy A.P. Towler D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1210-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These results implicate Msx2 in the promotion of osteogenic differentiation. Molecular genetic studies of Msx2 have shown that it is essential for normal suture closure and skull mineralization. Msx2 knock-out mice exhibit multiple abnormalities, such as persistent calvarial foramen, defective endochondral bone formation, and defective organogenesis in tooth, hair follicle, and mammary gland (8Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Partial deletion mutations of MSX2 cause parietal foramina in humans (20Wang J.C. Steinraths M. Dang L. Lomax B. Eydoux P. Stockley T. Yong S.L. Van Allen M.I. Am. J. Med. Genet.

Some MSX2 trisomy patients also exhibit craniosynostosis, which indicates that the function of Msx2 is conserved in human (20Wang J.C. Steinraths M. Dang L. Lomax B. Eydoux P. Stockley T. Yong S.L.

A. 2004; 128: 214-216Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies of Msx2 transgenic mice, which exhibit suture overgrowth and overlap without suture, have indicated that the mechanism of premature suture closure in these mice is due to a specific incremental increase in osteogenic cell proliferation (22Liu Y.H. Tang Z. Kundu R.K. Wu L. Luo W. Zhu D. Sangiorgi F. Snead M.L. Maxson R.E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Dodig M. Tadic T. Kronenberg M.S. Dacic S. Liu Y.H. Maxson R. Rowe D.W. Lichtler A.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that Msx2 is a major regulator of the proliferation of Msx2-expressing osteoprogenitor cells and subsequent osteoblast differentiation. Boston-type craniosynostosis is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in the premature fusion of calvarial bones, which leads to defects in skull and brain development (24Warman M.L. Mulliken J.B. Hayward P.G. Muller U. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 46: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Liu Y.H. Kundu R. Wu L. Luo W. Ignelzi Jr., M.A. Snead M.L. Maxson Jr., R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6137-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The underlying mutation in Boston-type craniosynostosis is a single amino acid substitution in MSX2, P148H (26Jabs E.W. Muller U. Li X. Ma L. Luo W. Haworth I.S. Klisak I. Sparkes R. Warman M.L. Mulliken J.B. Snead M.L. Maxon R. Cell. 1993; 75: 443-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed recombinant Msx2 (P148H) exhibits a higher affinity than Msx2-WT 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Ub, ubiquitin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CHX, cyclohexamide; En, embryonic day n; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole. for synthetic oligonucleotides that contain a core homeodomain response element (27Ma L. Golden S. Wu L. Maxson R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Based on the increased binding affinity of the mutant protein to DNA and the autosomal dominant transmission pattern of the disease, it has been hypothesized that MSX2 (P148H) is a gain-of-function mutation. However, because of the conflicting reports of MSX2 function in the literature and the resulting ambiguity in the role of MSX2 (i.e. in osteoblast differentiation, cranial suture closure, or cell proliferation), we have re-examined the function of MSX2 and the nature of the MSX2 mutation in Boston-type craniosynostosis. Cell Culture—C2C12, NSC-F5, 293T, SaOS-2, and ROS17/2.8 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Logan, UT) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable C2C12 cell lines were generated by transfection with the indicated expression vectors, followed by selection using G418-containing selection medium. Antibodies—Anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (HA11.3) antibodies were purchased from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2) (anti-FLAG-HRP) and anti-FLAG (M2) antibody-conjugated beads were from Sigma. Anti-cyclin D1, D2, D3, B, and A antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Reagents—For chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, single-stranded DNA and protein G-agarose beads were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. For the nonradioactive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we purchased a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling kit and nonradioactive EMSA detection kit from Pierce. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling and EMSA were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid Construction—All full-length cDNAs were generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3, for FLAG (M2) epitope fusion proteins, or pcDNA3.1, for HA or His6 epitope fusion proteins. All of the fusion proteins were generated as N-terminal epitope fusion proteins. Because there is only a single amino acid difference between mouse Msx2 and human MSX2 (there is a single amino acid deletion in the N terminus of mouse Msx2 as compared with human), we used mouse Msx2 for these experiments. However, we have used human MSX2 amino acid numbering to indicate the Msx2 mutation sites (the corresponding site of the P148H mutation of human MSX2 in mouse Msx2 would be P147H; to avoid confusion, we have maintained the human numbering system for the mouse cDNA). The cDNAs for Msx2, Praja1, and ubiquitin (Ub) from C2C12 cell were ligated into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pFLAG-Msx2-WT, pHA-Msx2-WT, pHis6-Msx2-WT, pHA-Praja1, and pFLAG-Ub. To construct the expression plasmid for green fluorescent protein-conjugated Msx2 (pEGFP-Msx2), a BamHI/XhoI fragment of pFLAG-Msx2 was subcloned into the BglII and XhoI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). For the construction of bacterial expression vectors, BamHI and XhoI fragments of Msx2 and Praja1 were subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pET28a (Novagen), respectively, to generate pGEX-Praja1 and pET-Msx2, respectively. The mutant proteins Msx2 (P148H) and Msx2 (R172H) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pFLAG-Msx2-WT as the template and then subcloned into pET 28a and pcDNA3.1, respectively. In Situ Hybridization—Probe preparation (Dlx5 and Msx2), tissue preparation, and in situ hybridization procedures were as described previously (28Park M.H. Shin H.I. Choi J.Y. Nam S.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Calvariae of ICR mice (embryonic days 12.5 and 15.5) were prepared as described previously (29Kim H.J. Rice D.P. Kettunen P.J. Thesleff I. Development. 1998; 125: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess the developing calvaria. The 800-bp rat Dlx5 fragment in pCR2 (Invitrogen) was digested with BamHI or XbaI. The 850-bp murine Msx2 fragment in pSP72 (Invitrogen) was digested with HindIII or BglII. In all three cases, antisense and sense riboprobes were produced by T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, respectively. Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation—The cell lysates were prepared from transfected cells using HEPES lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoblot analysis, 25 μg of whole cell lysate were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and then the proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using a chemiluminescent detection kit. For immunoprecipitation analysis, 500 μg of precleared cell lysate were incubated with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody-conjugated beads or anti-HA antibodies and then incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with constant rotation. The beads were washed extensively five times, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and then boiled at 100 °C for 3 min. Bound proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG-HRP and anti-HA antibodies. In Vivo Ubiquitylation Assay—The cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml MG132. For the analysis of FLAG-Msx2-WT, endogenous Ub was detected using an anti-Ub antibody. For the detection of recombinant Ub, the cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-Ub and an expression vector for the indicated HA- or His-tagged target protein. In vivo ubiquitylation assays were carried out as previously described (30Sasaki A. Masuda Y. Iwai K. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22541-22546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 100 μl of TBS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% SDS), boiled for 5 min, and briefly sonicated. The lysates were diluted with 900 μl of TNX dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and then subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 45 min. Cleared lysate (1 mg) was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies or an in vitro association (pull-down) assay using Ni+-agarose in the presence of 10 mm imidazole. Enriched Ub-conjugated proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-Ub or anti-FLAG-HRP antibodies. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—An in vitro ubiquitylation kit was purchased from BIOMOL, and the assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length recombinant Msx2 and Praja1 were generated using an in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega) as follows. Transcription/translation reactions containing purified RNase-free pET28-Msx2WT, pET28-Msx2 (P148H), and pGEX/Praja1 were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 min. Equal amounts of reaction mixture containing His-Msx2-WT, His-Msx2 (P148H), or glutathione S-transferase-Praja1 were then incubated with recombinant E1, E2, and biotinylated Ub in the presence and absence of the indicated reaction components. Ubiquitylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-biotin antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously (13Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Yoon W.J. Kim J.I. Kim B.G. Hwang Y.S. Wozney J.M. Chi X.Z. Bae S.C. Choi K.Y. Cho J.Y. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35579-35587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 107 cells/dish and then transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-Msx2-WT and FLAG-Msx2 (P148H). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cyclohexamide (CHX), in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for the indicated periods of time. For ChIP analysis, the following PCR primers were designed to amplify nucleotides −715 and −431 (relative to the mRNA cap site at +1) of the mouse Runx2 distal promoter: forward, 5′-AACAGAAGGAAGCAGCCACC; and reverse, 5′-CCACACTCCTGTAAGGTTAAGC. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSAs were performed using a nonradioactive EMSA kit and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling kit from Pierce and synthetic oligonucleotides that corresponded to the D2 region of the Runx2-P1 promoter, as previously described (13Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Yoon W.J. Kim J.I. Kim B.G. Hwang Y.S. Wozney J.M. Chi X.Z. Bae S.C. Choi K.Y. Cho J.Y. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35579-35587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were end-labeled with biotin using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling kit. SaOS-2 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-Msx2-WT and FLAG-Msx2 (P148H), and nuclear extracts were prepared 24 h post-transfection. The nuclear extracts were incubated with labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in the absence or presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA for 20 min at room temperature. For the supershift assay, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature before incubation with the labeled probe. Protein-DNA complexes were separated at 4 °C by 5% SDS-PAGE in the presence of 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA and then analyzed by immunoblot assay. DNA-protein complexes are visualized by the detection of biotin-labeled DNA using anti-biotin antibody. Luciferase Reporter Activity Assay—The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. After overnight culture, the cells were transfected with expression vectors by electroporation using Microporator (Digital Bio Technology). Each transfection assay was performed with 0.2 μg/well of the Dlx5 and Msx2 expression vectors or pcDNA3 and 0.2 μg of the ALP-luciferase reporter vector, ALP-553 (-553 to +81 bp), as previously described (14Kim Y.J. Lee M.H. Wozney J.M. Cho J.Y. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50773-50780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured using the BrightGlo luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Luminescence was recorded on a GloMax®-Multi Detection System (Promega). Cell Proliferation and Differentiation Assays—Proliferation assays were carried out using a cell counting kit (CCK-8, Dojindo, Japan), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate and allowed to incubate for 24 h. When the cells reached exponential growth phase, 10 μl of CCK-8 reagent was added to each well, and the cells were allowed to incubate for 90 min. The absorbance at 450 nm of each well was measured using a plate reader. C2C12 cells were transfected with pFLAG-Msx2-WT or pFLAG-Msx2 (P148H), and total cellular RNA was prepared using a total RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using a Superscript RT kit (Invitrogen), and PCR was carried out using the following primers for the amplification of FLAG and Msx2 sequences: forward, 5′-ACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTCCTGTATCCACGGTGCTCCG-3′. The levels of Msx2 mRNA were normalized to those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and relative mRNA expression levels are presented. Msx2, but Not Msx2 (P148H), Stimulates Cell Proliferation—Previous studies have shown that there are multiple proliferation-related defects in cells of mesenchymal origin in Msx2 knock-out (Msx2-/-) mice (8Satokata I.

Transgenic mice that overexpress Msx2 exhibit craniosynostosis because of the rapid proliferation of mesenchymal cells in osteogenic fronts and the subsequent rapid expansion of tissue. Using in situ hybridization, we found that Msx2 is expressed in the cranial tissue of embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and E15.5 mouse embryos (Fig. 1A). Msx2 mRNA expression was strong in the suture mesenchyme, where mesenchymal cells are actively proliferating to maintain suture patency. In coronal sections of E12.5 mouse heads, the expression patterns of Msx2 and Dlx5 did not overlap. Msx2 was expressed in the mesoderm of the primordial calvarium (arrowheads), whereas Dlx5 was expressed in the mesodermal tissue of the mandible (mn), parts of the brain (b), and the mineralizing regions of the calvarium (arrows) (Fig. 1A). At E15.5, the stage at which skull mineralization occurs, Dlx5 mRNA was specifically expressed in the mineralized calvarium (arrows) and maxilla (mx), whereas Msx2 was detected only in the suture mesenchyme (arrowheads) (Fig. 1A). Thus, Msx2 expression was localized predominantly in the suture mesenchyme, and there was no overlap between Dlx5 and Msx2 expression. The observation that Dlx5 was expressed in mineralizing tissue, whereas Msx2 was expressed in as-yet unmineralized, proliferating primordial bone tissue implicates these genes in an antagonistic functional relationship that results in mutually exclusive expression patterns. To determine the functional role of Msx2 in cellular proliferation, we examined the proliferation rate of C2C12 cells that were stably transfected with expression plasmids for Msx2-WT, Msx2 (P148H), antisense Msx2 (AS-Msx2), or Runx2. The rate of proliferation in Msx2-WT-transfected C2C12 cells was 1.8-fold higher than mock transfected cells. The expression of antisense Msx2 resulted in a lower rate of cell proliferation than Msx2-WT, and Runx2 stimulated cell proliferation, although not as strongly as Msx2-WT. The expression of Msx2 (P148H) failed to stimulate cell proliferation. These results indicated that Msx2-WT stimulates cell proliferation and that Msx2 (P148H) is functionally defective in this process. To characterize the cell proliferation defect of Msx2 (P148H), we examined the expression of cyclin proteins in cells that overexpressed WT or mutant Msx2. Previously, it was reported that a cyclin D1/D2/D3 knock-out mouse has severe cell proliferation defects (31Kozar K. Ciemerych M.A. Rebel V.I. Shigematsu H. Zagozdzon A. Sicinska E. Geng Y. Yu Q. Bhattacharya S. Bronson R.T. Akashi K. Sicinski P. Cell. 2004; 118: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The expression of FLAG-Msx2-WT increased the level of cyclin D family proteins in C2C12 cells, whereas FLAG-Msx2 (P148H) did not. Specifically, cyclin D1 and D2 were significantly increased by the expression of Msx2-WT. In cells that expressed mutant Msx2 (P148H), the protein expression of cyclin D family members was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether Msx2 was directly involved in cell division, we examined the expression of Msx2 during cell cycle progression. Endogenous Msx2 mRNA was induced at the G1/S transition in synchronously dividing cells, indicating that the primary role of Msx2 is in cell cycle progression. The induction of Msx2 gene expression in G1/S correlated with increased cyclin levels and the stimulation of cell cycle progression (Fig. 1D). These results suggested that the function of Msx2 is tightly linked to cell proliferation and that premature suture closure in Boston-type craniosynostosis may be due to a proliferation defect in Msx2 (P148H) mutation. This observation is particularly relevant, given that Msx2 is not only highly expressed in the suture mesenchyme in the early stages of craniofacial development but also strongly stimulates the proliferation pools of osteogenic front found in Msx2-transgenic mice. Msx2 (P148H) Is Expressed at a Lower Levels than Wild Type Msx2—During our analysis of M"

It is less clear, however, whether lymphopoeisis is affected by tumor growth.In our efforts of analyzing the impact of tumor growth on NK cell development, we observed a major reduction of NK cell numbers in mice bearing multiple lineages of tumor cells. The decrease in NK cell numbers was not due to increased apoptosis or decreased proliferation in the NK compartment. In addition, transgenic expression of IL-15 also failed to rescue the defective production of NK cells. Our systematic characterization of lymphopoeisis in tumor-bearing mice indicated that the number of the common lymphoid progenitor was significantly reduced in tumor-bearing mice. The number of B cells also decreased substantially in tumor bearing mice.Our data reveal a novel mechanism for tumor evasion of host immunity and suggest a new interpretation for the altered myeloid and lymphoid ratio in tumor bearing hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1978079827,"Background Isolation of human antibodies using current display technologies can be limited by constraints on protein expression, folding and post-translational modifications. Here we describe a discovery platform that utilizes self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors for the surface display of high-affinity single-chain variable region (scFv) antibody fragments on human cells and lentivirus particles. Methodology/Principal Findings Bivalent scFvFc human antibodies were fused in frame with different transmembrane (TM) anchoring moieties to allow efficient high-level expression on human cells and the optimal TM was identified. The addition of an eight amino acid HIV-1 gp41 envelope incorporation motif further increased scFvFc expression on human cells and incorporation into lentiviral particles. Both antibody-displaying human cells and virus particles bound antigen specifically. Sulfation of CDR tyrosine residues, a property recently shown to broaden antibody binding affinity and antigen recognition was also demonstrated. High level scFvFc expression and stable integration was achieved in human cells following transduction with IRES containing bicistronic SIN lentivectors encoding ZsGreen when scFvFc fusion proteins were expressed from the first cassette. Up to 106-fold enrichment of antibody expressing cells was achieved with one round of antigen coupled magnetic bead pre-selection followed by FACS sorting. Finally, the scFvFc displaying human cells could be used directly in functional biological screens with remarkable sensitivity. Conclusions/Significance This antibody display platform will complement existing technologies by virtue of providing properties unique to lentiviruses and antibody expression in human cells, which, in turn, may aid the discovery of novel therapeutic human mAbs."

Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar strongly suggests that ependymal cells are a key source of endogenous stem cells in the spinal cord. Advances in understanding endogenous neural stem cells may facilitate repair of the injured central nervous system. Repair of the injured spinal cord is one of the “holy grails” of medicine. The development of strategies to protect and repair the injured spinal cord has been facilitated by the identification of key mechanisms of secondary injury, by the characterization of extrinsic barriers to axonal regeneration, and by the discovery of neural stem cells within the adult central nervous system (CNS) (Rossignol et al., 2007Rossignol S. Schwab M. Schwartz M. Fehlings M.G. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11782-11792Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Complex and interrelated secondary injury processes are now increasingly understood, and they provide many potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Also critical has been the discovery that central axons are capable of regenerating but are prevented from doing so by inhibitory molecules expressed on central myelin and in the postinjury extracellular matrix (Rossignol et al., 2007Rossignol S. Schwab M. Schwartz M. Fehlings M.G. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11782-11792Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These discoveries have led to treatments now in early-stage human clinical trials (Figure 1) (Baptiste and Fehlings, 2008Baptiste D.C. Fehlings M.G. Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs. 2008; 13: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Neural precursor cells are emerging as another potential means to repair the injured CNS (Karimi-Abdolrezaee et al., 2006Karimi-Abdolrezaee S. Eftekharpour E. Wang J. Morshead C.M. Fehlings M.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3377-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The precise source(s) of endogenous neural precursor cells has been controversial; however, in the brain, evidence supports a role for cells in both the ependymal and subependymal layers, with many favoring a predominant role of radial glial cells. The spinal cord may have a unique source of neural precursor cells, as its ependymal layer, unlike in the brain, exhibits greater proliferation than its subependymal layer (Adrian and Walker, 1962Adrian E.K. Walker B.E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1962; 21: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Namiki and Tator, 1999Namiki J. Tator C.H. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A recent publication from the Frisen laboratory (Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) represents a significant advance in determining the source of neural stem cells in the spinal cord. In order to define the origin of neural stem cells in the region of the central canal of the spinal cord, Frisen's team generated two transgenic mouse lines expressing tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase under the control of FoxJ1 or Nestin regulatory sequences. FoxJ1 is a specific marker of cells with motile cilia or flagella, whereas Nestin is expressed by neural stem/progenitor cells. By labeling and characterizing spinal cord cells with motile cilia using these novel transgenic mice, Frisen's team provides convincing evidence that ependymal cells are the predominant source of endogenous spinal cord stem cells. There are several significant implications of these findings. First, harvesting ependymal-derived neural precursor cells for subsequent transplantation into the injured cord may be preferable to other donor cell types. This hypothesis is supported by data suggesting that transplanting cells and tissue to the anatomical site from which they were isolated may yield optimal results (Shetty and Turner, 2000Shetty A.K. Turner D.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8788-8801PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps specific cell populations are best equipped to survive and function in their original microenvironments. Second, stimulating endogenous ependymal cells within the injured spinal cord may be preferred over transplanting exogenous cells, as the latter may cause injury and also require immunosuppression. Future research will need to explore both possibilities, and the transgenic animals developed by Meletis and colleagues are ideally suited for such experiments. Also important is the finding that, following injury, ependymal cells not only form myelinating oligodendrocytes but also differentiate preferentially into “astrocyte-like” cells that participate in astroglial scarring (Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). While astrogliosis restricts the spread of damage, it creates a physical and chemical barrier to axonal outgrowth. Moreover, work by Hofstetter et al. suggests that astrocytic differentiation of transplanted cells may exacerbate neuropathic pain (Hofstetter et al., 2005Hofstetter C.P. Holmström N.A. Lilja J.A. Schweinhardt P. Hao J. Spenger C. Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Kurpad S.N. Frisén J. Olson L. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Indeed, much remains to be learned about astrogliosis, and this publication corroborates emerging evidence that the function of the astroglial scar is complex. Of interest, the ependymal-derived astrocyte-like cells observed by Meletis et al. appeared to support axonal outgrowth, in contrast to other regions of scar suggesting further benefit to stimulating the proliferation of these endogenous progenitor cells. Additional areas for future research are apparent. The transgenic animals employed in these experiments can determine if ependymal cells function as neural stem cells in the brain and also determine if they generate the more proliferative precursor cells in the brain's subependymal layer. As well, Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar suggest that novel molecules may guide the migration of the ependymal progenitor cells; once identified, the migration-inducing pathways might be exploited to promote repair. It is important to place the work of Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar into a broader context. It is becoming increasingly apparent that a combination of therapies will be required to achieve clinically meaningful improvements in spinal cord function. While the stimulation of endogenous stem cells is an attractive strategy for CNS repair/regeneration, it is unclear whether sufficient cells can be mobilized to provide efficient neural regeneration. Hence, cell replacement approaches remain an attractive cornerstone for combinatorial therapies that are being considered for clinical translation. Indeed, the replacement of lost cells has shown promise in various animal models of CNS injury. Some researchers have sought and achieved neural replacement with integration of transplanted cells into functional circuits. Other groups, such as our own, have sought and achieved oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination (Karimi-Abdolrezaee et al., 2006Karimi-Abdolrezaee S. Eftekharpour E. Wang J. Morshead C.M. Fehlings M.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3377-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). A broad array of cell types have been administered in protocols designed toward achieving diverse goals, and benefit has been almost universally reported. The benefit, however, has also been universally modest. The relatively modest effects of cell replacement strategies undoubtedly stem from the fact that these approaches are currently employed with insufficient understanding of the mechanisms underlying their observed benefit. Replacement of lost cells likely plays an important role, but functional improvement has also been seen in the absence of this effect. This has raised the possibility that transplanted cells may secrete trophic factors, or optimize the postinjury environment, in order to facilitate neuroprotection or enhanced plasticity of surviving, endogenous cells (Ourednik and Ourednik, 2004Ourednik V. Ourednik J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 76: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Shetty and Turner, 2000Shetty A.K. Turner D.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8788-8801PubMed Google Scholar). One must also consider that different donor cell types may lead to beneficial outcomes through distinct mechanisms. Studies exploring these possibilities are critically needed to advance the field of spinal repair. With improved understanding of the biology of transplanted cells and their interaction(s) with the host CNS, it may be possible to alter the exogenous cells and/or host environment in order to augment functional recovery. Enhanced knowledge of neural stem cell biology, such as the advances provided by Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, will be key to using neural precursor cells for CNS repair and regeneration. Also key will be an increased understanding of the signaling pathways that underlie the differentiation of neural stem cells, as recently described by Whittemore's group (Cheng et al., 2007Cheng X. Wang Y. He Q. Qiu M. Whittemore S.R. Cao Q. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the work by Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060182Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar represents an important step forward in understanding the biology of endogenous neural stem cells in the CNS. It is fascinating to consider that the cells at the center of the spinal cord may play a central role in its repair."
https://openalex.org/W2084976702,"Hepatic gluconeogenesis is elevated in diabetes and a major contributor to hyperglycemia. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine and an activator of Akt. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SDF-1 suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis through Akt. Our results from isolated primary hepatocytes show that SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta inhibited glucose production via gluconeogenesis and reduced transcript levels of key gluconeogenic genes glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Additionally, SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta both inhibited activation of the PEPCK promoter. In examining the mechanism by which SDF-1 inhibits gluconeogenesis, we found that SDF-1 promoted phosphorylation of Akt, FoxO1, and c-Src, but did not activate insulin receptor substrate-1-like insulin. Blockade of Akt activation by LY294002, FoxO1 translocation by constitutively nuclear FoxO1 mutant, or c-Src activation by the chemical inhibitor PP2, respectively, blunted SDF-1 suppression of gluconeogenesis. Finally, our results show that knocking down the level of SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 mRNA blocked SDF-1 suppression of gluconeogenesis. Together, our results demonstrate that SDF-1 is capable of inhibiting gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocytes through a signaling pathway distinct from the insulin signaling."

Future differentiation studies using these lines may offer insight on specific disease pathophysiology and aid the design of protective drug therapies. The advent of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) technology has fostered great optimism that if their extensive, though unpredictable, in vitro differentiation properties could be harnessed appropriately, these pluripotent cells could provide powerful models of human development and disease, as well as material for cell replacement therapies. Although this vision has been partially delivered with the provision of disease-specific hESC lines from afflicted embryos identified in preimplantation diagnostic screening programs (Pickering et al., 2005Pickering S.J. Minger S.L. Patel M. Taylor H. Black C. Burns C.J. Ekonomou A. Braude P.R. Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2005; 10: 390-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), only common, monogenic conditions can be captured in this way. Somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cell donors offers a more comprehensive route to patient-specific hESC. However technical, logistical, and ethical difficulties have, to date, presented insuperable difficulties. The landmark discovery by Takahashi and Yamanaka (reviewed in Yamanaka, 2007Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which share very similar properties with hESCs, could be prepared from mouse skin fibroblasts, has already been reproduced for a variety of human cell types taken from healthy donors. In the last month, two papers have been published describing the generation of iPSC lines from individual patients harboring a variety of both simple and complex genetic diseases. Daley and colleagues (Park et al., 2008Park I.H. Arora N. Huo H. Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Shimamura A. Lensch M.W. Cowan C. Hochedlinger K. Daley G.Q. Cell. 2008; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1700) Google Scholar) report the production of human iPSC lines for ten diseases, ranging from simple Mendelian traits, like adenosine deaminase deficiency and Gaucher disease type III, to complex conditions, like Parkinson's disease and Type 1 diabetes. In addition, they generated a line from a female carrier of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome with its characteristic mutation in one of the two alleles of the X-linked hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene. By analogy to the classic work using mouse hprt+/− ESCs, these human cells should prove extremely valuable in refining strategies for studies of homologous recombination as well as X chromosome activation/inactivation. These various lines were made by the now standard procedure of infecting dermal fibroblasts or, in one case, bone marrow mesenchymal cells, with disabled retroviruses expressing the reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC. The resulting iPSC lines displayed a variety of pluripotent stem cell markers (including NANOG, SSEA-3, and -4), and all of those tested could differentiate in vitro (embryoid bodies) and in vivo (teratoma formation in immunodeficient murine hosts) into cell lineages characteristic of all three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). Eggan and colleagues (Dimos et al., 2008Dimos J.T. Rodolfa K.T. Niakan K.K. Weisenthal L.M. Mitsumoto H. Chung W. Croft G.F. Saphier G. Leibel R. Goland R. et al.Science. 2008; 29: 1218-1221Crossref Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) used similar methods to produce iPSC lines from skin cells from an 82-year-old female patient diagnosed with a familial form of amylotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; also known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This lesion, which in this case was caused by a mutation in the superoxide dismutase gene, leads to motor neuron loss in the spinal cord and motor cortex with resulting paralysis and death. By converting the iPSCs into motor neurons and glial cell types, they established that reprogramming and in vitro differentiation are not necessarily thwarted by donor age. This is an important benefit given that many genetic diseases are of sporadic occurrence, with no family history, and become only evident with advancing years. Park et al. conclude their paper by signaling their intent to provide these lines as a resource to the biomedical research community. This is an eminently laudable declaration, and one hopes that the inventory of disease-specific lines will be expanded rapidly in the near future. However, before the full potential of these iPSC lines can be realized, a number of uncomfortable issues have to be addressed. First, iPSC generation involves retroviral integration and, as both the new papers attest, residual expression from some of the added genes. While the impact of this exogenous expression on cell potentiality remains unclear, the presence of integrated retroviral sequences precludes the use of these cells for donor patient cell therapy, even if the genetic lesion were repaired. However, new methods involving the transient exposure of somatic cells to reprogramming genes (or their products) or small molecule effectors are under development (discussed in Tada, 2008Tada T. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 121-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Second, it is not clear that iPSCs can display all the properties of ESCs: in mice where more stringent tests can be applied, murine iPSCs, unlike ESCs, have not yet formed live young in tetraploid aggregation assays. Third, experience in differentiating ESC, the gold standard, has itself been checkered. It is not clear whether any somatic cell lineages made in vitro are perfect replicas of the adult cell types. For example, differentiation of mouse ESC into adult hemopoietic stem cells has fallen far short of requirements even with additional genetic manipulation (see Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G. Cell. 2008; 132: 661-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). hESC-derived cells with adult beta cell-like properties have not been made in culture, while hESC-derived cardiomyocytes display mostly embryonic phenotypes. It may be that if perfect adult identity is required, the best cellular targets could be cell types that emerge very early in embryonic development and do not generally undergo division during postnatal life, such as retinal pigmented epithelial cells. Transplantation, of course, provides the most stringent test of actual or latent cell functionality, but in many situations, an informative outcome can be compromised by poor engraftment resulting from inadequate “preconditioning” in culture, or the disappearance of regional developmental cues in adult host tissues. Although improvements in heart function have been claimed after mouse or human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes transplantation into infarcted mouse hearts, these are likely short term gains unrelated to structural integration of donor cardiomyocytes (Van Laake et al., 2007Van Laake L.W. Passier R. Monshouwer-Kloots J. Verkleij A.J. Lips P.J. Freund C. den Ouden K. Ward-van Oostwaard D. Korving J. Tertoolen L.G. et al.Stem Cell Res. 2007; 1: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Despite these present shortcomings, cell perfection may not be required to permit important benefits accruing from the use of disease-specific iPSCs in drug discovery and screening. For example, experiments using coculture of mESC-derived motor neurons with primary (Nagai et al., 2007Nagai M. Re D.B. Nagata T. Chalazonitis A. Jessell T.M. Wichterle H. Przedborski S. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) or ESC-derived astrocytes (Di Giorgio et al., 2007Di Giorgio F.P. Carrasco M.A. Siao M.C. Maniatis T. Eggan K. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) have corroborated earlier mouse chimera findings implicating astrocyte involvement, and in particular, their secretion of toxic factors, in the degeneration of motor neurons in a mouse model of ALS. The new availability of these cell types from human ALS-specific iPSCs could presage the development of drugs that either prevent the production of toxic factors by astrocytes or, alternatively, prevent motor neuron degradation in their presence. In summary, the reports by Park and Dimos and their colleagues represent the first salvo of what should be a rich harvest of iPSC lines covering a host of simple and complex genetic diseases. Assuming present technological hurdles can be overcome and equivalence with conventional ESs is established, they should supplant ESCs for many applications since only iPSCs are made from living donors with detailed medical histories attesting to the impact of the disease on particular individuals."

Somatic hypermutation results by processing G.U mismatches generated when activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deaminates C to U. Mutations at C/G sites are targeted mainly at deamination sites, whereas mutations at A/T sites entail error-prone DNA gap repair. We used B-cell lysates to analyze salient features of somatic hypermutation with in vitro mutational assays. Tonsil and hypermutating Ramos B-cells convert C-->U in accord with AID motif specificities, whereas HeLa cells do not. Using tonsil cell lysates to repair a G.U mismatch, A/T and G/C targeted mutations occur about equally, whereas Ramos cell lysates make fewer mutations at A/T sites (approximately 24%) compared with G/C sites (approximately 76%). In contrast, mutations in HeLa cell lysates occur almost exclusively at G/C sites (> 95%). By recapitulating two basic features of B-cell-specific somatic hypermutation, G/C mutations targeted to AID hot spot motifs and elevated A/T mutations dependent on error-prone processing of G.U mispairs, these cell free assays provide a practical method to reconstitute error-prone mismatch repair using purified B-cell proteins."

We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the first SAMP motif-containing region of Xenopus APC as bait and obtained several SAMP binding candidates including DDEF2 (development and differentiation enhancing factor 2), which is an ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPase-activating protein (GAP (ArfGAP)) involved in the regulation of focal adhesions. In vitro and in cells the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of DDEF2 and its close homolog, DDEF1, are associated with the SAMP motif of APC competitively with Axin1. Moreover, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments revealed that the SAMP motif interacts at the same surface of the SH3 domain of DDEF as the known SH3 binding motif, PXXP. When fluorescent protein-tagged APC and DDEF are expressed in Xenopus A6 cells, co-localization at microtubule ends is observed. Overexpression and RNA interference experiments indicate that APC and DDEFs cooperatively regulate the distributions of microtubules and focal adhesions. Our findings reveal that the SAMP motif of APC specifically binds to the SH3 domains of DDEFs, providing new insights into the functions of APC in cell migration.

This class of proteins, showing an intriguing accumulation at growing MT plus ends, consists of diverse molecules having different structural properties, including EB1 (end-binding 1), CLIPs (cytoplasmic linker proteins), CLASPs (CLIP-associating proteins), dynein, and dynactin (3Akhmanova A.

To date +TIPs have been proven to play an important role in the polarized organization of MT networks. So far, some of +TIPs such as APC, ACF7, and CLASPs were reported to be associated with the cell cortex near the migrating edges of cells and to stabilize MTs (3Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. Drabek K.

Without the activities of these cortical +TIPs, in most cases the MT stabilizing effect at the leading edges is lost, and the cells fail to maintain polarized, coordinated migration in response to monolayer wounding (9Kodama A.

In the front of a motile fibroblast, the transient interaction of the plus-end of MT with focal adhesions (FAs) promotes adhesion disassembly and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (14Small J.V. Kaverina I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Indeed, MTs are involved in the disassembly of FAs via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and dynamin (14Small J.V. Kaverina I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Ezratty E.J. Partridge M.A. Gundersen G.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). On the other hand, paxillin, a FA adaptor protein involved in FA dynamics, regulates MT behaviors by promoting the disassembly of MTs (16Efimov A.S.N. Grigoriev I. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Small J.V. Kaverina I. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the factor(s) and the precise molecular mechanism(s) connecting the MT plus end and FAs are largely unknown. In this context, it is interesting to examine the involvement of APC in the FA dynamics. The APC protein is a large, 310-kDa protein with multiple structural domains and multiple binding partners, as shown in Fig. 1A (17Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 127-147PubMed Google Scholar). In the NH2-terminal armadillo repeat region, APC associates with the kinesin motor protein via KAP3 to transport the molecule to MT plus ends (18Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the COOH-terminal region, APC directly associates with MTs and with MT-binding proteins of the EB1 (end-binding 1) family (19Juwana J.P. Henderikx P. Mischo A. Wadle A. Fadle N. Gerlach K.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar) and promotes the net growth of MTs in cells (24Kita K. Wittmann T. Näthke I.S. Waterman-Storer C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2331-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The middle part of APC protein, which contains 15-amino acid (aa) repeats and distinct 20-aa repeats, directly interacts with β- or γ-catenin (25Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 26Su L.K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The 20-aa repeat region of APC contains 3 repeats of a Ser-Ala-Met-Pro (SAMP) motif, which binds to Axin1/conductin (27Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These repeats, initially termed SAMP repeats because of the SAMP motifs found in human APC (27Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), contain a conserved sequence (I/L)XXXCIX-SXMX(K/R) (where X is any amino acid) where (I/L)XXXCI also appears to be invariant in Drosophila APC (29Hamada F. Murata Y. Nishida A. Fujita F. Tomoyasu Y. Nakamura M. Toyoshima K. Tabata T. Ueno N. Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Through this middle portion, APC forms a complex with catenins, Axin1/conductin, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β, an important functional unit in the Wnt signaling pathway (25Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 30Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), which leads β-catenin to the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway (31Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The SAMP repeat region is thought to be critical in the developmental function and tumor-suppressing activity of APC. During the progression of sporadic colorectal tumors as well as in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), mutations in the APC gene result in a roughly half-sized APC protein truncated upstream of the SAMP repeats region (for reviews, see Refs. 32Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and 33Rowan A.J. Lamlum H. Ilyas M. Wheeler J. Straub J. Papadopoulou A. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Tomlinson I.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3352-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The importance of the first SAMP motif has been proven using mouse models carrying targeted mutations in APC (34Smits R. Kielman M.F. Breukel C. Zurcher C. Neufeld K. Jagmohan-Changur S. Hofland N. van Dijk J. White R. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Khan P.M. Fodde R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Truncations of APC upstream of the SAMP repeats (e.g. ApcMin and Apc1572T) have been shown to be associated with tumorigenesis in heterozygotes and embryonic lethal phenotype in homozygotes. In contrast and importantly, homozygosity for Apc1638T, in which mutated APC produces a truncated APC protein retaining the first SAMP motif but missing all of the COOH-terminal domains, is compatible with postnatal life and Apc1638T/Apc1638T animals do not show any increased tumor susceptibility. To date, the function of the SAMP repeats has been discussed only in the terms of the involvement of Axin1/conductin. However, it is still possible that molecules other than Axin1/conductin bind to the SAMP repeat. We have analyzed the localization and function of full-length and truncated forms of APC using the A6 cell line, which was established from a normal Xenopus laevis kidney and which can overexpress exogenous APC (11Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Matsui C. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This trait of A6 cells is advantageous for functional analysis of the APC protein, because in most cultured mammalian cells the expression of exogenous APC is very difficult due to the induction of cell death through apoptosis (36Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that the SAMP repeat region has a MT-related function in A6 cells. By a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we identified DDEF1 (also known as AMAP1, ASAP1, or PAG2) and DDEF2 (also known as AMAP2 or PAG3), paxillin- and FAK-binding proteins, as novel SAMP repeat-interacting proteins, the interaction being mediated through their Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. DDEFs co-localized with APC at the cell edges in a MT-dependent manner when expressed in A6 cells. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift perturbation experiments, we further found that the SAMP motif interacts with the same region of the SH3 domains of DDEFs as the known SH3 binding motif PXXP. Finally, we found that APC and DDEFs cooperatively regulate microtubules and FAs through the SAMP repeats region. Plasmid Construction and Recombinant Proteins—Enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vectors (pEGFP-C series) were purchased from Clontech (TaKaRa). To generate mRFP1 expression vectors, the GFP coding sequences of pEGFP-C were substituted with mRFP1 (a gift from Dr. R. Tsien). The GFP-fused X. laevis APC protein constructs, fAPC-GFP, GFP-fAPC, nAPC-GFP, ΔcAPC-GFP, and GFP-cAPC, are described previously (11Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Matsui C. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Other expression plasmids encoding a series of GFP-fused mutated APC proteins were generated using the GFP-fAPC plasmid. The details are provided in the supplemental materials. A rat Axin1 cDNA (rAxin1) was a gift from Dr. A. Kikuchi (Hiroshima University). A X. laevis Axin1 cDNA (BC089276, IMAGE:3379167) and a human vinculin cDNA were obtained from Open Biosystems and OriGene, respectively. To generate GFP or mRFP fusion proteins, Axin1, rAxin1, vinculin, and candidates for SAMP-binding proteins were subcloned into pEGFP or pmRFP expression vectors. The details are provided in the supplemental materials. To generate recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, PCR-engineered fragments were inserted into the pET32a (Novagen) or pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare) plasmids. The fragments used were as follows: Axin1-RGS, aa 88-211 of X. laevis Axin1; DDEF1-SH3, 73 aa from the stop codon of X. laevis DDEF1; DDEF2-SH3, aa 958-1029 of X. laevis DDEF2; ARHGAP10-SH3, aa 711-783 of X. laevis ARHGAP10; ARHGAP26-SH3, aa 700-771 of X. laevis ARHGAP26; SAMP#1, aa 1565-1594 of X. laevis APC; SAMP#2, aa 1712-1745 of X. laevis APC; SAMP#3, aa 2027-2054 of X. laevis APC. See also supplemental Fig. 4. The RGS fragment from human Axin1 (hAxin1-RGS) was constructed as described previously (37Spink K.E. Polakis P. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2270-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with thioredoxin His6 and S tags (Trx-S-tagged) or with GST and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) or glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), respectively. For NMR studies, uniformly 15N (13C/15N)-labeled proteins were expressed by growing E. coli cells in an M9 minimal medium supplemented with [12C6]-D-glucose/[12C3]-glycerol([U-13C6]-D-glucose) and 15NH4Cl as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. After purification using affinity chromatography as described above, the recombinant fusion proteins were treated with an appropriate enzyme (recombinant Enterokinase or Factor-Xa (both purchased from Novagen) to separate thioredoxin or GST. The proteins were further purified by anion exchange (HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare)) and gel-filtration (HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 pg (GE Healthcare)) chromatographies. Chemically synthetic peptides for the FLAG-tagged SAMP motif (FLAG-SAMP#n) and FAK-SII (38Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) were generated by PEPTIDE Institute Inc. (Japan). The amino acid sequences used are represented in supplemental Fig. 4. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies were raised against the following recombinant proteins expressed using pET32a vectors in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and are listed as the antibody specification followed by the aa position in the immunogen: rat anti-human APC monoclonal antibody (mAb) (anti-hAPC-N (#21)), aa 1-282 of human APC; rabbit anti-human APC pAb (anti-hAPC-N), aa 1-282 of human APC; rabbit anti-Xenopus APC pAb (anti-xAPC-N), aa 1-284 of Xenopus APC; anti-Xenopus DDEF2 pAb (anti-xD-DEF2-C) aa 709-308 of Xenopus DDEF2. Antibodies generated in rabbits or rats were purified by affinity chromatography (Sunplanet Co., Ltd.). The characterization of the antibodies used in this study is described in the supplemental materials. Purified rabbit anti-AMAP1 (DDEF1) pAb and rabbit anti-AMAP2 pAb and anti-KAP3 (C2) pAb were kindly provided by Dr. Sabe (Osaka Bioscience Institute) and by Dr. Akiyama (Tokyo University), respectively. Mouse anti-AFP mAb (Wako), rabbit anti-GFP pAb (Chemicon), chicken anti-GFP pAb (Chemicon), rabbit anti-DsRed pAb (Clontech; denoted as anti-RFP in the “Results”), mouse anti-FLAG mAb (M2; Sigma), mouse anti-α-tubulin mAb (DM1A; Sigma), rat anti-α-tubulin mAb (YL1/2; Abcam), rabbit anti-β-catenin pAb (Sigma); goat anti-Axin1 pAb (R-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-paxillin mAb (clone 349; BD Transduction), goat anti-p-paxillin (Tyr-31) (Santa Cruz), mouse anti-vinculin (Sigma), and mouse anti-GM130 mAb (Transduction Laboratories) were purchased from the indicated sources. As secondary antibodies, Cy2- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG and anti-chicken pAbs, rhodamine Red-X- or Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG pAbs, and Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG and anti-rat IgG pAbs were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cell Culture and Transfection of Plasmids and siRNAs—A6 cells, established from a normal X. laevis kidney, were grown at 23 °C without CO2 in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (50% L-15 medium, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 40% distilled water, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin solution). Human kidney epithelial cell line HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Non-cancer human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A cells (ATCC) were grown in mammary epithelial cell growth medium (Sanko-junyaku) supplemented with 100 ng/ml cholera toxin at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were carried out using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) for plasmids or HiPerFect transfection regent (Qiagen) for siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Drug-resistant A6 cell transfectant clones were selected in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) and screened by detecting GFP signals under a fluorescence microscope followed by Western blot analysis. The following A6 stable transfectant clones were used in this study: A6/GFP-fAPC, clone B5 (11Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Matsui C. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); A6/GFP-APC(Δ1574), clone A6C3; A6/GFP-APC(Δ1641), clone A1; A6/GFP-APC(ΔSAMP), clone 8; A6/GFP-APC(DDEF2), clone A4; A6/GFP-rAxin1, clone B4D2. For GFP-rAxin1, due to its toxic effect, only clones with very low expression levels were obtained. Moreover, the expression of GFP-rAxin1 tends to be lost during the serial subcultivation; therefore, occasionally GFP-positive cells were sorted using a cell sorter. Synthetic Stealth siRNAs (Invitrogen) were directed against the following target sites: APC, 5′-TCGTCTGATTCAGATTCCATCCTTT-3′; DDEF1, 5′-CCCAAATTGGAGATTTGCCGCCTAA-3′; DDEF2, 5′-CCTAAGCGGGTGAAAGCGCTCTATA-3′. The siRNAs were transfected at a concentration of 100 nm. The siRNA-treated cells were replated 2 days after transfection and used for assays on day 3. In Vitro Binding Assay, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—FLAG-SAMP#1 peptides were immobilized on anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), and 1% bovine serum albumin. Trx-S-tagged recombinant proteins were incubated with the beads in the same buffer for 1 h at a room temperature. After washing with the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation was performed as follows. First, to prepare soluble cell lysates, cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm lactacystin (Calbiochem), Complete protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma) containing 1% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Appropriate primary antibodies and protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) were used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using gels with appropriate concentrations of acrylamide and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation with appropriate antibodies, the bound antibodies were detected with the ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). MT Co-sedimentation Assay—Purified bovine tubulin proteins (Cytoskeleton) were polymerized into MTs and stabilized with taxol in BRB80 tubulin polymerization buffer using a standard protocol. Cells were cultured on 10-cm dishes, briefly washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 1 ml of buffer A. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm using a TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman) for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100 ultracentrifuge. The clarified cell lysates were mixed with 10 μm taxol and 0.2 mg of MTs, layered onto a prewarmed 1-ml glycerol cushion (buffer A containing 40% (v/v) glycerol and 10 μm taxol) in open-top thick-walled polycarbonate tubes and centrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 10 min at 37 °C in a TLA-100.3 rotor to pellet the MTs. After complete aspiration of the supernatants and cushions, the MT pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Immunofluorescence Staining and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min or in methanol-acetone (1:1) at -20 °C for 2 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were permeabilized with 0.1 or 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum. Samples were then processed for indirect immunostaining using appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Samples were washed several times and mounted in ProLong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). Images of cells were acquired and analyzed as described previously (11Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Matsui C. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For live cell imaging, cells were cultured on glass-based dishes (IWAKI) and observed using a DeltaVision Core microscope system (Applied Precision Inc.) equipped with an Olympus IX71 microscope (PlanApo 100×/1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Out-of-focus signals were removed using the deconvolution technique of the DeltaVision system. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AV-400 M or on a DRX-500 spectrometer. The sample conditions were 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% D2O for the chemical shift perturbation analyses of the proteins and the SAMP peptides (experiments shown in Fig. 4) or 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.2), 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% D2O for the main-chain assignment of DDEF1-SH3 and for the titration experiments of FLAG-SAMP#1 and FLAG-FAK-SII on DDEF1-SH3 (experiments shown in Fig. 5). To analyze chemical shift perturbations, weighted averages of chemical shift changes were summed for all the resonances in each 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of a 15N-labeled protein (0.07 mm) as the result of a peptide addition (see Fig. 4D). The weighted averages were calculated according to the function [(ΔδH)2 + (0.14 ×ΔδN)2]1/2 (ppm), where δH and δN are, respectively, 1H and 15N chemical shifts, and Δδ is the deviation of the observed chemical shift in the presence of a peptide from that in the free-form. The value of 0.14 was used as a scaling factor to normalize the 15N chemical shift range to that of 1H. For the peak that broadened beyond detection upon the peptide addition, the chemical shift change was assumed to be 0.1.FIGURE 5Titration of FLAG-SAMP#1 and FLAG-FAK-SII on DDEF1-SH3.

Although different retroviruses have been shown to target distinctive chromosomal regions, few of them display a site-specific integration. ZAM, a retroelement from Drosophila melanogaster very similar in structure and replication cycle to mammalian retroviruses is highly site-specific. Indeed, ZAM copies target the genomic 5'-CGCGCg-3' consensus-sequences. To enlighten the determinants of this high integration specificity, we investigated the functional properties of its integrase protein denoted ZAM-IN.Here we show that ZAM-IN displays the property to nick DNA molecules in vitro. This endonuclease activity targets specific sequences that are present in a 388 bp fragment taken from the white locus and known to be a genomic ZAM integration site in vivo. Furthermore, ZAM-IN displays the unusual property to directly bind specific genomic DNA sequences. Two specific and independent sites are recognized within the 388 bp fragment of the white locus: the CGCGCg sequence and a closely apposed site different in sequence.This study strongly argues that the intrinsic properties of ZAM-IN, ie its binding properties and its endonuclease activity, play an important part in ZAM integration specificity. Its ability to select two binding sites and to nick the DNA molecule reminds the strategy used by some site-specific recombination enzymes and forms the basis for site-specific integration strategies potentially useful in a broad range of genetic engineering applications."

A recent report in Nature Medicine (Gargioli et al., 2008Gargioli C. Coletta M. De G.F. Cannata S.M. Cossu G. Nat.

Histopathologic changes in diseased tissues may render them inhospitable to engraftment by transplanted stem cells. A recent report in Nature Medicine (Gargioli et al., 2008Gargioli C. Coletta M. De G.F. Cannata S.M. Cossu G. Nat. Med. 2008; https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrates that pretreatment of dystrophic mouse muscles with tissue-modifying factors leads to reduced fibrosis, increased vascularity, and enhanced stem cell engraftment. Stem cell transplantation holds great promise for the treatment of degenerative diseases. The success of stem cell transplantation depends not only the intrinsic properties of the transplanted cells, but also on the properties of the tissue into which the cells will be introduced. It seems to be generally true that exogenous stem cells engraft far more efficiently into tissues, whether normal or diseased, from which endogenous stem cells have been depleted. This has led to the concept that exogenous cells require a “vacated niche” for effective engraftment (Scadden, 2006Scadden D.T. Nature. 2006; 441: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). However, diseased tissues may pose specific barriers to cell transplantation. If the exogenous cells are introduced into an environment of necrosis, inflammation, and degenerative changes, their ability to engraft, proliferate, and differentiate into mature tissue may be severely compromised. In the muscular dystrophies, a group of diseases for which stem cell transplantation has long been considered as a potential therapeutic modality (Partridge and Sloper, 1977Partridge T.A. Sloper J.C. J. Neurol. Sci. 1977; 33: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the host environment is particularly relevant. The dystrophies are characterized by a progressive replacement of normal skeletal muscle with fibrous connective tissue and adipose tissue (Emery, 2002Emery A.E. Lancet. 2002; 359: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Therefore, any myogenic stem cells delivered to the muscle by direct injection are likely to face an extremely inhospitable environment in which to make new muscle. Furthermore, concomitant with the degenerative changes is a decline in the vascularity of the tissue, thereby diminishing the potential of using a vascular route for delivering stem cells to muscles throughout the body. In sum, the histologic features of dystrophic muscle pose substantial barriers to stem cell therapeutics for these diseases. In a recent paper in Nature Medicine, Gargioli, Cossu, and colleagues (Gargioli et al., 2008Gargioli C. Coletta M. De G.F. Cannata S.M. Cossu G. Nat. Med. 2008; https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) present a novel approach to deal with the problems of the dystrophic histopathology prior to the vascular delivery of myogenic stem cells. The rationale of the approach is several-fold, but the most important concept is that the delivery of factors that degrade extracellular matrix and promote angiogenesis might reduce fibrosis and enhance vascularization, respectively, thereby rendering the tissue more amenable to subsequent vascular delivery and engraftment of exogenous stem cells. To reduce fibrosis, the authors chose matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9); to enhance vascularization, they chose placenta growth factor (PIGF). However, they did not just inject these factors into muscle. Rather, they engineered tendon fibroblasts to produce each of the factors. They then injected those fibroblasts into a specific hindlimb muscle of mice with a muscular dystrophy due to α-sarcoglycan deficiency. Tendon fibroblasts were chosen both because they may be a readily available cell population from patients (since patients with muscular dystrophies commonly undergo surgical procedures to relieve tendon contractions) and because they may be relatively resistant to hypoxia as they normally reside in an avascular tissue (Webster and Burry, 1982Webster D.F. Burry H.C. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1982; 63: 50-55PubMed Google Scholar). The latter feature was considered important because cells injected as a bolus into skeletal muscle need to survive initially as an avascular mass, in addition to the fact that the dystrophic muscle is already hypovascular, as noted. Following transplantation of the genetically modified fibroblasts, the investigators examined their effects on tissue pathology. Indeed, various indices of fibrosis declined and indices of vascularity increased when muscles were injected with both MMP-9-producing and PIGF-producing fibroblasts, with almost no benefit from the injection of either fibroblast population alone. Surprisingly, fibroblasts producing MMP-9 had little effect on fibrosis and fibroblasts producing PIGF had little effect on vascularity, but the combination showed substantial improvement in both measures. Clearly, there must be some synergistic actions of the two factors within the context of the physiology of the dystrophic muscle. Having established conditions for reversing aspects of the dystrophic pathology, the investigators proceeded to test the efficacy of stem cell engraftment in the pretreated muscles. The authors chose to deliver a wild-type (i.e., α-sarcoglycan+) population of myogenic progenitors, termed “mesoangioblasts,” by intra-arterial injection because these cells efficiently cross vascular boundaries and colonize muscle (Minasi et al., 2002Minasi M.G. Riminucci M. De A.L. Borello U. Berarducci B. Innocenzi A. Caprioli A. Sirabella D. Baiocchi M. De M.R. et al.Development. 2002; 129: 2773-2783PubMed Google Scholar). They then examined muscles at different times after intra-arterial mesangioblast injections for various measures of engraftment and therapeutic response. As with the measures of histopathology, pretreatment with either population of genetically engineered fibroblasts alone had negligible effect on the transplantation efficacy, but pretreatment with both populations led to an increase in the amount of α-sarcoglycan expression and an increase in new muscle formation. Perhaps the most surprising and intriguing finding was that an enhancement of transplantation efficacy was observed not only in the specific muscle pretreated with the genetically engineered fibroblasts, but also in other muscles in the limb, including muscles quite distant from the treated muscles. This was perhaps related to the finding that, despite the fact that the fibroblasts were directly injected into only one muscle, some low level spread of the cells and diffusion of the factors to other muscles of the limb were observed. These specific findings may shed light on the nature of the observed synergy between MMP-9 and PIGF treatment. It may be that the ability of PIGF to promote angiogenesis requires a regression of the tissue fibrosis, as promoted by MMP-9. This possibility would be consistent with the finding that neither factor alone is sufficient to promote mesoangioblast engraftment, given that PIGF would not effectively promote angiogenesis without concomitant matrix remodeling, and MMP-9 obviously would not promote increased vascularity on its own. This model of synergy would also imply a requisite temporal sequence and would predict MMP-9 treatment followed by PIGF treatment would be most successful, whereas the reverse would be ineffective. These results are very encouraging and reflect a growing interest not only in the optimal characteristics of stem cells and progenitors for therapeutic transplantation, but also in the host environment into which those cells may be transplanted (Gopinath and Rando, 2008Gopinath S.D. Rando T.A. Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Consideration of the environment of diseased tissues may present an apparent paradox. On the one hand, the disease itself may render the tissue more amenable to stem cell therapy if the pathogenetic process results in a diminution of the endogenous stem cell population, resulting in vacated stem cell niches. On the other hand, the disease process may also render the tissue refractory to stem cell therapy by engendering pathologic changes that resist exogenous stem cell engraftment. Recent studies have shed new light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which fibrotic and adipogenic changes arise in aged skeletal muscle (Brack et al., 2007Brack A.S. Conboy M.J. Roy S. Lee M. Kuo C.J. Keller C. Rando T.A. Science. 2007; 317: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, Hidestrand et al., 2008Hidestrand M. Richards-Malcolm S. Gurley C.M. Nolen G. Grimes B. Waterstrat A. Zant G.V. Peterson C.A. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2008; 63: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), revealing potential approaches to the prevention of these changes. Similar mechanisms may underlie the age-dependent fibrogenesis and adipogenesis that occur in the dystrophies. The use of antifibrotic therapy in the muscular dystrophies is in early stages of investigation but holds promise (Andreetta et al., 2006Andreetta F. Bernasconi P. Baggi F. Ferro P. Oliva L. Arnoldi E. Cornelio F. Mantegazza R. Confalonieri P. J. Neuroimmunol. 2006; 175: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The results of the studies by Gargioli et al. provide further evidence in support of the idea that optimization of the recipient tissue may be just as important as optimization of the stem cells that will be delivered (Gargioli et al., 2008Gargioli C. Coletta M. De G.F. Cannata S.M. Cossu G. Nat. Med. 2008; https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Using intramuscular injection of genetically-modified fibroblasts to deliver tissue-modifying factors may not be optimal for clinical applications in humans because of the complexity this would add to the already significant challenges of stem cell transplantation itself. However, this approach represents a proof-of-principle and also offers a starting point for comparison of various treatments of diseased tissues designed to enhance stem cell engraftment."
