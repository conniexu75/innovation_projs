https://openalex.org/W2953250433,"When studying the impacts of climate change, there is a tendency to select climate data from a small set of arbitrary time periods or climate windows (e.g., spring temperature). However, these arbitrary windows may not encompass the strongest periods of climatic sensitivity and may lead to erroneous biological interpretations. Therefore, there is a need to consider a wider range of climate windows to better predict the impacts of future climate change. We introduce the R package climwin that provides a number of methods to test the effect of different climate windows on a chosen response variable and compare these windows to identify potential climate signals. climwin extracts the relevant data for each possible climate window and uses this data to fit a statistical model, the structure of which is chosen by the user. Models are then compared using an information criteria approach. This allows users to determine how well each window explains variation in the response variable and compare model support between windows. climwin also contains methods to detect type I and II errors, which are often a problem with this type of exploratory analysis. This article presents the statistical framework and technical details behind the climwin package and demonstrates the applicability of the method with a number of worked examples."
https://openalex.org/W2565011576,"Articular cartilage has little regenerative capacity. Recently, genetic lineage tracing experiments have revealed chondrocyte progenitors at the articular surface. We further characterized these progenitors by using in vivo genetic approaches. Histone H2B-green fluorescent protein retention revealed that superficial cells divide more slowly than underlying articular chondrocytes. Clonal genetic tracing combined with immunohistochemistry revealed that superficial cells renew their number by symmetric division, express mesenchymal stem cell markers, and generate chondrocytes via both asymmetric and symmetric differentiation. Quantitative analysis of cellular kinetics, in combination with phosphotungstic acid-enhanced micro-computed tomography, showed that superficial cells generate chondrocytes and contribute to the growth and reshaping of articular cartilage. Furthermore, we found that cartilage renewal occurs as the progeny of superficial cells fully replace fetal chondrocytes during early postnatal life. Thus, superficial cells are self-renewing progenitors that are capable of maintaining their own population and fulfilling criteria of unipotent adult stem cells. Furthermore, the progeny of these cells reconstitute adult articular cartilage de novo, entirely substituting fetal chondrocytes.-Li, L., Newton, P. T., Bouderlique, T., Sejnohova, M., Zikmund, T., Kozhemyakina, E., Xie, M., Krivanek, J., Kaiser, J., Qian, H., Dyachuk, V., Lassar, A. B., Warman, M. L., Barenius, B., Adameyko, I., Chagin, A. S. Superficial cells are self-renewing chondrocyte progenitors, which form the articular cartilage in juvenile mice."

The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a key role in almost all cancers, including breast cancer. We comprehensively analyzed miRNA expression, global gene expression, and patient survival from the Cancer Genomes Atlas (TCGA) to identify clinically relevant miRNAs and their potential gene targets in breast tumors. In our analysis, we found that increased expression of 12 mature miRNAs-hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-361-5p, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-374b-5p, hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-651-5p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-30c-5p, and hsa-let-7i-5p -each predicted improved breast cancer survival. Of the 12 miRNAs, miR-320a, miR-361-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-103a-3p were selected for further analysis. By correlating global gene expression with miRNA expression and then employing miRNA target prediction analysis, we suggest that the four miRNAs may exert protective phenotypes by targeting breast oncogenes that contribute to patient survival. We propose that miR-320a targets the survival-associated genes RAD51, RRP1B, and TDG; miR-361-5p targets ARCN1; and miR-21-5p targets MSH2, RMND5A, STAG2, and UBE2D3. The results of our stringent bioinformatics approach for identifying clinically relevant miRNAs and their targets indicate that miR-320a, miR-361-5p, and miR-21-5p may contribute to breast cancer survival."
https://openalex.org/W2561557641,"Introduction The Netherlands Armed Forces use -80°C frozen red blood cells (RBCs), plasma and platelets combined with regular liquid stored RBCs, for the treatment of (military) casualties in Medical Treatment Facilities abroad. Our objective was to assess and compare the use of -80°C frozen blood products in combination with the different transfusion protocols and their effect on the outcome of trauma casualties. Materials and Methods Hemovigilance and combat casualties data from Afghanistan 2006–2010 for 272 (military) trauma casualties with or without massive transfusions (MT: ≥6 RBC/24hr, N = 82 and non-MT: 1–5 RBC/24hr, N = 190) were analyzed retrospectively. In November 2007, a massive transfusion protocol (MTP; 4:3:1 RBC:Plasma:Platelets) for ATLS® class III/IV hemorrhage was introduced in military theatre. Blood product use, injury severity and mortality were assessed pre- and post-introduction of the MTP. Data were compared to civilian and military trauma studies to assess effectiveness of the frozen blood products and MTP. Results No ABO incompatible blood products were transfused and only 1 mild transfusion reaction was observed with 3,060 transfused products. In hospital mortality decreased post-MTP for MT patients from 44% to 14% (P = 0.005) and for non-MT patients from 12.7% to 5.9% (P = 0.139). Average 24-hour RBC, plasma and platelet ratios were comparable and accompanying 24-hour mortality rates were low compared to studies that used similar numbers of liquid stored (and on site donated) blood products. Conclusion This report describes for the first time that the combination of -80°C frozen platelets, plasma and red cells is safe and at least as effective as standard blood products in the treatment of (military) trauma casualties. Frozen blood can save the lives of casualties of armed conflict without the need for in-theatre blood collection. These results may also contribute to solutions for logistic problems in civilian blood supply in remote areas."

The novel NGS approach was based on sequencing libraries of small RNA isolated from grapevine vascular tissues. Eight previously partially-characterized grapevines of diverse varieties were selected and subjected to analysis: Chardonnay, Laurot, Guzal Kara, and rootstock Kober 125AA from the Moravia wine-producing region; plus Müller-Thurgau and Pinot Noir from the Bohemia wine-producing region, both in the Czech Republic. Using next generation sequencing of small RNA, the presence of 8 viruses and 2 viroids were detected in a set of eight grapevines; therefore, confirming the high effectiveness of the technique in plant virology and producing results supporting previous data on multiple infected grapevines in Czech vineyards. Among the pathogens detected, the Grapevine rupestris vein feathering virus and Grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1 were recorded in the Czech Republic for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2561180709,"Prediction of memory performance (remembered or forgotten) has various potential applications not only for knowledge learning but also for disease diagnosis. Recently, subsequent memory effects (SMEs)-the statistical differences in electroencephalography (EEG) signals before or during learning between subsequently remembered and forgotten events-have been found. This finding indicates that EEG signals convey the information relevant to memory performance. In this paper, based on SMEs we propose a computational approach to predict memory performance of an event from EEG signals. We devise a convolutional neural network for EEG, called ConvEEGNN, to predict subsequently remembered and forgotten events from EEG recorded during memory process. With the ConvEEGNN, prediction of memory performance can be achieved by integrating two main stages: feature extraction and classification. To verify the proposed approach, we employ an auditory memory task to collect EEG signals from scalp electrodes. For ConvEEGNN, the average prediction accuracy was 72.07% by using EEG data from pre-stimulus and during-stimulus periods, outperforming other approaches. It was observed that signals from pre-stimulus period and those from during-stimulus period had comparable contributions to memory performance. Furthermore, the connection weights of ConvEEGNN network can reveal prominent channels, which are consistent with the distribution of SME studied previously."
https://openalex.org/W2562987243,"Each year more than 450,000 Germans are expected to be diagnosed with cancer subsequently receiving standard multimodal therapies including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. On top, molecular-targeted agents are increasingly administered. Owing to intrinsic and acquired resistance to these therapeutic approaches, both the better molecular understanding of tumor biology and the consideration of alternative and complementary therapeutic support are warranted and open up broader and novel possibilities for therapy personalization. Particularly the latter is underpinned by the increasing utilization of non-invasive complementary and alternative medicine by the population. One investigated approach is the application of low-dose electromagnetic fields (EMF) to modulate cellular processes. A particular system is the BEMER therapy as a Physical Vascular Therapy for which a normalization of the microcirculation has been demonstrated by a low-frequency, pulsed EMF pattern. Open remains whether this EMF pattern impacts on cancer cell survival upon treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and the molecular-targeted agent Cetuximab inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor. Using more physiological, three-dimensional, matrix-based cell culture models and cancer cell lines originating from lung, head and neck, colorectal and pancreas, we show significant changes in distinct intermediates of the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways and enhanced cancer cell radiosensitization associated with increased DNA double strand break numbers and higher levels of reactive oxygen species upon BEMER treatment relative to controls. Intriguingly, exposure of cells to the BEMER EMF pattern failed to result in sensitization to chemotherapy and Cetuximab. Further studies are necessary to better understand the mechanisms underlying the cellular alterations induced by the BEMER EMF pattern and to clarify the application areas for human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2562982243,"The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is a key pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America, and damage resulting from this species has recently expanded southward. Current pest management practices are inadequate and uncertainty regarding geographic origin, as well as limited data on population structure and dynamics across North America impede progress towards more informed management. We examined the genetic divergence between samples collected in North America and northeastern Asia, the assumed native range of C. cinctus using two mitochondrial regions (COI and 16S). Subsequently, we characterized the structure of genetic diversity in the main wheat producing areas in North America using a combination of mtDNA marker and microsatellites in samples collected both in wheat fields and in grasses in wildlands. The strong genetic divergence observed between North American samples and Asian congeners, in particular the synonimized C. hyalinatus, did not support the hypothesis of a recent American colonization by C. cinctus. Furthermore, the relatively high genetic diversity both with mtDNA and microsatellite markers offered additional evidence in favor of the native American origin of this pest. The genetic diversity of North American populations is structured into three genetic clusters and these are highly correlated with geography. Regarding the recent southern outbreaks in North America, the results tend to exclude the hypothesis of recent movement of damaging wheat stem sawfly populations from the northern area. The shift in host plant use by local populations appears to be the most likely scenario. Finally, the significance of these findings is discussed in the context of pest management."
https://openalex.org/W2561605235,"Phycocyanobilin (PCB) binds with high affinity (2.2 x 106 M-1 at 25°C) to human serum albumin (HSA) at sites located in IB and IIA subdomains. The aim of this study was to examine effects of PCB binding on protein conformation and stability. Using 300 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, UV-VIS spectrophotometry, CD, FT-IR, spectrofluorimetry, thermal denaturation and susceptibility to trypsin digestion, we studied the effects of PCB binding on the stability and rigidity of HSA, as well as the conformational changes in PCB itself upon binding to the protein. MD simulation results demonstrated that HSA with PCB bound at any of the two sites showed greater rigidity and lower overall and individual domain flexibility compared to free HSA. Experimental data demonstrated an increase in the α-helical content of the protein and thermal and proteolytic stability upon ligand binding. PCB bound to HSA undergoes a conformational change to a more elongated conformation in the binding pockets of HSA. PCB binding to HSA stabilizes the structure of this flexible transport protein, making it more thermostable and resistant to proteolysis. The results from this work explain at molecular level, conformational changes and stabilization of HSA structure upon ligand binding. The resultant increased thermal and proteolytic stability of HSA may provide greater longevity to HSA in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2561705237,"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental organisms associated with a range of infections. Reports of NTM epidemiology are mainly focused on pulmonary infections and isolations, and extrapulmonary infections are less frequently described.We conducted a retrospective study of NTM infections at the Bordeaux University Hospital, France, between January 2002 and December 2013. We used the microbiologic component of the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America's pulmonary NTM disease criteria to define cases of pulmonary NTM, and patients with isolates from a normally sterile site were classified as having extrapulmonary disease.In our setting, 170 patients were included. Pulmonary cases predominated (54.1%), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (22.9%), disseminated cases (10.6%), lymphadenitis (7.7%), bone and joint infections (2.9%) and the remaining 1.8% catheter-related infections. Overall, 16 NTM species were isolated. Mycobacterium avium (31.8%) and M. intracellulare (20%) were the most common species identified, followed by M. marinum (13.5%), M. kansasii (10.6%), M. xenopi (9.4%), rapidly growing mycobacteria (9.4%) and other slowly growing mycobacteria (5.3%). In general, NTM isolates were largely prevalent in people older than 50 (62.4%); patients aged 1-10 year-old exclusively yielded M. avium from lymph nodes, almost cases having being diagnosed after 2007. Among the 121 patients with complete follow-up, 78 (64.5%), 24 (19.8%), and 19 (15.7%) were cured, experienced relapse, or died, respectively.In our study, extrapulmonary NTM infections represented almost half of cases, consisting mainly in skin and soft tissue infections. The increase lymphadenitis cases in children after 2007 could be linked to the cessation of mandatory BCG vaccination in France. We observed similar cure rates (64%) between pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections."
https://openalex.org/W2561475202,"Pathogen exposure to sublethal doses of fungicides may result in mutations that may represent an important and largely overlooked mechanism of introducing new genetic variation into strictly clonal populations, including acquisition of fungicide resistance. We tested this hypothesis using the clonal plant pathogen, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Nine susceptible isolates were exposed independently to five commercial fungicides with different modes of action: boscalid (respiration inhibitor), iprodione (unclear mode of action), thiophanate methyl (inhibition of microtubulin synthesis) and azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin (quinone outside inhibitors). Mycelium of each isolate was inoculated onto a fungicide gradient and sub-cultured from the 50-100% inhibition zone for 12 generations and experiment repeated. Mutational changes were assessed for all isolates at six neutral microsatellite (SSR) loci and for a subset of isolates using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). SSR analysis showed 12 of 85 fungicide-exposed isolates had a total of 127 stepwise mutations with 42 insertions and 85 deletions. Most stepwise deletions were in iprodione- and azoxystrobin-exposed isolates (n = 40/85 each). Estimated mutation rates were 1.7 to 60-fold higher for mutated loci compared to that expected under neutral conditions. AFLP genotyping of 33 isolates (16 non-exposed control and 17 fungicide exposed) generated 602 polymorphic alleles. Cluster analysis with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) identified fungicide-exposed isolates as a distinct group from non-exposed control isolates (PhiPT = 0.15, P = 0.001). Dendrograms based on neighbor-joining also supported allelic variation associated with fungicide-exposure. Fungicide sensitivity of isolates measured throughout both experiments did not show consistent trends. For example, eight isolates exposed to boscalid had higher EC50 values at the end of the experiment, and when repeated, only one isolate had higher EC50 while most isolates showed no difference. Results of this support the hypothesis that sublethal fungicide stress increases mutation rates in a largely clonal plant pathogen under in vitro conditions. Collectively, this work will aid our understanding how non-lethal fungicide exposure may affect genomic variation, which may be an important mechanism of novel trait emergence, adaptation, and evolution for clonal organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2562118253,"Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into mesendoderm (ME) is directed by extrinsic signals and intrinsic epigenetic modifications. However, the dynamics of these epigenetic modifications and the mechanisms by which extrinsic signals regulate the epigenetic modifications during the initiation of ME differentiation remain elusive. In this study, we report that levels of histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) decrease during ME initiation, which is essential for subsequent differentiation induced by the combined effects of activin and Wnt signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activin mediates the H3K27me3 decrease via the Smad2-mediated reduction of EZH2 protein level. Our results suggest a two-step process of ME initiation: first, epigenetic priming via removal of H3K27me3 marks and, second, transcription activation.

https://openalex.org/W2563037145,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated mechanism that generates multiple transcripts from individual genes. It is widespread in eukaryotic genomes and provides an effective way to control gene expression. At low temperatures, AS regulates Arabidopsis clock genes through dynamic changes in the levels of productive mRNAs. We examined AS in barley clock genes to assess whether temperature-dependent AS responses also occur in a monocotyledonous crop species. We identify changes in AS of various barley core clock genes including the barley orthologues of Arabidopsis AtLHY and AtPRR7 which showed the most pronounced AS changes in response to low temperature. The AS events modulate the levels of functional and translatable mRNAs, and potentially protein levels, upon transition to cold. There is some conservation of AS events and/or splicing behaviour of clock genes between Arabidopsis and barley. In addition, novel temperature-dependent AS of the core clock gene HvPPD-H1 (a major determinant of photoperiod response and AtPRR7 orthologue) is conserved in monocots. HvPPD-H1 showed a rapid, temperature-sensitive isoform switch which resulted in changes in abundance of AS variants encoding different protein isoforms. This novel layer of low temperature control of clock gene expression, observed in two very different species, will help our understanding of plant adaptation to different environments and ultimately offer a new range of targets for plant improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2567191481,"Background 
There is great interest in repurposing the commonly prescribed anti-diabetic drug metformin for cancer therapy. Intracellular uptake and retention of metformin is affected by the expression of organic cation transporters (OCT) 1–3 and by multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) 1–2. Inside cells, metformin inhibits mitochondrial function, which leads to reduced oxygen consumption and inhibition of proliferation. Reduced oxygen consumption can lead to improved tumor oxygenation and radiation response.


Purpose 
Here we sought to determine if there is an association between the effects of metformin on inhibiting oxygen consumption, proliferation and expression of OCTs and MATEs in a panel of 19 cancer cell lines.


Results 
There was relatively large variability in the anti-proliferative response of different cell lines to metformin, with a subset of cell lines being very resistant. In contrast, all cell lines demonstrated sensitivity to the inhibition of oxygen consumption by metformin, with relatively small variation. The expression of OCT1 correlated with expression of both OCT2 and OCT3. OCT1 and OCT2 were relatively uniformly expressed, whereas expression of OCT3, MATE1 and MATE2 showed substantial variation across lines. There were statistically significant associations between resistance to inhibition of proliferation and MATE2 expression, as well as between sensitivity to inhibition of oxygen consumption and OCT3 expression. One cell line (LNCaP) with high OCT3 and low MATE2 expression in concert, had substantially higher intracellular metformin concentration than other cell lines, and was exquisitely sensitive to both anti-proliferative and anti-respiratory effects. In all other cell lines, the concentration of metformin required to inhibit oxygen consumption acutely in vitro was substantially higher than that achieved in the plasma of diabetic patients. However, administering anti-diabetic doses of metformin to tumor-bearing mice resulted in intratumoral accumulation of metformin and reduced hypoxic tumor fractions.


Conclusions 
All cancer cells are susceptible to inhibition of oxygen consumption by metformin, which results in reduced hypoxic tumor fractions beneficial for the response to radiotherapy. High MATE2 expression may result in resistance to the anti-proliferative effect of metformin and should be considered as a negative predictive biomarker in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2561039181,"Sub-zero temperatures pose a major threat to the survival of cold-climate perennials. Some of these freeze-tolerant plants produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that offer frost protection by restricting ice crystal growth and preventing expansion-induced lysis of the plasma membranes. Despite the extensive in vitro characterization of such proteins, the importance of IBPs in the freezing stress response has not been investigated. Using the freeze-tolerant grass and model crop, Brachypodium distachyon, we characterized putative IBPs (BdIRIs) and generated the first 'IBP-knockdowns'. Seven IBP sequences were identified and expressed in Escherichia coli, with all of the recombinant proteins demonstrating moderate to high levels of ice-recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity, low levels of thermal hysteresis (TH) activity (0.03-0.09°C at 1 mg/mL) and apparent adsorption to ice primary prism planes. Following plant cold acclimation, IBPs purified from wild-type B. distachyon cell lysates similarly showed high levels of IRI activity, hexagonal ice-shaping, and low levels of TH activity (0.15°C at 0.5 mg/mL total protein). The transfer of a microRNA construct to wild-type plants resulted in the attenuation of IBP activity. The resulting knockdown mutant plants had reduced ability to restrict ice-crystal growth and a 63% reduction in TH activity. Additionally, all transgenic lines were significantly more vulnerable to electrolyte leakage after freezing to -10°C, showing a 13-22% increase in released ions compared to wild-type. IBP-knockdown lines also demonstrated a significant decrease in viability following freezing to -8°C, with some lines showing only two-thirds the survival seen in control lines. These results underscore the vital role IBPs play in the development of a freeze-tolerant phenotype and suggests that expression of these proteins in frost-susceptible plants could be valuable for the production of more winter-hardy crops."

V-ATPase consists of soluble V1-ATPase and membrane-integral Vo proton channel sectors. To investigate the mechanism of V-ATPase regulation by reversible disassembly, we recently determined a cryo-EM reconstruction of yeast Vo. The structure indicated that, when V1 is released from Vo, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of subunit a (aNT) changes conformation to bind rotor subunit d.

V-ATPase can be divided into a soluble catalytic sector, V1, and a membrane-integral proton channel sector, Vo (Fig. 1). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, V1 is composed of eight different polypeptides, AB(C)DEFGH, that are arranged in an A3B3 catalytic hexamer with a central stalk made of DF and three peripheral stators (EG heterodimers), one of which binds the single-copy H subunit. The ∼320-kDa Vo contains subunits acc'c”de, which are organized in a membrane-integral “proteolipid” ring (c8c'c” (22Zhao J. Benlekbir S. Rubinstein J.L.

The stoichiometry, location, and function of subunit e are not known. Eukaryotic V-ATPase belongs to the family of energy-transducing rotary motor ion pumps that also includes F1Fo-ATP synthase, archaeal A-ATPase, and bacterial A/V-like ATPase (24Wilkens S.

Biophys. 2011; 44: 311-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In V-ATPase, ATP hydrolysis at three catalytic sites in the A3B3 hexamer is coupled to proton translocation via rotation of V1 subunits DF that are connected to the subunit d-proteolipid ring subcomplex of Vo. Proton translocation is through two aqueous half-channels at the interface of aCT and the proteolipid ring and involves membrane-embedded essential glutamate and arginine residues in the c subunits and aCT, respectively. V-ATPase function is regulated in vivo by a unique mechanism referred to as reversible disassembly, a condition under which the enzyme dissociates into membrane-bound Vo and cytoplasmic V1 sectors (26Kane P.M.

Although the resulting structural models together with biochemical data provide valuable information on the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis-driven proton pumping, we only have a limited understanding of the mechanism of reversible enzyme dissociation and reassociation. We recently obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction of yeast Vo (38Couoh-Cardel S. Milgrom E. Wilkens S. Affinity purification and structural features of the yeast vacuolar ATPase Vo membrane sector.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27959-27971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and although a comparison with EM models of holo V-ATPase showed that aNT undergoes a large structural change to bind the rotor subunit d in free Vo, the resolution of the model was insufficient to precisely define the aNT-d interface. Here we present a negative-stain 3D EM reconstruction of lipid nanodisc-reconstituted Vo calculated at a resolution of ∼15 Å. The model of nanodisc-bound Vo suggests that the interaction between aNT and subunit d is mediated by charge complementation between acidic and basic residues on d and aNT, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments conducted with recombinant subunits identified acidic and basic patches on d and aNT that mediate the aNT-d interaction. A comparison with the recent EM reconstructions of yeast V-ATPase in three states (22Zhao J. Benlekbir S. Rubinstein J.L. Electron cryomicroscopy observation of rotational states in a eukaryotic V-ATPase.Nature. 2015; 521: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) suggests that, upon enzyme dissociation, free Vo is halted in state 3. We showed previously that autoinhibited, membrane-detached V1-ATPase is halted in state 2 (45Oot R.A. Kane P.M. Berry E.A. Wilkens S. Crystal structure of yeast V1-ATPase in the autoinhibited state.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 1694-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and we propose that this conformational mismatch to state 3 Vo could function to prevent unintended reassembly of holo V-ATPase under conditions when the proton pumping activity of the enzyme is not needed. We previously developed a procedure for purification of milligram amounts of yeast V-ATPase Vo sector for functional and structural studies (38Couoh-Cardel S. Milgrom E. Wilkens S. Affinity purification and structural features of the yeast vacuolar ATPase Vo membrane sector.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27959-27971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, Vo was solubilized from vacuolar membranes and affinity-captured via a calmodulin binding peptide fused to the C terminus of the vacuole-specific isoform of subunit a (Vph1p). For structural studies under more native-like conditions, Vo was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). Purified detergent-solubilized Vo (Fig. 2a) was mixed with Escherichia coli polar lipids and the recombinant membrane scaffold protein MSP1E3D1 (Fig. 2b), followed by detergent removal with polystyrene beads. In a final purification step, Vo-containing nanodiscs (VoND) were separated from “empty” discs by a second calmodulin affinity binding step followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 column (Fig. 2, c and d). Peak fractions of VoND eluted from the gel filtration column were pooled, and the concentrated preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 2e). We initially generated a dataset of ∼30,000 particles from EM images of negatively stained VoND. However, attempts to reconstruct a 3D model of the complex using reference-free algorithms were unsuccessful, likely because of the limited size of the complex and the lack of characteristic features required for alignment. Models did not converge on a specific handedness, i.e. orientation of aNT with respect to the membrane sector, and density for aNT was smeared out over the membrane and did not allow us to distinguish its positioning relative to subunit d. We therefore decided to make use of the calmodulin binding peptide on the C terminus of subunit a to introduce an additional asymmetry to aid in alignments and angle determination in the 3D startup procedure. Purified calmodulin (CaM) was incubated with VoND, followed by removal of excess CaM using glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2, f–h). Negative stain electron microscopy showed that the final VoND-CaM preparation was monodisperse, with an average diameter of the particles of ∼12 nm (Fig. 3a). A dataset of ∼40,000 particles, generated from 380 micrographs such as shown in Fig. 3a, was subjected to reference-free alignment procedures as implemented in EMAN2. Fig. 3b shows class averages of side, top, and intermediate view projections (center row), representative raw particle images (top row), and the corresponding reprojections of the final 3D model (bottom row). Class averages, including those shown in Fig. 3b, were used for a 3D startup procedure in EMAN2, and the resulting 3D reconstruction was refined until stable. At this point, the reconstruction was strongly low pass-filtered and used as input for the 3D autorefinement procedure as implemented in the Relion 1.3 software package. The model was then refined until no further improvement was observed. The resolution of the final VoND-CaM 3D reconstruction was estimated to be 14.9 Å (20.3 Å at 0.5 correlation) using the “gold standard” FSC protocol as implemented in Relion 1.3 (Fig. 3c). The final VoND-CaM model was strongly low pass-filtered to serve as a reference for a new VoND dataset (∼47,000 images) using the Relion 3D autorefinement procedure as described for the VoND-CaM dataset. The 3D autorefinement converged to a final model of VoND with an estimated gold standard resolution of ∼14.9 Å (16.3 Å at 0.5 correlation, Fig. 3d). As can be seen from Fig. 3, c and d, the final VoND-CaM and VoND models are very similar except for a small density in the VoND-CaM map that is due to the CaM bound at the a subunit C terminus (Fig. 3c, top panel, red circle). However, because the VoND-CaM map showed slightly more detail, we used this model to illustrate the features of nanodisc-bound Vo as summarized in Fig. 4. Side, top, and bottom views of the VoND-CaM model are illustrated in Fig. 4, a–c, showing the characteristic features as seen in earlier reconstructions of bovine (44Wilkens S. Forgac M.

Semiautomatic fitting of homology models of the yeast Vo subunits into the EM density is summarized in Fig. 4, d–f. As illustrated in Fig. 4, d and e, aNT (blue) was positioned with its proximal lobe (which is comprised by the N and C termini of subunit a, domain nomenclature as in Ref. 46Srinivasan S. Vyas N.K.

Because of its pseudo-3-fold symmetry and the limited resolution of the EM reconstruction, the yeast subunit d homology model could be fit in three orientations corresponding to rotational states 1, 2, and 3, as seen in the recent cryo-EM reconstructions of intact yeast V-ATPase (22Zhao J. Benlekbir S. Rubinstein J.L. Electron cryomicroscopy observation of rotational states in a eukaryotic V-ATPase.Nature. 2015; 521: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, only the orientation corresponding to state 3 preserved the contact between the subunit d N-terminal α helix and the cytoplasmic face of the c subunit ring, as seen in the recent cryo-EM model of holo V-ATPase in state 3 (22Zhao J.

LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory mechanisms driving such expression.We implemented Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry analyses to investigate fatty acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1 encoded protein) expression in subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant human tissues. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed to initially investigate modulatory mechanisms of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA knockdown in vitro model system was used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion on peroxisome function.FAMIN expression was detected in macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells and several human tissues, being highest in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells among peripheral blood cells. Subcellular co-localization was exclusively confined to peroxisomes, with some additional positivity for organelle endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression signatures were enriched for genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN expression in in vitro model systems.FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary role(s) in macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may be modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be elucidated."

The polysaccharide, with an average molecular weight of about 283 kDa, also contains 10.8% protein. Atomic force microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses revealed that CFPS-1 has a backbone of 1,6-linked and 1,4,6-linked-α-D-Glc, which is terminated with a 1-linked-α-D-Man residue at the O-4 position of 1,4,6-linked-α-D-Glc, in a molar ratio of 3:1:1. Preliminary in vitro bioactivity tests revealed that CFPS-1 effectively and dose-dependently inhibits human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth, with an IC50 of 243 ± 6.79 and 1142 ± 14.84 μg/mL, respectively. In MCF-7, CFPS-1 produced a significant up-regulation of p53, p21, Bax and cleaved caspase-7 and down-regulation of Cdk4, cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and caspase-7. These effects resulted in cell cycle blockade at the S-phase and apoptosis induction. In contrast, in MDA-MB-231, with limited degree of change in cell cycle distribution, CFPS-1 increases the proportion of cells in apoptotic sub-G1 phase executed by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and caspase-7 and up-regulation of Bax and cleaved caspase-7.

This event is important as bicarbonate/CO2 is determinant for several redox and enzymatic reactions, in addition to pH regulation. Until now, most work done on the role of bicarbonate in ischemia-reperfusion injury focused on pH changes; although reperfusion solutions have a fixed pH, cardiac resuscitation protocols commonly employ bicarbonate to correct the profound acidosis associated with respiratory arrest. However, we previously showed that bicarbonate can increase tissue damage and protein oxidative damage independent of pH. Here we show the molecular basis of bicarbonate-induced reperfusion damage: the presence of bicarbonate selectively impairs mitophagy, with no detectable effect on autophagy, proteasome activity, reactive oxygen species production or protein oxidation. We also show that inhibition of autophagy reproduces the effects of bicarbonate in reperfusion injury, providing additional evidence in support of this mechanism. This phenomenon is especially important because bicarbonate is widely used in resuscitation protocols after cardiac arrest, and while effective as a buffer, may also contribute to myocardial injury."

Improvement in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that cause neurovascular complications, particularly in type 2 diabetes. Recent studies demonstrate that rodents fed a high fat diet exhibit retinal dysfunction concomitant with attenuated Akt phosphorylation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a high fat/high sucrose diet on retinal insulin signaling and evaluate the mechanism(s) responsible for the changes. Mice fed a high fat/sucrose diet exhibited attenuated Akt phosphorylation in the retina as compared with mice fed normal chow. Retinas of mice fed a high fat/sucrose diet also exhibited elevated levels of activated JNK as well as enhanced p70S6K1 autoinhibitory domain phosphorylation. In cells, JNK activation enhanced p70S6K1 phosphorylation and mTORC1-dependent activation of the kinase, as evidenced by enhanced phosphorylation of key substrates. Rictor phosphorylation by p70S6K1 was specifically enhanced by the addition of phosphomimetic mutations in the autoinhibitory domain and was more sensitive to inhibition of the kinase as compared with rpS6. Notably, rictor and IRS-1 phosphorylation by p70S6K1 attenuate insulin action through a negative feedback pathway. Indeed, p70S6K1 inhibition prevented the repressive effect of JNK activation on insulin action in retinas. Overall, the results identify the JNK/S6K1 axis as a key molecular mechanism whereby a high fat/sucrose diet impairs insulin action in retina.

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in working age Americans. Almost everyone with type 1 diabetes and most people with type 2 diabetes develop retinopathy within two decades of disease onset (1Fong D.S. Aiello L.P. Ferris 3rd, F.L. Klein R. Diabetic retinopathy.Diabetes Care. 2004; 27: 2540-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The incidence of type 2 diabetes is rapidly on the rise and accounts for up to 95% of diabetes prevalence (2U. S. Department of Health and Human ServiceNational Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014: Estimates of Diabetes and Its Burden in the United States. 2014; (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Diabetes Translation, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention): 9Google Scholar). However, the overwhelming majority of experimental studies on diabetic retinopathy have been performed using animal models of type 1 diabetes. Development of type 2 diabetes is associated with consumption of a diet containing high fat and sucrose content, which has become extremely common in Western populations (3Parillo M. Riccardi G. Diet composition and the risk of type 2 diabetes: epidemiological and clinical evidence.Br. J. Nutr. 2004; 92: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study we set out to investigate potential mechanisms whereby a Western diet contributes to diabetes-induced vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by a combination of hyperglycemia and a reduction in insulin-mediated signaling, which results in neurovascular changes in the retina. Insulin provides a protective neurotrophic stimulus to retina by activating the protein kinase Akt through a signaling pathway involving the insulin receptor substrate 1/2 (IRS1/2) 2The abbreviations used are: IRS1/2insulin receptor substrate 1/2PDK1phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1mTORC2mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in complex 2p70S6K170-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1D3ES411D/S418D/T421E/S424DDKOdouble knock-outMEFmouse embryonic fibroblasts.

In response to insulin, the activation loop of Akt is phosphorylated at Thr-308 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (5Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

In addition to mTORC2, insulin also promotes activation of mTORC1 and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1). Chronic activation of p70S6K1 induces cellular insulin resistance by a mechanism known as the “negative-feedback loop” (9Shah O.J. Wang Z. Hunter T.

Like other AGC kinases, p70S6K1 has a bilobal fold structure with coordinating N- and C-terminal lobes (13Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol.

When dephosphorylated, a basic pseudo-substrate domain within the C-terminal lobe serves an autoinhibitory role by blocking the kinase domain (16Banerjee P. Ahmad M.F. Grove J.R. Kozlosky C.

Phosphorylation of the pseudo-substrate domain relieves autoinhibition of the kinase by inducing a conformational change that allows for subsequent phosphorylation by mTORC1 and PDK1 at Thr-389 and Thr-229, respectively (17Price D.J. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Avruch J. Insulin-activated protein kinases phosphorylate a pseudosubstrate synthetic peptide inhibitor of the p70 S6 kinase.J. Biol.

The chronic inflammatory response associated with type 2 diabetes is characterized by abnormal cytokine production and activation of JNK (20Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Görgün C.Z. Uysal K.T.

Inflammation in diabetic retinopathy.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2011; 30: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Mice consuming a high fat diet exhibit early inflammasome activation within inner retinal layers and induction of JNK (22Rajagopal R. Bligard G.W. Zhang S. Yin L. Lukasiewicz P. Semenkovich C.F. Functional deficits precede structural lesions in mice with high fat diet-induced diabetic retinopathy.Diabetes. 2016; 65: 1072-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK by proinflammatory cytokines inhibits insulin action at least in part by promoting inhibitory serine phosphorylation and degradation of IRS1/2 (23Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L.

Thus, the inhibitory effects of JNK activation on insulin action are potentially mediated through enhanced p70S6K1 activation. In this regard, both p70S6K1 (24Tremblay F. Brûlé S. Hee Um S. Li Y.

Recent studies demonstrate high fat diet-induced retinal degeneration (25Marçal A.C. Leonelli M. Fiamoncini J. Deschamps F.C. Rodrigues M.A. Curi R. Carpinelli A.R. Britto L.R. Carvalho C.R.

Sci. 2015; 56: 2367-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in rodent models of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, these studies show attenuation of Akt phosphorylation in synaptic layers of the retina concomitant with high fat diet-induced retinal dysfunction (25Marçal A.C. Leonelli M. Fiamoncini J. Deschamps F.C. Rodrigues M.A. Curi R. Carpinelli A.R. Britto L.R. Carvalho C.R. Diet-induced obesity impairs AKT signalling in the retina and causes retinal degeneration.Cell Biochem.

Sci. 2015; 56: 2367-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The attenuation of Akt phosphorylation is most clearly observed in the outer segments of the outer plexiform layer, which is made up of synapses between photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells. The goal of the present study was to assess the development of insulin resistance in the retina of mice fed a Western diet (i.e. one containing high fat and sucrose content) using phosphorylation of Akt as a biomarker and to evaluate the mechanism(s) responsible for the observed changes. In support of the previous reports, we found that Akt phosphorylation was attenuated in the retina of mice after 2-weeks of consuming a Western diet. Of significance, the retina of mice fed a Western diet exhibited activated JNK as well as enhanced phosphorylation of p70S6K1 at Thr-421/Ser-424. We also present evidence that activation of the JNK signaling pathway represses insulin action through phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K1. Indeed, p70S6K1 inhibition was sufficient to prevent the repressive effect of JNK activation on insulin action in explant retinas. Mice fed a Western diet for 2-weeks exhibited slightly elevated but not statistically different body weight (25.5 ± 1.1 versus 23.8 ± 0.6 g; p = 0.23) and blood glucose concentrations (189.5 ± 27.7 versus 163.5 ± 28.0 mg/dl; p = 0.53) as compared with mice receiving a control chow diet. Activation of Akt was assessed in the retina by examining its phosphorylation state. Phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 was attenuated in the retina of mice fed a Western diet for 2-weeks, as compared with mice receiving a control chow diet (Fig. 1A). One potential mechanism responsible for attenuated Akt phosphorylation is activation of JNK, which has been implicated in the development of complications associated with type 2 diabetes (20Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Görgün C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. A central role for JNK in obesity and insulin resistance.Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). Although the relative phosphorylation of JNK on Thr-183/Tyr-185 was similar (Fig. 1B), JNK expression was enhanced in the retina of mice fed a Western diet (Fig. 1C). Thus, phosphorylated JNK (Fig. 1D) as well as phosphorylation of its most well established substrate, c-Jun (Fig. 1E), were both enhanced in the retina of mice fed a Western diet. Phosphorylation of p70S6K1 on Thr-421/Ser-424 (Fig. 1F) and Thr-389 (Fig. 1G) was also elevated in the retina of mice fed a Western diet as compared with mice receiving a control diet. To assess the effect of a Western diet on p70S6K1 activity, we evaluated phosphorylation of rpS6 and rictor. As expected, phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser-240/244 (Fig. 1H) and rictor on Thr-1135 (Fig. 1I) was enhanced in the retina of mice fed a Western diet, as compared with mice fed a control diet. To further investigate the effect of JNK activation on p70S6K1, HEK293E cells were chosen as a model system to directly manipulate these signaling pathways. After serum deprivation to reduce p70S6K1 phosphorylation, cells were treated with the JNK agonist anisomycin and/or insulin. Anisomycin enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser-63 (Fig. 2A), whereas both insulin and anisomycin promoted p70S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr-421/Ser-424 (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with our report that JNK and mTORC1 coordinate phosphorylation of the p70S6K1 C-terminal domain (19Martin T.D. Dennis M.D. Gordon B.S. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. mTORC1 and JNK coordinate phosphorylation of the p70S6K1 autoinhibitory domain in skeletal muscle following functional overloading.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 306: E1397-E1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, administration of either insulin or anisomycin enhanced p70S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr-389 (Fig. 2C). Moreover, p70S6K1 phosphorylation at both Thr-421/424 and Thr-389 was increased to a greater extent in response to combined insulin and anisomycin treatment as compared with either one (Fig. 2, B and C). We assessed the effect of JNK activation on p70S6K1 activity by evaluating phosphorylation of rpS6, rictor, and eIF4B as well as expression of PDCD4. When cells were treated with either insulin or anisomycin, phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser-240/244 was enhanced (Fig. 2D). Moreover, both insulin and anisomycin enhanced rictor phosphorylation on Thr-1135 (Fig. 2E) and eIF4B phosphorylation on Ser-422 (Fig. 2F); however, the effect of anisomycin on these sites was less than that of insulin alone, and no additive effect of insulin and anisomycin was observed. Phosphorylation of PDCD4 by p70S6K1 leads to its proteasome-dependent degradation (27Dorrello N.V. Peschiaroli A. Guardavaccaro D. Colburn N.H. Sherman N.E. Pagano M. S6K1- and βTRCP-mediated degradation of PDCD4 promotes protein translation and cell growth.Science. 2006; 314: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). PDCD4 expression was reduced after administration of either insulin or anisomycin, and the effects were synergistic (Fig. 2G). Notably, anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of rpS6, rictor, eIF4B, and degradation of PDCD4 were absent in cells deficient for S6K1/2 (Fig. 2H). Overall, these findings demonstrate that JNK activation modulates phosphorylation of various p70S6K1 substrates. To further evaluate the role of JNK in activation of p70S6K1, we expressed a fusion protein composed of JNK1 and its activating kinase, MKK7, that allows for constitutive phosphorylation and activation of the expressed JNK1 (28Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. The Bax subfamily of Bcl2-related proteins is essential for apoptotic signal transduction by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). As a negative control, we used a variant of the fusion protein with mutations in the activating JNK1 phosphorylation sites (Thr-183/Tyr-185) that results in a JNK1 variant that cannot be activated (referred to hereafter as inactive JNK) (28Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. The Bax subfamily of Bcl2-related proteins is essential for apoptotic signal transduction by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). To ensure that mTORC1 signaling was active, cells were deprived of serum for 2 h and then treated with IGF1 to activate the kinase. As shown in Fig. 3A, IGF1 potently activated mTORC1, as assessed by phosphorylation of p70S6K1 and its downstream targets. Interestingly, IGF1 and anisomycin acted in an additive manner to promote phosphorylation of rictor and eIF4B but not rpS6 (Fig. 3A). Similarly, expression of active, but not inactive JNK enhanced p70S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-421/Thr-424 as well as phosphorylation of rictor and eIF4B, but not rpS6, in IGF1-treated cells (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, knockdown of JNK with siRNA attenuated p70S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr-421/Ser-424 as well as phosphorylation of rpS6, rictor, and eIF4B (Fig. 3C). Similarly, anisomycin failed to promote phosphorylation of the p70S6K1 autoinhibitory domain or activation of the kinase in JNK1-deficient cells (Fig. 3D). Because both mTORC1 and JNK can phosphorylate the p70S6K1 autoinhibitory domain, we evaluated the role of mTORC1 in JNK-dependent activation of p70S6K1. Cells were treated with anisomycin in combination with either the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or the mTORC1/2 inhibitor TORIN2. As expected, inhibition of mTORC1 attenuated but did not prevent the anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K1 on Thr-421/Ser-424 (Fig. 3E). Notably, although treatment with rapamycin or TORIN2 had no effect on anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of JNK or c-Jun, both compounds dramatically attenuated phosphorylation of rpS6, rictor, and eIF4B (Fig. 3E). These findings suggest that JNK activation modulates p70S6K1 activity in an mTORC1-dependent manner. It was previously demonstrated that phosphorylation sites in the autoinhibitory domain of p70S6K1 promoted its phosphorylation at Thr-229 by PDK1 and enhanced activity of the kinase toward rpS6 C-terminal peptides in vitro (29Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Phosphorylation and activation of p70s6k by PDK1.Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Importantly, mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of the linker domain at Thr-389 is necessary for activation loop phosphorylation at Thr-229 and, thus, activity of the kinase (30Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Phosphorylation sites in the autoinhibitory domain participate in p70(s6k) activation loop phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In agreement with these previous studies, mutation of Thr-389 to a phosphomimetic Glu residue was sufficient to promote p70S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr-229 even in cells deprived of serum and treated with rapamycin to prevent Thr-389 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when combined with the T389E mutation, phosphomimetic substitutions in the autoinhibitory domain (i.e. S411D/S418D/T421E/S424D also known as D3E) enhanced Thr-229 phosphorylation to a greater extent compared with T389E alone. To determine the effect of these variant constructs on signaling downstream of p70S6K1, we assessed rpS6, rictor, and eIF4B phosphorylation. The overall level of rpS6 (Fig. 4B), rictor (Fig. 4C), and eIF4B (Fig. 4D) phosphorylation was greatest with expression of the T389E/D3E variant, whereas phosphorylation of these substrates by the T389A/D3E variant was not different from wild-type p70S6K1. However, in combination with T389E, the D3E mutation did not enhance phosphorylation of rpS6 or eIF4B as compared with T389E alone. Alternatively, rictor phosphorylation at Thr-1135 was enhanced by the D3E/T389E variant as compared with the T389E variant (Fig. 4C). Thus, phosphorylation of the p70S6K1 autoinhibitory domain may be particularly important with regards to phosphorylation of rictor. Many multitarget protein kinases exhibit variability in their Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) for different substrates. An estimate of the Km of a kinase for its substrates can be obtained by treating cells with various concentrations of a selective kinase inhibitor and subsequently assessing the phosphorylation of downstream targets (e.g. Ref. (31Kang S.A. Pacold M.E. Cervantes C.L. Lim D. Lou H.J. Ottina K. Gray N.S. Turk B.E. Yaffe M.B. Sabatini D.M. mTORC1 phosphorylation sites encode their sensitivity to starvation and rapamycin.Science. 2013; 341: 1236566Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the p70S6K1-specific inhibitor PF-4708671, and phosphorylation of rictor was compared with that of rpS6. In cells maintained in complete culture media, phosphorylation of rictor exhibited increased sensitivity toward PF-4708671 as compared with phosphorylation of rpS6 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, when cells were serum-deprived and stimulated with anisomycin, a much lower concentration of PF-4708671 was sufficient to attenuate phosphorylation of rictor as compared with rpS6 (Fig. 5B). Moreover, insulin and/or anisomycin promoted rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser-240/244 in cells treated with PF-470861; however, the effect was attenuated as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5C). Alternatively, insulin and anisomycin failed to enhance rictor phosphorylation in cells treated with PF-470861. Overall, the results suggest that p70S6K1 has less affinity for rictor as compared with rpS6. It has been previously demonstrated that p70S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of rictor at Thr-1135 suppresses mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation and activation of Akt (12Dibble C.C. Asara J.M. Manning B.D. Characterization of Rictor phosphorylation sites reveals direct regulation of mTOR complex 2 by S6K1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5657-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Based on the finding that rictor phosphorylation was more sensitive to modulation of the kinase activity as compared with rpS6, we investigated the hypothesis that JNK attenuates insulin action by enhancing p70S6K1 activity. Expression of active JNK repressed insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 (Fig. 6A). Similarly, when cells were treated with anisomycin, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 was also attenuated (Fig. 6B). In addition to rictor phosphorylation, p70S6K1 also represses insulin action and thus Akt phosphorylation through inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (9Shah O.J. Wang Z. Hunter T. Inappropriate activation of the TSC/Rheb/mTOR/S6K cassette induces IRS1/2 depletion, insulin resistance, and cell survival deficiencies.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1650-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with anisomycin, phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser-636/639 was enhanced (Fig. 6C). Similarly, phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-636/639 was elevated in the retina of mice fed a Western diet (Fig. 6D), consistent with the idea that activation of the JNK/S6K1 axis promotes negative feedback. Importantly, the effect of anisomycin on IRS-1 phosphorylation was absent in cells deficient for S6K1/2, showing that JNK1-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation requires these proteins (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, the effect of anisomycin on IRS-1 phosphorylation was attenuated by either rapamycin or TORIN2 (Fig. 6F) in a manner that was consistent with p70S6K1 substrate phosphorylation observed in Fig. 3D. This supports the previous report that mTOR and JNK play coordinating roles in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation (32Hiratani K. Haruta T. Tani A. Kawahara J. Usui I. Kobayashi M. Roles of mTOR and JNK in serine phosphorylation, translocation, and degradation of IRS-1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The repressive effect of JNK activation on Akt phosphorylation is further supported by the finding that in combination with IGF1, anisomycin enhanced IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-636/639 and prevented Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 (Fig. 6G). To further explore how p70S6K1 phosphorylation is enhanced over time, leading to repressed Akt phosphorylation, we performed a time-course where cells were treated with insulin in the presence or absence of anisomycin. Whereas insulin caused a progressive enhancement in p70S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr-421/Ser-424 over 60 min, the combination of insulin and anisomycin maximally enhanced p70S6K1 phosphoryla"
https://openalex.org/W2562184332,"Skin is protected by a tough but flexible multilayered barrier and is a front line for immune responses against invading particles. For many years now, skin has been a tissue where certain vaccines are injected for the prevention of infectious disease, however, the detailed mechanisms of the skin immune response are not yet well understood. Using thin and small injection needles, we carefully injected OVA into a restricted region of mouse skin, i.e., intradermal (ID), and examined the antibody response in comparison with subcutaneous (SC) injection or epicutaneous patch administration of OVA. Epicutaneous patches induced a high IgE response against OVA, but IgG production was low. High IgG production was induced by both ID and SC injection, moreover, ID injection induced higher IgG production without any adjutants. Furthermore, OVA-specific IgE production was diminished by ID injection. We found that ID injection could efficiently stimulate skin resident DCs, drive Th1-biased conditions and diminish IgE production. The ID injection response was regulated by Langerin+ dermal DCs, because OVA was taken up mainly by these cells and, after transiently deleting them, the IgE response was no longer diminished and IgG1 production was enhanced. We also tested whether ID injection might be an effective allergy treatment by attempting to inhibit ongoing IgE production in mice with experimentally induced high serum IgE levels. Multiple ID injections of OVA were shown to prevent elevation of serum OVA-specific IgE after repeated allergen challenge. In contrast, SC OVA injection could only transiently inhibit the OVA-specific IgE production. These findings indicated that ID injection results in higher induction of antigen-specific IgG, and thus may be useful for vaccine delivery with little or no adjuvant components. Moreover, the observed diminishment of IgE and induction of Th1-biased immune responses suggest that ID may be a useful injection route for allergy immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2567205839,"DNA from apoptotic cancer cells, present in the circulation, has the potential to facilitate genomic profiling and disease monitoring. However, only low fractions of total cell-free DNA originates from cancer cells, limiting the applicability of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Optimal sample processing is consequently of uttermost importance. Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro stability of ctDNA.Blood was collected in 10 ml EDTA or Streck tubes. Three conditions (EDTA and Streck tubes in room temperature, EDTA tubes at five degrees) and four time points (plasma harvested from blood aliquots of each 10 ml tube in a time series up to 24 h) were investigated. Each condition was evaluated in five metastatic prostate cancer patients. Subsequently, three additional patients were collected enabling investigation of the in vitro stability in EDTA tubes up to 48 h.The in vitro stability of ctDNA was interrogated by low-pass whole genome sequencing which allows for the identification of somatic copy-number alterations (CNAs). In silico simulations demonstrated that non-parametric testing could detect a 1% contamination by white blood cell DNA. Mutational profiling was performed by targeted, in-solution based hybridization capture and subsequent sequencing. The allelic fraction of individual mutations was used as an estimate of the in vitro stability.Somatic CNAs were detected in all patients. Surprisingly, the ctDNA levels at zero hours were not significantly different to 24 or 48 hour in vitro incubation in any investigated condition. Subsequently, mutational profiling corroborated the conclusions from the CNA analysis.The stability of ctDNA simplifies logistics without the requirement of immediate processing or applying fixatives to prevent white blood cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2566232500,"Extra-esophageal carcinogenesis has been widely discussed in relation to the chronic effects of laryngopharyngeal reflux and most prominently with pepsin historically central to this discussion. With refluxate known to include gastric (pepsin) and duodenal (bile) fluids, we recently demonstrated the mechanistic role of NF-κB in mediating the preneoplastic effects of acidic-bile. However, the role of pepsin in promoting hypopharyngeal premalignant events remains historically unclear. Here, we investigate the in vitro effect of acidic-pepsin on the NF-κB oncogenic pathway to better define its potential role in hypopharyngeal neoplasia.Human hypopharyngeal primary cells (HHPC) and keratinocytes (HHK) were repetitively exposed to physiologic pepsin concentrations (0.1 mg/ml) at pH 4.0, 5.0 and 7.0. Cellular localization of phospho-NF-κB and bcl-2 was determined using immunofluorescence and western blotting. NF-κB transcriptional activity was tested by luc reporter and qPCR. Analysis of DNA content of pepsin treated HHK and HHPC was performed using Fluorescence-activated-cell sorting assay. To explore a possible dose related effect, pepsin concentration was reduced from 0.1 to 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml.At physiologic concentration, acidic-pepsin (0.1 mg/ml at pH 4.0) is lethal to most normal hypopharyngeal cells. However, in surviving cells, no NF-κB transcriptional activity is noted. Acidic-pepsin fails to activate the NF-κB or bcl-2, TNF-α, EGFR, STAT3, and wnt5α but increases the Tp53 mRNAs, in both HHPC and HHK. Weakly acidic-pepsin (pH 5.0) and neutral-pepsin (pH 7.0) induce mild activation of NF-κB with increase in TNF-α mRNAs, without oncogenic transcriptional activity. Lower concentrations of pepsin at varying pH do not produce NF-κB activity or transcriptional activation of the analyzed genes.Our findings in vitro do not support the role of acidic-pepsin in NF-κB related hypopharyngeal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2561011083,"Background The pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an independent predictor of prognosis in various malignancies, but its predictive capacity in basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (BSCCE) remains unclear. We aim to determine the value of the inflammation-related factors, including the NLR, neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR), and albumin levels, in predicting BSCCE prognosis. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the records of 121 patients with pathologically diagnosed BSCCE that underwent a curative esophagectomy from January 2007 to December 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results The preoperative NLR was correlated with the tumor length and NMR. In OS univariate analyses, a high NLR (>1.77), high NMR (>12.31), and low albumin (≤40.0 g/L) level were significantly associated with a poorer survival in BSCCE. The median OS was significantly greater in low NLR (≤1.77) than in the high NLR (>1.77) patients (51.0 vs. 31.0 months; P = 0.008). In multivariate analyses, only the NLR was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.030; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.262–3.264; P = 0.003). A high NLR was also an independent predictor of a poorer RFS in BSCCE (HR, 2.222; 95% CI, 1.407–3.508; P = 0.001); the median RFS for low (≤1.77) and high (> 1.77) NLR patients was 44.0 months and 14.0 months, respectively. NLR remained a strong prognostic indicator for OS in stage I/II patients and a preoperative NLR>1.77 was predictive of a poor RFS in both stage I/II and stage III patients. Conclusions We show that the preoperative NLR, a convenient and cost-effective biomarker, may serve as a prognostic indicator for BSCCE patients following curative surgery."

Methods Forty-five guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups: control, form deprivation myopia (FDM) and flickering light induced myopia (FLM) groups(n = 15 for each group). The right eyes of the FDM group were covered with semitransparent hemispherical plastic shells serving as eye diffusers. Guinea pigs in FLM group were raised with illumination of a duty cycle of 50% at a flash frequency of 0.5Hz. The refractive status, axial length (AL), corneal radius of curvature(CRC) were measured by streak retinoscope, A-scan ultrasonography and keratometer, respectively. Ultramicroscopy images were taken by electron microscopy. The concentrations of 5-HTin the retina, vitreous body and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, the retinal 5-HT2A receptor expression was evaluated by immunohistofluorescence and western blot. Results The refraction of FDM and FLM eyes became myopic from some time point (the 4th week and the 6th week, respectively) in the course of the experiment, which was indicated by significantly decreased refraction and longer AL when compared with the controls (p<0.05). The concentrations of 5-HT in the retina, vitreous body and RPE of FDM and FLM eyes were significantly increased in comparison with those of control eyes (both p<0.05). Similar to FDM eyes, the expression of retinal 5-HT2A receptor in FLM eyes was significantly up-regulated compared to that of control eyes (both p<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that retinal 5-HT2A receptor level elevated less in the FLM eyes than that in the FDM eyes. Moreover, the levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in FDM and FLM groups generally decreased when compared with control groups (all p<0.05). Conclusions Constant flickering light could cause progressive myopia in guinea pigs. 5-HT and 5-HT2A receptor increased both in form deprivation myopia and flickering light induced myopia, indicating that 5-HT possibly involved in myopic development via binding to5-HT2A receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2562082515,"Non-syndromic kyphosis is a common disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and has a strong genetic involvement; however, the causative genes remain to be identified, as such studies are hampered by genetic heterogeneity, small families and various modes of inheritance. To overcome these limitations, we investigated 12 week old progeny of mice treated with the chemical mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) using phenotypic assessments including dysmorphology, radiography, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. This identified a mouse with autosomal recessive kyphosis (KYLB). KYLB mice, when compared to unaffected littermates, had: thoraco-lumbar kyphosis, larger vertebrae, and increased body length and increased bone area. In addition, female KYLB mice had increases in bone mineral content and plasma alkaline phosphatase activity. Recombination mapping localized the Kylb locus to a 5.5Mb region on chromosome 15A1, which contained 51 genes, including the natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (Npr3) gene. DNA sequence analysis of Npr3 identified a missense mutation, Tyr209Asn, which introduced an N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence. Expression of wild-type NPR3 and the KYLB-associated Tyr209Asn NPR3 mutant in COS-7 cells demonstrated the mutant to be associated with abnormal N-linked glycosylation and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum that resulted in its absence from the plasma membrane. NPR3 is a decoy receptor for C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which also binds to NPR2 and stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, thereby increasing the number and size of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Histomorphometric analysis of KYLB vertebrae and tibiae showed delayed endochondral ossification and expansion of the hypertrophic zones of the growth plates, and immunohistochemistry revealed increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation throughout the growth plates of KYLB vertebrae. Thus, we established a model of kyphosis due to a novel NPR3 mutation, in which loss of plasma membrane NPR3 expression results in increased MAPK pathway activation, causing elongation of the vertebrae and resulting in kyphosis."

This study aimed to determine the impact of establishing standards of health promoting hospitals on hospital indicators in Shahroud. This applied study was a quasi-experimental one which was conducted in 2013. Standards of health promoting hospitals were established as an intervention procedure in the Fatemiyeh hospital. Parameters of health promoting hospitals were compared in intervention and control hospitals before and after of intervention (6 months). The data were analyzed using chi-square and t-test. With the establishment of standards for health promotion hospitals, standard scores in intervention and control hospitals were found to be 72.26 ± 4.1 and 16.26 ± 7.5, respectively. T-test showed a significant difference between the mean scores of the hospitals under study (P = 0.001).The chi-square test also showed a significant relationship between patient satisfaction before and after the intervention so that patients' satisfaction was higher after the intervention (P = 0.001). Commenting on the short-term or long-term positive impacts of establishing standards of health promoting hospitals on all hospital indicators is a bit difficult but preliminary results show the positive impact of the implementation of standards in case hospitals which has led to the improvement of many indicators in the hospital."

Accurate segmentation of the basal RPE and BM was achieved using custom software. The en face OCT images from eyes with isolated interdigitation or ellipsoid zone pathology were of similar quality between custom software and Heidelberg Eye Explorer software in the absence of any other significant outer retinal pathology. En face OCT images demonstrated angioid streaks, lesions of acute macular neuroretinopathy, hydroxychloroquine toxicity and Bietti crystalline deposits that correlated with other imaging modalities.Graph-search theory algorithm helps to overcome the limitations of outer retinal segmentation inaccuracies in commercial software. En face OCT images can provide detailed topography of the reflectivity within a specific layer of the retina which correlates with other forms of fundus imaging. Our results highlight the need for standardization of image reflectivity to facilitate quantification of en face OCT images and longitudinal analysis."

However, there is a paucity of information on the nature of kinematic change that occur with aging prior to the development of OA, This study applied a robust statistical method (Principal Component Analysis) to test the hypothesis that coupling between primary (flexion) and secondary (anterior-posterior translation, internal-external rotation) joint motions in walking would differ for age groupings of healthy subjects. Methods Seventy-four healthy participants divided into three groups with mean ages of 24 ± 2.3 years (younger), 48 ± 4.7years (middle-age) and 64 ± 2.4 years (older) were examined. Principal Component Analysis was used to characterize and statistically compare the patterns of knee joint movement and their relationships in walking. Results There were significant differences between the younger group and both the middle-age and older groups in the knee frontal plane angle and the coupling between knee flexion (PC1, p≤0.04) and the relative magnitudes of secondary plane motions in early and late stance (PC3, p<0.01). Two additional principal components (PC2, p = 0.03 and PC5, p<0.01) described differences in early stance knee flexion and relationship with secondary plane motion through-out stance for the older compared with middle-age group. Conclusions It appears there are changes in knee kinematics that occur with aging. The kinematic differences were identified for middle-aged as well as older adults suggesting midlife changes in neuromuscular physiology or behavior may have important consequences. These kinematic measures offer the potential to identify early markers for the risk of developing knee OA with aging."

This is especially important as climate change, pollution, and overfishing change the structure and functioning of pelagic ecosystems. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical spatial-temporal models to map the Essential Fish Habitats of the Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the waters around Isla del Coco National Park, Pacific Costa Rica, based on independent underwater observations from 1993 to 2013. We assessed if observed changes in the distribution and abundance of this species are related with habitat characteristics, fishing intensity or more extreme climatic events, including the El Niño Southern Oscillation, and changes on the average sea surface temperature. Yellowfin tuna showed a decreasing abundance trend in the sampled period, whereas higher abundances were found in shallow and warmer waters, with high concentration of chlorophyll-a, and in surrounding seamounts. In addition, El Niño Southern Oscillation events did not seem to affect Yellowfin tuna distribution and abundance. Understanding the habitat preferences of this species, using approaches as the one developed here, may help design integrated programs for more efficient management of vulnerable species."
https://openalex.org/W2562724480,"Background X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS), caused by mutations in the type IV collagen COL4A5 gene, accounts for approximately 80% of human Alport syndrome. Dogs with XLAS have a similar clinical progression. Prior studies in autosomal recessive Alport mice demonstrated early mesangial cell invasion as the source of laminin 211 in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), leading to proinflammatory signaling. The objective of this study was to verify this process in XLAS dogs. Methods XLAS dogs and WT littermates were monitored with serial clinicopathologic data and kidney biopsies. Biopsies were obtained at set milestones defined by the onset of microalbuminuria (MA), overt proteinuria, onset of azotemia, moderate azotemia, and euthanasia. Kidney biopsies were analyzed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Results XLAS dogs showed progressive decrease in renal function and progressive increase in interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis (based on light microscopy and immunostaining for fibronectin). The only identifiable structural abnormality at the time of microalbuminuria was ultrastructural evidence of mild segmental GBM multilamination, which was more extensive when overt proteinuria developed. Co-localization studies showed that mesangial laminin 211 and integrin α8β1 accumulated in the GBM at the onset of overt proteinuria and coincided with ultrastructural evidence of mild cellular interpositioning, consistent with invasion of the capillary loops by mesangial cell processes. Conclusion In a large animal model, the induction of mesangial filopodial invasion of the glomerular capillary loop leading to the irregular deposition of laminin 211 is an early initiating event in Alport glomerular pathology."

However, they have also been associated with neurotoxic effects and in particular with the development of Parkinson-like neuropathy. Although different pathways and enzymes (such as ubiquitin ligases or the proteasome) have been identified as potential targets of DTCs in the brain, the molecular mechanisms underlying their neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. There is increasing evidence that alteration of glycogen metabolism in the brain contributes to neurodegenerative processes. Interestingly, recent studies with N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate suggest that brain glycogen phosphorylase (bGP) and glycogen metabolism could be altered by DTCs. Here, we provide molecular and mechanistic evidence that bGP is a target of DTCs. To examine this system, we first tested thiram, a DTC pesticide known to display neurotoxic effects, observing that it can react rapidly with bGP and readily inhibits its glycogenolytic activity (kinact = 1.4 × 105 m−1 s−1). Using cysteine chemical labeling, mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we show that thiram (and certain of its metabolites) alters the activity of bGP through the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond (Cys318–Cys326), known to act as a redox switch that precludes the allosteric activation of bGP by AMP.

https://openalex.org/W2563221447,"AmpG is a transmembrane protein with permease activity that transports meuropeptide from the periplasm to the cytoplasm, which is essential for the induction of the ampC encoding β-lactamase. To obtain new insights into the relationship between AmpG structure and function, comparative genomics analysis, secondary and tertiary structure modeling, site-directed mutational analyses and genetic complementation experiments were performed in this study. AmpGs from different genera of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baumannii) could complement AmpG function in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to ampicillin is 512 μg/ml for wild type strain PAO1, while it is 32 μg/ml for an ampG deletion mutant strain (PAO1ΔampG) with a corresponding decrease in the activity of the ampC-encoded β-lactamase. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved AmpG residues (G29, A129, Q131 and A197) resulted in a loss of function, resulting in a loss of resistance to ampicillin in PAO1ΔampG. The G29A, G29V, A129T, A129V, A129D, A197S and A197D mutants had lower resistance to ampicillin and significantly decreased activity of the AmpC β-lactamase. The G29A, G29V, A129V, A197S and A197D mutants had decreased ampG mRNA transcript levels. The A129T and A129D mutants had normal ampG mRNA transcript levels, but the function of the protein was drastically reduced. Our experimental results demonstrate that the conserved amino acids played essential roles in maintaining the function of AmpG. Combined with the AmpG structural information, these critical amino acids can be targeted for the development of new anti-bacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2563726795,"The propensity of cellular prion protein to aggregation is reputed essential for the initiation of the amyloid cascade that ultimately lead to the accumulation of neurotoxic aggregates. In this paper, we extended and applied an already reported computational workflow [Proteins 2015; 83: 1751-1765] to elucidate in details the aggregation propensity of PrP protein systems including wild type, wild type treated at different [Ca2+] and E200K mutant. The application of the computational procedure to two segments of PrPC, i.e. 125-228 and 120-231, allowed to emphasize how the inclusion of complete C-terminus and last portion (120-126) of the neurotoxic segment 106-126 may be crucial to unveil significant and unexpected interaction properties. Indeed, the anchoring of N-terminus on H2 domain detected in the wild type resulted to be disrupted upon either E200K mutation or Ca2+ binding, and to unbury hydrophobic spots on the PrPC surface. A peculiar dinuclear Ca2+ binding motif formed by the C-terminus and the S2-H2 loop was detected for [Ca2+] > 5 mM and showed similarities with binding motifs retraced in other protein systems, thus suggesting a possible functional meaning for its formation. Therefore, we potentiated the computational procedure by including a tool that clusterize the minima of molecular interaction fields of a proteinand delimit the regions of space with higher hydrophobic or higher hydrophilic character, hence, more likely involved in the self-assembly process. Plausible models for the self-assembly of either the E200K mutated or Ca2+-bound PrPC were sketched and discussed. The present investigation provides for structure-based information and new prompts that may represent a starting point for future experimental or computational works on the PrPC aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2565272761,"In contrast to the highly conserved mitogenomic structure and organisation in most animals (including rotifers), the two previously sequenced monogonont rotifer mitogenomes were fragmented into two chromosomes similar in size, each of which possessed one major non-coding region (mNCR) of about 4–5 Kbp. To further explore this phenomenon, we have sequenced and analysed the mitogenome of one of the most studied monogonont rotifers, Brachionus calyciflorus. It is also composed of two circular chromosomes, but the chromosome-I is extremely large (27 535 bp; 3 mNCRs), whereas the chromosome-II is relatively small (9 833 bp; 1 mNCR). With the total size of 37 368 bp, it is one of the largest metazoan mitogenomes ever reported. In comparison to other monogononts, gene distribution between the two chromosomes and gene order are different and the number of mNCRs is doubled. Atp8 was not found (common in rotifers), and Cytb was present in two copies (the first report in rotifers). A high number (99) of SNPs indicates fast evolution of the Cytb-1 copy. The four mNCRs (5.3–5.5 Kb) were relatively similar. Publication of this sequence shall contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary history of the unique mitogenomic organisation in this group of rotifers."
https://openalex.org/W2565550079,"Background Frailty is a characteristic of older patients with heart failure, who undergo functional decline during hospitalization. At present, continuous intravenous infusion of diuretics is widely used for the treatment of hospitalized patients with heart failure. In this prospective, randomized, open-label controlled trial, we tested whether an early switch from continuous intravenous infusion therapy to oral treatment with diuretics prevents functional decline in patients hospitalized for heart failure. Methods A total of 59 patients hospitalized for heart failure were randomized to either continuous intravenous infusion (n = 30) or oral medication (n = 29) within 48 h of admission. The primary outcome was the Barthel index, a universally utilized scale to assess the functional status of patients in their activities of daily living, assessed at 10 days. Secondary outcomes included the number of daily steps counted using pedometers and average hospital costs. Results Barthel index scores were significantly higher in the oral medication group than in the intravenous group (78.1 ± 20.8 vs. 59.6 ± 34.2, P = 0.029). The number of daily steps was significantly higher in the oral treatment group relative to the intravenous group (P < 0.001), and the average hospital costs were similar between the randomized groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that oral medication was a significant independent predictor of Barthel index score at day 10, and the number of daily steps was significantly associated with the patient’s functional outcome. Conclusions This trial showed that, in patients hospitalized for heart failure, oral medication increased functional independence during hospitalization compared with sustained continuous intravenous infusion, most likely because the release from the infusion line enabled the patients to be more mobile. Notably, these beneficial effects were achieved without increasing hospital costs."
https://openalex.org/W2565952451,"Fur Animal Epidemic Necrotic Pyoderma (FENP) is a severe, often lethal infectious disease affecting all three fur animal species: mink (Neovision vision), foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and finnraccoons (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Previous studies showed an association between Arcanobacterium phocae and FENP. An experimental infection was conducted to confirm the ability of A. phocae to infect mink either alone or concurrently with a novel Streptococcus sp. found together with A. phocae in many cases of FENP. Different inoculation methods were tested to study possible routes of transmission. Typical signs, and gross- and histopathological findings for FENP were detected when naïve mink were infected with the tissue extract of mink with FENP, using a subcutaneous/ intradermal infection route. Edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and pus formation were detected in the infection site. A pure culture preparation of A. phocae alone or concurrently with the novel Streptococcus sp. caused severe acute signs of lethargy, apathy and anorexia and even mortality. The histopathological findings were similar to those found in naturally occurring cases of FENP. In contrast, the perorally infected mink presented no clinical signs nor any gross- or histopathological lesions. This study showed that A. phocae is able to cause FENP. The study also indicated that predisposing factors such as the environment, the general condition of the animals, temperature and skin trauma contribute to the development of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2529453472,"We reported that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) enhance neurological recovery from experimental stroke and increase tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) expression in astrocytes. Here, we investigate mechanisms by which tPA mediates MSC enhanced axonal outgrowth. Primary murine neurons and astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and tPA-knockout (KO) cortices of embryos. Mouse MSCs (WT) were purchased from Cognate Inc. Neurons (WT or KO) were seeded in soma side of Xona microfluidic chambers, and astrocytes (WT or KO) and/or MSCs in axon side. The chambers were cultured as usual (normoxia) or subjected to oxygen deprivation. Primary neurons (seeded in plates) were co-cultured with astrocytes and/or MSCs (in inserts) for Western blot. In chambers, WT axons grew significantly longer than KO axons and exogenous tPA enhanced axonal outgrowth. MSCs increased WT axonal outgrowth alone and synergistically with WT astrocytes at both normoxia and oxygen deprivation conditions. The synergistic effect was inhibited by U0126, an ERK inhibitor, and receptor associated protein (RAP), a low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) ligand antagonist. However, MSCs exerted neither individual nor synergistic effects on KO axonal outgrowth. Western blot showed that MSCs promoted astrocytic tPA expression and increased neuronal tPA alone and synergistically with astrocytes. Also, MSCs activated neuronal ERK alone and synergistically with astrocytes, which was inhibited by RAP. We conclude: (1) MSCs promote axonal outgrowth via neuronal tPA and synergistically with astrocytic tPA; (2) neuronal tPA is critical to observe the synergistic effect of MSC and astrocytes on axonal outgrowth; and (3) tPA mediates MSC treatment-induced axonal outgrowth through the LRP1 receptor and ERK."
https://openalex.org/W2563199969,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including the nuclear envelope, is a continuous and intricate membrane-bound organelle responsible for various cellular functions. In neurons, the ER network is found in cell bodies, axons, and dendrites. Recent studies indicate the involvement of the ER network in neuronal development, such as neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth. However, the regulation of neural development by ER-localized proteins is not fully understood. We previously reported that the multi-transmembrane protein Dpy19L1 is required for neuronal migration in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. A Dpy19L family member, Dpy19L2, which is a causative gene for human Globozoospermia, is suggested to act as an anchor of the acrosome to the nuclear envelope. In this study, we found that the patterns of exogenous Dpy19L1 were partially coincident with the ER, including the nuclear envelope in COS-7 cells at the level of the light microscope. The reticular distribution of Dpy19L1 was disrupted by microtubule depolymerization that induces retraction of the ER. Furthermore, Dpy19L1 showed a similar distribution pattern with a ER marker protein in embryonic mouse cortical neurons. Finally, we showed that Dpy19L1 knockdown mediated by siRNA resulted in decreased neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. These results indicate that transmembrane protein Dpy19L1 is localized to the ER membrane and regulates neurite extension during development."
https://openalex.org/W2561848107,"Handling our everyday life, we often react manually to verbal requests or instruction, but the functional interrelations of motor control and language are not fully understood yet, especially their neurophysiological basis. Here, we investigated whether specific motor representations for grip types interact neurophysiologically with conceptual information, that is, when reading nouns. Participants performed lexical decisions and, for words, executed a grasp-and-lift task on objects of different sizes involving precision or power grips while the electroencephalogram was recorded. Nouns could denote objects that require either a precision or a power grip and could, thus, be (in)congruent with the performed grasp. In a control block, participants pointed at the objects instead of grasping them. The main result revealed an event-related potential (ERP) interaction of grip type and conceptual information which was not present for pointing. Incongruent compared to congruent conditions elicited an increased positivity (100-200 ms after noun onset). Grip type effects were obtained in response-locked analyses of the grasping ERPs (100-300 ms at left anterior electrodes). These findings attest that grip type and conceptual information are functionally related when planning a grasping action but such an interaction could not be detected for pointing. Generally, the results suggest that control of behaviour can be modulated by task demands; conceptual noun information (i.e., associated action knowledge) may gain processing priority if the task requires a complex motor response."
https://openalex.org/W2561938522,"Protein translational machinery is an important component of the proteostasis network that maintains cellular proteostasis and regulates aging and other cellular processes. Ample evidence indicates that inhibition of translation initiation factor activities enhances stress resistance in model organisms. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) acts by joining the pre-40S subunit with the 60S ribosomal unit to form an 80S-like complex during protein translational initiation. Reduced eIF5B expression may disrupt proteostasis and trigger cellular processes associated with stress responses. In this study, the physiological effects of altered eIF5B expression were examined in 293T and HepG2 cells. Cells with eIF5B-knockdown (eIF5B-KN) grew more slowly than control cells, and had a lower level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy. Proteomic analysis showed that eIF5B knockdown resulted in upregulation of 88 proteins and downregulation of 130 proteins compared with control cells. The differentially expressed proteins were associated with diverse cellular processes including amino acid metabolism, RNA processing and protein metabolism, and DNA synthesis. Autonomous downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was identified as confirmed by western blotting and qPCR. We proposed that deactivation of MAPK pathway modulated proteostasis and induced prolonged S-phase of the cell-cycle, contributing to the slow growth of eIF5B-KN cells. eIF5B silencing also inactivated the mTOR pathway, downregulated glutamine transporters, enhanced autophagy, and decreased 28S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA expression levels which were reversed by restoration of eIF5B expression. Taken together, these results suggest that eIF5B silencing provides a negative feedback to deactivate MAPK signaling, leading to reduced cell growth. These findings provide a useful resource to further biological exploration of the functions of protein synthesis in regulation of proteostasis and stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2563414238,"The aim of this study was to compare the 2008 Chinese and the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and to provide proposals for updating T and N staging systems of the present staging system.Between January 2007 and December 2012, a cohort of 752 patients with biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy were retrospectively analysed. Prognoses were compared by T stage, N stage, and clinical stage according to the two staging systems for overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).In terms of both the T and N staging systems, the two current staging systems were comparable in predicting OS. The T classification of the 2008 Chinese staging system was better in predicting LRFS, while the N classification of the 7th edition AJCC staging system was superior in predicting DMFS. In the modern era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the staging system should be updated by down-staging the current stage T2 to T1, and it might be rational to merge subcategories N1 and N2.The two current staging systems each had advantages in predicting prognosis. It seems reasonable to downstage T2 to T1 and to merge N1 and N2."
https://openalex.org/W2563426220,"Dissociation-induced apoptosis is a striking phenomenon in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), but not in naive mouse ESCs. Rho-associated kinase–dependent actin-myosin hyperactivation is an underlying mechanism that triggers apoptosis in dissociated hESCs; however, in this study, we show that the Ink4A-ARF–mediated senescence pathway is another mechanism to cause apoptosis in individualized hESCs. We show that P16INK4A and P14ARF are immediately induced in hESCs upon dissociation, but not in mouse ESCs. Overexpression of BMI1, a suppressor for Ink4A-ARF, greatly promotes survival and cloning efficiency of individualized hESCs mechanistically via direct binding the H3K27me3-marked Ink4A-ARF locus. Forced expression of BMI1 in hESCs does not reduce the actin-myosin activation that is triggered by dissociation, which indicates it is an independent pathway for hESC survival. Furthermore, dual inhibition of both Ink4A-ARF and actin-myosin hyperactivation enables successful passaging of hESCs via gelatin, a nonbioactive matrix. In sum, we provide an additional mechanism that underlies cell death in individualized hESCs that might help to fully understand the differential cell characteristics between naive and primed ESCs.—Wang, W., Zhu, Y., Huang, K., Shan, Y., Du, J., Dong, X., Ma, P., Wu, P., Zhang, J., Huang, W., Zhang, T., Liao, B., Yao, D., Pan, G., Liu, J.

https://openalex.org/W2564437186,"Monocropped rice system is an important intensive cropping system for food security in China. Green manure (GM) as an alternative to fertilizer N (FN) is useful for improving soil quality. However, few studies have examined the effect of Chinese milk vetch (CMV) as GM on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from monocropped rice field in south China. Therefore, a pot-culture experiment with four treatments (control, no FN and CMV; CMV as GM alone, M; fertilizer N alone, FN; integrating fertilizer N with CMV, NM) was performed to investigate the effect of incorporating CMV as GM on N2O emission using a closed chamber-gas chromatography (GC) technique during the rice growing periods. Under the same N rate, incorporating CMV as GM (the treatments of M and NM) mitigated N2O emission during the growing periods of rice plant, reduced the NO3- content and activities of nitrate and nitrite reductase as well as the population of nitrifying bacteria in top soil at maturity stage of rice plant versus FN pots. The global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of N2O from monocropped rice field was ranked as M<NM<FN. However, the treatment of NM increased rice grain yield and soil NH4+ content, which were dramatically decreased in the M pots, over the treatment of FN. Hence, it can be concluded that integrating FN with CMV as GM is a feasible tactic for food security and N2O mitigation in the monocropped rice based system."
https://openalex.org/W2510922350,"Sagan et al. (1993) used the Galileo space probe data and first principles to find evidence of life on Earth. Here we ask whether Sagan et al. (1993) could also have detected whether life on Earth had three-dimensional structure, based on the Galileo space probe data. We reanalyse the data from this probe to see if structured vegetation could have been detected in regions with abundant photosynthetic pigments through the anisotropy of reflected shortwave radiation. We compare changing brightness of the Amazon forest (a region where Sagan et al. (1993) noted a red edge in the reflectance spectrum, indicative of photosynthesis) as the planet rotates to a common model of reflectance anisotropy and found measured increase of surface reflectance of 0.019 versus a 0.007 predicted from only anisotropic effects. We hypothesize the difference was due to minor cloud contamination. However, the Galileo dataset had only a small change in phase angle (sun-satellite position) which reduced the observed anisotropy signal and we demonstrate that theoretically if the probe had a variable phase angle between 0-20, there would have been a much larger predicted change in surface reflectance of 0.06 and under such a scenario three-dimensional vegetation structure on Earth could possibly have been detected. These results suggest that anisotropic effects may be useful to help determine whether exoplanets have three-dimensional vegetation structure in the future but that further comparisons between empirical and theoretical results are first necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2566857552,"Isolates of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis recovered from clinical samples exhibit genetic heterogeneity. Such variation may result from the stressful environment encountered by the pathogen inside the macrophage, which is the host cell tubercle bacilli parasitize. To study the evolution of the M. tuberculosis genome during growth inside macrophages, we developed a model of intracellular culture in which bacteria were serially passaged in macrophage-like THP-1 cells for about 80 bacterial generations. Genome sequencing of single bacterial colonies isolated before and after the infection cycles revealed that M. tuberculosis developed mutations at a rate of about 5.7 × 10−9 / bp/ generation, consistent with mutation rates calculated during in vivo infection. Analysis of mutant growth in macrophages and in mice showed that the mutations identified after the cyclic infection conferred no advantage to the mutants relative to wild-type. Furthermore, activity testing of the recombinant protein harboring one of these mutations showed that the presence of the mutation did not affect the enzymatic activity. The serial infection protocol developed in this work to study M. tuberculosis genome microevolution can be applied to exposure to stressors to determine their effect on genome remodeling during intra-macrophage growth."
https://openalex.org/W2565395600,"Behavioral plasticity is a key feature allowing animals to broaden their dietary niche when novel food resources become available, and long-fingered bats provide an appropriate model system to study the underpinnings of behavioral plasticity, since although generally being an insectivorous species, some individuals have been reported to catch fish. Aiming to get insight into the origin of fishing behavior in long-fingered bats, we studied in the field the differences in sensorial and mechanical reactions to insect-like (stationary) and fish-like (temporary) prey stimuli between well-known piscivorous and strictly insectivorous individuals. Both piscivorous and insectivorous individuals exhibited a qualitatively similar reaction to temporary target stimuli (longer and deeper dips and terminal echolocation phase skewed towards buzz I compared to stationary stimuli). Nevertheless, the quantitative differences observed in the sensorial and mechanical features (the intensity of the shift was significantly greater in piscivorous than in insectivorous individuals) show that piscivorous individuals have honed their capture technique likely enhancing the fishing success. Thus, our results suggest that the fishing technique was developed from a primary reaction shared by all long-fingered bats. All individuals seem to be mechanically and sensorially adapted to detect and capture fish, although under appropriate environmental conditions, they would further improve their technique by experience and/or social learning."
https://openalex.org/W2566629158,"Vascularization of atherosclerotic plaques has been linked to plaque vulnerability. The aim of this study was to test if the vascularization was increased in upstream regions of early atherosclerotic carotid plaques and also to test if the same pattern of vascularization was seen in complicated, symptomatic plaques.We enrolled 45 subjects with early atherosclerotic lesions for contrast enhanced ultrasound and evaluated the percentage of plaque area in a longitudinal ultrasound section which contained contrast agent. Contrast-agent uptake was evaluated in both the upstream and downstream regions of the plaque. We also collected carotid endarterectomy specimens from 56 subjects and upstream and downstream regions were localized using magnetic resonance angiography and analyzed using histopathology and immunohistochemistry.Vascularization was increased in the upstream regions of early carotid plaques compared with downstream regions (30% vs. 23%, p = 0.033). Vascularization was also increased in the upstream regions of advanced atherosclerotic lesions compared with downstream regions (4.6 vs. 1.4 vessels/mm2, p = 0.001) and was associated with intra-plaque hemorrhage and inflammation.Vascularization is increased in the upstream regions of both early and advanced plaques and is in advanced lesions mainly driven by inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2562459635,"In this paper two novel space-time coding multi-input single-output (STC MISO) schemes, designed especially for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems, are introduced. The proposed schemes are referred to as wavelet space-time coding (WSTC) schemes. The WSTC schemes are based on two types of multiplexing, spatial and wavelet domain multiplexing. In WSTC schemes, four symbols are transmitted on the same UWB transmission pulse with the same bandwidth, symbol duration, and number of transmitting antennas of the conventional STC MISO scheme. The used mother wavelet (MW) is selected to be highly correlated with transmitted pulse shape and such that the multiplexed signal has almost the same spectral characteristics as those of the original UWB pulse. The two WSTC techniques increase the data rate to four times that of the conventional STC. The first WSTC scheme increases the data rate with a simple combination process. The second scheme achieves the increase in the data rate with a less complex receiver and better performance than the first scheme due to the spatial diversity introduced by the structure of its transmitter and receiver. The two schemes use Rake receivers to collect the energy in the dense multipath channel components. The simulation results show that the proposed WSTC schemes have better performance than the conventional scheme in addition to increasing the data rate to four times that of the conventional STC scheme."
