In addition, βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 target desensitized receptors to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis. Whether arrestins differ in their ability to interact with GPCRs in cells is not known. In this study, we visualize the interaction of arrestin family members with GPCRs in real time and in live cells using green fluorescent protein-tagged arrestins. In the absence of agonist, visual arrestin and βarrestin1 were found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of HEK-293 cells, whereas βarrestin2 was found only in the cytoplasm. Analysis of agonist-mediated arrestin translocation to multiple GPCRs identified two major classes of receptors. Class A receptors (β2 adrenergic receptor, mu opioid receptor, endothelin type A receptor, dopamine D1A receptor, and α1b adrenergic receptor) bound βarrestin2 with higher affinity than βarrestin1 and did not interact with visual arrestin. In contrast, class B receptors (angiotensin II type 1A receptor, neurotensin receptor 1, vasopressin V2 receptor, thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, and substance P receptor) bound both βarrestin isoforms with similar high affinities and also interacted with visual arrestin. Switching the carboxyl-terminal tails of class A and class B receptors completely reversed the affinity of each receptor for the visual and non-visual arrestins. In addition, exchanging the βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 carboxyl termini reversed their extent of binding to class A receptors as well as their subcellular distribution. These results reveal for the first time marked differences in the ability of arrestin family members to bind GPCRs at the plasma membrane. Moreover, they show that visual arrestin can interact in cells with GPCRs other than rhodopsin. These findings suggest that GPCR signaling may be differentially regulated depending on the cellular complement of arrestin isoforms and the ability of arrestins to interact with other cellular proteins.

GPCR signaling is regulated by a small family of intracellular arrestin proteins that includes visual arrestin (S-antigen), βarrestin1 (arrestin2), and βarrestin2 (arrestin3) (1.Ferguson S.S.

The βarrestins are 78% identical in amino acid composition and widely expressed in tissues, but their expression level varies in a cell type-specific fashion (5.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C.

The variations in arrestin homology, localization, and expression level suggest that arrestin family members may differ in their abilities to regulate GPCR signaling.Arrestins bind to GPCRs that are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (7.Lohse M.J.

In contrast to visual arrestins that primarily desensitize light-activated rhodopsin (10.Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They also regulate the rate at which endosomal receptors are dephosphorylated and recycled back to the plasma membrane through interactions with specific clusters of GRK-phosphorylated residues in the GPCR carboxyl terminus (18.Oakley R.H.

In vitro studies using purified proteins have shown that specificity exists between arrestin family members and GPCRs. For example, visual arrestin binds rhodopsin in preference to the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2mAChR), whereas βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 bind the β2AR and m2mAChR in preference to rhodopsin (5.Attramadal H.

Furthermore, βarrestin1 binds the β2AR with a 2.5-fold greater affinity than βarrestin2, and βarrestin2 binds the m2mAChR with a 1.5-fold greater affinity than βarrestin1 (21.Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B.

However, whether specificity exists between arrestin family members and GPCRs in cells has not been explored.In the following study we investigate the dynamic interactions between arrestin family members and GPCRs in live cells by assessing the redistribution of fluorescent arrestins from the cytoplasm to agonist-activated receptors at the plasma membrane. Two classes of GPCRs, designated A and B, are identified that differ in their affinities for the arrestin isoforms. Class A receptors, such as the β2AR, do not interact with visual arrestin and bind βarrestin1 with less affinity than βarrestin2. Class B receptors, such as the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR), interact with visual arrestin and bind both βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 with similar high affinities. The molecular determinants underlying this classification appear to reside in specific serine residues located in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. These findings reveal a potential role for visual arrestin in the regulation of GPCRs outside the visual system. Moreover, they suggest that the particular cellular complement of arrestin isoforms and their distinct interactions with intracellular proteins will play a critical role regulating the pattern of GPCR desensitization, sequestration, and resensitization.DISCUSSIONIn this study we identify two major classes of GPCRs that demonstrate marked differences in their interactions with visual arrestin, βarrestin1, and βarrestin2. Class A receptors, which bind both biogenic amines and peptide ligands, demonstrate little to no affinity for visual arrestin and have a higher affinity for βarrestin2 than βarrestin1. Class B receptors, which bind peptide ligands, bind visual arrestin and have a similar high affinity for both βarrestin1 and βarrestin2. Residues in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail appear entirely responsible for determining class A or B characteristics rather than the nature of the ligand. This classification paradigm provides a foundation for predicting the manner in which the cellular complement of arrestin isoforms will regulate the desensitization, sequestration, and resensitization of a particular GPCR.For many GPCRs, homologous desensitization involves both GRK phosphorylation and arrestin binding (1.Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Our findings fit a model in which the kinetics of GRK phosphorylation are rate-limiting and facilitate the interaction of arrestin with receptors (Fig.11 A). In support of this interpretation, GRK phosphorylation of rhodopsin and the β2AR is necessary for high affinity binding of arrestins both in vitro and in cells (7.Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 8.Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 21.Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Moreover, GFP analogues of GRK2 translocate to the SPR at the plasma membrane prior to the binding of βarrestin (28.Barak L.S. Warabi K. Feng X. Caron M.G. Kwatra M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7565-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Some βarrestin binding may also occur, however, with agonist-activated receptors in the absence of GRK phosphorylation. For example, in vitro studies have shown that βarrestin binds with low affinity to the unphosphorylated β2AR and m2mAChR (21.Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, in experiments with the SPR under conditions that should significantly reduce GRK-mediated phosphorylation in response to agonist (60 min agonist treatment at 4 °C), both transfected and endogenous βarrestins were found to associate with the receptor at the plasma membrane (31.McConalogue K. Dery O. Lovett M. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16257-16268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). βArrestin binding to GPCRs is thought to involve the engagement of two regions of the βarrestin molecule with two corresponding regions of the receptor (2.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 21.Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). A large region within the amino-terminal half of βarrestin (termed the activation-recognition domain) appears to bind the third loop of agonist-activated GPCRs (32.Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A positively charged smaller domain (termed the phosphorylation-recognition domain) appears to interact with GRK-phosphorylated residues in the GPCR carboxyl terminus (33.Kieselbach T. Irrgang K.D. Ruppel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, although βarrestins may bind intracellular loops of agonist-activated receptors that are not phosphorylated, the affinity of this interaction is presumably weak. GRK phosphorylation and the engagement of both βarrestin recognition domains with the receptor appear to be necessary for a high affinity interaction to take place.From the data presented in Fig. 2, we observed that translocation of βarrestin1 to the β2AR was delayed in onset and slower in rate compared with βarrestin2 translocation. Re-analysis of this data using the model described under “Experimental Procedures” indicates that these qualitative differences correspond to an approximately 10-fold higher affinity of βarrestin2 for the β2AR relative to βarrestin1 (Fig. 11 B). In contrast to these findings in cells, in vitro studies have reported that βarrestin1 has a 2.5-fold greater affinity for the β2AR than βarrestin2 (21.Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The discrepancy may arise from differences in the manner in which βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 interact intracellularly with the GRK-phosphorylated β2AR carboxyl-terminal tail. The β2AR tail contains 13 putative phosphate acceptor sites, and βarrestin1 binding in vivo may require that either a greater number of sites or different residues be phosphorylated. Moreover, proteins other than GRKs apparently influence the interaction between βarrestins and GPCRs. The βarrestin carboxyl-terminal domain contains AP-2 and clathrin-binding sites (16.Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 30.Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A stronger interaction between βarrestin2 and these endocytic proteins may explain why swapping the βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 carboxyl-terminal domains increases the fraction of the βarrestin1 chimera and decreases the fraction of the βarrestin2 chimera that translocate to the β2AR at the plasma membrane.The difference in the ability βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 to interact in cells with the β2AR is typical of class A receptors. However, receptors belonging to class B, such as the AT1AR, appear to bind βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 equally well (Figs. 6 Cand 11 C). Two lines of evidence suggest that their affinity for βarrestins is greater than that possessed by class A receptors. First, AT1ARs and βarrestins form stable endocytic complexes, whereas the β2AR·βarrestin complexes dissociate at or near the plasma membrane. The ability of βarrestins to internalize with the AT1AR into endocytic vesicles may indicate that this receptor internalizes in a βarrestin-dependent pathway. Consistent with this possibility, overexpression of βarrestin1 potentiates AT1AR sequestration in HEK-293 cells (24.Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Second, visual arrestin translocates to class B but not class A receptors. The ability of class B receptors, such as the AT1AR and V2R, to bind arrestin family members with such high affinity appears to be mediated entirely by clusters of phosphorylated residues in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail (18.Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar,22.Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Similar clusters are noticeably absent from the tails of class A receptors. Thus, it is not unexpected that switching tails between class A and class B receptors completely reverses their affinity for both the visual and nonvisual arrestins.Differences in βarrestin affinities for class A receptors suggest that the tissue complement of βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 may provide an additional degree of receptor regulation. βArrestin1 is more abundant than βarrestin2 in many bovine tissues including the heart, lung, and spleen and is the predominant isoform in rat respiratory epithelial cells (6.Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C. Donoso L.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15640-15648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Dawson T.M. Arriza J.L. Jaworsky D.E. Borisy F.F. Attramadal H. Lefkowitz R.J. Ronnett G.V. Science. 1993; 259: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Conversely, βarrestin2 is more abundant than βarrestin1 in the rat central nervous system, olfactory epithelial cells, and spermatozoa (5.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Dawson T.M. Arriza J.L. Jaworsky D.E. Borisy F.F. Attramadal H. Lefkowitz R.J. Ronnett G.V. Science. 1993; 259: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). βArrestin2 was also found to be 3–5-fold more abundant than βarrestin1 in a variety of transformed cell lines (35.Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Since βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 bind class A receptors with different affinities, signaling of class A receptors will be more affected by relative changes in the ratio of βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 than class B receptors. An important challenge for future research will be to determine the relationship between GPCR behavior and the absolute and relative levels of βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 in normal cells and in diseased tissues.The ability of visual arrestin to interact with class B receptors suggests that it may play an unappreciated role regulating the signaling of GPCRs other than rhodopsin. Visual arrestin is expressed primarily in rod photoreceptor cells of the retina, but it is also found in other brain regions such as the pineal gland and in peripheral tissues including the heart, kidney, and lung (3.Breitman M.L.

Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to βarrestin1 and βarrestin2, visual arrestin is unlikely to promote receptor sequestration as it does not bind clathrin and interacts very poorly with AP-2 2S. A. Laporte, personal communication. (17.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observe that visual arrestin does not appear to target class B receptors to clathrin-coated pits. Therefore, visual arrestin by desensitizing class B receptors without promoting internalization may provide a more permanent scaffold for membrane signaling events and an endocytic independent mechanism to resensitize receptors more rapidly than either βarrestin1 or βarrestin2 (36.Daaka Y.

Visual arrestin and βarrestin1 are distributed in both the cell cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas βarrestin2 is found in the cytoplasm but is excluded from the nucleus. The amino acid residues mediating arrestin compartmentalization appear to reside in the arrestin carboxyl terminus. Switching the βarrestin1 and βarrestin2 carboxyl-terminal domains completely reverses their subcellular distributions. Notably, reports have shown that functional prostaglandin E2 receptors reside on the nuclear envelope and other GPCRs, including muscarinic and angiotensin receptors, may be there as well (40.Bhattacharya M.

Thus, the nuclear pools of visual arrestin and βarrestin1 may specifically regulate nuclear GPCR signaling.In summary, we have shown in real time and in live cells that specificity exists between arrestin family members and GPCRs. Therefore, these findings provide a basis for predicting the arrestin-mediated pattern of GPCR desensitization, sequestration, and resensitization. Moreover, they explain why the regulation of certain GPCRs will be more susceptible to variations in the cellular complement of arrestin isoforms. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 comprise a large gene family of more than 1000 members that mediate distinct physiological functions as diverse as phototransduction, olfaction, vascular tone, cardiac output, digestion, and pain. GPCR signaling is regulated by a small family of intracellular arrestin proteins that includes visual arrestin (S-antigen), βarrestin1 (arrestin2), and βarrestin2 (arrestin3) (1.Ferguson S.S.

Visual arrestin is 60 and 65% identical in amino acid composition to βarrestin1 and βarrestin2, respectively, and predominantly localized in rod photoreceptor cells of the retina but can also be found in other tissues (3.Breitman M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2156172044,"Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is a member of the mitochondrial anion carrier superfamily. Based upon its high homology with UCP1 and its restricted tissue distribution to skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue, UCP3 has been suggested to play important roles in regulating energy expenditure, body weight, and thermoregulation. Other postulated roles for UCP3 include regulation of fatty acid metabolism, adaptive responses to acute exercise and starvation, and prevention of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. To address these questions, we have generated mice lacking UCP3 (UCP3 knockout (KO) mice). Here, we provide evidence that skeletal muscle mitochondria lacking UCP3 are more coupled (<i>i.e.</i> increased state 3/state 4 ratio), indicating that UCP3 has uncoupling activity. In addition, production of ROS is increased in mitochondria lacking UCP3. This study demonstrates that UCP3 has uncoupling activity and that its absence may lead to increased production of ROS. Despite these effects on mitochondrial function, UCP3 does not seem to be required for body weight regulation, exercise tolerance, fatty acid oxidation, or cold-induced thermogenesis. The absence of such phenotypes in UCP3 KO mice could not be attributed to up-regulation of other UCP mRNAs. However, alternative compensatory mechanisms cannot be excluded. The consequence of increased mitochondrial coupling in UCP3 KO mice on metabolism and the possible role of yet unidentified compensatory mechanisms, remains to be determined."

We generated combined PON1 knockout (KO)/apolipoprotein E (apoE) KO and apoE KO control mice to compare atherogenesis and lipoprotein oxidation. Early lesions were examined in 3-month-old mice fed a chow diet, and advanced lesions were examined in 6-month-old mice fed a high fat diet. In both cases, the PON1 KO/apoE KO mice exhibited significantly more atherosclerosis (50–71% increase) than controls. We examined LDL oxidation and clearancein vivo by injecting human LDL into the mice and following its turnover. LDL clearance was faster in the double KO mice as compared with controls. There was a greater rate of accumulation of oxidized phospholipid epitopes and a greater accumulation of LDL-immunoglobulin complexes in the double KO mice than in controls. Furthermore, the amounts of three bioactive oxidized phospholipids were elevated in the endogenous intermediate density lipoprotein/LDL of double KO mice as compared with the controls. Finally, the expression of heme oxygenase-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and oxidized LDL receptors were elevated in the livers of double KO mice as compared with the controls.

Recent studies using genetically modified or naturally occurring mutant mouse models have confirmed the roles of many genes involved in the process of LDL oxidation, inflammation, macrophage function, and atherogenesis.

The PON1 KO mice were more susceptible to organophosphate toxicity, and the HDL isolated from the PON1 KO mice failed to prevent LDL oxidation induced by a co-culture model of artery wall cells. When PON1 KO mice were bred onto the C57BL/6J mouse background and fed an atherogenic diet, they developed significantly larger fatty streak lesions in the aortic sinus as compared with the PON1 wild-type littermates (41.Shih D.M.

We have now extended our studies of PON1 deficiency to the apoE KO mouse model that exhibits advanced atherosclerosis and increased lipoprotein oxidation. ApoE mediates the uptake and removal of chylomicron and VLDL remnants via hepatic lipoprotein receptors. ApoE KO mice exhibit severalfold higher levels of plasma total cholesterol as compared with wild-type littermates and develop advanced atherosclerotic lesions even when maintained on low fat chow diets (42.Plump A.S.

The atherosclerosis that develops in apoE KO mice appears to be oxidation-dependent as their lesions contain oxidation-specific epitopes by immunostaining, and there are high plasma titers of autoantibodies against varying epitopes of ox-LDL (44.Palinski W. Ord V.A. Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation products are detected in the circulating lipoproteins of apoE KO mice as well (45.Hayek T. Oiknine J. Brook J.G. Aviram M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Consistent with the importance of oxidation in the apoE KO mice, their atherosclerosis can be inhibited by vitamin E despite the presence of marked hypercholesterolemia (46.Pratico D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In the present study, we crossed the PON1 null mutation onto the apoE KO mouse background and examined the effects of PON1 deficiency on atherosclerotic lesion formation at two different time points and using two different diets. We also compared lipoprotein oxidation and expression of genes involved in the metabolism of oxidized lipoproteins in these mice. PON1 KO mice were generated as described (41.Shih D.M. Gu L. Xia Y.R. Navab M. Li W.F. Hama S. Castellani L.W. Furlong C.E. Costa L.G. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). ApoE KO mice on the C57BL/6J background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). To obtain PON1 KO/apoE KO and apoE KO littermates, the crosses were set up as follows. PON1 KO mice that were of the 87.5% C57BL/6J and 12.5% 129/SvJ genetic background were crossed to apoE KO mice on the C57BL/6J background to obtain PON1 heterozygous/apoE heterozygous (het) mice. The PON1 het/apoE het mice were backcrossed to the apoE KO mice again to obtain PON het/apoE KO mice. PON1 het/apoE KO mice were then intercrossed to produce PON KO/apoE KO and apo E KO littermates with a genetic makeup of 97% C57BL/6J and 3% 129/SvJ. Only female mice were included in the experiments. Mice were maintained on a 6% fat chow diet after weaning. For studies of atherosclerotic lesion formation in the whole aortic tree, mice were switched to a 42% fat, 0.15% cholesterol “Western” diet (diet number TD88137, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) at 6–8 weeks of age and were maintained on this diet for 16 weeks. One μg of tail DNA was used for each PCR. For genotyping of the PON1 gene, three primers, PON321, PON151A, and Neo9, were used. The sequences of the primers were as follows: PON321, 5′-TGG GCT GCA GGT CTC AGG ACT GA-3′; PON151A, 5′-ATA GGA AGA CCG ATG GTT CT-3′; and Neo9, 5′-TCC TCG TGC TTT ACG GTA TCG-3′. Primer pair PON321 and PON151A were used to amplify the wild-type PON1 allele to yield a 144-bp DNA fragment. Primer pair PON321 and Neo9 were used to amplify the mutated PON1 allele to produce a 240-bp DNA fragment. The PCR was carried out in the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following program: 94 °C, 3 min, 30 cycles of (94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min), 72 °C 7 min. For genotyping the apoE gene, the following three primers were used as recommended by The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME): oIMR180 (5′-GCC TAG CCG AGG GAG AGC CG-3′), oIMR181 (5′-TGT GAC TTG GGA GCT CTG CAG C-3′), and oIMR182 (5′-GCC GCC CCG ACT GCA TCT-3′). Primer pair oIMR180 and oIMR181 amplified a 155-bp wild-type band, whereas primer pair oIMR180 and oIMR182 amplified a 243-bp band from the apoE-targeted allele. The PCR was carried out using a similar PCR program as the PON1 PCR described above except annealing temperature was raised to 64 °C and 35 cycles of amplification. Atherosclerotic lesions at the aortic valve were analyzed as described (47.Mehrabian M. Qiao J. Hyman R. Ruddle D. Laughton C. Lusis A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at sacrifice, the upper portion of the heart and proximal aorta was obtained, embedded in OCT compound, and stored at −70 °C. Serial 10-μm-thick cryosections of aorta, beginning at the aortic root, were collected for a distance of 400 μm. These sections were stained with Oil Red O and hematoxylin. The lipid-staining areas on 25 sections, centered around aortic valves, were determined in a blinded fashion by light microscopy. The mean value of lipid staining areas of aortic wall per section was then calculated. En face analyses of lesions in the entire aorta were performed according to procedures described by Tangirala et al. (48.Tangirala R.K. Rubin E.M. Palinski W. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2320-2328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After perfusion-fixation, the aorta was dissected out, opened longitudinally from heart to the iliac arteries, pinned on a black wax pan, and stained with Sudan IV solution. The image of the aorta was captured using a SONY DXC-970MD color video camera, and the image analysis was performed using the Image-Pro plus program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) in a blinded fashion. The area covered by atherosclerotic lesions divided by the area of the entire aorta was calculated and compared. Mice were fasted for 16 h before bleeding. Plasma lipids were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays (47.Mehrabian M. Qiao J. Hyman R. Ruddle D. Laughton C. Lusis A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma samples were fractionated by FPLC as described (49.Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse VLDL (d <1.006), IDL (d = 1.006–1.019), and LDL (d = 1.019–1.063) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugations using 2 ml of plasma pooled from 10 or more mice as described before (49.Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antioxidants (0.01% EDTA and 120 μm butylated hydroxytoluene) and protease and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase inhibitor (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were present during the isolation process to prevent in vitro oxidation and modification. Human LDL was isolated in the presence of EDTA by ultracentrifugation according to established procedures (50.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Twenty-five μg of lipoprotein was used for lipid extraction (51.Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Ivandic B. Qiao J.H. Huber J. Faull K.F. Grass D.S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. de Beer F.C. Lusis A.J. Berliner J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The extracted lipids were dissolved in acetonitrile/water/formic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v) and injected into an API III triple-quadruple biomolecular mass analyzer (Perkin-Elmer) for mass analysis of phospholipids as described previously (51.Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Ivandic B. Qiao J.H. Huber J. Faull K.F. Grass D.S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. de Beer F.C. Lusis A.J. Berliner J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) was used as internal standard. The relative intensities of m/z 496 (lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)), m/z 594.3 (POVPC), m/z 610.2 (PGPC), andm/z 828.5 (mixed isomers of PEIPC) as compared with the internal standard, DMPC (m/z 678.5), were determined using a software supplied by PE Sciex and calculated in terms of nanograms of DMPC eq/μg of lipoprotein. The autoantibody titers against copper-oxidized LDL and malondialdehyde-modified LDL (MDA-LDL) in the plasma samples of PON1 KO/apoE KO and apoE KO mice were determined by ELISA as described previously (52.Hörkkö S. Miller E. Branch D.W. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, ox-LDL or MDA-LDL were plated at the bottom of a microtiter plate as antigen and incubated with 1:500 dilutions of mouse plasma. The bound IgG or IgM were then detected by using alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies against mouse IgG or mouse IgM using a sensitive chemiluminescent technique. Data are expressed as relative light units per 100 ms. Human LDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation in the presence of 1 mmEDTA. The day before injection, the LDL was dialyzed overnight with phosphate-buffered saline. Mice were bled immediately before injection and then injected with 1 mg of human LDL through the tail vein. The mice were then bled 15 min, 2, 6, and 24 h after injection. Plasma samples were stored with 1 mm EDTA at −80 °C before assay. Each plasma sample was then assayed by chemiluminescent immunoassay technique for the relative amount of human LDL in plasma, the amount of murine IgG or IgM bound per human LDL particle, and the amount of oxidized phospholipid epitopes present on each human LDL particle, as detected by antibody EO6. For these assays, murine plasma was added to wells of a microtiter plate that had previously been coated with a monoclonal antibody, MB47, specific for human apoB (53.Young S.G. Witztum J.L. Casal D.C. Curtiss L.K. Bernstein S. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 178-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was achieved by plating 10 μg/ml MB47 in phosphate-buffered saline overnight. This antibody does not detect murine LDL (53.Young S.G. Witztum J.L. Casal D.C. Curtiss L.K. Bernstein S. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 178-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then a 1:50 dilution of murine plasma was added. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that at this dilution the content of human LDL did not lead to saturation of binding to the coated MB47. To determine the content of human apoB, biotinylated anti-human apoB monoclonal antibody, MB24 (54.Young S.G. Smith R.S. Hogle D.M. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was added. This antibody binds to a distinct site on apoB separate from that recognized by MB47 (54.Young S.G. Smith R.S. Hogle D.M. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because there is only one MB24-binding site per LDL, the amount of MB24 bound represents the number of apoB particles bound. To determine the amount of oxidized phospholipid epitope present on LDL, biotinylated monoclonal antibody EO6 (55.Palinski W. Hörkkö S. Miller E. Steinbrecher U.P. Powell H.C. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 800-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) was added in a separate set of wells. EO6 binds to the oxidized phospholipid, POVPC (56.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Finally, to detect the amount of murine immunoglobulin bound to the captured human LDL, alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse IgG or IgM antibodies were added. For each of these assays, the amount of EO6 binding or the content of bound IgG or IgM was expressed per MB24, e.g. normalizing each value per LDL particle. Each plasma sample was assayed in triplicate. Each data point represents the average value of assays from five mice. Liver total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocol. Northern blot was performed as described (57.Shih D.M. Gu L. Hama S. Xia Y.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The probes used in hybridization were a 588-bp PCR product from the exon 5 of mouse heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene, an KpnI 500-bp fragment from a mouse macrosialin cDNA clone, a ClaI/ApaI 757-bp fragment from mouse F4/80 cDNA clone, and a HindIII/PstI 280-bp fragment from mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA clone. Quantitation of mRNA levels on the Northern blots was done using a PhosphorImager 445SI (Molecular Dynamics). For analysis of mRNA of other genes by RT-PCR, first strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand cDNA was then used as template in RT-PCR. The program for RT-PCR of scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) was 94 °C for 4 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 5 min, followed by 72 °C for 7 min. The program for all other RT-PCRs was 94 °C for 4 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 72 °C for 7 min. The primer pairs for RT-PCR were as follows: for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (product size = 775 bp), 5′-GCC ATT GAG TGC CGA GTC TGT G-3′ and 5′-GGA AAC CAC TGA AAT ACC TCG G-3′; for SRA (product size = 328 bp), 5′-CCA AGT CCT TGC AGA GTC TG-3′ and 5′-AGC CCT CTG TCT CCC TTT TC-3′; for CD36 (product size = 491 bp), 5′-CAG CCC AAT GGA GCC ATC-3′ and 5′-AAC ACA GCG TAG ATA GAC CTG C-3′; for SRBI (product size = 1767 bp), 5′-GTC CTG AGC CCC GAG AGC-3′ and 5′-TGT CCC TGG TCC CTG AGT-3′; and for GAPDH (product size = 438 bp), 5′-TGC CAT TTG CAG TGG CAA AGT GG-3′ and 5′-TTG TCA TGG ATG ACC TTG GCC AGG-3′. PCR products were fractionated by 1.5% agarose gel, stained with SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and scanned and quantitated using a Hitachi FMBIO II Multi-View scanner. Known amounts of DNA standards were included on the gels for construction of standard curve for quantitation of the PCR products. PON1 KO mice were intercrossed with apoE KO mice to produce mice lacking both PON1 and apoE. The study was designed to maintain a largely inbred (97%) genetic background of strain C57BL/6J to avoid possible background effects on lesion development an"
https://openalex.org/W2112821460,"Uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) is a mitochondrial protein that can diminish the mitochondrial membrane potential. Levels of muscle Ucp3 mRNA are increased by thyroid hormone and fasting. Ucp3 has been proposed to influence metabolic efficiency and is a candidate obesity gene. We have produced aUcp3 knockout mouse to test these hypotheses. TheUcp3 (−/−) mice had no detectable immunoreactive UCP3 by Western blotting. In mitochondria from the knockout mice, proton leak was greatly reduced in muscle, minimally reduced in brown fat, and not reduced at all in liver. These data suggest that UCP3 accounts for much of the proton leak in skeletal muscle. Despite the lack of UCP3, no consistent phenotypic abnormality was observed. The knockout mice were not obese and had normal serum insulin, triglyceride, and leptin levels, with a tendency toward reduced free fatty acids and glucose. Knockout mice showed a normal circadian rhythm in body temperature and motor activity and had normal body temperature responses to fasting, stress, thyroid hormone, and cold exposure. The base-line metabolic rate and respiratory exchange ratio were the same in knockout and control mice, as were the effects of fasting, a β3-adrenergic agonist (CL316243), and thyroid hormone on these parameters. The phenotype ofUcp1/Ucp3 double knockout mice was indistinguishable fromUcp1 single knockout mice. These data suggest thatUcp3 is not a major determinant of metabolic rate but, rather, has other functions."
https://openalex.org/W1989287988,"The production of recombinant proteins in the periplasm of <i>Escherichia coli</i> can be limited by folding problems, leading to periplasmic aggregates. We used a selection system for periplasmic chaperones based on the coexpression of an <i>E. coli</i> library with a poorly expressing antibody single-chain Fv (scFv) fragment displayed on filamentous phage (Bothmann, H., and Plückthun, A. (1998) <i>Nature Biotechnol.</i> 16, 376–380). By selection for a functional antibody, the protein Skp had been enriched previously and shown to improve periplasmic expression of a wide range of scFv fragments. This selection strategy was now repeated with a library constructed from the genomic DNA of an<i>skp-</i>deficient strain, leading to enrichment of the periplasmic peptidylprolyl <i>cis,trans</i>-isomerase (PPIase) FkpA. Coexpression of FkpA increased the amount of fusion protein displayed on the phage and dramatically improved functional periplasmic expression even of scFv fragments not containing<i>cis</i>-prolines. In contrast, the coexpression of the periplasmic PPIases PpiA and SurA showed no increase in the functional scFv fragment level in the periplasm or displayed on phage. Together with the <i>in vitro</i> data in the accompanying paper (Ramm, K., and Plückthun, A. (2000) <i>J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1998993673,"Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand exchange is greatly enhanced by the single-stranded (ss) DNA binding factor RPA if the latter is introduced after Rad51 has already nucleated onto the initiating ssDNA substrate.

These genes were first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and consist ofRAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54/TID1, MRE11, and XRS2. Mutations in these genes very often result in severe meiotic phenotypes including an arrest in meiotic prophase, low sporulation efficiency, and spore inviability, which arise because of a requirement for the recombination machinery in ensuring the proper disjunction of chromosomal homologs in meiosis I. The RAD52 group genes also mediate the repair of DNA strand breaks by homologous recombination (reviewed in Ref. 1.Paques F. Haber J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RAD51 gene product is structurally related to RecA (2.Aboussekhra A. Chanet R. Adjiri A. Fabre P. Mol. Cell.

Studies on RecA, its bacteriophage T4 counterpart UvsX, and eukaryotic Rad51 have indicated that they mediate the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction that forms heteroduplex DNA during recombination. In the earliest phase of this reaction, referred to as presynapsis, Rad51 polymerizes on ssDNA1 to form a right-handed nucleoprotein filament that has a highly regular pitch (∼95 Å) and in which the DNA is held in a highly extended conformation (axial rise of ∼5.4 Å per base or base pair) (5.Ogawa T., Yu, X.

The assembly of this presynaptic Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament requires ATP binding but not its hydrolysis (7.Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol.

Extract was made from 15 g of cell paste (from 8 liters of culture) in 120 ml of cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) in the presence of protease inhibitors using a French press (23.Sung P. Matson S.W. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min), and the supernatant (fraction I, 120 ml) was applied onto a column of SP-Sepharose (2.5 × 6.1 cm; 30 ml total) equilibrated in buffer K (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 150 mm KCl. The column was developed with a 300-ml gradient of 150–650 mm KCl in buffer K. Rad52 elutes from SP-Sepharose at ≈360 mm KCl, the pool of which (fraction II, 30 ml) was diluted with 2 volumes of K buffer and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (1.5 × 5.5 cm; 8 ml total), which was developed with a 100-ml gradient of 120–450 mm KCl in K buffer, collecting 2-ml fractions. The pool of Rad52 (fraction III; 10 ml), eluting from Q-Sepharose at about 300 mm KCl, was mixed with 1 ml of nickel-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. The nickel matrix was poured into a glass column (1 cm diameter) and washed with 10 volumes each of 10, 20, and 30 mm imidazole in buffer K containing 500 mm KCl. Rad52 was eluted with 4 ml of 200 mm imidazole in buffer K containing 500 mm KCl and then concentrated to 1 ml using a Centricon microconcentrator (Amicon). The concentrated nickel pool (fraction IV) was subject to sizing in a column of Sepharose 6B (1.6 × 40 cm; 80 ml matrix) in buffer K containing 150 mm KCl. The Rad52 pool (fraction V, 8 ml) was loaded directly onto a Mono S column (HR5/5), which was developed with a 30-ml gradient of 150–500 mm KCl in buffer K. Fractions containing the peak of Rad52 protein, eluting at ≈350 mm KCl, were pooled (fraction VI; 4 ml) and concentrated to 5 mg/ml and stored in small portions at −70 °C. The concentration of Rad52 protein was measured by densitometric comparison of multiple loadings of Rad52 protein against known amounts of bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin in a Coomassie Blue R-stained polyacrylamide gel. Rad51 was purified to near-homogeneity from yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring the plasmid pR51.3 (2 μm,PGK-RAD51), using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatographic fractionation steps in columns of Q-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, Bio-Rex 70, and Mono Q (7.Sung P.

RPA was purified from a yeast strain genetically tailored to co-overexpress the three subunits of RPA (a gift from Richard Kolodner). Extract was prepared and then subjected to fractionation in columns of Affi-Gel Blue, ssDNA cellulose, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q as described (14.Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The RPA purified this way was nearly homogeneous and was stored in K buffer containing 200 mm KCl. The concentration of RPA was measured by densitometric comparison of multiple loadings of RPA against known amounts of bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin in a Coomassie Blue R-stained polyacrylamide gel. Purified Rad51 (3 mg) and Rad52 (3.25 mg) were incubated in 5 ml of buffer K with 300 mm KCl for 12 h on ice and then mixed with 1 ml of nickel-NTA-agarose to immobilize the Rad51-Rad52 complex, which was eluted from the nickel matrix with 3 ml of 200 mm imidazole in buffer K containing 300 mm KCl. The eluate was concentrated to 0.3 ml in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator, diluted to 3 ml with buffer K containing 300 KCl, and reconcentrated to 0.3 ml. This filter-dialysis step was repeated in the same concentrator, and the final concentrate, containing Rad51-Rad52 complex at 150 μm, was stored in small portions at −70 °C. φX174 viral (+) strand was purchased from New England Biolabs, and the replicative form (about 90% supercoiled form and 10% nicked circular form) was from Life Technologies, Inc. The 83-mer oligonucleotides used in the strand exchange experiments were as follows: Oligo 1 with 16% GC content, 5′-AAA TGA ACA TAA AGT AAA TAA GTA TAA GGA TAA TAC AAA ATA AGT AAA TGA ATA AAC ATA GAA AAT AAA GTA AAG GAT ATA AA; Oligo 2, the exact complement of Oligo 1, was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then annealed to Oligo 1. The resulting duplex was purified from 10% polyacrylamide gels by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaOAC, 0.5 mm EDTA). A Sepharose 6B column (1 × 45 cm; 35 ml total) was used to monitor the migration of Rad51, Rad52, and the Rad51-Rad52 complex in the experiment described in Fig. 2 A. Rad51 protein (11.6 μm in panels I, III, and IV) and Rad52 protein (11.6 μm in panels II andIII and 2.3 μm in panel IV) were incubated in 100 μl of column buffer (buffer K containing 150 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT) on ice for 1 h, diluted with 400 μl of column buffer, and then filtered through the sizing column at 0.2 ml/min, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. The indicated column fractions were subject to immunoblot analyses to determine their content of the Rad51 and Rad52 proteins. For calibration of the column, thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and blue dextran (>2,000 kDa) were used, and their elution positions are marked on the chromatogram in Fig. 2 A. In Fig. 2 B, Rad51 and Rad52 proteins were incubated at various molar ratios (0.5 μm Rad51 and 2 μm Rad52 or 1:4; 1.5 μm Rad51 and 1.25 μm Rad52 or 1.2:1; 3 μm Rad51 and 1 μm Rad52 or 3:1; or 2 μm Rad51 alone) in 1 ml of K buffer containing 300 mm KCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 1 h. In Fig. 2 C, reaction mixtures containing 1.5 μm Rad51 or a combination of 1.5 μm Rad51 and 1.5 μm Rad52 were incubated in the same buffer with or without 2.5 mm ATP and 3 mm MgCl2 for 1 h. All the mixtures were gently mixed with 200 μl of nickel-NTA-agarose beads at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed with 2 ml of 20 mmimidazole in the same buffer with or without ATP/MgCl2before eluting the bound proteins with 400 μl of 3% SDS by boiling for 1 min. The substrates used were φX174 viral (+) strand and the replicative form linearized with PstI. In Fig. 3, A–C, the reactions contained both ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) and dsDNA (20 μmnucleotides) with the indicated amounts of Rad51 protein, Rad52 protein, or Rad51-Rad52 complex in 10 μl of reaction buffer (35 mm K-MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml BSA, with or without 2.5 mm ATP and 3 mmMgCl2, as indicated). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, mixed with 2 μl of loading buffer (0.1% Orange G in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50% glycerol), and then subjected to electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels at 100 mA in TAE buffer at 25 °C until the dye front had migrated 4 cm. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide to reveal the DNA species. In Fig. 3 D, Rad51 (0.45 μm), Rad52 (0.45 μm), or a mixture of these two proteins in 150 μl of buffer T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing 150 mm KCl and 100 μg/ml BSA was incubated on ice for 45 min and then mixed with 15 μl of ssDNA cellulose beads (1 μg of denatured calf thymus DNA/μl beads; purchased from United States Biochemical Corp.) for 45 min at 25 °C. The beads were collected by a 5-s centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, washed with 150 μl of buffer T containing 300 mm KCl, and treated with 35 μl of 3% SDS at 37 °C for 15 min to elute bound proteins. Equivalent amounts of the input material, the supernatant that contained unbound proteins, the KCl wash, and SDS eluate were subject to immunoblotting to examine the Rad51 and Rad52 contents. Rad51 protein (10 μm) with or without Rad52 protein (4 μm) was incubated with or without φX ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) and 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP using the buffer conditions employed in the strand exchange assay. At the indicated times, 1-μl aliquots were removed and directly spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheet, which was developed in 0.75 m potassium phosphate. The polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets were analyzed in the PhosphorImager. The indicated amounts of Rad51 protein in 1 μl of storage buffer were incubated with ssDNA (30 μm) added in 1 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA) in 10 μl of buffer R (35 mm K-MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT) containing 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm ATP, and 3 mmMgCl2 for 5 min at 37 °C. After the addition of the indicated amounts of RPA in 0.5 μl of storage buffer, reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for another 5 min before the incorporation of dsDNA (30 μm) in 1 μl of TE and 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine hydrochloride. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K. Deproteinization of the reaction mixtures was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min. After the addition of 0.2 volume of gel loading buffer, samples were run in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer, stained with ethidium bromide for 60 min, and then destained for at least 4 h in a large volume of H2O. Images were recorded in a NucleoTech Gel documentation system and analyzed with the software provided. In the time course experiments, the reaction mixtures were scaled up accordingly, and 6-μl portions of the mixtures were withdrawn for analysis at each time point. Reaction mixtures (12.5 μl final volume) containing the indicated amounts of Rad51, Rad52, and RPA were incubated on ice for 45 min, followed by the addition of φX ssDNA. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by the incorporation of the linear dsDNA and spermidine, as described in the standard reaction above. In Fig. 6 A, 1.0 μm Rad51 or Rad51-Rad52 complex was incubated with Oligo 2 (3 μm) in 10.5 μl of buffer R containing 20 mm KCl, 2.5 mm ATP, and 3 mmMgCl2 at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine and the homologous duplex (6 μm) consisting of unlabeled Oligo 1 and32P-labeled Oligo 2 in 1 μl. At the indicated times, 4 μl of the reaction mixture was deproteinized and resolved in a 10% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer, which was dried onto a sheet of DEAE paper, and the DNA species was quantified in a PhosphorImager. In the experiment in Fig. 7, A and B, unlabeled Oligo 2 (3 μm) was incubated with Rad51 or Rad51-Rad52 complex in 10 μl of buffer R at 37 °C for 5 min before an increasing concentration of RPA (0.07, 0.14, 0.28, and 0.56 μm) was added in 0.5 μl. After a further 5 min, 1 μl of 50 mmspermidine hydrochloride and the homologous 32P-labeled duplex in 1 μl were incorporated to complete the reactions (12.5 μl final volume). Alternatively, Oligo 2 was co-incubated in 10.5 μl of buffer R with RPA and Rad51 or Rad51-Rad52 complex for 5 min or preincubated with RPA for 5 min before Rad51 or Rad51-Rad52 complex was added and then followed by an additional 5 min of incubation. Subsequent to the addition of labeled duplex DNA and spermidine, all the reaction mixtures (12.5 μl final volume) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before being deproteinized and analyzed in 10% polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer. The gels were dried and the DNA species quantified in the PhosphorImager.Figure 7Rad51-Rad52, but not Rad51, can utilize an RPA-coated ssDNA template for homologous pairing. A,homologous pairing reactions that used oligonucleotides (3 μm ss and 6 μm homologous duplex) with Rad51 protein (1 μm), in which increasing concentrations of RPA (0.07, 0.14, 0.28, and 0.56 μm) were either preincubated with the ss oligonucleotide (●), added with Rad51 to the ss oligonucleotide (○), or added after the ss oligonucleotide had been preincubated with Rad51 (■). B, Rad51-Rad52 complex (1 μm) and oligonucleotide substrates (3 μmss and 6 μm homologous duplex) were used in the strand exchange reactions. In these reactions, increasing concentrations of RPA (0.07, 0.14, 0.28, and 0.56 μm) were either preincubated with the ss oligonucleotide (●), added with Rad51-Rad52 complex to the ss oligonucleotide (○), or added after the ss oligonucleotide had been preincubated with Rad51-Rad52 complex (■). After the addition of the 32P-labeled duplex, reaction mixtures were further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixtures were resolved in 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the reaction products were quantified in the PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All the reaction mixtures in the experiment in Fig. 5 had a final volume of 37.5 μl. In the experiments in panels Iand II of Fig. 5 A, Rad51 protein (10 μm in panel I and 20 μm inpanel II) was preincubated with φX ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) and then with RPA (1.5 μm) as in the standard reaction. Following the preincubations, 1 μl of either TE or TE containing BsaI-linearized pBluescript DNA (75 μm nucleotides) was added to the reaction mixtures, which were incubated at 37 °C for another 2 min, before the φX duplex (30 μm nucleotides) and spermidine were incorporated to complete the reaction. In the experiment in panel III of Fig. 5 A, Rad51 (10 μm) and Rad52 proteins (2.5 μm) were preincubated with φX ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) and then with RPA (1.5 μm). Following these preincubations, 1 μl of either TE or TE containing linear pBluescript duplex DNA (75 μm nucleotides) was added to the reaction mixtures, which were incubated at 37 °C for 2 additional min before φX duplex DNA (30 μm nucleotides) and spermidine were incorporated to complete the reaction. A 6-μl portion of the reaction mixtures was withdrawn at the indicated times and processed for gel electrophoresis. Self-aggregation reaction (25 μl final volume) was carried out by following the order of addition of reaction components and using the buffer described for the standard strand exchange reaction. After the addition of dsDNA, reaction samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min and immediately spun at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 25 °C. After centrifugation, 20 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl of 1% SDS, and 35 μl of 0.5% SDS was added to the pellet fraction to dissolve the precipitated protein-DNA complex. The supernatant and pellet fractions, 8 μl each, were analyzed for their protein contents by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. To examine the DNA contents, a 10-μl portion of the supernatant and pellet fractions was treated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 20 min and then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis as described for the strand exchange experiments. Rad51, RPA, and DNA (ss and ds) were omitted from some of the experiments (Fig. 6, C andD), as indicated, and Oligo 2 replaced the φX ssDNA in Fig. 6 E. We examined the level of strand exchange reaction products (Fig.1 A) by fixing the amount of Rad51 (10 μm), and we varied the concentration of RPA (0.4–2.8 μm), added either with Rad51 (Fig. 1 B, panel I) or after Rad51 has already nucleated onto the ssDNA (Fig.1 B, panel II), as in the standard reaction. At levels of RPA of 2 μm and above, pronounced inhibition of the reaction was observed with the co-addition of components (Fig. 1, Band C). However, at amounts of RPA lower than 2 μm, the extent of suppression of reaction products was much less severe (Fig. 1, B and C). It seems likely that at lower concentrations of RPA, enough Rad51 can still nucleate onto the ssDNA to prime the assembly of the presynaptic nucleoprotein filament. We have previously described expression of Rad52 in yeast and its purification to near-homogeneity (15.Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Since much larger amounts of functionally active and nearly homogeneous Rad52 can be obtained by expression in E. coli (12.New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 13.Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 22.Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As indicated from recent work (12.New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 13.Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 15.Sung P. J. Biol.

Rad52 by itself, with or without RPA, is devoid of homologous DNA pairing activity (12.New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 13.Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 15.Sung P. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, panel I, Rad51 (43 kDa) eluted from a Sepharose 6B column with an average V e/V t (elution volume/total column volume) of ∼0.7, which is slightly before the elution position of catalase (232 kDa), suggesting a multimeric structure under the conditions used. Rad52 (56 kDa) eluted from Sepharose 6B with an averageV e/V t of ∼0.6, slightly before the elution volume of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), indicating that Rad52 also exists as a multimeric structure (Fig. 2 A, panel II); the same results were obtained with Rad52 purified from yeast cells (data not shown). When mixed with an equimolar amount of Rad52, the majority of Rad51 (>85%) emerged from the sizing column at a much earlier position (average V e/V t of ∼0.55) than free Rad51 (V e/V t of ∼0.7). Consistent with the formation of a stable complex of Rad51 and Rad52, the Rad52 peak was also shifted slightly (Fig. 2 A, panel III). When the amount of Rad52 was lowered to one-fifth of the previous level, the portion of the Rad51 shifted to the earlier elution position dropped accordingly to about 20% of the total (see Fig.2 A, panel IV). Similarly, when Rad52 was fixed at the previous level but with the amount of Rad51 being increased five times, the portion of Rad51 found in association with Rad52 was once again about 20% of the total (data not shown). Thus, Rad51 and Rad52 form a stable complex consisting of approximately equimolar amounts of the two proteins. Judging from the elution position of the Rad51-Rad52 complex, it appears that the complex contains multiple molecules of the two proteins. Complex formation between Rad51 and Rad52 was also examined by mixing different molar amounts of the two proteins and then immobilizing the complex on nickel-NTA-agarose through the histidine tag on Rad52. The results shown in Fig. 2 B are again consistent with an approximately equimolar complex between Rad51 and Rad52. The addition of ATP and magnesium did not alter the amount or the stoichiometry of Rad51-Rad52 complex formed, assessed both by immobilizing the complex via the histidine tag on Rad52 (Fig. 2 C) or by sizing in Sepharose 6B (data not shown). The same molar concentrations of Rad51, Rad52, and Rad51-Rad52 complex were incubated with a mixture of ssDNA and dsDNA in the presence of ATP and magnesium, and nucleoprotein complexes were separated from free DNA in an agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Fig.3 A shows that both Rad52 and the Rad51-Rad52 complex bound specifically to the ssDNA. The experiment presented in Fig. 3 A was done in the presence of ATP and magnesium, but we have detected no difference in terms of the amount of ssDNA shifted or the binding specificity of the Rad51-Rad52 complex when ATP was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 3 B). No significant shifting of either the ss or ds form of DNA was observed with the concentrations of Rad51 used (Fig. 3 A). Much higher concentrations of Rad51 are needed to see ATP-dependent binding to the ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig. 3 C). In the DNA mobility shift experiments (Fig. 3, A andB), we could not ascertain that Rad51 was present in the nucleoprotein complex. To demonstrate directly that Rad51 is being targeted to ssDNA by Rad52, we co-incubated Rad51 and Rad52 with ssDNA cellulose and then analyzed the bound proteins by immunoblot analyses after their elution from the matrix by SDS treatment. Under the same conditions, Rad51 alone did not bind to ssDNA cellulose, but Rad52 alone did (Fig. 3 D). Importantly, very similar amounts of"

We analyzed the role of the cytoplasmic tail by expressing wild type MT1-MMP and three mutants with progressively truncated C termini in human Bowes melanoma cells. We examined gelatinase A activation and the localization and processing of recombinant proteins in stable cell clones using gelatin zymography, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Cell invasion was analyzed<i>in vitro</i> by Matrigel invasion assays. Gelatinase A was activated in all cell clones. However, the localization of MT1-MMP to the leading edge of migrating cells and cell invasion through Matrigel were strongly enhanced only in cells expressing either wild type or truncated MT1-MMP lacking 6 C-terminal amino acid residues (Δ577). Truncations of 10 or 16 amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain (Δ567 and Δ573, respectively) disturbed MT1-MMP localization. The expression of wild type and Δ577 MT1-MMPs induced also their cleavage to 43-kDa cell surface forms and the release of soluble, ∼20-kDa N-terminal fragments containing the catalytic center. A synthetic MMP inhibitor but not a gelatinase inhibitor prevented the processing, suggesting that autocatalytic cleavage occurs. Purified soluble MT1-MMP was also autoproteolytically processed to 43- and 20-kDa forms <i>in vitro</i>. Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain has an important role in cell invasion by controlling both the targeting and degradation/turnover of MT1-MMP."

We have now investigated the properties of FkpA in vitro. The peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of FkpA was found to be among the highest of any such enzyme with a protein substrate, yet FkpA is not able to enhance the proline-limited refolding rate of the disulfide-free hu4D5-8 scFv fragment, probably due to inaccessibility of Pro-L95. Nevertheless, the yield of the soluble and functional scFv fragment was dramatically increasedin vitro in the presence of FkpA. Similar effects were observed for an scFv fragment devoid of cis-prolines. We are thus forced to conclude that the observed folding-assisting function is independent of the isomerase activity of the protein. The beneficial effect of FkpA was found to be due to two components. First, FkpA interacts with early folding intermediates, thus preventing their aggregation. Additionally, it has the ability to reactivate inactive protein, possibly also by binding to a partially unfolded species that may exist in equilibrium with the aggregated form, which may thus be released on a productive pathway.

This was achieved by overexpressing a library of E. coli proteins in a phagemid, on which a poorly expressing antibody was encoded for phage display, and panning for functional antibody. In vivo overexpression experiments provided further evidence that the yield of functional antibody scFv fragments produced in the periplasm is increased upon coexpression of FkpA. Interestingly, the effect was also observed with antibody fragments devoid of cis-prolines (7.Bothmann H. Plückthun A. J. Biol.

It was found that a state with considerable structure within the domains is formed on the millisecond time scale, regardless of the peptide conformation at the proline residues. However, a complication is introduced by the slow isomerization of the peptide bond preceding Pro-L95, which must becis for the native VH/VL interface to form. As a consequence, the final correct docking of VHand VL (and thus, the subsequent stabilization of the structure) is limited in rate by this prolinecis,trans-isomerization (10.Freund C. Gehrig P.

In the scFv format, presumably through the increased effective domain concentration mediated by the interdomain peptide linker, the domains have been shown to associate prematurely instead of folding rapidly and independently into native-like structures,3 thus forming off-pathway intermediates that are potentially prone to aggregation.We have chosen two different model systems to investigate the effect of FkpA on scFv fragment refolding in vitro. The disulfide-free variant (15.Wörn A. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) of the hu4D5-8 scFv fragment (termed 4D5− −) to indicate the absence of both disulfide bonds (16.Carter P. Kelley R.F. Rodrigues M.L. Snedecor B. Covarrubias M. Velligan M.D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C.E. Carver M.E. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), an antibody scFv fragment binding the extracellular domain of p185HER2, was chosen for its low stability and reduced reversibility of refolding. With refolding yields of 75% at 10 °C under optimal conditions, this scFv fragment leaves room for a possible improvement by FkpA (14.Ramm K. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The anti-GCN4 scFv fragment, which binds the transcriptional activator Gcn4p (17.Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), was chosen because it has a VL domain of the λ type and thus nocis-prolines in its native structure.2 Since, however, the wild-type anti-GCN4 fragment displays excellent folding properties, we used a destabilized variant for this study containing the H-R66K mutation, where H refers to the heavy chain (18.Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Arg at the heavy chain position H66 was shown previously to result in higher protein stability than Lys (19.Proba K. Wörn A. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20.Wörn A. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8739-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The obtained mutant is indeed considerably less stable (18.Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and shows reduced folding reversibility due to aggregation at elevated temperatures. The experiments with the anti-GCN4 (H-R66K) scFv fragment could therefore be carried out at physiologically relevant temperatures (37 °C) under conditions allowing for the observation of an effect of FkpA.In this study, we have attempted a thorough analysis of the biochemical properties of FkpA in vitro and its effect on scFv fragments. We investigated whether FkpA can accelerate the rate of refolding or increase the refolding yield of antibody fragmentsin vitro and whether these two effects are connected. Particularly, we also determined the effect of FkpA on an scFv fragment with a λ domain, devoid of cis-prolines. We measured the rate of acceleration in folding and the amount of soluble monomeric as well as functional scFv protein and also tested the dependence on the time of PPIase addition. We came to the conclusion that the effect on increasing the yield is independent of the PPIase activity of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONOur in vitro measurements of FkpA activity have shown that it is an extremely efficient PPIase, with ak cat/K m of 4 × 106m−1 s−1 and thus comparable to other FKBPs (21.Dolinski K. Scholz C. Muir R.S. Rospert S. Schmid F.X. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2267-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28.Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The activities of the other FKBPs and PpiA mentioned here have been determined using peptide substrates; and depending on the protein, higher (trigger factor (24.Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)) or lower (FKBP12 (21.Dolinski K. Scholz C. Muir R.S. Rospert S. Schmid F.X. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2267-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) values were found when measurements were carried out with a folding protein as a substrate. Especially for the trigger factor, the data show that it catalyzes isomerization in a folding protein much more efficiently than in an oligopeptide of comparable local sequence (24.Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This was found to result predominantly from the tight binding of the trigger factor to the folding protein substrate (28.Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Given the present data, it is tempting to speculate that the very efficient catalysis of RNase T1 refolding by FkpA may also partly be due to such a binding effect. FkpA is, however, not able to accelerate the rate-limiting proline cis,trans-isomerization of scFv fragment hu4D5-8. This must be attributed to the inaccessibility of Pro-L95 in a very early trapped folding intermediate of the scFv fragment (14.Ramm K. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)3 since this isomerization can be catalyzed when the same VL domain is refolded alone.3Nevertheless, in vivo overexpression of FkpA, which had initially been selected as a factor increasing the amount of active scFv fragment expressed in the periplasm (7.Bothmann H. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17100-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), has a dramatic effect on the expression yield of a number of scFv fragments, among them the 4D5− − scFv fragment, whose rate-limiting proline isomerization is not accelerated by FkpA, and the anti-GCN4 scFv fragment, which carries no cis-prolines at all. This prompted us to take a closer look at the molecular mechanisms behind this beneficial effect of FkpA on scFv refolding in vitro, with the aim to understand the importance of the prolyl isomerase activity of FkpA in this context and to distinguish it from other possible folding-assisting functions.In the past years, there has been a controversial discussion as to whether protein-folding catalysts such as prolylcis,trans-isomerases could also exhibit chaperone-like activity independent of or in addition to their catalytic activity (29.Freskgard P.-O. Bergenhem N. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Science. 1992; 258: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30.Rinfret A. Collins C. Ménard R. Andersson S.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1668-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31.Kern G. Kern D. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The definition of a chaperone itself will be, of course, decisive for the inclusion of factors. The most widely accepted definition is a protein that transiently binds and thus stabilizes an otherwise unstable conformer of another protein, thus facilitating folding by preventing misfolding and aggregation (see, for example, Ref. 32.Rassow J. van Ahsen O. Bömer U. Pfanner N. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 129-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recently, there have been further examples demonstrating a chaperoning function for classical PPIases, namely Cyp-40 (33.Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and FKBP52 (34.Bose S. Weikl T. Bügl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), both proteins from the eukaryotic cytosol. The E. coli trigger factor, an isomerase of the FKBP family, has long been suggested to possess additional chaperone activity (reviewed in Ref. 35.Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is dependent on the presence of its additional flanking domains (36.Zarnt T. Tradler T. Stoller G. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). FkpA is a member of the FKBP family since it shows 83% sequence identity to the consensus sequence of the FK506-binding domain, derived from an alignment of mammalian, yeast, and bacterial members of this family (1.Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).Our results clearly show that FkpA assists protein folding of the investigated scFv fragments in vitro. As there is no correlation with the acceleration of prolinecis,trans-isomerization or even the presence ofcis-prolines, we are forced to conclude that the chaperoning effect of FkpA must be independent of its peptidylprolylcis,trans-isomerase activity. This view is supported by the absence of any in vivo or in vitro effect of PpiA (RotA).The observed effect is 2-fold. On the one hand, FkpA appears to be able to interact with early folding intermediates, thus preventing aggregation, provided the scFv protein is prone to such off-pathway reactions under the conditions used. This is clearly demonstrated by the marked dependence of the magnitude of the beneficial effect of FkpA on the time point of its addition during refolding. Recent studies with the 4D5− − scFv fragment (14.Ramm K. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)3 have shown that premature interaction between the domains occurs very fast in the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument, and it is possible that such a non-native intermediate binds to FkpA transiently. Stable binding was not detectable.On the other hand, FkpA increases the activity even when added very late to the folding reaction and, moreover, also when incubated with “native” protein. We interpret this effect as FkpA acting on non-native, possibly aggregated, but soluble scFv fragments, which were also present in our preparation of native scFv protein. They may very likely have formed during acid elution from the affinity columns, and they also occur in equilibrium with the native form at least in the case of the 4D5− − scFv fragment, due to its marginal stability, at temperatures of 20 °C or higher. FkpA can thus be proposed to act also by binding to partially unfolded or aggregated species present at equilibrium, thus preventing their further irreversible aggregation and facilitating their reactivation.It is tempting to speculate that both activities (early prevention of aggregation and “rescue” of inactive molecules) have the same molecular cause: a transient interaction of non-native intermediates with FkpA. In the one case, they may immediately be released in a form that is productive for further folding, without ever forming an aggregate, thereby increasing the yield of the reaction, provided FkpA is present from the beginning. In the other case, FkpA binds either to the aggregate or to non-native forms in equilibrium with the aggregated state, which can thus productively fold from the FkpA-bound state. What the exact recognition motif is and whether it is the same in both cases must await further studies.Based on these findings, the reasons for the remarkably large effect of coexpression of FkpA in vivo (7.Bothmann H. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17100-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) can now be understood. When quantitating expression of antibody fragments in vivo, one cannot distinguish between assistance of refolding and dynamic stabilization of the native protein by a rescue mechanism such that the observed effect will be the sum of the two. Moreover, conditions in the cell are rather on the unfavorable side for folding yields compared with the conditions used in the in vitro study due to elevated temperatures and very high concentrations of protein in the cell. A combination of all these factors may well explain the fact that the beneficial effect of FkpA coexpression in vivo is 2–3-fold higher than what we observed in ELISA measurements in vitro.Whether the dramatic effect of FkpA observed here in vitroand in vivo is physiologically relevant for E. coli proteins is, however, a difficult question since the maximal effect requires very large concentrations of the protein. In this context, it is interesting to note that some overexpression of FkpA can be achieved under stress conditions, as the gene is at least partially controlled by ςE (3.Rouvière P.E. De Las Peñas A. Mecsas J. Lu C.Z. Rudd K.E. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4.Raina S. Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), possessing an ςE-activable promoter. It has also been shown that extracytoplasmic defects that increase ςE activity stimulate fkpA transcription to some extent (5.Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Together with the observation that a null mutation in fkpA stimulates transcription of the degP locus (which encodes a heat shock-inducible periplasmic protease (Refs. 1.Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar and 2.Horne S.M. Young K.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref.6.Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)) and vice versa, FkpA has already been suggested to perform a general periplasmic folding function (1.Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 5.Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the biological purpose of FkpA induction under stress conditions may be related to the chaperoning properties reported here, in conjunction with or even independent of its unquestionable PPIase activity. In the periplasm, especially under stress conditions, a “protein buffer” would be needed to which unfolded proteins can transiently bind and from which they can be refolded. We have clearly shown this function for FkpA in vitro, and it is attractive to propose that it can fulfill this role in vivo as well. FkpA is one of three soluble peptidylprolylcis,trans-isomerases (PPIase)1 in the periplasm ofEscherichia coli, in addition to PpiA (RotA) and SurA (1.Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It was first described as being similar to the macrophage infectivity potentiator of Legionella species (2.Horne S.M. Young K.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is homologous to the FK506-binding proteins and was subsequently shown to belong to the ςE regulon and thus to be inducible under stress conditions (Refs. 3.Rouvière P.E. De Las Peñas A. Mecsas J. Lu C.Z. Rudd K.E. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4.Raina S. Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C.

Although thefkpA deletion mutant has been shown to be viable (1.Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2.Horne S.M. Young K.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), FkpA has been proposed to have a general folding-assisting function in the periplasm (Refs. 1.Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar and 5.Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J.

This idea was based on an fkpA deletion causing up-regulation of ςE and thus stimulation of degP transcription and, in addition, FkpA's own induction by extracytoplasmic stress (5.Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and its ability to restore near-normal ςE-dependent response when overexpressed (1.Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the accompanying paper (7.Bothmann H. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17100-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), FkpA was identified in a selection system as a factor improving the functional expression of antibody scFv fragments in the bacterial periplasm. This was achieved by overexpressing a library of E. coli proteins in a phagemid, on which a poorly expressing antibody was encoded for phage display, and panning for functional antibody. In vivo overexpression experiments provided further evidence that the yield of functional antibody scFv fragments produced in the periplasm is increased upon coexpression of FkpA. Interestingly, the effect was also observed with antibody fragments devoid of cis-prolines (7.Bothmann H. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17100-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In antibody scFv fragments, the variable domain of the heavy chain (VH) is connected via a linker to the variable domain of the light chain (VL). Antibody VH domains have never been found to carry a cis-proline in their framework, 2A. Honegger, personal communication. 2A.

The importance of HBX in the life cycle of HBV has been well established, but the underlying molecular function of HBX remains controversial. We previously identified a proteasome subunit PSMA7 that interacts specifically with HBX in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system. Here we demonstrate that PSMC1, an ATPase-like subunit of the 19 S proteasome component, also interacts with HBX and PSMA7. Analysis of the interacting domains among PSMA7, PSMC1, and HBX by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis suggested a mutually competitive structural relationship among these polypeptides. The competitive nature of these interactions is further demonstrated using a modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system. The crucial HBX sequences involved in interaction with PSMA7 and PSMC1 are important for its function as a transcriptional coactivator. HBX, while functioning as a coactivator of AP-1 and acidic activator VP-16 in mammalian cells, had no effect on the transactivation function of their functional orthologs GCN4 and Gal4 in yeast. Overexpression of PSMC1 seemed to suppress the expression of various reporters in mammalian cells; this effect, however, was overcome by coexpression of HBX. In addition, HBX expression inhibited the cellular turnover of c-Jun and ubiquitin-Arg-β-galactosidase, two well known substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, interaction of HBX with the proteasome complex in metazoan cells may underlie the functional basis of proteasome as a cellular target of HBX.

Thus, interaction of HBX with the proteasome complex in metazoan cells may underlie the functional basis of proteasome as a cellular target of HBX. hepatitis B virus hepatitis B virus X protein β-galactosidase amino acid(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin cytomegalovirus Human hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 belongs to a group of hepadnaviruses that includes the hepatitis viruses of the woodchuck, ground squirrel, tree squirrel, Pekin duck, and heron. HBV has a unique fourth open reading frame, termed the hepatitis B virus X (HBX) gene. HBX gene is well conserved among the mammalian hepadnaviruses and codes for a 16.5-kDa protein (1.Haruna Y.

HBX has been shown to enhance transcription through AP-1 and AP-2 (7.Haviv I. Vazl D. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Natoli G. Avantaggiati M.L.

Several recent studies have also identified possible cellular targets of HBX, including members of the CREB/ATF family (12.Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A.

Feitelson M.A. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HBX has also been shown to interact with p53 and inhibit its function (19.Truant R. Antunovic J. Greenblatt J.

A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HBX possesses amino acid sequence homology to the functionally essential domains of Kunitz-type serine proteases inhibitors and mutation of this putative motif inactivates the transactivation function of HBX (21.Arii M. Takada S. Koike K. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar). Using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system (22.Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar,23.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), we previously identified an α proteasome subunit, PSMA7, as a putative cellular target of HBX. We demonstrated that this interaction may be functionally important in the pleiotropic effect of HBX (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified another HBX-interacting clone as the proteasome subunit PSMC1, which is an ATPase-like member of the 19 S regulatory factor (25.Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Pratt G. Reichsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22699-22702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol.

The interacting domains of PSMA7, PSMC1, and HBX were characterized, and the specificity of these interactions was further evaluated using a modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system. We also studied the transactivation function of HBX in mammalian cells and yeasts, and further demonstrated the functional importance of HBX-PSMC1 interaction. Four S. cerevisiae strains were used, and their genetic backgrounds are summarized in TableI. EGY48 was used in the standard yeast two-hybrid system, and EGY40 in the modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system. KNY14 (inactivated GCN4 gene) and KNY24 (wild-type GCN4) (28.Hinnebusch A.G. Lucchini G. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29.Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) were used to study the effect of HBX on GCN4, the yeast AP-1 ortholog. The MaV103 yeast strain was used to test the effect of HBX on the Gal4 transactivator.Table IGenetic background of S. cerevisiae strainsYeast strainGenetic backgroundEGY48Mata, leu2, his3, trp1, ura3, LexAop-LEU2EGY40Mata, leu2, his3, trp1, ura3KNY14Mata, leu2, trp1, ura3, gcn4–103KNY14Mata, leu2, trp1, ura3, GCN4 Open table in a new tab For the yeast two-hybrid system, the HBX gene was fused to the lexA DNA binding domain of pEG202 as pEG202HBX (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter construct was lexAop-lacZgene, which permits determination of interaction based on β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity. Two lacZ reporter constructs, pSH18–34 and JK103 (both with URA3 marker), contained eight and two LexA binding sites, respectively (23.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). pRF4–6NL, a TRP1 plasmid containing Gal1 promoter that is galactose-inducible, was used for expression of the “dissociator” in the modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system (30.Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). pCL1, a LEU2 plasmid expressing GAL4, and p2.5 plasmid containing theHIS3 marker have been described (22.Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar, 31.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). p2.5HBX was generated by inserting HBX fragment (EcoRI-NotI) from pEG202HBX into p2.5 plasmid. Mutations in HBX were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The HBX mutants have been described previously (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HBXmd and HBXsm, containing the middle and small HBX, respectively, were generated by PCR. Deletion mutants of PSMA7 and PSMC1 were generated using convenient restriction sites or by PCR (for map, see Fig. 2). Chimeric constructs of yeast and human PSMA7 constructs (YHA7.169, YHA7.199, and YHA7.227) were generated by PCR, exchanging corresponding regions of yeast with human sequences. All mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pYepHBX was generated by ligation of the ADH1 promoter (PstI-HindIII fragment from pJG7–1) (31.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) and aHindIII-BamHI fragment from JG4–6HBX containing HBX and ADH1 transcription terminator into the PstI andBamHI sites of a LEU2 plasmid pYepLac181 (provided by Alan Hinnebusch, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Plasmid B2079 (TRP1 marker) (28.Hinnebusch A.G. Lucchini G. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), containing a GCN4-responsive lacZ reporter, was also provided by Alan Hinnebusch. Gal4 reporter gene p17X4TATA-CAT, which contains four copies of Gal4 binding sites, the thymidine kinase minimal promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter; and plasmid pCEP4GLVP which contains a fusion of Gal4 DNA binding domain and the VP-16 acidic activation domain driven by the SV40 promoter, were provided by Sophia Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). and Robert Kingston (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA), respectively. The CMV-HA-c-Jun containing the full-length c-Jun tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at its N terminus was provided by Mathias Treier (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) (32.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The CMV-Arg-β-gal plasmid was generated by inserting the DNA fragment coding for ubiquitin-Arg-β-galactosidase (provided by Alexander Varshavsky, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) (33.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) into the plasmid pCDNA1. For in vitro binding experiment, [35S]Met-labeled HBX and PSMA7 proteins were generated using Rabbit Reticulocyte Extract system (Promega, Madison, WI). PSMC1 (full-length) and PSMA7 (aa 137–248) were cloned into the pGEX-KG vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, which were purified by glutathione-coupled agarose beads. The translated proteins were then incubated with the protein-bound beads in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, EDTA 1 mm, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at room temperature for 1 h with constant mixing. The beads were washed extensively with the same buffer and the bound proteins were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager (Storm, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) analysis. For the pulse-chase experiment, cells were lysed directly in a 10-cm dish with 1 ml of cold standard lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the nuclei and other insoluble cell debris. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the cell lysates with antibody first and then protein G-coupled Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a PhosphorImager. The monoclonal antibody 12CA5 specific for the HA epitope and the anti-β-gal monoclonal antibody were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Standard yeast two-hybrid system was performed as described (23.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). For the modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system, four pairs of interacting proteins, HBX-PSMA7, PSMC1.1-PSMA7, Max-Mxi1 (34.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and PreS2-B31 2A. Furusaka and T. J. Liang, unpublished data. were cloned into the LexA DNA binding domain vector (pEG202: ADH1 promoter,HIS3 marker) and the B42 acidic activator vector (pRF25: ADH1 promoter, TRP1 marker) (30.Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), respectively. Yeast strain EGY40 was first transformed with these interacting pairs and then thelacZ reporter plasmid JK103. Positive interacting clones were then retransformed with the dissociator construct containing the dissociator gene cloned into the pRF4–6NL vector (Gal1 promoter,LEU2 marker). The yeast transformants were grown on plates containing Glu/CSM-His-Leu-Trp-Ura (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA) at 30 °C for 2–3 days until colonies were visible. 10 independent colonies from each group were streaked onto the Gal/CSM-His-Leu-Trp-Ura plates (galactose to induce the expression of the dissociator) and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. The streaked colonies were then harvested, lysed with acid-washed 425–600-μm glass beads (Sigma), and assayed for β-gal activities using the Galacto-Light kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Three reporter plasmids were used for HBX transactivation assays in the HepG2 cells. The RSV-Luc, the AP-1-CAT (containing four AP-1 sites adjacent to a minimal human metallothionein IIA promoter), and the mTK-Luc (containing minimal thymidine kinase promoter) have been described previously (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human hepatoma HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). Transient transfection of HepG2 cells in a 35-mm well was carried out using the DNA transfection kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Luciferase assay was performed with a Monolight luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). CAT assay was performed using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we previously identified several independent clones that interacted specifically with HBX (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One strongly interacting clone was identified as an α subunit of the proteasome complex, PSMA7 (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the other clones, PSMC1, was an ATPase-like subunit of the 19 S regulatory component of the 26 S proteasome complex (25.Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Pratt G. Reichsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22699-22702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, the PSMA7 clone also interacted specifically with the PSMC1 clone in the yeast two-hybrid system. To demonstrate the interaction of HBX and the proteasome subunitsin vitro, we constructed two GST fusion expression plasmids, one with PSMA7 and the other with PSMC1. The GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria were purified with glutathione beads and incubated with the in vitro translated, [35S]Met-labeled HBX or PSMA7 proteins. The beads were then washed and the bound polypeptides subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). HBX bound specifically to GST-PSMA7 and -PSMC1 but not GST. Similar binding was also shown between PSMA7 and GST-PSMC1 or -HBX. The binding appeared to be stronger between PSMA7 and PSMC1 than that between HBX and PSMA7. This finding is consistent with the relative strength of interactions among these proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system. In addition, these binding results corroborated the interaction of these polypeptides in the yeast two-hybrid system. To characterize the interacting domains of HBX, PSMC1 and PSMA7, various deletion and site-directed mutants of each cDNA were generated and tested for their interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system. In our previous study, we determined that the C-terminal region (aa 137–248) of PSMA7 is important for binding to HBX (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the sequences of PSMA7 important for binding to HBX and PSMC1, we generated additional deletion mutants and tested their interactions with HBX and PSMC1 (Fig.2 A). The deletion mutants H7.198 (aa 137–198), H7.227 (aa 137–227), and H7.230 (aa 137–230) exhibited no binding to either HBX or PSMC1, while H7.237 (aa 137–237) retained nearly full binding activity to HBX and PSMC1 (Fig.2 A). In addition, the N-terminally truncated construct H7.169 (aa 169–248) had binding activity similar to that of H7.237 (Fig. 2 A). Since the yeast PSMA7 ortholog (YPSM7) (35.Remacha M. Saenz-Robles M.T. Vilella M.D. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9094-9101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has regions of sequence homology with the PSMA7, its interaction with HBX and PSMC1 was analyzed (Fig. 2 A). The YPSMA7 demonstrated no binding to HBX but had a weak binding to PSMC1 (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that human PSMA7 exhibits selective binding to HBX and human PSMC1. To further characterize the binding domain between HBX, PSMC1, and PSMA7, we generated three constructs that are chimeric for human and yeast PSMA7: YH7.169, YH7.199, and YH7.227. YH7.169 and YH7.199 had full binding activity to HBX, while YH7.227 demonstrated no binding to either (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, YH7.199 interacted with PSMC1 as well as the HY7.169 did, but its binding to HBX was weaker than that to YH7.169. Taken together, aa 199–237 of the human PSMA7 contains the necessary structural information for binding to both HBX and PSMC1. However, the observed minor difference in the mapping results suggested that the binding domains of PSMA7 with HBX and PSMC1 may be slightly different. Comparison of human and yeast PSMA7 sequences shows that major sequence divergence in this region probably accounts for the difference in binding. Fig. 2 B showed that the full-length PSMC1 (aa 1–440) interacted with both PSMA7 and HBX. The PSMC1.1 construct (aa 123–440) containing N-terminally truncated PSMC1, also interacted with PSMA7 and HBX, although the interaction with HBX was weaker than that of the full-length PSMC1. On the other hand, the strength of binding to PSMA7 appeared to be much higher for the truncated than the full-length PSMC1. Two additional deletions, PSMC1.2 (aa 123–316) and PSMC1.3 (aa 317–440), demonstrated no binding to HBX. In contrast, PSMA7 retained high binding activity to PSMC1.3 but not to PSMC1.2. Collectively, these results suggested that PSMC1 interacts with PSMA7 and HBX via distinct domains: a N-terminal domain to HBX and a C-terminal domain to PSMA7. Two constructs of the yeast PSMC1 (36.Heinemeyer W. Trondle N. Albrecht G. Wolf D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12229-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were assayed for interaction with the HBX and PSMA7. The yeast PSMC1 interacted weakly with HBX, but exhibited moderate binding to the human PSMA7. Similar to the human pairs, the yeast PSMC1 interacted well with the yeast PSMA7 (data not shown). Sequence divergence between the human and yeast PSMC1 subunits may again account for the difference in binding to HBX. Functional mapping of HBX has defined two structural domains that are crucial for the transactivation function of HBX (21.Arii M. Takada S. Koike K. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Runkel L. Fischer M. Schaller H. Virology. 1993; 197: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These two domains appear to overlap with the putative Kunitz-type domain of protease inhibitor that is present in both HBX and WHVX (21.Arii M. Takada S. Koike K. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous mutagenesis studies established a structural and functional association of mutations in the second Kunitz-type domain of HBX with respect to interaction between HBX and PSMA7; HBX mutants defective in binding to PSMA7 were also negative for transactivation (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the interacting domain of HBX with PSMC1, we carried out similar experiments using various HBX mutants (Fig. 2 C). The results showed that the first Kunitz-type domain is also not important for binding to PSMC1. Analysis of constructs with mutations in the second Kunitz-type domain revealed that H139D mutation abolished binding of HBX to both PSMA7 and PSMC1, while C137S and R138Q mutations had no effect on binding to PSMA7 but reduced markedly the binding of HBX to PSMC1 (Fig. 2 C). Together with our previous data on PSMA7 and HBX interaction (24.Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the current study suggests that the second Kunitz-type domain of HBX is essential for binding to both proteasome subunits PSMA7 and PSMC1, albeit the binding motifs may not be exactly the same. HBX gene, through alternative translation initiations, could potentially encode three HBX polypeptides that may function differentially to transactivate polymerase II and III promoters (38.Kwee L. Lucito R. Aufiero B. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the data above, we reason that all three forms of HBX should bind equally well to PSMA7 and PSMC1. Two HBX constructs, HBXmd and HBXsm, containing HBX sequences from the second and third in-frame start codons, respectively, were generated. Interactions of all three forms of HBX with either PSMA7 or PSMC1 were studied using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results showed that both HBXmd and HBXsm bound equally well to PSMA7 and PSMC1 as the full-length HBX, despite both constructs scoring negative for transactivation using RSV-Luc as the reporter gene (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results suggested that the second Kunitz-type domain of HBX is essential for interaction with the proteasome subunits. The N terminus of HBX, which includes the first Kunitz-type domain, is not necessary for binding to proteasome subunits, but may interact with other cellular factor(s) that is equally important for the function of HBX. Recent reports have suggested that the N-terminal domain of HBX interacts with a DNA repair enzyme UVDDB (39.Sitterlin D. Lee T.H. Prigent S. Tiollais P. Butel J.S. Transy C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the RNA polymerase subunit RPB5 (15.Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16.Cheong J. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and the general transcriptional factor TFIIH (14.Qadri I. Maguire H.F. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 40.Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To further define the structural relationship of interactions among HBX and the proteasome subunits PSMA7 and PSMC1, we adopted a modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system (30.Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The system is diagrammatically summarized in Fig.3 A. Briefly, two potentially interacting protein partners (bait and prey) were expressed in the standard two-hybrid system. The third construct expressing the dissociator protein under the Gal1 promoter (pRF4–6) was then introduced and the β-gal activity (lacZ reporter) analyzed after induction of the dissociator by galactose. If the dissociator interacts with either the bait or prey through similar structural domains, a competitive inhibition of the original interaction would result, leading to a decreased β-gal activity. In the present study, four groups of interactors were evaluated using this system (Fig.3 B). Two interacting pairs from this study, HBX-PSMA7 and PSMC1.1-PSMA7, and two unrelated interacting pairs, Max-Mxi1 (34.Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R.

PSMC1.1 was used instead of the full-length PSMC1 because it conferred a stronger binding to PSMA7. Since previous mapping results revealed that both HBX and PSMC1 interacted with PSMA7 through the PSMA7 C-terminal domain, we expected that the interaction between HBX and PSMA7 should be competed by either HBX or PSMC1.1. As predicted, HBX-PSMA7 interaction was inhibited by HBX (to 71% of the activity) and more significantly by PSMC1.1 (to 55%) (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, the PSMC1.1-PSMA7 interaction was dramatically reduced by PSMC1.1 (to 47% activity) but only modestly by HBX (to 75%). These results are consistent with the relatively stronger interaction of PSMC1.1-PSMA7 as compared with that of HBX-PSMA7 interaction (about 30% of PSMC1.1-PSMA7 interaction by β-gal assay). Similar results were obtained using other combinations of these interactors (data not shown). Finally, the specificity of this dissociator assay was demonstrated by a lack of effect of dissociator expression on two unrelated interacting pairs (Max-Mxi1 and PreS2-B31). Taken together, the interacting domains among HBX, PSMA7, and PSMC1, as characterized by the yeast two-hybrid system, were confirmed by the modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system. In general, this modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system could provide valuable information regarding the structural relationship among multiple interacting proteins. HBX functions as a coactivator of AP-1 and many other transcriptional factors in a variety of mammalian cells (7.Haviv I. Vazl D. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell.

They interact with dynamin and synaptojanin via their COOH-terminal SH3 domain, whereas their central regions contain binding sites for clathrin and for the clathrin adaptor AP-2. We have defined here amino acids of amphiphysin 1 crucial for binding to AP-2 and clathrin. Overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary cells of an amphiphysin 1 fragment that binds both AP-2 and clathrin resulted in a segregation of clathrin, which acquired a diffuse distribution, from AP-2, which accumulated at patches also positive for Eps15. These effects correlated with a block in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A fragment selectively interacting with clathrin produced a similar effect. These results can be explained by the binding of amphiphysin to the NH2-terminal domain of clathrin and by a competition with the binding of this domain to the β-subunit of AP-2 and AP180. The interaction of amphiphysin 1 with either clathrin or AP-2 did not prevent its interaction with dynamin, supporting the existence of tertiary complexes between these proteins. Together with previous evidence indicating a direct interaction between amphiphysin and membrane lipids, these findings support a model in which amphiphysin acts as a multifunctional adaptor linking the membrane to coat proteins and coat proteins to dynamin and synaptojanin."

V., Guruswamy, S., Cao, K. T., Pessin, J. E., and Olson, A. L. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14285–14292). To identify the specific MEF2 isoform(s) responsible for GLUT4 expression, we studied the pattern of expression of the MEF2 isoforms in insulin-sensitive tissues. Both heart and skeletal muscle were found to express the MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D isoforms but not MEF2B. However, only the MEF2A protein was selectively down-regulated in insulin-deficient diabetes. Co-immunoprecipitation with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that, in the basal state, essentially all of the MEF2A protein was presented as a MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer without any detectable MEF2A-MEF2A homodimers or MEF2A-MEF2C and MEF2C-MEF2D heterodimers. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that nuclear extracts from diabetic animals had reduced binding to the MEF2 binding site compared with extracts from control or insulin-treated animals. Furthermore, immunodepletion of the MEF2A-MEF2D complex from control extracts abolished binding to the MEF2 element. However, addition of MEF2A to diabetic nuclear extracts fully restored binding activity to the MEF2 element. These data strongly suggest that the MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer is selectively decreased in insulin-deficient diabetes and is responsible for hormonally regulated expression of the GLUT4 gene.

In addition to this acute regulation of GLUT4-containing vesicle trafficking, the expression of GLUT4 is transcriptionally regulated in a variety of persistent altered metabolic states. For example, states of insulin deficiency induced by either streptozotocin (STZ) treatment or nutritional restriction results in decreased GLUT4 mRNA and protein in adipose tissue and cardiac and skeletal muscle (7.Camps M.

In addition, analysis of tissue-specific GLUT4 gene expression in the cultured C2C12 muscle cell line demonstrated the necessary requirement for a myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) cis-DNA regulatory element (13.Liu M.L.

The importance of the MEF2 site was further supported by expression analysis in transgenic mice that demonstrated the essential function of the human GLUT4 MEF2 site (−473/−464) in both tissue-specific and hormonal/metabolic regulation (14.Tsunoda N. Cooke D.W. Ikemoto S. Maruyama K. Takahashi M. Lane M.D. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, in vitro MEF2 sequence-specific binding activity was found to decrease following STZ-induced diabetes (15.Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Currently, there are four known members of the mammalian MEF2 family termed MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D (16.Black B.L.

In this report, we demonstrate that cardiac and skeletal muscle expression of GLUT4 is dependent upon a MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer. STZ-induced insulin deficiency results in a specific decrease in expression of the MEF2A mRNA and protein. Furthermore, the addition of in vitro synthesized MEF2A protein to diabetic nuclear extracts restored the binding activity to a comparable level found in control or insulin-treated animals.DISCUSSIONIt has been well established that insulin stimulates the recruitment or translocation of pre-formed GLUT4 glucose transporter proteins from intracellular storage sites to the cell surface membrane (1.Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 2.Martin S. Slot J. James D. Cell Biochem.

Testar X. Palacin M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S70-S81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).This process is necessary for normal tissue (striated muscle and adipose) insulin sensitivity and the maintenance of whole body glucose homeostasis. However, in addition to the acute stimulation of GLUT4 protein intracellular trafficking, the tissue-specific expression levels of GLUT4 are also regulated by a variety of hormonal/nutritional/metabolic states. For example, GLUT4 expression is markedly up-regulated during muscle and adipose differentiation and following muscle exercise/contraction (34.Castello A. Cadefau J. Cusso R. Testar X. Hesketh J.E.

Res. 1996; 28: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, states of relative insulin deficiency (type I diabetes and fasting) result in decreased GLUT4 expression (7.Camps M. Castello A. Munoz P. Monfar M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26.Richardson J.M. Balon T.W. Treadway J.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12690-12694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, although there was no effect on muscle GLUT4 levels in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes, there was a selective loss of GLUT4 protein in adipose tissue (37.Garvey W.T. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 396-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Based upon these data, we and others have begun to identify the cis-regulatory elements that are necessary for the tissue-specific and regulated expression of the GLUT4 gene. Recently, we have identified a consensus MEF2 binding sequence located at (−473/−464) in the human GLUT4 gene (13.Liu M.L. Olson A.L. Edgington N.P. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28514-28521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Deletions or point mutations within this element completely prevented tissue-specific and hormonally/metabolically regulated expression in both differentiating culture muscle C2C12 cells and more importantly in transgenic mice (15.Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA binding activity to this sequence was markedly reduced in nuclear extracts from insulin-deficient diabetic rats but was fully restored following insulin therapy. Thus, these data provide compelling evidence that the MEF2 binding site is, at least, one essential functional element in the expression of the GLUT4 gene.There are four known members of the mammalian MEF2 family of transcription factor, and since MEF2B expression is restricted to early embryo development (29.Morisaki T. Sermsuvitayawong K. Byun S.H. Matsuda Y. Hidaka K. Morisaki H. Mukai T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Molkentin J.D. Firulli A.B. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Hustad C.M. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the other MEF2 isoforms were likely candidates responsible for the loss of DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from diabetic animals. To this end, Western blotting using isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated that only the level of MEF2A protein was down-regulated in both skeletal muscle and heart of insulin-deficient diabetic rats. Interestingly, the mRNA of MEF2C was also decreased; however, this did not result in any significant change in protein expression. Previous studies have also observed a discordance in the levels of MEF2 mRNA versus protein, suggesting the presence of post-transcriptional control mechanism(s) (31.Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 32.Suzuki E. Guo K. Kolman M., Yu, Y. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In any case, the decrease in MEF2A expression correlated with the decrease in GLUT4 gene expression and reduction in nuclear extract binding activity to the MEF2 consensus sequence. These findings were confirmed by the addition of in vitro translated MEF2A protein to diabetic nuclear extracts, which at the appropriate endogenous amount restored the DNA binding activity to the same level as found in control nuclear extracts.At present, the mechanism(s) regulating MEF2 gene expression and protein levels remains largely unknown. All the MEF2 genes contain large 5′-noncoding regions with multiple spliced exons and large introns. In Drosophila, two D-MEF enhancers have been described, one that binds the cardiac homeodomain protein Tinman (38.Gajewski K. Kin Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and another controlled by the basic helix-loop helix transcription factor Twist (39.Cripps R.M. Black B.L. Zhao B. Lien C.-L. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 422-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, no cis-regulatory sequences have yet been described for any vertebrate MEF2 gene. Alternatively, MEF2A and also MEF2C can be transcriptionally activated by phosphorylation through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (40.Yang S. Galanis A. Sharrocks A. Mol. Cell.

Wrana J.L. Prywes R., Yu, Y. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, MEF2C has been reported to undergo nuclear export into the cytoplasm following transforming growth factor-β stimulation (44.De Angelis L. Borghi S. Melchionna R. Berghella L. Baccarani-Contri M. Parise F. Ferrari S. Cossu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12358-12363Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Although we cannot exclude these possibilities for the loss of MEF2A expression in muscles of insulin-deficient diabetic rats, an additional mechanism may be envisaged based upon the dimerization of the MEF2 isoforms. In this study, we have also observed that the MEF2A antibody will co-immunoprecipitate approximately one-third of the MEF2D protein, whereas the MEF2D antibody will co-immunoprecipitate essentially all of the MEF2A protein. These data suggest that all the MEF2A protein exists as an MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer. Since MEF2C is not co-immunoprecipitated with MEF2D, these data further indicate that the excess MEF2D is present in an MEF2D-MEF2D homodimer. The presence of an MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer is consistent with studies in the HeLa cell system but is somewhat in disagreement with cultured C2C12 cells (45.Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In any case, decreased MEF2A expression would therefore increase the relative proportion of MEF2D-MEF2D homodimers. Although it has been suggested that MEF2D homodimers can function as a transcriptional inhibitor (45.Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we do not feel that this is likely for the GLUT4 promoter. The fact that decreased levels of MEF2A, either in diabetic nuclear extracts or by MEF2A antibody immunodepletion, markedly reduces DNA binding strongly suggests the MEF2D homodimer has a relatively low affinity for the GLUT4 MEF2 element.In summary, our data demonstrate that MEF2A protein levels are selectively reduced in striated muscle of insulin-deficient diabetic rats. This loss of MEF2A expression accounts for the reduction in DNA binding activity and directly correlates with the decrease in GLUT4 gene expression. Future studies are now needed to determine whether the down-regulation of MEF2A expression occurs at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. In addition, further analysis will be necessary to determine the specific functional roles of the MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer and MEF2D-MEF2D homodimer in the control of GLUT4 transcriptional activity. The major insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT41 is predominantly expressed in striated muscle and adipocytes, tissues that display insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (1.Pessin J.E.

In addition to this acute regulation of GLUT4-containing vesicle trafficking, the expression of GLUT4 is transcriptionally regulated in a variety of persistent altered metabolic states. For example, states of insulin deficiency induced by either streptozotocin (STZ) treatment or nutritional restriction results in decreased GLUT4 mRNA and protein in adipose tissue and cardiac and skeletal muscle (7.Camps M.

The decrease in GLUT4 protein levels directly correlates with a decrease in GLUT4 mRNA and the rate of GLUT4 gene transcription (10.Olson A.L. Edgington N.P. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1962-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Promoter analysis in tissue cultured 3T3L1 adipocytes has recently identified an insulin-responsive element (−706/−676) located in the 5′-flanking region of the murine GLUT4 gene (11.Cooke D.W.

In addition, analysis of tissue-specific GLUT4 gene expression in the cultured C2C12 muscle cell line demonstrated the necessary requirement for a myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) cis-DNA regulatory element (13.Liu M.L.

The importance of the MEF2 site was further supported by expression analysis in transgenic mice that demonstrated the essential function of the human GLUT4 MEF2 site (−473/−464) in both tissue-specific and hormonal/metabolic regulation (14.Tsunoda N. Cooke D.W. Ikemoto S. Maruyama K. Takahashi M. Lane M.D. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, in vitro MEF2 sequence-specific binding activity was found to decrease following STZ-induced diabetes (15.Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Currently, there are four known members of the mammalian MEF2 family termed MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D (16.Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 17.Brand N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 12: 1467-1470Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These DNA-binding proteins are important transcription factors in both the maintenance and induction of the muscle differentiated phenotype (18.Naidu P.S. Ludolph D.C. To R.Q. Hinterberger T.J.

These factors bind DNA as homo- and heterodimers but can also form protein-protein interactions with the thyroid hormone receptor (22.Lee Y. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Izumo S. Mol. Cell.

Although the MEF2 element appears to be essential for GLUT4 expression, the specific MEF2 isoform(s) regulating the tissue-specific and hormonal/metabolic regulation of the GLUT4 gene has not been determined. In this report, we demonstrate that cardiac and skeletal muscle expression of GLUT4 is dependent upon a MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer. STZ-induced insulin deficiency results in a specific decrease in expression of the MEF2A mRNA and protein. Furthermore, the addition of in vitro synthesized MEF2A protein to diabetic nuclear extracts restored the binding activity to a comparable level found in control or insulin-treated animals. DISCUSSIONIt has been well established that insulin stimulates the recruitment or translocation of pre-formed GLUT4 glucose transporter proteins from intracellular storage sites to the cell surface membrane (1.Pessin J.E.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: S70-S81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).This process is necessary for normal tissue (striated muscle and adipose) insulin sensitivity and the maintenance of whole body glucose homeostasis. However, in addition to the acute stimulation of GLUT4 protein intracellular trafficking, the tissue-specific expression levels of GLUT4 are also regulated by a variety of hormonal/nutritional/metabolic states. For example, GLUT4 expression is markedly up-regulated during muscle and adipose differentiation and following muscle exercise/contraction (34.Castello A. Cadefau J. Cusso R. Testar X. Hesketh J.E.

Res. 1996; 28: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, states of relative insulin deficiency (type I diabetes and fasting) result in decreased GLUT4 expression (7.Camps M. Castello A. Munoz P. Monfar M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26.Richardson J.M. Balon T.W. Treadway J.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12690-12694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, although there was no effect on muscle GLUT4 levels in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes, there was a selective loss of GLUT4 protein in adipose tissue (37.Garvey W.T. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 396-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Based upon these data, we and others have begun to identify the cis-regulatory elements that are necessary for the tissue-specific and regulated expression of the GLUT4 gene. Recently, we have identified a consensus MEF2 binding sequence located at (−473/−464) in the human GLUT4 gene (13.Liu M.L. Olson A.L. Edgington N.P. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28514-28521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Deletions or point mutations within this element completely prevented tissue-specific and hormonally/metabolically regulated expression in both differentiating culture muscle C2C12 cells and more importantly in transgenic mice (15.Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA binding activity to this sequence was markedly reduced in nuclear extracts from insulin-deficient diabetic rats but was fully restored following insulin therapy. Thus, these data provide compelling evidence that the MEF2 binding site is, at least, one essential functional element in the expression of the GLUT4 gene.There are four known members of the mammalian MEF2 family of transcription factor, and since MEF2B expression is restricted to early embryo development (29.Morisaki T. Sermsuvitayawong K. Byun S.H. Matsuda Y. Hidaka K. Morisaki H. Mukai T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Molkentin J.D. Firulli A.B. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Hustad C.M. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the other MEF2 isoforms were likely candidates responsible for the loss of DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from diabetic animals. To this end, Western blotting using isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated that only the level of MEF2A protein was down-regulated in both skeletal muscle and heart of insulin-deficient diabetic rats. Interestingly, the mRNA of MEF2C was also decreased; however, this did not result in any significant change in protein expression. Previous studies have also observed a discordance in the levels of MEF2 mRNA versus protein, suggesting the presence of post-transcriptional control mechanism(s) (31.Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 32.Suzuki E. Guo K. Kolman M., Yu, Y. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In any case, the decrease in MEF2A expression correlated with the decrease in GLUT4 gene expression and reduction in nuclear extract binding activity to the MEF2 consensus sequence. These findings were confirmed by the addition of in vitro translated MEF2A protein to diabetic nuclear extracts, which at the appropriate endogenous amount restored the DNA binding activity to the same level as found in control nuclear extracts.At present, the mechanism(s) regulating MEF2 gene expression and protein levels remains largely unknown. All the MEF2 genes contain large 5′-noncoding regions with multiple spliced exons and large introns. In Drosophila, two D-MEF enhancers have been described, one that binds the cardiac homeodomain protein Tinman (38.Gajewski K. Kin Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and another controlled by the basic helix-loop helix transcription factor Twist (39.Cripps R.M. Black B.L. Zhao B. Lien C.-L. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 422-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, no cis-regulatory sequences have yet been described for any vertebrate MEF2 gene. Alternatively, MEF2A and also MEF2C can be transcriptionally activated by phosphorylation through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (40.Yang S. Galanis A. Sharrocks A. Mol. Cell.

Wrana J.L. Prywes R., Yu, Y. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, MEF2C has been reported to undergo nuclear export into the cytoplasm following transforming growth factor-β stimulation (44.De Angelis L. Borghi S. Melchionna R. Berghella L. Baccarani-Contri M. Parise F. Ferrari S. Cossu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12358-12363Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Although we cannot exclude these possibilities for the loss of MEF2A expression in muscles of insulin-deficient diabetic rats, an additional mechanism may be envisaged based upon the dimerization of the MEF2 isoforms. In this study, we have also observed that the MEF2A antibody will co-immunoprecipitate approximately one-third of the MEF2D protein, whereas the MEF2D antibody will co-immunoprecipitate essentially all of the MEF2A protein. These data suggest that all the MEF2A protein exists as an MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer. Since MEF2C is not co-immunoprecipitated with MEF2D, these data further indicate that the excess MEF2D is present in an MEF2D-MEF2D homodimer. The presence of an MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer is consistent with studies in the HeLa cell system but is somewhat in disagreement with cultured C2C12 cells (45.Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In any case, decreased MEF2A expression would therefore increase the relative proportion of MEF2D-MEF2D homodimers. Although it has been suggested that MEF2D homodimers can function as a transcriptional inhibitor (45.Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we do not feel that this is likely for the GLUT4 promoter. The fact that decreased levels of MEF2A, either in diabetic nuclear extracts or by MEF2A antibody immunodepletion, markedly reduces DNA binding strongly suggests the MEF2D homodimer has a relatively low affinity for the GLUT4 MEF2 element.In summary, our data demonstrate that MEF2A protein levels are selectively reduced in striated muscle of insulin-deficient diabetic rats. This loss of MEF2A expression accounts for the reduction in DNA binding activity and directly correlates with the decrease in GLUT4 gene expression. Future studies are now needed to determine whether the down-regulation of MEF2A expression occurs at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. In addition, further analysis will be necessary to determine the specific functional roles of the MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer and MEF2D-MEF2D homodimer in the control of GLUT4 transcriptional activity. It has been well established that insulin stimulates the recruitment or translocation of pre-formed GLUT4 glucose transporter proteins from intracellular storage sites to the cell surface membrane (1.Pessin J.E.

In addition, further analysis will be necessary to determine the specific functional roles of the MEF2A-MEF2D heterodimer and MEF2D-MEF2D homodimer in the control of GLUT4 transcriptional activity. We thank Dr. Ron Prywes for kindly providing the MEF2A/C and MEF2D antibodies."

Ectopic expression of any of these transcription factors is sufficient to confer lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) to a B lymphoblast cell line, which normally lacks C/EBP factors and does not display LPS induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, the activities of C/EBPα, β, and δ are redundant in regard to expression of IL-6 and MCP-1. Surprisingly, the bZIP region of C/EBPβ, which lacks any previously described activation domains, can also confer LPS-inducible expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 in stable transfectants. Transient transfections reveal that the bZIP regions of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and, to a lesser extent, C/EBPα can activate the IL-6 promoter and augment its induction by LPS. Furthermore, the transdominant inhibitor, LIP, can activate expression from the IL-6 promoter. The ability of the C/EBPβ bZIP region to activate the IL-6 promoter in transient transfections is completely dependent upon an intact NF-κB-binding site, supporting a model where the bZIP protein primarily functions to augment the activity of NF-κB. Replacement of the leucine zipper of C/EBPβ with that of GCN4 yields a chimeric protein that can dimerize and specifically bind to a C/EBP consensus sequence, but shows a markedly reduced ability to activate IL-6 and MCP-1 expression. These results implicate the leucine zipper domain in some function other than dimerization with known C/EBP family members, and suggest that C/EBP redundancy in regulating cytokine expression may result from their highly related bZIP regions.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein basic region-leucine zipper interleukin lipopolysaccharide monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 electrophoretic mobility shift assay CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1 α, β, and δ are members of a family of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 1.Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Yaniv M. Tronche F. in Liver Gene Expression. Raven Press, New York1994: 231-258Google Scholar). These proteins dimerize through their leucine zippers and bind to a consensus DNA motif through their adjacent basic regions. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have been implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines as well as other gene products associated with macrophage activation and the acute-phase response. For example, the promoter regions of the genes for interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, nitric oxide synthase, and lysozyme (2.Akira S.

Furthermore, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have both been shown to activate a reporter gene controlled by the IL-6 promoter in transient expression assays (2.Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S.

A. 1992; 89: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the stable expression of C/EBPβ in a murine B lymphoblast cell line is sufficient to confer lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inducibility of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) expression (9.Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There have been some reports demonstrating specificity of a particular C/EBP family member for a given promoter. One example is the ratCYP2D5 gene, which encodes a cytochrome P450 protein. It is transactivated cooperatively by C/EBPβ and SP1, but not C/EBPα (10.Lee Y.-H. Yano M. Liu S.-Y.,. Matsunaga E. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of this cooperativity is determined by both the leucine zipper and activation domains of C/EBPβ (11.Lee Y.-H. Williams S.C. Baer M. Sterneck E. Gonzalez F.J. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another case is promoter P1 of furin (12.Ayoubi T.A Creemers J.W. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9298-9303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is transactivated by C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα or C/EBPδ. Recently, it has been reported that C/EBPδ, but not C/EBPβ, can transactivate the promoter for nerve growth factor (13.Colangelo A.M. Johnson P.F. Mocchetti I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10920-10925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Conversely, C/EBPα, β, and δ are all functional in a heterologous transgenic rescue assay for a Drosophila C/EBP mutant, slow border cells (14.Rorth P. Science. 1994; 266: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our own studies have demonstrated redundancy in the abilities of C/EBPα, β, and δ to support LPS induction of IL-6 and MCP-1 gene transcription (15.Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). A simple hypothesis for the redundancy of C/EBPs that we have observed is that only their highly homologous bZIP regions (16.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) are required for activation of the IL-6 and MCP-1 genes. Against this hypothesis stand results obtained with a truncated form of C/EBPβ that initiates at Met-132 and lacks activation domains. This protein, referred to as LIP, could not activate transcription and, in fact, inhibited C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation of an artificial promoter derived from the DE-I site of the albumin gene (17.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In this report, we have unexpectedly found that a truncated form of C/EBPβ lacking all known activation domains and consisting solely of the C/EBPβ bZIP region is capable of supporting LPS induction of IL-6 and MCP-1 expression. Furthermore, the transdominant inhibitor LIP, as well as a truncated form of C/EBPδ and, to a lesser extent, a truncated form of C/EBPα that similarly lack conventional activation domains have transcriptional activity on the IL-6 promoter. The transcriptional activity of both C/EBPβ and the C/EBPβ bZIP region is completely dependent on the presence of an intact NF-κB-binding site in the IL-6 promoter, implying that these proteins primarily act by augmenting NF-κB activity. Replacement of the leucine zipper of C/EBPβ with that of GCN4 yields a chimeric protein that can dimerize and specifically bind to a C/EBP consensus sequence, but has reduced ability to activate IL-6 and MCP-1. Furthermore, the majority of both full-length and truncated C/EBPβ exists as heterodimers with C/EBPγ (Ig/EBP), a C/EBP family member lacking any known activation domains. These results imply that the leucine zipper domain has a function beyond dimerization to known C/EBP family members, and that the basis for C/EBP redundancy in regulating cytokine expression resides in their highly related bZIP regions. P388 cells are murine B lymphoblasts (4.Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection; CCL46). P388-Cβ cells and P388-Neo cells have been described previously by Hu et al. (15.Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Inductions were conducted with LPS derived from Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5 (Sigma) added to 10 μg/ml. Stable transfections were conducted with 2 × 106 cells, 5 μg of DNA, and 10 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies) in 1.2 ml of Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies). Cells were incubated in the transfection mixture for 16 h followed by addition of 2.8 ml of standard growth medium. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with standard growth medium supplemented with G418 (Life Technologies) at 0.67 mg/ml. Transient transfections were conducted with 2 × 106cells, 4 μg of DNA, and 8 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies) in 1.2 ml of Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies). The DNA was comprised of either 1 μg of IL-6 promoter-reporter or albumin DE-I promoter-reporter, 1 μg of SV40 early promoter-reporter, 0.5 μg of C/EBP expression vector, and pMEX plasmid to total 4 μg. Cells were incubated in the transfection mixture for 5 h followed by addition of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented to 15% with fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the medium of certain transfections was supplemented with 10 μg/ml LPS. After 4 h in the presence or absence of LPS, transfected cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity by using the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and for β-galactosidase activity by using the Luminescent β-Galactosidase Genetic Reporter System II (CLONTECH). For stable transfections, C/EBPs were expressed from pZIP-NEO SV(X)1 constructs (18.Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). C/EBP sequences were inserted into the BamHI site of the vector. Inserted sequences were transcribed from the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter and the gene conferring G418-resistance was expressed from a subgenomic splicing product from the same promoter. For transient transfections, C/EBPs were expressed from pMEX (16.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), which utilizes the Moloney murine sarcoma virus promoter. The construction of C/EBP deletions and C/EBPβ:GLZ have been described previously (16.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The IL-6 promoter-reporter consists of the murine IL-6 promoter (19.Tanabe O. Akira S. Kamiya T. Wong G.G. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3875-3881PubMed Google Scholar) (−250 to +1) inserted into the luciferase vector, pXP2 (20.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). The IL-6 promoter-reporter with a mutated NF-κB site replaces GGGATTTTCCC with AAGATTTTCTT. The albumin DE-I promoter-reporter is (DEI)4(−35alb)LUC (21.Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) which is derived from pXP2 (20.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) and contains four copies of the DE-I element upstream of the albumin minimal promoter. The SV40 early promoter-reporter is a commercial product, pβgal-Control (CLONTECH), where the SV40 early promoter and enhancer sequences are cloned upstream and downstream, respectively, of the lacZ gene. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNAs were electrophoresed through 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels. Transfers to membranes were hybridized and washed to a stringency of 0.1 × SSPE at 65 °C. Hybridization probes were prepared with a random priming kit (Life Technologies) with the incorporation of 5′-[α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.). The IL-6 probe was a 0.65-kilobase murine cDNA (from N. Jenkins and N. Copeland, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center). The MCP-1 probe was a 0.58-kilobase murine cDNA (22.Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was a 1.3-kilobase rat cDNA (23.Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Salrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur J. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described below. The extracts (50 μg) were adjusted to 1× Laemmli sample buffer (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and processed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to a Protran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 15 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 20 s at 4 °C. Proteins were extracted from nuclei by incubation at 4 °C with vigorous vortexing in buffer C (420 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant extract was collected and stored at −70 °C. The EMSA probe was a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an optimal C/EBP-binding site (5′-GATCCTAGATATCCCTGATTGCGCAATAGGCTCAAAGCTG-3′ annealed with 5′-AATTCAGCTTTGAGCCTATTGCGCAATCAGGGATATCTAG-3′) labeled with the incorporation of 5′-[α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and Klenow DNA polymerase. A probe containing a CTF/NF-1-binding site (25.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) (5′-GATCCTTTGGCATGCTGCCAATATG-3′ annealed with 5′-AATTCATATTGGCAGCATGCCAAAG-3′) was used as a nonspecific competitor in some assays. Underlined sequences correspond to the binding motifs of the specified transcription factors. DNA binding reactions were performed at room temperature in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 6 μl of nuclear extract (1 mg/ml in buffer C) and 5 μl of 5× binding buffer (20% (w/v) Ficoll, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol). The remainder of the reaction mixture contained 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1.25 ng of probe, bromphenol blue to a final concentration of 0.06% (w/v), and water to volume. For supershifts, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C prior to the binding reaction. Samples were electrophoresed through 5.5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 160 V. Rabbit anti-C/EBPβ specific to the carboxyl terminus (product C-19) and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-C/EBPβ specific to the amino terminus has been described (16.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-C/EBPγ (Ig/EBP) was prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of C/EBPγ and will be described elsewhere. 2S. Parkin, M. Baer, and P. F. Johnson, unpublished data. We previously found that C/EBPα, β, and δ were all effective in supporting the LPS-induced transcription of the genes encoding IL-6 and MCP-1 (15.Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this redundancy was based on the bZIP domain which is highly conserved among these C/EBP family members (16.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), we examined the expression of a truncated form of C/EBPβ (amino acids 192–276; C/EBPβ192–276) that lacks all conventional activation and regulatory domains and simply consists of the bZIP domain of C/EBPβ (21.Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). It was expected that the activity of C/EBPβ192–276 would be similar to that of LIP, which initiates at Met-132 and lacks transcriptional activation domains (17.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We performed stable transfections of P388 cells with a murine retroviral vector expressing C/EBPβ192–276, and compared those transfectants to P388-Cβ cells that had been transfected with a vector expressing C/EBPβ, as well as a control population transfected with the same vector lacking an expressed insert (P388-Neo) (9.Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15.Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). P388 is a murine B lymphoblastic cell line (26.Bauer S.R. Holmes K.L. Morse III, H.C. Potter M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4695-4699PubMed Google Scholar) that lacks C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPε expression and has been a useful system for analyzing C/EBP protein function (9.Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15.Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). The population of cells transfected for C/EBPβ192–276 expression was designated P388-Cβ192–276. EMSA of nuclear extracts from transfected populations, as well as Western blot analyses, verified proper expression of stably transfected C/EBPβ genes. In comparison to nuclear extracts from P388-Neo, nuclear extracts from P388-Cβ and P388-Cβ192–276yielded supershifted protein-DNA complexes upon incubation with an antibody specific for C/EBPβ (Fig.2 A, lanes 5, 6, and9). The EMSA species that gave rise to the supershifts were also evident in the samples incubated with normal IgG (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 7). As expected, the C/EBPβ-specific EMSA species from P388-Cβ192–276 cells were of greater mobility than those of P388-Cβ cells reflecting their truncated structure. Additionally, the C/EBPβ192–276 EMSA species could only be supershifted with antibody specific to the carboxyl terminus of C/EBPβ (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8 and 9), while EMSA species of intact C/EBPβ could be supershifted by both amino and carboxyl terminus specific antibodies (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). Western analysis of nuclear extracts from transfected populations examined actual levels of protein expression of C/EBPβ and P388-Cβ192–276 (Fig. 2 B). The level of C/EBPβ192–276 expression in transfected cells was much lower than that of C/EBPβ. Interestingly, although the level of protein expression for P388-Cβ192–276 was much lower than that of intact C/EBPβ, its binding activity in the EMSA was quite high. We note that C/EBPβ192–276 has been reported to have enhanced affinity for its binding site (21.Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To ensure that the supershifted species observed in Fig. 2 Aspecifically bound to the C/EBP-binding site, competitions were performed with the addition of unlabeled C/EBP-binding site and an unlabeled CTF/NF-1-binding site to supershifted samples (Fig.2 C). All of the supershifted protein-DNA complexes observed upon incubation with C/EBPβ-specific antibody were effectively competed by a 30-fold excess of C/EBP-binding site (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 9) while a 100-fold excess of CTF/NF-1-binding site had little effect (Fig. 2 C, lanes 6and 12). The prominent protein-DNA complex not supershifted by specific antibody, but effectively competed by unlabeled C/EBP-binding site, was surmised to be C/EBPγ (Ig/EBP) (Fig. 1), which is highly expressed in immature B cells (27.Roman C. Platero J.S. Shuman J. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). C/EBPγ has been shown to act as a transdominant inhibitor of C/EBP family transcriptional activators (28.Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To verify the expression of C/EBPγ and to ascertain whether C/EBPγ might be forming heterodimers with either C/EBPβ or C/EBPβ192–276, EMSA was performed in the presence of antibodies specific for C/EBPβ and antibodies specific for C/EBPγ (Fig. 3). Nuclear extracts from P388-Neo cells clearly showed a C/EBPγ·DNA complex that could be supershifted with C/EBPγ-specific antibody (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). In nuclear extracts from P388-Cβ cells, a single C/EBPβ·DNA complex of lower mobility than that for C/EBPγ was observed and it could be supershifted both by antibodies specific to C/EBPβ and C/EBPγ (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6). Analysis of extracts from P388-Cβ192–276 cells found two C/EBPβ·DNA complexes, both more rapidly migrating than that for C/EBPγ (Fig. 3, lane 7). The more abundant of the two C/EBPβ·DNA complexes could again be supershifted by both C/EBPβ- and C/EBPγ-specific antibodies (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and9). Surprisingly, the majority of both C/EBPβ and C/EBPβ192–276 was found to be in heterodimers with C/EBPγ (Fig. 3).2 Since we had previously shown that ectopic expression of C/EBPβ was sufficient to confer LPS inducibility of IL-6 and MCP-1 to P388 cells (9.Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is clear that C/EBPγ is not strongly inhibitory to C/EBPβ activity on the IL-6 promoter. P388-Cβ and P388-Cβ192–276 cells were treated with LPS over a time course of 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h, and RNA was isolated. Northern analyses were performed to detect transcripts encoding IL-6 and MCP-1. Unexpectedly, P388-Cβ192–276 cells behaved similarly to P388-Cβ cells in their ability to induce IL-6 and MCP-1 transcription in response to LPS (Fig. 4). While IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNAs were not induced to as high a level with C/EBPβ192–276 as with intact C/EBPβ and the kinetics of their expression were somewhat altered, the activity of a truncated form of C/EBPβ lacking all known activation domains is surprising. The level of C/EBPβ192–276 expression in P388-Cβ192–276 cells is much lower than that of C/EBPβ in P388-Cβ cells (Fig. 2 B) making its ability to support expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 all the more remarkable. A second population of P388 cells independently transfected for expression of C/EBPβ192–276 behaved similarly (data not shown). Since C/EBPβ192–276 retains only the DNA-binding and leucine zipper domains of C/EBPβ yet is still active on the IL-6 promoter, we decided to examine whether the leucine zipper domain contains determinants for activation other than those necessary for homodimerization. To that end, we tested a chimeric C/EBPβ protein in which the C/EBPβ leucine zipper was replaced with that of yeast GCN4 (C/EBPβ:GLZ) (16.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) by stable expression in P388 cells (P388-CβGLZ) (Fig. 1). C/EBPβ:GLZ retains wild type amino-terminal activation and regulatory domains as well as the DNA-binding domain, and has previously been shown to activate transcription from an albumin DE-I site-driven reporter (21.Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We verified the ability of C/EBPβ:GLZ to activate a DE-I promoter in P388 cells (data not shown). In contrast to that result, P388-CβGLZ cells did not induce IL-6 or MCP-1 mRNA in response to LPS (Fig. 4). To verify that C/EBPβ:GLZ was properly expressed in P388-CβGLZ cells, both EMSA and Western blot analyses were performed. While a C/EBPβ:GLZ protein-DNA complex was not obvious in a simple EMSA, the addition of C/EBPβ-specific antibodies revealed a supershifted protein-DNA complex with amino-terminal specific but not carboxyl terminus-specific antibodies (Fig. 5 A, lanes 8 and9). This result is consistent with replacement of the leucine zipper at the carboxyl terminus of the C/EBPβ protein. These data also demonstrate that C/EBPβ:GLZ retains the capacity to dimerize and bind to the optimal C/EBP-binding site. Competition experiments were performed with unlabeled C/EBP-binding site and unlabeled CTF/NF-1-binding site to verify the specificity of C/EBPβ:GLZ binding (Fig. 5 C). The supershifted protein-DNA complexes were effectively competed by a 30-fold excess of the C/EBP-binding site (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3 and 9), while a 100-fold excess of the CTF/NF-1-binding site had little effect (Fig. 5 C, lanes 6 and 12). Western analyses of nuclear extracts from P388-CβGLZ cells and other transfectant populations show that, while not expressed as efficiently as C/EBPβ, the C/EBPβ:GLZ protein was expressed at a level comparable to that of C/EBPβ192–276 (Figs.2 B and 5 B). These data suggest that some determinant for C/EBPβ activity on the IL-6 promoter, apart from homodimerization, is located in the leucine zipper. We further examined the dispensability of the amino-terminal activation domains of C/EBPβ in transient transfections with an IL-6 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. We sought to confirm the surprising results obtained in stable transfections and to facilitate comparisons of C/EBPβ with its structural variants and analogous truncations of other C/EBP family members. P388 cells were co-transfected with an IL-6 promoter-luciferase reporter and expression vectors for C/EBPβ, C/EBPβ192–276, or LIP. These transfections were carried out with and without LPS treatment. As with the endogenous IL-6 promoter in stably transfected cells, both C/EBPβ and C/EBPβ192–276, and additionally LIP, were capable of activating the IL-6 promoter-reporter to varying degrees in transient transfections (Fig. 6). While LPS treatment of C/EBPβ transfectants induced luciferase expression by a mean value of 12-fold over an untreated, “reporter-only” control, LPS treatment of C/EBPβ192–276 and LIP transfectants induced luciferase expression 6.2- and 8.3-fold, respectively. LPS stimulation alone (without transfection of a C/EBP expression vector) produced a mean value of only 2.6-fold over the control value. Interestingly, the transient transfections show C/EBPs to generally elevate the level of transcription rather than mediate LPS induction; LPS induction of luciferase expression occurs to a similar extent in either the presence or absence of C/EBP expression (between 2.6 and 4.4-fold; Figs. 6 and 8). This is in contrast to stable transfection experiments where LPS stimulation fails to induce IL-6 mRNA expression in the absence of C/EBP expression (see P388-Neo in Fig. 4). The greater contribution of C/EBP expression to the LPS induction of IL-6 in stable transfection experiments may be a reflection of the more complete endogenous IL-6 promoter, or the more repressed basal activity of the gene in a native chromatin environment.Figure 8C/EBP δ181–272(δ181–272), although lacking an activation domain, can support the LPS induced activation of the IL-6 promoter in transient tr"

HDL contains apolipoproteins AI and AII as its major protein components and various amounts of triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters. Its primary function appears to be the “reverse transport” of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, where it is catabolized into bile acids. A second proposed function for HDL is the uptake of apolipoproteins and free cholesterol from catabolized very low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons. Phenotypic variation of plasma HDL levels depends on both genetic and environmental factors such as exercise. About 50% of HDL variation is ascribed to genetic influences (2.Funke H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A number of rare mutations have been described that result in severely depressed HDL levels, among them mutations in the genes encoding apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein B, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (3.Mahley R.W.

Although these rare deficiencies account only for a fraction of individuals with lipid abnormalities, their existence suggests that less severe dyslipidemic phenotypes may be due more subtle disruptions in the expression and function of genes that participate in lipid metabolism. In an effort to discern other genetic contributors to HA, we performed linkage analysis on large Utah pedigrees that have heritable HA and a family history of early coronary disease. A locus on human chromosome 11q23, clearly distinct from the apoA1/CIII/AIV gene cluster, is linked to HA in many Utah families. 2Kort, E. N., Ballinger, D. G., Hunt, S. C., Ding, B. R.

Hum. Genet., in press.One of the genes localized to this region is the zinc finger transcription factor ZNF202 (9.Monaco C. Helmer Citterich M. Caprini E. Vorechovsky I. Russo G. Croce C.M. Barbanti-Brodano G. Negrini M. Genomics. 1998; 52: 358-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In light of the increasingly recognized role of transcription factors in coordinating the transcription of multiple genes in lipid-related pathways (10.Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnology. 1999; 10: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11.Kardassis D. Laccotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 980-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we characterized the biochemical function of ZNF202. This analysis reveals that ZNF202 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to the regulatory region of many genes involved in lipid metabolism. ZNF202 thus joins a growing number of transcription factors acting in metabolic coordination. HepG2 and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (HB-8065 and CRL-1573, respectively) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of amino acids 1–199 of ZNF202 was purified from bacterial extracts and used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Antisera were affinity-purified on a GST-ZNF202 column. cDNAs representing the alternatively spliced mRNAs of ZNF202 were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Proteins were synthesized and [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). A GST fusion with ZNF202 zinc fingers 3 through 8 (GST.ZF3.8) was generated by inserting amino acids 474 to 648 of ZNF202 into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST.ZF3–8 protein was expressed in BL21 cells and purified essentially as described by the manufacturer. For gel shift assays, protein was eluted from glutathione-Sepharose and dialyzed to remove residual glutathione. Protein concentration was estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. An affinity selection procedure was modified from a method described previously (12.Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide designated INVSL2n36 (5′-ACC CGA ATT CGG ATC C (N)36 CG GAA TTC CG-3′) was synthesized with a 36-nucleotide random sequence between defined sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends. GST.ZF3.8 was immobilized on GSH-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pre-blocked with 200 ng/ml poly(dIC) for 30 min in 1× GSA buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 μmZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100). This affinity matrix was used to select specific sequences from the pool of random oligomers. Oligonucleotides were added to the GST-ZNF202 agarose beads for 30 min at 22 °C in 1× GSA buffer. Unspecifically retained oligomers were removed by stepwise washes with 3 bed volumes of 1× GSA buffer containing increasing amounts of NaCl (0.1 m and 0.2 m). In the first round, a low and a high stringency-bound fraction were obtained by collecting sequential elutions at increasing salt concentrations. The low salt-bound fraction was obtained by eluting with 0.3 mNaCl. After two more washes at 0.4 m and 0.5 m, a high salt fraction was collected from an elution with 0.6m NaCl. Both pools were submitted to additional cycles. Subsequent elutions were performed with 0.3 m for the low stringency pool and 0.6 m for the high stringency fraction. From each of the affinity purification rounds, the oligonucleotide pools were amplified for 22–24 cycles with the primers 5′-ACC GAA TTC GGA TCC-3′ and 5′-GTG CCT GCT GAA TTC CTA-3′ in the following PCR protocol: 96 °C for 4 s, 62 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. After the fifth iteration of selection, the pools of selected oligonucleotides were cloned into pBluescript for sequence analysis. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out using purified bacterially expressed GST.ZF3.8 protein orin vitro transcribed and translated ZNF202 (amino acids 304–648). Gel-purified promoter fragments were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Approximately 2 ng of GST.ZF3.8 and 20 fmol of end-labeled DNA were incubated for 20 min at 22 °C in 1× GSA buffer in a final volume of 15 μl. Complexes were resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).

GenBank™ release 104.0 was screened for accessions whose annotations included the key words “exon1,” “promoter,” “regulator,” or “upstream.” More than 7300 human accessions presumed to contain 5′ upstream regions and annotated promoters were isolated. These accessions were screened using the BLAST algorithm (13.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59915) Google Scholar) with the binding sequences from the apolipoprotein AIV (apoAIV) (TTGGTGGGGTGGGGGGTGGGGGGTG), apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) (GGGTGGGGGCGGGTGGGGGG), and LPL (GGGGGTGGGGATGGGGTGCGGGGT) regulatory regions as queries. A promoter fragment from the apoAIVgene (−710 to +10) was cloned into the pSEAP2-enhancer vector, and a fragment of the apoE gene (−322 to +18) was inserted into pSEAP2-basic (CLONTECH). 2.0 μg of reporter plasmid and the indicated amounts of a ZNF202m1 expression plasmid were cotransfected into HepG2 cells using LipofectAMINEPlus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 100 ng of pCMVβ was added as an internal control. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by supplementing with the parent expression vector pcDNA3.1. Supernatant was collected at 48 h post-transfection, and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by chemilumiscent detection (Great EscApe chemilumiscence detection kit, CLONTECH) per manufacturer's procedures. Results are expressed as percent of transcriptional activity relative to transcription in the absence of ZNF202m1. Each point represents the average of 3 independent experiments. HEK293 were transfected with 4 μg of expression plasmid with LipofectAMINE as described earlier. After 48 h, cells were harvested, and total cell extract was prepared by lysis in radioimmunoprecipitation assay on ice. Approximately 20 μg of extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot with affinity-purified anti-GST-ZNF202 antibodies according to standard procedures. Labeled ZNF202 cDNA probes were prepared using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a random prime labeling kit (Promega). Two multi-tissue blots (Human and HumanII) and a human cancer cell line blot (CLONTECH) were used for hybridization in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) at 65 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The blots were then stripped of radioactivity and reprobed with a32P random prime-labeled glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (CLONTECH) to confirm equal loading. The ZNF202 gene contains 10 exons spanning 27 kilobases of chromosome 11. It was independently cloned as a candidate gene for predisposition to breast and lung cancer (9.Monaco C. Helmer Citterich M. Caprini E. Vorechovsky I. Russo G. Croce C.M. Barbanti-Brodano G. Negrini M. Genomics. 1998; 52: 358-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cloning of ZNF202 cDNAs (GenBank™ accession numbers AF027219and AF027218) revealed a number of alternative splices in the 5′-non-coding region and two common splice variants in the coding region named ZNF202m1 and ZNF202m3 (Fig.1 A). The full-length m1 form (ZNF202m1) encodes a predicted 648 amino acid protein with several conserved domains. The C terminus encodes eight consecutive C2H2 zinc finger motifs; the first, second, seventh, and eighth C2H2 motifs show significantly higher similarity to C2H2 fingers known to bind DNA than do fingers three through six (14.Nardelli J. Gibson T.J. Vesque C. Charnay P. Nature. 1991; 349: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The central part of the protein is occupied by a Krueppel-associated box (KRAB). KRAB domains, present in one-third of all zinc finger proteins, mediate transcriptional repression through mobilization of a corepressor, for example KAP-1(15–17). The N terminus contains a SCAN (or LeR) motif, a suggested protein interaction module, observed in other zinc finger proteins (18.Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the protein sequence by PESTFIND (19.Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar) reveals extensive PEST sequences that suggest a rapid protein turnover, similar to that observed for several other transcription factors. The conceptual translation (GenBank™ accession AF027218) of the second common splice form, m3 (ZNF202m3), predicted a N-terminal-truncated protein that retains the KRAB domain and the eight C-terminal zinc finger motifs. However, expression of a ZNF202 m3 cDNA revealed that the m3 form encodes a truncated ZNF202 protein of 142 amino acids encompassing only the SCAN domain. Expression of the m1 and m3 gene products was demonstrated by both coupled transcription/translation experiments and transient transfections in HEK293 cells followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots (Figs. 1,B and C). If, as has been suggested (18.Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), SCAN domains mediate dimerization, the m1 and m3 gene products may interact with each other and potentially with other SCAN domain-containing proteins. Northern blots containing a wide range of tissues and several cell lines were probed with ZNF202 cNDA to determine its expression pattern. Maximal expression was detected in heart, lung, liver, and testis (Fig.2). The protein motifs observed in the ZNF202 m1 gene product imply that it functions as a DNA-binding protein and as a transcriptional regulator. Fluorescent microscopy of HEK293 cells expressing green fluorescent protein-ZNF202m1 fusions reveals a strong nuclear fluorescence (data not shown), as expected for a transcription factor. To define a DNA binding site for ZNF202m1, we employed a GST fusion protein containing the last six zinc fingers of ZNF202 m1(GST.ZF3–8) to select a consensus binding site from a complex mixture of random oligonucleotides (12.Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). After five rounds of selection and amplification, the bound fraction was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of 55 clones revealed a simple consensus binding motif (5′-GGGGT-3′), as shown in Fig. 3 A. The rules of Choo and Klug (20.Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) predict essentially the same binding specificity for these zinc fingers. Direct repeats of the selected motif were found in the apoAIV and LPL promoters and in the apoCIII enhancer (Fig.3 B); this enhancer affects the expression of the entire apoA1/CIII/AIV gene cluster. To confirm that GST.ZF3–8 binds the predicted elements, we performed electromobility shift assays with promoter fragments of apoAIV and apoCIII. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, promoter fragments that include the presumed ZNF202 site were bound by GST.ZF3–8. Subdivision of the apoCIII and apoAIV probes into smaller fragments revealed that fragments containing the consensus repeat were bound by GST.ZF3–8, whereas adjacent fragments lacking the consensus site were not bound. Also, several non-related DNA fragments derived from the promoters of heat shock protein 90 and glycerol-3-phosphate hydrogenase were negative for binding by GST.ZF3–8. Methylation interference experiments indicated that GST.ZF3–8 binds to the predicted sequence elements (data not shown). To demonstrate binding specificity, we performed a competition assay. Fig. 4 C shows binding of ZNF202 to a fragment of the β3-adrenergic receptor promoter containing a predicted ZNF202 binding site. The addition of a 50× excess of the cold β3-adrenergic receptor promoter fragment effectively competed for binding to the labeled β3-adrenergic receptor probe. A negative control fragment of the neurofibromin promoter did not compete under identical conditions. Protein dilution experiments suggested the binding of GST.ZF3–8 to the apoAIV DNA fragment has an apparent K d of approximately 10 nm, an upper limit value that assumes that all purified GST.ZF3–8 is in an active conformation. This binding constant is similar to the apparent K d described for other zinc finger proteins (21.Cohen H.T. Bossone S.A. Zhu G. McDonald G.A. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2901-2913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We thus conclude that binding of GST.ZF3–8 to these promoter fragments is sequence-specific.Figure 4ZNF202 binds the apoCIII enhancer and apoAIV promoter. A, gel shift analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with32P-end-labeled fragments (S0, S1,S2, S3) of the apoCIII enhancer and bacterially expressed GST.ZF3.8. Positions relative to the transcription start site are given for each fragment. The ZNF202 binding site depicted in Fig.3 B is denoted by GnT. The barred regions labeled I, H, and Findicate footprinted regions as described in Kardassis et al. (11.Kardassis D. Laccotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V.

B, as in A, except that fragments of the apoAIV promoter were used in the gel shift analysis. C, sequence-specific binding of ZNF202. Gel shifts were performed using in vitro translated ZNF202m1 (amino acids 304–648) and a fragment of the β3-adrenergic receptor promoter containing a ZNF202 site (β3AR), −103 to +120 relative to the start of transcription) or a control fragment from the promoter of neurofibromin (NF1*, −361 to −194). Binding assays were run in the absence (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or presence of 50× cold specific competitor (β-3 adrenergic receptor (β3AR), lanes 3 and 7) or 50× nonspecific competitor (NF1*, lanes 4 and8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify other possible target promoters, we generated a custom unbiased data base of known human promoters from GenBank™ entries through a keyword search. These sequences were searched with the consensus binding motifs found in the apoAIV and LPL promoters or in the apoCIII enhancer, which had been shown to bind ZNF202 zinc fingersin vitro. Remarkably, the motif appeared in only a small number of promoters (Table I). Moreover, the majority of the genes identified are known to be involved in lipid metabolism or to be associated with metabolic disorders. We amplified most of these putative elements from genomic DNA and used them as probes in gel shift experiments to confirm ZNF202 binding. These results are summarized in Table I, and an alignment of the binding sites is displayed in Fig. 5. Notably, several of our binding elements coincide with sites previously mapped as DNA-protein interaction sites (11.Kardassis D. Laccotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 980-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, the ZNF202 site in the apoCIII promoter overlaps with an element at −611 to −592 relative to the transcription initiation site (Fig. 4 a); this element is thought to bind Sp1 and an unidentified factor CIIIJ1 from rat liver (11.Kardassis D. Laccotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 980-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the rat ortholog to ZNF202 may be that factor.Table IResults of bioinformatic survey for ZNF202 binding sitesPromoters containing confirmed ZNF202 binding sitesGeneRepressionFunction of gene productapoAIVYesLipoprotein structural componentapoCIIIYesRegulates expression of apoA1/CIII/AIV gene complexapoEYesLipoprotein structural componentHNF4YesHepatic ligand-activated transcription factorLPLNDLipid metabolismLCATNDLipid metabolismPLTPYesLipid metabolismHTGLNDLipid metabolismVEGFNDEndothelial cell growth factorIA-1NDZinc finger transcription factor, neuroendocrine tumor antigenβ3ARNDSignaling receptor implicated in metabolic diseasesCRABP2NDRetinoic acid signalingCALRT1NDCalcium signalingGOS24NDZinc finger transcription factor, cell cycle controlp16/ALTNDCell cycle controlPNMTANDHormone synthesisPLPNDMyelin componentPILOTNDZinc finger transcription factor, growth responseNF1NDSignalingLAG3NDLymphocyte signaling receptorThe informatics search for ZNF202 binding sites in promoters was performed as follows.

Having established that ZNF202m1 zinc fingers bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, we next analyzed the effect of full-length ZNF202m1 on transcription from target promoters. The presence of a KRAB domain suggested that the ZNF202m1 gene product acts as a transcriptional repressor (15.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Soeicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 16.Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W.

A. 1996; 93: 15299-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we used several reporter constructs containing portions of the apoE and apoAIV genes; these fragments all had been shown to bind ZNF202 in gel shift experiments. The reporter constructs were introduced by transfection into HepG2 human hepatoma cells with varying amounts of a ZNF202m1 expression plasmid. Reporter gene expression was measured in two independent systems by monitoring either secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) or luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 6, co-expression of ZNF202 represses transcription from the apoAIV and apoE reporter constructs 5–10-fold relative to the transcriptional activity in the absence of ZNF202. This repression is dose-dependent. No effect was observed for a control plasmid lacking a ZNF202 binding site. Identical results were obtained using a luciferase reporter (data not shown). Additional fragments derived from the promoters of phospholipid transfer protein and hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF4) and the apoCIII enhancer that had been shown to bind GST.ZF3–8 in vitrowere also used in reporter assays. Transcriptional repression in the presence of ZNF202 was similar to the one observed for the apoE and apoAIV promoters (Table I). Our results establish that ZNF202 is a transcriptional repressor that can bind in vitro to the regulatory regions of a large number of genes related to lipid processing. The target genes of ZNF202 can be divided into three distinct classes. The first group contains genes that encode structural components of lipoprotein particles: apoAIV, apoCIII, and apoE. Additionally, through its action on the apoCIII enhancer, ZNF202 also affects transcription of the apoA1 gene (11.Kardassis D. Laccotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 980-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A second class comprises enzymes involved in lipid processing: LPL, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and hepatic triglyceride lipase. Members of these first two groups are essential for maintaining lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. The overall effect of ZNF202 on lipid metabolism is difficult to predict because several of the genes products are thought to have counterbalancing functions. For example, in our hands ZNF202 represses transcription of both apoCIII and LPL reporter gene constructs, yet under some conditions these two genes have opposite effects on triglyceride hydrolysis because apoCIII inhibits LPL (22.Wang C.S. McConathy W.J. Kloer H.U. Alaupovic P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The third group of target genes includes several genes already suspected of contributing broadly to metabolic processes: HNF4α, insulinoma-associated gene 1, β-3 adrenergic receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. In particular, β-3 adrenergic receptor variants have been associated with body mass index (23.Hoffstedt J. Poirier O. Thorne A. Lonnquist F. Herrmann S.M. Canbien F. Arner P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24.Garcia-Rubi E. Starlin g R.D. Tchernof A. Matthews D.E. Walston J.D. Shuldiner A.R. Silver K. Poehlman E.T.

Several reports have provided genetic evidence that the chromosomal region containing the ZNF202 gene is linked to changes in lipid metabolism. Linkage analysis in Utah pedigrees identified a locus on chromosome 11q23 that predisposes to hypoalphalipoproteinemia.2 A genome scan in Pima Indians found evidence for a 11q23 locus that influences body mass index (26.Hanson R.L. Ehm M.G. Pettitt D.J. Prochazka M. Thompaon D.B. Timberlake D. Foroud T. Kobes S. Baier L. Burns D.K. Almasy L. Blangero J. Garvey W.T. Bennettt P.H. Knowler W.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1130-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained from a study in Massachusetts residents (27.Jaquish C.E. Fabsitz R.R. Larson M.G. Cupples L.A. Myers R.H. Levy D. Am. Soc. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63 (suppl.) (Abstr. 1905): 329Google Scholar). In addition, a gender-specific obesity mouse quantitative trait locus that localizes to the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 9 was recently described (28.Taylor B.A. Tarantino L.M. Phillips S.J. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The biochemical evidence presented here raises the possibility that ZNF202 may underlay these genetic linkages to obesity and hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Several actions of ZNF202 may contribute to the clinical associations between dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity. For example, ZNF202 represses expression of HNF4α, an important activator of liver-specific genes. It also represses the expression of several other transcription factors and signaling molecules known to participate in metabolic processes (TableI). Expression of structural components of lipoproteins and of the enzymes that act on them likely is coordinated, and shared regulatory elements afford one mechanism by which this coordination may occur. Specifically, the liver X receptor α transcription factor binds to DR-4 sites in the promoters of genes involved in cholesterol catabolism such as cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (8.Lehman J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.-L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Similarly, farnesoid X receptor orchestrates bile acid synthesis and recovery through opposing actions on the transcription of the ilial bile acid protein gene and of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (10.Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnology. 1999; 10: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, HNF4α enhances transcription of many genes related to lipid metabolism, including the genes for apoAI, apoB, apoCIII, apoAIV, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (11.Kardassis D. Laccotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 980-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

Mutant RTs with nonconservative substitutions affecting Tyr-115 (Y115V, Y115A, and Y115G) showed a dramatic reduction in their ability to discriminate against ribonucleotides in the presence of both cations. However, selectivity of deoxyribonucleotidesversus ribonucleotides was not affected in mutants Y115W and F160W. The substitution of Tyr-115 with Val or Gly had no effect on discrimination against dideoxyribonucleotides, but these mutants were less efficient than the wild-type RT in discriminating against cordycepin 5′-triphosphate. We also show that Tyr-115 is involved in fidelity of DNA synthesis, but substitutions at this position have different effects depending on the metal cofactor used in the assays. In Mg2+-catalyzed reactions, removal of the side chain of Tyr-115 reduced misinsertion and mispair extension fidelity, while opposite effects were observed in Mn2+-catalyzed reactions. Our results indicate that the aromatic side chain of Tyr-115 plays a role as a “steric gate” preventing the incorporation of nucleotides with a 2′-hydroxyl group in a cation-independent manner, while its influence on fidelity could be modulated by Mg2+ or Mn2+.

It converts the viral single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA which integrates into the host genome. The enzyme is multifunctional, possessing RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RNase H, strand transfer, and strand displacement activities (1.Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J. Hughes S.H.

Biol. 1998; 58: 339-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 RT is an error prone enzyme, as manifested by the frequencies of base substitutions, −1 frameshifts, and complex errors in the polymerization products (3.Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 85-102Google Scholar, 4.Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 16-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Unlike other DNA polymerases (e.g. Escherichia coli DNA polymerases I and III, T4 DNA polymerase, chicken polymerase γ, or calf polymerase δ, among others), retroviral RTs lack a proofreading activity. The low fidelity of HIV-1 RT contributes to retroviral mutagenesis and promotes the emergence of variants escaping the host's immune response, as well as viruses that are resistant to antiretroviral drugs such as RT or protease inhibitors.The HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer composed of two subunits of 66 and 51 kDa, with subdomains termed fingers, thumb, and palm and connection in both subunits and an RNase H domain in the larger subunit only. The polymerase active site resides within the palm subdomain of the 66-kDa subunit, which bears the catalytic aspartic acid residues 110, 185, and 186. A crystal structure of a covalently trapped catalytic complex of HIV-1 RT containing a DNA template-primer and a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) has been reported (5.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). According to this structure, the triphosphate moiety of the dNTP is coordinated by the side chains of Lys-65 and Arg-72, the main chains of Asp-113 and Ala-114, and two magnesium ions. The side chains of Arg-72 and Gln-151 pack against the outer surface of the incoming dNTP, and the ribose moiety of the incoming dNTP binds in a pocket defined by the side chains of Asp-113, Tyr-115, Phe-116, and Gln-151. Non-conservative substitutions at residues involved in dNTP binding are usually detrimental for polymerase activity and viral replication (6.Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Purifoy D.J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In the case of Tyr-115, its replacement with Phe rendered RT fully active, although other amino acid changes such as Y115W, Y115V, Y115A, or Y115G diminished the polymerase activity of the enzyme, by increasing theK m values for the incorporation of dNTPs (11.Martı́n-Hernández A.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on the crystallographic data, it has been suggested that the side chain of Tyr-115 is important for modifications at the 2′ and 3′ positions of the dNTP. In support of this proposal, the substitution of Val for the equivalent residue of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) RT (Phe-155) rendered an enzyme with a dramatically increased affinity for ribonucleotides, compared with the wild-type (WT) RT (16.Gao G. Orlova M. Georgiadis M.M. Hendrickson W.A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Unlike in the case of HIV-1 RT, the introduced mutation did not alter the affinity for dTTP. However, the kinetic parameters reported for HIV-1 RT were determined in the presence of magnesium cations (Mg2+), while in the case of Mo-MLV, manganese cations (Mn2+) were used as cofactors.The consequence of replacing Mg2+ with Mn2+ in DNA polymerization was originally documented by Hall and Lehman (17.Hall Z.W. Lehman I.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 36: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), who showed that Mn2+ caused the phage T4 DNA polymerase to be error prone. Evidence of increased error frequency in the presence of Mn2+ has been observed in vitro withEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I (18.El-Deiry W.S. Downey K.M. So A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2189-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have studied the effects of Mg2+ and Mn2+ on the nucleotide specificity of HIV-1 RT, by focusing on the role of Tyr-115 in nucleotide recognition at the 2′ and 3′ positions of the ribose ring and fidelity of DNA synthesis, in Mg2+- and Mn2+-catalyzed reactions. The reported data indicate that the mutagenic effect of Mn2+ on DNA polymerization by HIV-1 RT operates mainly at the level of mispair extension. Non-conservative substitutions of Tyr-115 decrease fidelity of DNA synthesis only in Mg2+-catalyzed reactions. An aromatic amino acid residue is required at position 115 to discriminate against nucleotides having a 2′-OH group. The proposed role of Tyr-115 as a “steric gate” in HIV-1 RT does not depend on the cations used in the DNA polymerization reactions.

In the case of Tyr-115, its replacement with Phe rendered RT fully active, although other amino acid changes such as Y115W, Y115V, Y115A, or Y115G diminished the polymerase activity of the enzyme, by increasing theK m values for the incorporation of dNTPs (11.Martı́n-Hernández A.M.

Based on the crystallographic data, it has been suggested that the side chain of Tyr-115 is important for modifications at the 2′ and 3′ positions of the dNTP. In support of this proposal, the substitution of Val for the equivalent residue of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) RT (Phe-155) rendered an enzyme with a dramatically increased affinity for ribonucleotides, compared with the wild-type (WT) RT (16.Gao G.

Unlike in the case of HIV-1 RT, the introduced mutation did not alter the affinity for dTTP. However, the kinetic parameters reported for HIV-1 RT were determined in the presence of magnesium cations (Mg2+), while in the case of Mo-MLV, manganese cations (Mn2+) were used as cofactors. The consequence of replacing Mg2+ with Mn2+ in DNA polymerization was originally documented by Hall and Lehman (17.Hall Z.W. Lehman I.R. J. Mol.

In this paper, we have studied the effects of Mg2+ and Mn2+ on the nucleotide specificity of HIV-1 RT, by focusing on the role of Tyr-115 in nucleotide recognition at the 2′ and 3′ positions of the ribose ring and fidelity of DNA synthesis, in Mg2+- and Mn2+-catalyzed reactions. The reported data indicate that the mutagenic effect of Mn2+ on DNA polymerization by HIV-1 RT operates mainly at the level of mispair extension. Non-conservative substitutions of Tyr-115 decrease fidelity of DNA synthesis only in Mg2+-catalyzed reactions. An aromatic amino acid residue is required at position 115 to discriminate against nucleotides having a 2′-OH group. The proposed role of Tyr-115 as a “steric gate” in HIV-1 RT does not depend on the cations used in the DNA polymerization reactions. We thank J. A. Pérez, J. I. Belio, and M. Bautista for help with the preparation of figures, and B. Canard, E. Domingo, and A. Mas for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."

Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Chaperonins are composed of two back-to-back rings containing either seven, eight, or nine 60-kDa subunits per ring, and they comprise two evolutionary divergent groups: the type I and type II chaperonins (2.Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Ellis R.J. The Chaperonins. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1996: 107-135Crossref Google Scholar). Generally, chaperonins are composed of one, two, or three subunit species (3.Archibald J.M. Logsdon J.M. Doolittle W.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1053-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but, exceptionally, the eukaryotic type II chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT)1 has eight different subunits per 8-fold pseudosymmetric ring (4.Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and each is proposed to be arranged in a fixed topology (5.Liou A.K.F.

It is suggested that each CCT subunit has evolved a specific independent function while maintaining the common property of ATPase activity (8.Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9.Willison K.R. Kubota H. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 299-312Google Scholar). The specific functions of individual CCT subunits may be associated with the provision of different polypeptide substrate binding sites, and thus individual subunits of CCT may play different roles in substrate interaction (5.Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10.Willison K.R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanisms. Harwood Academic Publishers, 1999: 555-571Google Scholar). The observation that the sequences of the eight constitutively expressed CCT subunit types (CCTα-CCTθ) are most divergent from each other in their apical domains (11.Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and that the apical domains of these eight orthologues are highly conserved between higher and lower eukaryotes supports the idea of the apical domain region of each subunit providing an individual and evolutionarily conserved role within the CCT complex related to substrate binding. This scenario is plausible because the majorin vivo substrates of CCT, the actins and tubulins, are among the proteins most conserved in comparison across all eukaryotic species (10.Willison K.R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanisms. Harwood Academic Publishers, 1999: 555-571Google Scholar). Llorca et al. (12.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) recently determined a structure of α-actin complexed with CCT by cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of single particles. Despite the fact that the images are at low resolution, around 30 Å, it appears that a stable intermediate can exist in which α-actin is bound to two CCT subunits in either of two 1:4 arrangements (CCTδ-CCTβ and CCTδ-CCTε) in the 8-fold ring, via the tips of the large and small domains. The complexes were prepared in the absence of ATP and, therefore, CCT is unliganded by adenine nucleotides (apo-CCT). It is suggested that actin bound by apo-CCT may be native-like, albeit opened up across its nucleotide binding cleft, and thus presumably in a nucleotide-free state (12.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This recent structural analysis of the apo-CCT-α-actin complex (12.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) raises the strong possibility that CCT, at least in one stage of its reaction cycle with this particular substrate, may not be recognizing residues predominantly located in the hydrophobic core of an unstructured folding intermediate but rather those on the surface of a native-like folding intermediate. Here we have undertaken a biochemical approach to test the model that individual subunits of CCT are involved in interactions with newly synthesized actin and that specific sequences in actin are bound by CCT. Immunoprecipitation of CCT-β-actin complexes under conditions of various stringency in buffers containing single and combinations of detergents revealed that several interactions between specific CCT subunits and actin are highly resistant to disruption in mixed micelle buffers, conditions that cause complete disruption of the CCT hexadecamer into its constituent subunits. In addition, a set of overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the entire 375 residues of mouse β-actin was screened for apo-CCT binding activity. We find that the peptides that bind CCT strongly are derived predominantly from loop and β-strand regions located on the surface of native actin. As expected for surface exposed regions of proteins, the CCT-binding peptides contain charged and polar residues in addition to nonpolar ones. These results suggest that some steps in the CCT-actin interaction pathway may be mediated through nonhydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, these data allow us to begin discriminating various levels of a complicated series of interactions that take place between actin and CCT during folding. We propose that some critical interactions are mediated between specific CCT subunits and actin folding intermediates and that hydrophilic loops and strands, which in native actin are found located on the surface, are components of the binding sites recognized by CCT. Full-length β-actin cDNA (residues M1-F375 of human β-actin) was cloned into pCITE vector (Novagen). Ha-Ras-β-actin subdomain 4 fusion cDNA, abbreviated as β-actin.sub4 (residues 1–168 of human Ha-Ras linked by Ser-Arg to residues Leu178–Phe262 of human β-actin in pBluescript SK− vector; Stratagene), was described previously by Llorca et al. (12.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). All eight constitutively expressed mouse CCT subunit cDNAs in pBluescript SK−were used as described by Liou et al. (13.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biological Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription/translation reactions were carried out in the TNTTM rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of 40 μCi (40 pmol) of [35S]l-methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)/50 μl of volume as described (13.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biological Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Individual translation reactions were performed at 30 °C for 22 min (β-actin), 60 min (CCTα, CCTβ, CCTγ, CCTδ, CCTε, CCTη, CCTθ, or CCTζ-1 subunits), or 45 min (β-actin.sub4). 35S-Labeled full-length β-actin and β-actin.sub4 produced by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-CCT subunit antibodies (14.Hynes G.

Following in vitrotranslation and sucrose gradient fractionation of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, three different types of immunoprecipitation experiment were performed. In the first set of reactions (see Fig. 1), 114-μl aliquots of the fractions containing the hexadecameric CCT peak (20–23% sucrose) (16.Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) were made up to a volume of 500 μl with either Nonidet P-40 immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 90 mm KC1, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (final detergent concentration)) or mixed micelle immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaC1, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS (final detergent concentrations)) and incubated with 5 μl of antibody for 2 h on ice. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in either Nonidet P-40 buffer or mixed micelle buffer (packed volume, 50 μl) were added, and reactions were mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer or mixed micelle buffer. In the second set of reactions (see Fig. 2 C), fractions containing unlabeled hexadecameric CCT peak (20–23% sucrose) were mixed with the fraction containing 35S-labeled β-actin monomers (13% sucrose). The samples (total volume, 94 μl) were made up to a volume of 500 μl with either Nonidet P-40 or mixed micelle immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated with 5 μl of antibody for 2 h on ice. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in either Nonidet P-40 buffer or mixed micelle buffer (packed volume, 50 μl) were added, and reactions were mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer or mixed micelle buffer. In the third set of reactions (see Fig. 3), 130-μl aliquots of the sucrose fractions containing free CCT subunits and β-actin monomers (13–17% sucrose) were made up to a volume of 1 ml with Nonidet P-40 immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated with 10 μl of antibody for 2 h on ice. Protein A-Sepharose beads in Nonidet P-40 buffer (packed volume, 100 μl) were added, and reactions were mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then divided into two equal samples, and one sample was washed three times with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, whereas the other sample was washed three times with 500 μl of mixed micelle buffer. Beads were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE on 8% (full-length β-actin) or 12.5% (β-actin.sub4) gels. 35S-Labeled protein bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis on a Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics). Twenty mouse testes were homogenized in 10 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmdl-lactic acid, 1 mm pyruvic acid in PBS.A, pH 7.2) containing CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a Polytron PT3000 (Kinematica). Debris was pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman SW28 rotor (25000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C), and the supernatant lysate (12 ml) was layered onto a linear sucrose gradient (10–40% w/w sucrose in 90 mm KCl, 50 mm TEA-HCl, pH 7.5). The gradient was centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 rotor (25000 rpm, 16 h, 4 °C), and fractions (1 ml each) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The three fractions enriched in both CCT and Hsc/Hsp70 were pooled, and sample volume was brought up to 10 ml with column equilibration buffer (20 mmTEA-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl). Hsc/Hsp70 proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Hi-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 20 mm to 1 m NaCl in 4 bed volumes of column equilibration buffer, and the fraction (1 ml) containing purified Hsc/Hsp70 proteins was concentrated using a Millipore ultrafree microconcentrator to a final volume of 200 μl. A set of 74 PepsetTM peptides (Meltek Scientific) was synthesized on polyethylene solid phase pins in a 96-well format. Each peptide was immobilized at the C terminus and contained 15 amino acid residues and an acetyl N terminus. Peptides 1–73 scanned the primary structure of mouse cytoplasmic β-actin (SwissProt:P02570), and starting from the N-terminal peptide 1MDDDIAALVVDNGSG15 (peptide 1), each subsequent peptide was offset by 5 residues, i.e.peptide 2, 6AALVVDNGSGMCKAG20; peptide 3,11DNGSGMCKAGFAGDD25; etc. Peptide 74 contained the epitope sequence for monoclonal antibody (mAb) 91A, which recognizes CCTα (15.Hynes G.

A general assay was established to detect the interaction of molecular chaperone proteins with the peptide array, which involved mAb binding followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection. Nonspecific binding to the peptide pins was reduced by incubation with precoat buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS.A, pH 7.2) for 1 h at room temperature. Hsc/Hsp70 proteins were purified from mouse testis as described above, and CCT was isolated from mouse testis as described previously (18.Hynes G. Sutton C.W., U, S. Willison K.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Purified CCT (6.5 μg/ml) or Hsc/Hsp70 (675 ng/ml) in 100 ml of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 90 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2) were incubated with the peptide array for 16 h at 4 °C. The pins were washed three times with PBS.A for a total of 30 min and incubated with the appropriate mAb (approximately 1.5 μg/ml in PBS.A) for 2 h at room temperature to detect CCT (mAb 91A) (15.Hynes G.

Following washing in PBS.A, the pins were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (30 ng/ml in PBS.A, Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. The pins were washed in PBS.A and incubated with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in 96-well microtitre plate for 30 min in the dark. Absorbance at 410 nm caused by the conjugates was detected using a microplate reader (model MR 710, Dynatech). The immobilized peptide array was incubated with CCT as described above and, prior to the development step inp-nitrophenyl phosphate, the peptide pins were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in substrate release buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 90 mm KC1, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP). Biotinylated PepsetTM peptides (Meltek Scientific) corresponding to residues 36–50 of mouse β-actin were synthesized on polyethylene solid phase pins. After cleavage, each peptide contained an amide C terminus and 19 amino acid residues including a -SGSG linker to a biotin group at the N terminus. The set consisted of the wild-type β-actin sequence (biotin-SGSG-36GRPRHQGVMVGMGQK50), five mutant peptides containing alanine scanning substitutions of residues GRPRH (biotin-SGSG-ARPRHQGVMVGMGQK, biotin-SGSG-GAPRHQGVMVGMGQK, biotin-SGSG-GRARHQGVMVGMGQK, biotin-SGSG-GRPAHQGVMVGMGQK, and biotin-SGSG-GRPRAQGVMVGMGQK), and one mutant peptide where all five residues of the GRPRH core sequence were replaced by AAAAA (biotin-SGSG-AAAAAQGVMVGMGQK). The peptides were solubilized in 10% acetic acid and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry on a Finnegan Lasermat 2000, and peptide concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. CCT (70 nm) was incubated with peptide (13.3 μm or 1.33 μm) in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 90 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2) for 1 h on ice. CCT complex was resolved on 6% native PAGE gels, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with Neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) (2 μg/ml in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS.A) to detect the interaction between CCT and biotinylated peptide. The image of the three-dimensional structure of actin (1ATN) was rendered using PREPI (48.Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J.E. PREPI. Alpha Ed., Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London1996Google Scholar). CCT in complex with 35S-labeled β-actin was prepared under approximate physiological conditions by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate followed by sucrose gradient fractionation to separate actin in complex with hexadecameric CCT away from actin monomers and free CCT subunits (13.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biological Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Initially, to follow CCT subunit recovery during immunoprecipitation, each of the eight CCT subunits was 35S-labeled individually and incorporated into rabbit CCT in reticulocyte lysate using the single-ring mediated assembly cycle discovered by Liou et al. (13.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biological Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Two CCT preparations each having 35S-labeled β-actin and four 35S-labeled CCT subunit types were prepared by sucrose gradient fractionation of five pooled in vitro translation reactions (set 1 contained35S-labeled β-actin and CCTα, β, δ, and ζ-1, whereas set 2 contained 35S-labeled β-actin and CCTγ, ε, η, and θ). These two sets were mixed after fractionation but prior to immunoprecipitation to produce CCT mixtures labeled in each of the eight subunits (Fig. 1 A,lane S). Thus, in the following experiments it should be borne in mind that no CCT complex contains more than one35S-labeled component, be it specific CCT subunit or the actin substrate. Immunoprecipitation of the pooled35S-labeled CCT-β-actin mixtures with monoclonal anti-CCTα antibody 23C (16.Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17.Willison K. Lewis V. Zuckerman K.S. Cordell J. Dean C. Miller K. Lyon M.F. Marsh M. Cell. 1989; 57: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 recovered all eight CCT subunits and actin (Fig. 1 A, lane N). This is to be expected, because this nonionic detergent does not disrupt CCT-substrate complexes (8.Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 16.Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of35S-labeled CCT-β-actin mixtures with monoclonal anti-CCTα antibody 23C in mixed micelle buffer recovered only the CCTα subunit but none of the other seven CCT subunit types (Fig.1 A, lane α), consistent with the fact that incubation in mixed micelle buffers causes disruption of CCT complex into its constituent subunits (16.Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, some actin remains bound to the CCTα subunit dissociated from holo-CCT by detergent (Fig.1 A, lane α). Immunoprecipitation of the35S-labeled CCT-β-actin mixtures with the other seven anti-CCT C-terminal epitope antibodies (14.Hynes G. Kubota H. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in mixed micelle buffer found that each antibody recovered its cognate CCT subunit and various amounts of 35S-β-actin (Fig. 1 A, lanes β, γ, δ, ε,η, θ, and ζ-1). Recovery of each CCT subunit by immunoprecipitation with its cognate antibody under mixed micelle conditions was quantitated and is shown graphically in Fig. 1 B. There is a 10-fold range in recovery that is probably a consequence of several variables, including antibody affinity and accessibility of the C-terminal epitopes of individual CCT subunits. These immunoprecipitations were repeated with unlabeled CCT-35S-β-actin complexes (Fig. 1 C), and the data were quantitated to show the relative amount of actin recovered by each anti-CCT subunit antibody (Fig. 1 D). This experiment was repeated several times with similar results, and the conclusion is that 35S-β-actin is recoverable in complex with CCTα, β, ε, and θ under conditions that cause disruption of holo-CCT into its constituent monomers. Certain CCT subunits are well recovered by immunoprecipitation under mixed micelle conditions, such as CCTη (Fig. 1 B), but do not appear complexed with actin under these stringent conditions. It is, of course, possible that different and weaker interactions are occurring between some CCT subunits and actin, but these cannot be discerned under milder conditions, because such conditions do not disrupt holo-CCT. Overall, when these data are compared with the CCT-α-actin complex model (12.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), some aspects are consistent, such as the substantial β-actin signals recovered with anti-CCTβ and anti-CCTε antibodies, whereas others are not accountable, such as the substantial β-actin signals recovered with CCTθ and CCTα antibodies. Furthermore, an important interaction seen between CCTδ and actin subdomain 2 in the three-dimensional structure is only weakly discernible under these immunoprecipitation conditions (Fig. 1,C and D). Llorca et al. (12.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) also determined a structure of apo-CCT bound to recombinant β-actin subdomain 4 fused to Ha-Ras, named β-actin.sub4, in which the hybrid protein appears to contact either CCTβ or CCTε but not CCTδ. β-Actin.sub4 interacts with CCT upon in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the interaction is mediated through actin subdomain 4 of the chimeric protein, because Ha-Ras does not interact with CCT. Therefore, a similar immunoprecipitation analysis to the experiment with β-actin was carried out on unlabeled CCT complexed to 35S-β-actin.sub4 (Fig. 1, E andF). The data are again consistent with the three-dimensional reconstruction; these are the substantial35S-β-actin.sub4 signals recovered with anti-CCTβ and anti-CCTε antibodies and the absence of any35S-β-actin.sub4 signal with CCTδ antibody. Again, CCTα and CCTθ produce positive interactions with35S-β-actin.sub4, indicating a contribution of these CCT subunits to associations with the large domain of actin. A number of control experiments were performed to confirm that the interactions between newly synthesized β-actin and CCT subunits are productive (Fig. 2). β-Actin is actively folded and processed to a non-CCT interacting monomer conformation upon in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (12.Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), indicating that interaction between newly synthesized β-actin and CCT is transient. The 20 S sucrose peak containing CCT-35S-β-actin complexes was incubated with Mg-ATP to induce release of bound substrate. Quantitation of35S-β-actin recovery upon immunoprecipitation of CCT indicates that a significant amount of 35S-β-actin is released from CCT subunits in response to Mg-ATP and that the released β-actin is not rebound by CCT nor does it adhere nonspecifically to the protein A-Sepharose beads (Fig. 2 A). β-Actin monomers, produced through the action of CCT during the course of the in vitro translation reaction, sediment in the top fractions of the sucrose gradient (13–17% sucrose). A DNase I shift assay indicates that these β-actin monomers have been folded to a native conformation (Fig. 2 B), presumably as a result of their interaction with CCT, and that they retain their native conformation during fractionation. These native35S-β-actin monomers were mixed with unlabeled CCT complex, and immunoprecipitation reactions similar to those described in Fig. 1 were performed (Fig. 2 C). No interaction between35S-β-actin and CCT subunits was detected in either 0.5% Nonidet P-40 or mixed micelle buffers. This indicates that native β-actin is not bound by CCT complex, despite the input35S-β-actin monomer counts being in 10-fold excess compared with the 35S-β-actin counts preloaded on CCT byin vitro translation under physiological conditions (Fig.1). This demonstrates that the specific interactions detected between newly synthesized β-actin and CCT subunits upon in vitrotranslation do not occur upon mixing CCT and folded β-actin monomers. Furthermore, nonspecific interactions between CCT subunits and β-actin do not occur either in Nonidet P-40 or in mixed micelle buffers during the course of the immunoprecipitation experiments. In rabbit reticulocyte lysate and the cytosol of other eukaryotic cells, it has been demonstrated that CCT subunits can exist as populations of free monomers and microcomplexes as well as components of the 900-kDa hexadecameric CCT complex (5.Liou A.K.F.

Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the function of these free CCT subunits and microcomplexes within cells is not yet fully understood. Free CCT subunits dissociated from the holo-chaperonin in lysate co-sediment with the native β-actin monomers in sucrose gradients at 13–17% sucrose. Further immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to investigate whether any free CCT subunits could interact with the monomeric folded actin. An interaction preserved in nonionic detergent was observed between dissociated CCTα and CCTθ and native β-actin monomers. Fig. 3 shows that35S-β-actin is recovered upon immunoprecipitation with anti-CCTα and anti-CCTθ antibodies in 0.5% Nonidet P-40. This is presumably a qualitatively different interaction to the one observed w"

However, few pro-proliferative targets of Wnt have been identified. We now show that cyclin D1, a critical mediator of cell cycle progression, is a downstream target of Wnt-dependent signaling. NIH-3T3 cell lines engineered to overexpress Wnt1 displayed reduced glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity.

However, in the absence of serum-derived growth factors, Wnt-1 was not sufficient to drive cyclin D1 accumulation or S-phase entry. In contrast, cells engineered to co-express Wnt1 and activated MEK1 accumulated high levels of cyclin D1 and entered the DNA synthetic phase in the absence of serum-derived growth factors, a characteristic of neoplastic transformation. The ability of a dominant-negative cyclin D1 mutant, D1-T156A, to inhibit Wnt1/MEK1-dependent S-phase entry suggests that cyclin D1 is a critical downstream target for Wnt1- and MEK1-dependent cellular proliferation.

The Wnt ligand binds to Frizzled, its membrane bound receptor, transmitting its signals through Disheveled (Dvl), culminating in the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)1 and the stabilization of β-catenin (2.Dale T.C.

J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Upon accumulation, β-catenin is free to translocate to the nucleus as a component of a transcription factor complex composed of TCF/LEF-1 family members and activate transcription of genes whose promoters contain binding sites for TCF/ LEF-1 (7.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In addition to providing pivotal signals in the determination of embryonic development (1.Moon R.T. Brown J.D. Torres M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 157-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), certain Wnt family members are also implicated in tumorigenesis. For example, the proto-typical Wnt family member Wnt1 can transform cultured murine epithelial cells (8.Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and reduce growth factor requirements and increase saturation densities when expressed in rodent fibroblasts (9.Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2119-2825Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A direct demonstration of the oncogenic capacity of Wnt1 was the observation that mice expressing a Wnt1 transgene develop mammary carcinoma (8.Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). GSK-3β may be one of the key effectors of Wnt-dependent signaling, as it directly regulates the accumulation and, thus, activity of several pro-proliferative molecules, such as cyclin D1 (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). In general, the mitogen-responsive D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) regulate G1-phase progression in concert with their catalytic subunit, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) or 6 (CDK6) (11.Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). G1 progression also requires the activity of CDK2 in combination with cyclin E (11.Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mitogenic stimuli trigger the accumulation of active cyclin D1·CDK4 complexes through both increased expression and decreased proteolysis of cyclin D1 and through the promotion of cyclin D1·CDK4 association (11.Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mitogen-dependent expression of cyclin D1 depends upon growth factor-mediated activation of a signal transduction cascade consisting of Ras, Raf-1, and ERK1 and ERK2 (12.Albanese C. Johnson J.

Accumulation of cyclin D1 during G1 also relies upon mitogen-dependent inhibition of GSK-3β through activation of PI3K and AKT (protein kinase B) (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on a single threonine residue, threonine 286, triggers the cytoplasmic proteolysis of cyclin D1 via the 26 S proteasome (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). The significance of the precise regulation of cyclin D1 accumulation is emphasized by the observed overexpression of cyclin D1 in a high percentage of human malignancies (19.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). Given the capacity of GSK-3β to regulate the accumulation of cyclin D1, we reasoned that Wnt1-induced growth alterations might be attributed, in part, to its capacity to promote increased accumulation of cyclin D1. In this paper we demonstrate that Wnt1-dependent down-regulation of GSK-3β promotes the deregulation of cyclin D1 accumulation through reduced cyclin D1 proteolysis, increased accumulation of cyclin D1 message, and increased nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1. We also demonstrate that cells overexpressing Wnt1 and activated MEK1 promote growth factor independent S-phase entry, which is dependent upon the accumulation of cyclin D1-dependent kinase. NIH-3T3 cells and their derivatives were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and antibiotics (Fisher). NIH-3T3 cells expressing zinc-inducible MEK1* (provided by Dr. Charles Sherr, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) were established previously, and their characteristics are described in detail elsewhere (15.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells that express zinc-inducible MEK1* and constitutively express Wnt1 were established by transfection of a plasmid encoding Hfc-tagged Wnt1 (provided by Dr. Stuart Aaronson, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and a second plasmid encoding the puromycin resistance gene into MEK1*-3T3 cells using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation protocol (20.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Cell lines were selected in complete medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 and 7.5 μg/ml puromycin. NIH-3T3 cells expressing HFc-Wnt1 were established using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation protocol (20.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) and selected in complete medium containing 800 μg/ml G418. For focus formation assays, the indicated cell lines were plated at a density of 5 × 105/60-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics, 5% FCS, and, where indicated, 80 μm zinc sulfate. The medium was changed every 4 days, and cells were stained with Giemsa (Sigma) after 3 weeks. For direct Western analysis, cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mmNa3VO4, and 0.4 mm NaF). 150 μg of total cellular proteins were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (MSI, Westborough MA), and blotted with the indicated primary antibodies. Immunoblot analysis of Myc-tagged MEK1*, cyclin D1, CDK4, p21 cip1, and p27 kip1 was otherwise performed as described previously (15.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

For detection of Hfc-tagged Wnt1, cell lysates were prepared as above, and Wnt1-HFc was detected with a mouse-specific Hfc antiserum (DAKO; Carpinteria, CA). Sites of antibody binding were visualized using anti-mouse-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (NEN Life Science Products). For detection of total CDK2-associated catalytic activity, cells were lysed in Tween 20 immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease and phosphatase inhibitors indicated above). CDK2 complexes were isolated from clarified lysates (150 μg/sample) with antiserum directed to CDK2 (RDD) and protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed 4 times with immunoprecipitation buffer and 2 times with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm unlabeled ATP, and the protease and phosphatase inhibitors indicated above). Reactions were initiated by the addition 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and incubated at 30 °C for 25 min (with linear incorporation kinetics). Labeled proteins were denatured in sample buffer and separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels before autoradiography. Rb kinase and GSK-3β kinase assays were performed as described previously (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F.

For detection of BrdUrd and FLAG-tagged cyclin D1 in a single cell, transfected cells seeded on coverglass were fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol-acetone (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C. The coverglass was then incubated with FLAG-specific Octa-probe antiserum (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG (1 μg/ml; Fisher) for 30 min. To detect the antibody-antigen complexes, a third incubation was performed with anti-rabbit-conjugated fluoroscein isothiocyanate (1:400; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Following treatment of cells with 1.5 n HCl, cells were stained with a BrdUrd-specific antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by biotinylated anti-mouse (1:400; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and streptavidin Texas Red (1:400; Vector Laboratories). All incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% nonfat dry milk. Finally, after a final wash in phosphate-buffered saline, DNA was stained with Hoecsht dye 33258 (Sigma). Detection of endogenous cyclin D1 was performed as described elsewhere (21.Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8505-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using a Nikon microscope fitted with the appropriate filters. Total cellular RNA (15 μg/lane) was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Sigma). After cross-linking, membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeled cyclin D1 probe or γ-actin (provided by Dr. Joseph Brewer, Loyola University) probes prepared by random priming, washed, and subjected to autoradiography. We established NIH-3T3 cells lines that constitutively overexpress HFc-tagged Wnt1 (Wnt1-3T3). To confirm expression of Wnt1-HFc, whole cell lysates prepared from proliferating NIH-3T3 or Wnt1-3T3 cells were separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Direct Western blot analysis with an antibody that recognizes the mouse-Hfc tag confirmed that Wnt1 was expressed in Wnt1-3T3 but not parental NIH-3T3 cells (Fig.1 A). Although Wnt1 is normally not expressed in NIH-3T3 cells (23.Brown A.M.C. Papkoff J. Fung Y.K.T. Shackleford G.M. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell.

Although this inhibition is potentially due to the incorporation of GSK-3β into catalytically inactive complexes (24.Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J.

Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), the end result of either mechanism should be a net reduction in GSK-3β catalytic activity. To confirm that ectopically expressed Wnt1 regulates GSK-3β, we assessed GSK-3β kinase activity in asynchronously proliferating parental NIH-3T3 and Wnt1-3T3 cells. GSK-3β precipitated from whole cell lysates was assayed for its ability to phosphorylate glutathioneS-transferase fused with the carboxyl-terminal 41 amino acids of cyclin D1 (GST-D1). We have previously demonstrated that GSK-3β specifically phosphorylates a single residue, threonine-286, located within the cyclin D1 moiety of this recombinant protein (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). GSK-3β precipitated from NIH-3T3 cell lysates incorporated significantly more phosphate into the cyclin D1 substrate than GSK-3β precipitated from Wnt1-3T3 cellular lysates (Fig. 1 B), demonstrating that overexpression of Wnt1 results in inhibition of GSK-3β activity. Equivalent levels of GSK-3β were expressed in both cell lines (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating that the observed decrease in GSK-3β activity did not reflect its decreased expression. Cyclin D1 accumulation is exquisitely sensitive to a variety of signaling pathways (28.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Mitogens regulate cyclin D1 accumulation via Ras-dependent activation of at least two distinct pathways. The first, which proceeds via Raf-1-MEK1-ERK, regulates cyclin D1 gene expression and assembly with CDK4 (12.Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The second Ras-dependent pathway, involving PI3K and AKT, triggers the inhibition of GSK-3β, thereby stabilizing cyclin D1 protein (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Signal-dependent cyclin D1 accumulation may also be subject to regulation via Ras-independent mechanisms. For example, Wnt-dependent signal transduction pathways also regulate GSK-3β, apparently in a Ras-independent fashion (2.Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered the possibility that Wnt1-3T3 cells might overexpress cyclin D1. Consistent with this hypothesis, lysates prepared from asynchronously proliferating Wnt1-3T3 cells contained 4-fold more cyclin D1 than parental NIH-3T3 cells (Fig.2 A), as determined by immunoblot analysis using a cyclin D1-specific monoclonal antibody. In mouse fibroblasts, CDK4 is the primary catalytic partner of cyclin D1 (29.Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.-Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). As steady-state levels of CDK4 exceed that of cyclin D1 (30.Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.E. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), the increase in cyclin D1 abundance in Wnt1-3T3 cells should result in a corresponding increase in cyclin D1·CDK4 kinase activity (22.Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1·CDK4 complexes were precipitated from whole cell lysates prepared from asynchronously proliferating NIH-3T3 or Wnt1-3T3 cells using a cyclin D1-specific monoclonal antibody that supports cyclin D1·CDK4 activity (22.Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1·CDK4 activity was then determined by immune complex kinase assays using recombinant GST-Rb as the substrate (22.Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1·CDK4 complexes isolated from Wnt1-3T3 cells displayed an increased propensity to phosphorylate GST-Rb (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–3) relative to those precipitated from normal, proliferating NIH-3T3 cells (lanes 4–5). Densitometric scanning revealed that the absolute catalytic activity of the cyclin D1-dependent kinase was enhanced at least 2-fold in the Wnt1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that Wnt1 promotes the increased accumulation of catalytically active cyclin D1-dependent kinase. It has previously been demonstrated that cells overexpressing cyclin D1 exhibit a contracted G1-phase interval (30.Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.E. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Given the capacity of Wnt1 to promote increased accumulation of cyclin D1, we determined the percentage of asynchronously proliferating Wnt1-3T3 or parental NIH-3T3 cells in each stage of the cell cycle by flow cytometric analysis. Surprisingly, we failed to detect significant alterations in the percentage of G1- or S-phase Wnt1-3T3versus NIH-3T3 cells (negative data not shown). Our inability to detect alterations in the cell cycle profile of Wnt1-3T3versus NIH-3T3 is likely a reflection on the modest level of cyclin D1 overexpression in these cells in the absence of a collaborating oncogene (see below). We next considered the possibility that the increased cyclin D1 accumulation in Wnt1-3T3 cells might result from decreased cyclin D1 proteolysis. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis (50 μg/ml blocks >95% of total protein synthesis within 2 min; data not shown) and followed the rate of cyclin D1 decay by direct Western blot analysis with a cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody. Cycloheximide was added to asynchronously proliferating NIH-3T3 or Wnt1-3T3 cells, and lysates were prepared at the indicated intervals. The cyclin D1 half-life in parental NIH-3T3 cells was 25 min (Fig.3 A, upper panel), in agreement with the previously determined half-life of cyclin D1 (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cyclin D1 half-life in Wnt1-3T3 was approximately 60 min (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). The results of a series of independent pulse-chase experiments are represented graphically in Fig. 3 B and demonstrate a cyclin D1 half-life of 25 min in parental NIH-3T3 cells versus 65 min in Wnt1-3T3 cells. These results demonstrate that cyclin D1 turnover is compromised in Wnt1-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells. Although cyclin D1 is a nuclear protein during G1 phase, it relocalizes to the cytoplasm during S phase (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar, 31.Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar), a process that is also regulated by GSK-3β (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). We thus considered the possibility that overexpression of Wnt1 might perturb the normal subcellular distribution of cyclin D1. To address this issue, Wnt1-3T3 and NIH-3T3 cells seeded on glass coverslips were fixed, and the subcellular localization of cyclin D1 was determined by immunofluorescent staining with a monoclonal antibody specific for cyclin D1. Representative immunofluorescent data are shown in Fig.4 A. As previously seen, cyclin D1 localized primarily to the nucleus in approximately 60% of asynchronously proliferating fibroblasts (Fig. 4, A(top panels) and B (left column)). In contrast, 78% of Wnt1-3T3 cells contained nuclear cyclin D1 (Fig. 4,A (bottom panel) and B (right column)). These findings demonstrate that Wnt1 overexpression perturbs normal cyclin D1 subcellular distribution, resulting in the increased nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1. Given the propensity of β-catenin to positively regulate cyclin D1 expression (32.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar, 33.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) and the capacity of Wnt1 overexpressing cells to accumulate high levels of free β-catenin (7.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that Wnt1 might also promote increased accumulation of cyclin D1 message. Total RNA was isolated from asynchronously proliferating or serum-starved parental NIH-3T3 or Wnt1-3T3 cells. Equal quantities of total RNA were transferred to membranes and probed with either a cyclin D1-specific probe or a γ actin-specific probe. Northern blotting revealed a modest but significant increase of approximately 2-fold steady-state cyclin D1 mRNA in the asynchronously proliferating Wnt1-3T3 cells relative to that observed in proliferating NIH-3T3 cells (Fig.5; compare lanes 2 and4). As has previously been observed for many cell types, no cyclin D1 message was detectable in either serum-starved NIH-3T3 or Wnt1-3T3 cells (Fig. 5; compare lanes 1 and 3). The inability of Wnt1 to drive cyclin D1 gene expression in the absence of serum likely reflects the inability of Wnt1 to activate ERK1 or 2 in these cells, both of which are required for cyclin D1 gene expression (9.Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2119-2825Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Wnt1 is not sufficient to support either cyclin D1 synthesis or S-phase entry in the absence of serum-derived growth factors (Figs. 5 and6). This is potentially due to the failure of Wnt1-dependent signals to activate the growth factor inducible extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (9.Bafico A. Gazit A. Wu-Morgan S.S. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2119-2825Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1*), the upstream activator of ERK1 and -2, can promote both the expression of cyclin D1 and the assembly of cyclin D1·CDK4 complexes in the absence of serum-derived growth factors (15.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 17.Treinies I. Paterson J.F. Hooper S. Wilson R. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, MEK1*, like Wnt1, cannot support S-phase entry in the absence of serum-derived growth factors (see below) (15.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 17.Treinies I. Paterson J.F. Hooper S. Wilson R. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The inability of cells expressing MEK1* to enter S phase apparently resulted from the failure of these cells to accumulate sufficient levels of cyclin D1·CDK4 complexes necessary to titrate the CDK inhibitor, p27 kip1 (15.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The sub-optimal levels of cyclin D1 result from the inability of MEK1-dependent pathways to inhibit GSK-3β (10.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the failure of cyclin D1·CDK4 complexes to titrate p27 kip1 results in “free” p27 kip1 that can associate with and inhibit the CDK2 kinases (both cyclins A/CDK2 and E/CDK2), both o"

Only under a special condition such as the presence of low concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate is Rac modified to a minor extent (5.Just I. Mohr C. Schallehn G. Menard L. Didsbury J.R.

In addition to the transferase activity, the C3-like exoenzymes exhibit glycohydrolase activity to cleave NAD+ in the absence of the protein substrate (10.Just I. Mohr C. Habermann B. Koch G. Aktories K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The C3-like exoenzymes are single-chain proteins with a molecular mass of about 25 kDa. They lack a membrane binding and translocation domain, and their cell entry is most likely mediated through pinocytosis. This deficiency in cell entry has been overcome by the construction of chimeric C3 toxins, which exploit the cell entry domains of other toxins such as diphtheria or C. botulinum C2 toxin (11.Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12.Aullo P. Giry M. Olsnes S. Popoff M.R. Kocks C. Boquet P.

The RhoA, -B, and -C proteins belong to the Rho subfamily, which encompasses (in addition to Rho) Rac, Cdc42, RhoD, Rnd/RhoE, RhoG, and TC10. These low molecular mass GTPases are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, cell cycle progression, cell transformation, and apoptosis. The function of the GTPases is tightly governed by regulatory proteins such as the exchange factors, the GTPase-activating proteins, and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. Downstream signaling is mediated through interaction with effector proteins, which are serine/threonine-kinases (Rho kinases, citron kinase, protein kinase N), lipid kinases (phosphatidyl inositol kinases), phospholipases (phospholipase D), and adapter proteins (rhotekin, rhophilin, p140Dia, myosin binding subunit) (13.Mackay D.J.G.

The finding, that C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of RhoA in intact cells causes depolymerization of the actin filaments, led to the notion that ADP-ribosylation at Asn41 inactivates Rho. ADP-ribosylation has no significant influence on nucleotide exchange, intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein-stimulated GTPase activity but clearly decreases the exchange activity of Lbc (17.Paterson H.F.

Furthermore, the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-driven cycling between cytosol and membranes is blocked leading to sequestration of ADP-ribosylated Rho in the inactive guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor complex. 1H. Genth, M. Schmidt, H. Barth, K. Aktories, and I. Just, submitted for publication. This sequestration seems to be an additional important functional consequence finally resulting in the inactivation of Rho. The Rho proteins are also targets for other bacterial toxins. TheClostridium difficile toxins A and B glucosylate Rho at Thr37 but also modify Rac and Cdc42 (21.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K.

Among the Rho-modifying toxins, the C3-like exoenzymes exhibits the most confined substrate specificity to exclusively ADP-ribosylate RhoA, -B, and -C. The Rho-related GTPases Rac and Cdc42 also harbor the acceptor amino acid asparagine (Asn39 in Rac and Cdc42) and are highly homologous in the vicinity of the acceptor amino acid but are not substrates for C3. We studied, therefore, which amino acids of Rho define the substrate specificity for C3 and whether it is possible to construct a mutant Rac that is a substrate for C3. RhoA, Rac1, and the mutant forms were purified as GST2 fusion proteins from E. coli followed by thrombin cleavage. Thrombin was removed by precipitation with benzamidine-Sepharose.

The RhoA or Rac1 mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with the pGEX2T-wild type human RhoA or the pGEX2T-wild type human Rac1 vector as templates and the respective oligonucleotides using the Quickchange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR reactions were carried out with PfuI polymerase according to the manual from Stratagene or with Taq-DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the TOPO-TA vector system from Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherland) in a Gene Amp 2400 PCR system from Perkin-Elmer. DNA was sequenced with the cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (ABI PRISM) from Perkin-Elmer to verify the correct mutations. This chimera was created using the pGEX2T vectors mentioned above and a splicing by overlapping extension (“SOE”) PCR reaction (26.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

The products of each PCR were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and put in a third PCR as template for each other. As a result, a 1.8-kilobase fragment was obtained and ligated in the TA vector system. Sequential digestion with BstBI and PstI resulted in mobilization of the PCR product, which can be ligated directly into a pGEX2T, cut with the same enzymes. The resulted plasmid was transformed in E. coli XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Binding ofN-methylanthraniloyl-GDP was used to prove structural and functional integrity of the mutant Rho and Rac proteins. The GTPases (0.5 μm), dissolved in buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2,150 mm NaCl) were warmed to 37 °C, and the nucleotide exchange was initiated by the addition ofN-methylanthraniloyl-GDP to give a final concentration of 2 μm. The samples were measured in a fluorescence cuvette with a excitation wavelength of 357 nm and a emission wavelength of 444 nm. The binding ofN-methylanthraniloyl-GDP was monitored as an increase in fluorescence. Wild type and mutant Rho/Rac proteins showed the same increase in fluorescence. 2 μg of wild type RhoA, wild type Rac1, and the mutant proteins were incubated with 1 μg/ml (43 nm) or 0.1 μg/ml (4.3 nm) C3 (as indicated) in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm[adenylate-32P]NAD at 37 °C for up to 15 min. For nucleotide-dependent ADP-ribosylation, wild type RhoA (15 μm) was incubated with 3 mm GDP, GTPγS, or Gpp(NH)p (a kind gift of Dr. C. Herrmann, Dortmund) in a buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 60 min on ice. The nucleotide exchange was terminated by the addition of 13 mm MgCl2, and the Rho proteins were subjected to [32P]ADP-ribosylation. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and the32P-labeled proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by analysis with a PhosphorImager. RhoA, Rac1, and the indicated mutant forms were used as GST fusion proteins immobilized to Sepharose. 5 μg of the GST fusion proteins were incubated under mild agitation with 100 ng of C3, or as indicated, in a binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (total volume of 100 μl) at 4 °C for 45 min. The Sepharose beads were washed once with 100 μl of binding buffer followed by elution with 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluted samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by probing with anti-C3, and visualization was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence. The exposed films were evaluated by scanning and subsequent quantification. The nonspecific binding (binding to GST) was subtracted, and the remaining intensity was given as relative units. To calculate the percentage of bound C3, 450 ng of C3 in the binding buffer was incubated with RhoA immobilized to Sepharose beads; thereafter the beads were processed as described above. Samples were drawn before the addition of RhoA from the supernatant after binding and from the RhoA-bound fraction. The amount of C3 in each sample was assessed by immunoblotting. For detection of glycohydrolase activity, 200 mm [adenylate-32P]NAD was incubated with or without 1 μm of C3 and 5 μm of the indicated GTPases in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) and 2 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 3 h. Samples were filtrated through a 10-kDa Centricon, and the protein-free flow through was separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 F254 (Merck) with 66% 2-propanol and 0.33% ammonium sulfate. The amount of hydrolyzed [32P]NAD was calculated from PhosphorImager data. To test whether the complete structure of Rho or only subdomains define the substrate recognition by C3 exoenzyme, chimeras between RhoA and Rac1 were constructed (Fig. 1) and tested for ADP-ribosylation. Only when the N-terminal part was Rho-like, the chimeras were modified by C3 (Fig. 1). Thus, the minimum part, which makes the difference between Rac and Rho with respect to ADP-ribosylation, is determined by amino acids 1–90. The non-ADP-ribosylatable chimeras were native in structure as tested by nucleotide binding (data not shown) except the Rho73Rac chimera, which was therefore excluded. Sequence comparison of the N-terminal 90 amino acids of RhoA with Rac1 revealed several differences (Fig. 2). The basic stretch at the N terminus (positionRhoArg5-Lys6), which is absent in Rac, and the acidic residues RacAsp28, Asp45, Glu47, Glu54, Asp76, Asp87, and Asp90, which are not acidic in Rac, were inserted and exchanged, respectively. Mutant Rac1 proteins possessing the respective amino acid(s) of RhoA were then tested for ADP-ribosylation as depicted in TableI. Only the insert of the basic residues equivalent to RhoArg5-Lys6 or the exchange of RacMet45 andRacAsn52 to glutamic acid led to an increase in ADP-ribosylation, however, only to a minor degree. Therefore, combinations of those mutations identified to affect ADP-ribosylation were tested. The basic insert (residuesRacArg5-Lys6) together with RacGlu47 andRacGlu54 led to a significant increase in ADP-ribosylation of this mutant Rac (Table I; note that the insert of the two basic residues changes the numbering of the Rac1 residues). To compare the kinetics of the ADP-ribosylation reaction between wild type RhoA andRacArg5-Lys6-Glu47-Glu54, the concentration of C3 was decreased from 1 μg/ml to 0.1 μg/ml (4 nm) to extend the linear phase. Surprisingly, the mutant Rac protein (RacArg5-Lys6-Glu47-Glu54) was only faintly modified, indicating that the so far identified residues only partially contributed to the substrate recognition by C3 (Fig. 3).Table IWild type and mutant forms of RhoA and Rac1, respectively, were ADP-ribosylated by C3 (1 μg/ml).

Only Val43 is different in Rac, the equivalent position is taken by a hydrophilic serine. The side-chain of Asn41 interacts with Trp58 and with Glu40, the latter one is an Asp residue in Rac (RacAsp38). The exchange of this two residues in Rho (Glu40 → Asp, Val43 → Ser) to the respective amino acids of Rac, almost completely inhibited ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 4 A), a finding supporting the importance of RhoGlu40and RhoVal43 for Rho ADP-ribosylation. As expected, the exchange of RhoTrp58 completely blocked ADP-ribosylation, whereas the exchange ofRhoPhe39 had no effect (data not shown). Surprisingly, the exchange of the respective amino acids in Rac1 (Asp38 → Glu, Ser41 → Val) did not significantly increase ADP-ribosylation of Rac (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that RhoGlu40 andRhoVal43 are necessary but not sufficient for ADP-ribosylation. Therefore, those residues found to contribute to ADP-ribosylation were mixed in various combinations, and the multiple mutant Rac constructs were tested for ADP-ribosylation. As illustrated in Fig. 3, only Rac, which harbored the basic insert (Arg5, Lys6) RacGlu at positions 40, 47, and 54 and the lipophilic RacVal43, was completely modified. In addition to complete ADP-ribosylation, this mutant Rac showed a kinetic behavior that was indistinguishable from that of wild type RhoA (Fig. 3). Thus, these residues are the essential ones allowing C3 to transfer the ADP-ribose moiety. The residues identified to promote ADP-ribosylation by C3 were tested whether they participate in substrate recognition, i.e.binding to C3. To this end, the binding of multiple mutant Rho and Rac proteins to C3 was studied by applying a precipitation assay with immobilized mutant GST fusion proteins. Preliminary experiments showed that C3 binding was different from nonspecific binding. As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, C3 bound to wild type RhoA but not to wild type Rac whose binding was comparable to control signal. The binding of the poor ADP-ribosylatableRacArg5-Lys6-Glu47-Glu54and RacGlu38-Val41 was comparable to C3 binding to RhoA. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of C3 resulted in increased binding but not in increased nonspecific binding. The amount of RhoA-bound C3 was about 25% (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 5 C,RacArg5-Lys6-Glu47-Glu54and RacGlu38-Val41 exhibited the same binding as the full substrate mutant Rac (RacArg5-Lys6-Glu40-Val43-Glu47-Glu54). Thus, the combination of all mutations, which contributed to ADP-ribosylation, did not further increase binding to C3. Consistent with this finding was that the exchange ofRhoGlu40 and RhoVal43did not alter the binding to C3. The exchange ofRhoTrp58, which abolished ADP-ribosylation had no effect on C3 binding. Thus, there are two types of binding and only the combination makes Rac1 a substrate. It is conceivable that the residues involved in mere binding to C3 also participate in the correct formation of the ternary complex, consisting of RhoA, C3, and NAD+. Especially, the residuesRhoGlu40 and RhoVal43, which are adjacent to the acceptor residue Asn41 could be involved in the correct positioning of the catalytic site of C3 in respect to the acceptor amino acid Asn41. To prove this working hypothesis, we made use of the fact that the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3 was increased by mutant Rho and deficient in the acceptor amino acid Asn41(RhoIle41) (Fig.6). This observation seems to be because of the fact that the formation of the ternary complex increases the rate of glycohydrolysis probably by decreasing thekm for NAD. Although bothRhoIle41 andRhoAsp40-Ser43 bound to C3 and were non-ADP-ribosylatable, only RhoIle41 was capable of increasing the glycohydrolase activity, whereasRhoAsp40-Ser43 even blocked it (Fig. 6). The inhibitory effect ofRhoAsp40-Ser43 might be because of an incorrect interaction of C3 with RhoA not allowing the correct binding of NAD+.Figure 6Effect of mutant RhoA on the NAD-glycohydrolase activity of C3. C3 (1 μm) was incubated in the presence of [32P]NAD (200 μm) (C3) or together with 5 μmRhoAN41I (C3+ RhoAN41I) or RhoAE40D/V43S (C3+ RhoA E40D/V43S). After the indicated times, samples were resolved on TLC, and cleaved [32P]ADP-ribose was determined by phosphoimaging.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The acceptor amino acid RhoAsn41 is located in the effector loop (switch I) of RhoA, which undergoes conformational changes upon GTP binding. To test whether nucleotide occupancy affects the accessibility of the amide moiety of Asn41, the nucleotide dependence of the ADP-ribosylation reaction was studied. To exclude GTPase activity to form GDP during the ADP-ribosylation reaction, the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues Gpp(NH)p and GTPγS were used. Fig. 7 shows the linear phase of the ADP-ribosylation reaction of RhoA loaded with either GDP, Gpp(NH)p, or GTPγS. The rate of ADP-ribosylation of RhoA-GDP was about five times faster than that of RhoA-Gpp(NH)p/GTPγS. The total amount of ADP-ribose incorporation, however, was not changed (Fig. 7,inset). Thus, the nucleotide occupancy had only minor effects on the kinetics of the transferase reaction. The C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases are characterized by a very selective substrate specificity to exclusively modify the Rho isoforms A, B, and C, which possess a homology of about 90%. This specificity is striking, because other Rho-modifying bacterial toxins exhibit less specificity. Furthermore, this specificity is the basis why C3 is an established and widely used tool in cell biology to selectively shut off the cellular functions of Rho. The first step to identify the regions of Rho involved in the interaction with C3 was to test chimeras between substrate RhoA and the nonsubstrate Rac1. The substrate recognition domain is at least restricted to the N-terminal part covering amino acids 1–90. Comparison of this part from RhoA with the Rho isoforms B and C revealed that only RhoB has one single amino acid exchange. However, Rac shows differences, i.e. the absence of the basic N-terminal stretch and less acidic amino acids distributed over the N-terminal part. Single and combined mutational analysis of the nonsubstrate Rac revealed that the insertion of the basic stretch and the exchange to the respective residues of RhoA (RhoGlu47 and RhoGlu54) clearly increased ADP-ribosylation of this multiple mutant Rac. However, neither the extent nor the time course of ADP-ribosylation were identical with the substrate RhoA. Therefore, we focused on the crystal structure of RhoA (27.Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors point out the unusual feature of the solvent exposed lipophilic amino acidsRhoVal38, Phe39, Val43, and Trp58. However, only the position ofRhoVal43 is different in Rac, which is taken by a hydrophilic serine (RacSer41). Indeed,RhoVal43 is important for ADP-ribose transfer because its exchange leads to a loss of ADP-ribosylation, whereas the conserved RhoPhe39 is not involved in substrate recognition. The proposed function of the conservedRhoTrp58 in the ADP-ribosylation reaction to facilitate the reaction through increase of the nucleophilicity of the acceptor moiety (27.Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was fully supported by mutagenesis; the exchange of Trp to a nonaromatic amino acid completely inhibited ADP-ribosylation. In addition, also the precursor residue ofRhoAsn41, RhoGlu40, is different in Rac, which is RacAsp38. Because the main-chain carbonyl group of RhoGlu40interacts with the side chain of RhoAsn41, the exchange to Asp (the side chain is one carbon atom shorter) should not affect ADP-ribosylation. However, exchange to Asp blocks ADP-ribosylation of Rho. The side-chain carbonyl group ofRhoGlu40 is solvent exposed, as can be deduced from the crystal structure, and the only explanation is that the acidic Glu finger is involved in binding to C3. Surprisingly, the introduction of the respective Glu and Val into Rac has only a minimum effect on ADP-ribosylation. Only the combination of these two residues together with the residues mentioned above (RacArg5-Lys6-Glu40-Val43-Glu47-Glu54) generates a mutant Rac protein, which meets the requirements for substrate recognition by C3. From the binding experiments of the wild type and mutant RhoA and Rac1, respectively, it became clear that the basic residues at the N terminus together with acidic residues (RhoGlu47 and RhoGlu54) and theRhoGlu40/RhoVal43residues are independently responsible for the mere binding to C3. The combination, i.e. the generation of the 6-fold mutant, does not increase binding. The residues involved in binding of Rho to C3 are exclusively located in the N-terminal part; thus, it is unlikely that the C-terminal part of RhoA contributes to the binding. However, the residuesRhoGlu40/RhoVal43 have a profound function in the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety because their exchange results in abolished ADP-ribosylation. In the case of the NAD-glycohydrolase reaction, a binary complex is formed between C3 and NAD+, and the rate of reaction is much slower (factor of 100) compared with the transferase reaction. The presence of non-ADP-ribosylatable Rho (RhoIle41) increases the glycohydrolase activity most likely by increasing the affinity of NAD to the now existing ternary complex. In contrast, mutant Rho lacking Glu40 and Val43, which still binds to C3, does block the NAD-glycohydrolase activity, most likely through its inability to form the correct ternary complex. Taken together, the residues Glu40 and Val43 are directly involved in the correct formation of the ternary complex formed by the exoenzyme C3, the protein substrate RhoA, and the co-substrate NAD+. The acceptor amino acid for ADP-ribosylation, Asn41, resides in the effector loop, as it can be concluded from the effects of partial loss of function mutants. The exchange ofRhoTyr42, the residue adjacent to Asn41, to Cys decreases PLD1 activation, whereas mutation of Asn41 has no effect on stimulation (28.Bae C.D. Min D.S. Fleming I.N. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Also the exchange of Glu40, the residue just before Asn41, inhibits effector activation, namely the RhoA stimulation of Rho kinase (ROK) (29.Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Switch I undergoes conformational changes during nucleotide exchange but the solvent accessibility of the side chain of Asn41 does not change, as can be deduced from the crystal structures of Rho-GTP and Rho-GDP (27.Ihara K.

The nucleotide-dependent time course of the ADP-ribosylation revealed that Rho-GDP is the optimal substrate and that binding of the GTP analogues Gpp(NH)p or GTPγS decreases the rate of reaction by a factor of five but does not change the total amount of ADP-ribosylation. Thus, conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding have only a minor effect on C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. However, this effect is only gradually compared with that of monoglycosylation of RhoA at Thr37 by Clostridium novyi α-toxin and of H-Ras at Thr35 by theClostridium sordellii lethal toxin (31.Selzer J.

Because the hydroxyl group of RhoThr37(RasThr35) points to the inner core of the protein (20.Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A.

Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), RhoA-GTP (Ras-GTP) is resistant to glucosylation. Therefore, the GDP form of RhoA is exclusively modified. Because the nucleotide occupancy has only effects on the kinetics but not the total amount of ADP-ribosylation, C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is in fact not a reliable marker to determine the inactive fraction of Rho in cells. In conclusion, it turned out that the basic stretch and at least three acidic amino acids are involved in the binding to C3. The N-terminal part of Rho has more acidic amino acids at the surface of the molecule than Rac. Thus, the specificity of Rho to serve as substrate for C3 is determined by several amino acids distributed over the N-terminal part of Rho. It is not possible to generate mutant Rac to be substrate of C3 by single or double exchange of amino acids. At least six residues are responsible for the interaction with C3 and thus define the selective interaction with Rho. We thank Jürgen Dumbach for expert technical assistance."

In plants, the molecular basis for effects of iron and oxidative stress on ferritin expression has been much less studied. Many end effects of ferritin regulation, such as induction by iron and changes during development, are the same in plants and animals, even though mechanisms differ. For example, the ferritin gene in plants contrasts with animals because it enocodes a target peptide to deliver the protein to an organelle, the plastid (27.Ragland M. Briat J.F. Gagnon J.

Evol. 1996; 42: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, although iron can change transcription of ferritin genes in both plants and animals, the effect on transcription in animals is amplified by large changes in mRNA translation. In soybean and maize by contrast, increases in transcription and mRNA accumulation of as much as 50–60-fold occur with no detectable, differential effects on translation of mRNA (29.Lescure A.M.

We describe in this study the identification and characterization of the upstream sequence in the soybean ferritin gene, which responds to iron (FRE), using soybean leaves to analyze soybean gene expression. There is no sequence similarity detectable between FRE and any known promoter or with the IRE, but in analogy to the IRE/IRP interaction in animal mRNA, we observe derepression of the soybean ferritin gene by iron through an iron-sensitive trans-factor. In addition, we show that the form of iron in the medium influences FRE activity in the leaves, with the highest derepression observed with iron fully chelated by citrate (iron:citrate = 1:10), compared with iron partially chelated by citrate (iron;citrate = 1;1); Fe-EDTA did not derepress ferritin, even though the leaf iron content increased. Soybean seed (Glycine max var. Williams) was kindly provided by Dr. Joe Burton (Department of Crop Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC). Seeds were planted in oyster shells and Perlite; after planting, the seedlings were watered twice a day with 250 ml of water for 4 days, followed by watering with 200 ml of water once a day and 200 ml of nutrient solution once a day (37.Ahmed S. Evans H.J. Soil Sci. 1960; 90: 205-210Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar); Ca(NO3)2(5.0 mm) was added as the nitrogen source. The non-nodulated soybean plants were grown with ambient light and harvested after 2–3 weeks of growth. For bombardment experiments, the de-rooted soybean plants were pre-incubated in water or 500 μm ferric citrate (1:1) for 4–5 h with exposure to ambient light. The effects of different physiological signals on ferritin gene expression were tested with soybean plants from which the roots were removed by cutting while holding the roots and stem under water. Incubation was at room temperature in the light. Preliminary experiments showed that the process of removing the roots did not change ferritin expression. Negative and positive controls were water (−iron) and 500 μm ferric citrate (1:1), which had been shown previously to give a large induction of ferritin mRNA in cultured tobacco cells (29.Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32.Proudhon D. Briat J.-F. Lescure A.-M. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 586-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in excised soybean leaves (33.Kimata Y. Theil E.C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Plant hormones, heavy metals, and anti-oxidants were tested at the following concentrations: 200 μm abscisic acid, 100 μm giberellic acid, 500 μmZnCl2, 500 μm MgCl2, 50–500 μm ferric citrate (1:1), 50–500 μm ferric citrate (1:10), 500 μm ferric nitrate. Iron:citrate (1:10) was made by adding a 10-fold molar excess of citric acid to a solution of iron nitrate dissolved in 1 mm HCl, and the solution was neutralized with NaOH before adding to the plants. Iron:citrate (1:1) is a commercial salt, which, when dissolved in water, becomes a mixture of “free” iron and partly chelated iron. Such “free iron” is “reactive,” in contrast to Fe(III) in iron:citrate (1:10), which is fully chelated and unavailable for radical (reactive oxygen species) chemistry. Salt stress was achieved by treating the de-rooted soybean plants with 300 mm NaCl. Drought stress was created by placing soybean leaves on dry filter paper, in a sealed Petri dish, for up to 6 h. Soybean leaves were removed from the de-rooted plants after 6 h of incubation under the test conditions and the tissue frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The source plasmid GmFRE1 (28.Proudhon D. Wei J., J.F., B. Theil E.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) encodes the entire soybean ferritin gene plus a 1900-bp promoter region. Reporter vectors were PBI221, in which the glucuronidase (GUS) gene is under the control of the 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (38.Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8219) Google Scholar) and the TC14 vector (C. Taylor, DuPont, Wilmington, DE), which has the luciferase gene, under the control of the Fed A promoter (39.Caspar T. Quail P.H. Plant J. 1993; 3: 161-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all GUS constructs, two primers were designed, which corresponded to the ends of the region to be examined and contained either a BamHI site or aPstI site. PCR amplification of the soybean ferritin promoter fragment and BamHI/PstI sites was followed by restriction enzyme digestion with BamHI andPstI. Digested PCR products were ligated toBamHI/PstI-digested PBI221, in which the 35 S promoter had been removed. Luciferase constructs were obtained by digesting the GUS constructs with HindIII andBamHI and ligating the promoter fragments to TC14 vectors, digested with the same enzymes (Scheme I). Linker scan mutants LS1, LS2, LS3, and LS4 were made by inserting random sequences, 25 bp in length, into different sites of the 86-bp promoter regions, using PCR. The sites were 22, 43, and 64 in the 86-bp promoter. Those mutants were then ligated to the luciferase reporter vector in TC14. DNA-coated particles were delivered to soybean leaves using procedures described previously (40.Mccabe D.E. Swain W.F. Martinell B.J. Christou P. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 923-926Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 41.Klein T.M. Fromm M. Weissinger A. Tomes D. Schaaf S. Sletten M. Sanford J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 85: 4305-4309Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of plasmid DNA (1 μg/μl) were added to 200 μl of gold (1.6 μm) suspension, followed by the addition of 50 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 and 20 μl of 0.1 mspermidine. After mixing (using a vortex mixer) for 3 min, DNA-coated gold particles were sedimented in a microcentrifuge, washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in 400 μl of 100% ethanol, and the suspension subjected to sonication (Fisher sonicator water bath) for several seconds before spreading 5 μl of suspension on a macrocarrier disc. The gold particles on the carrier were then delivered to the soybean leaf fragments using the PDS-1000/helium system; the helium pressure was 1,100 p.s.i., chamber pressure 27 inches of mercury, and the Petri dish was placed on the second shelf from the bottom of the chamber. After bombardment, the Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated at room temperature for 36–48 h with light from a fluorescent lamp during the night and ambient light during the day. GUS activity was analyzed by staining the soybean leaves with 3 ml of a mixture containing 0.1mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml X-GLUC for 24 h at 37 °C (38.Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8219) Google Scholar). The leaves were then rinsed with 70% ethanol for several hours to remove the chlorophyll. Cells expressing the GUS gene turned blue and could be analyzed with a dissecting microscope. The total number of the blue spots in all leaf fragments from one plate was used to represent the activity of the GUS gene. The data are presented as the average of three to six experiments, and statistics were obtained from a general linear model, using a square root transform in the SAS-GLM program. Luciferase was measured (42.Ow D. Wood K.V. Deluca M. De Wet J.R. Helinski D.R. Howell S.H. Science. 1986; 234: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) following bombardment and incubation, by grinding soybean leaf fragments from each plate in a chilled mortar with 1.5 ml of buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA). After grinding, the suspension was transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 rpm (SA600 rotor) at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and 100 μl of the supernatant solution were mixed with reagents from the enhanced luciferase assay kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI), as directed by the manufacturer. Another 100 μl of the supernatant solution was used to measure the protein concentration with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The data are presented as the average of three to six experiments, and the data were analyzed with a general linear model, using a square root transform in the SAS-GLM program. Fresh, young soybean leaves (20 g) were collected 2–3 weeks after germination and ground in a chilled mortar with 80 ml of whole cell extraction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and then two layers of Miracloth before transfer of the filtrate to a beaker chilled on ice. 0.1 volume of 5m cold NaCl solution was added dropwise, the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h with slow stirring, and the suspension was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h using a Ti-70 rotor. The supernatant solution was recovered and transferred to a second chilled beaker, to which cold saturated (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 40%, followed by incubation on ice for 1 h. The protein pellet was collected by sedimentation at 40,000 rpm for 30 min and then resuspended in 1 ml of a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KOAc, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by dialysis against 500 ml of the same buffer for 5 h. The insoluble pellet was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 rpm. Aliquots (100 μl) of the supernatant solution were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use (1–2 months). A soybean ferritin promoter probe of 400 bp was prepared from SoF-P304-GUS by the fill-in method with 32P after restriction enzyme digestion with BamHI and PstI overnight at 37 °C (8 μl of DNA, 2 μl of 10× buffer, 1 μl ofBamHI, 1 μl of PstI, 1 μl of bovine serum albumin, 7 μl of H2O) (43.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Wild type and “linker scan mutant” iron regulatory element probes (86 bp) were labeled the same way. Labeled probes were purified by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) and Qiagen gel extraction kit. Various amounts of cell extract were added to 20 μl of binding mix that contained 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 μg of poly(dI/dC) binding mix. Incubation of the mixture at room temperature for 5 min was followed by the addition of 1 μl of labeled DNA (around 10 ng). Further incubation for 20 min was followed by quickly loading the mixture onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Free and bound fractions of DNA were separated by electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer at 140 V for 2 h. The experiments were repeated with two to four independently prepared sets of cell extracts. Total RNA was purified from frozen leaf samples with a Qiagen kit (RNAeasy total RNA). 10 μg of the RNA from soybean leaves were used in hybridization reactions. Denatured RNA (heated at 65 °C for 10 min in 60% formamide, 5% formaldehyde, pH = 7) was fractionated by electrophoresis in formamide, 1% agarose gels and transferred to Duralose-UV membranes. Prehybridization (5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured sheared sperm DNA) was at 62 °C for 2–3 h (36.Ragland M. Theil E.C. Plant Mol. Biology. 1993; 21: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DNA probes were prepared by digesting SoF-IC1 (28.Proudhon D. Wei J., J.F., B. Theil E.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with EcoRI to release the soybean ferritin insert, followed by electrophoresis (1% agarose), purification of the insert (Qiagen gel extraction kit), and labeling with 32P (using the oligolabeling kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); probes were purified by gel filtration (Sephadex G-50). Hybridization, 18 h at 62 °C, was followed by washing in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then at 62 °C. For autoradiography, we used a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the images were analyzed with Imagequant (Molecular Dynamics). The data were averaged from three to six experiments. For image treatment, we used Photoshop 3.0 (Adobe). Fresh leaves (0.2 g) were ground on ice in a chilled mortar with 2 ml of cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% β-mercaptoethanol); cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (SA600 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution (500 μl) was used to measure the iron concentration, after boiling for 30 min in 0.1 m HCl, by forming the Fe(II)-1,10-phenanthroline complex and measuring the absorbance at 510 nm, after neutralization (36.Ragland M. Theil E.C. Plant Mol. Biology. 1993; 21: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The data are presented as the average of two to four experiments. Maximum induction of ferritin expression (50–60-fold increases in ferritin mRNA accumulation) occurred in soybean leaves within 6 h of adding 500 μm ferric citrate to the plants. The high ferritin mRNA concentration persisted for at least 24 h. 3J. Wei and E. C. Theil, unpublished observations. No RNA was isolated from leaves after 24 h because the tissues displayed symptoms of iron toxicity (brown spots, drying). Ferric citrate (1:1) was used as the iron source in the initial studies, since historically it has been the most common agent for inducing ferritin synthesis in plants. Iron overload had been shown to increase ferritin mRNA synthesis 3–5-fold in intact soybean and maize plants (44.Lobreaux S. Hardy T. Briat J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). De-rooted soybean plants used here have been used by many other investigators to eliminate the root barrier and to accelerate iron uptake (45.Lobreaux S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 46.Savino G. Briat J.-F. Lobreaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The wounding of the plantlets due to the cutting of the roots did not itself induce ferritin mRNA accumulation (data not shown). The location of the iron regulatory element in the soybean ferritin gene used a set of promoter fragments linked to a luciferase reporter in plasmid TC14. DNA fragments, representing different sequences upstream from the transcription start site of the soybean ferritin gene determined by primer extension analysis and S1 nuclease mapping, were delivered to soybean leaf sections by particle bombardment, followed by incubation of the leaf sections with or without iron. The results are shown in Fig. 1 A. The 35 S Luc construct, which showed very high luciferase activity (data not shown), also demonstrated that the particle bombardment was effective in delivering the foreign gene into soybean leaf cells. Luciferase activity was observed in SoF-P84, SoF-P156, and SoF-P218 transformed soybean leaves with and without iron, while luciferase activity encoded in SoF-P304, SoF-P600, and SoF-P1900 was easily detectable only after incubation with iron. The effect of iron on expression of luciferase SoF-P304, SoF-P600, and SoF-P1900 was highly significant (confidence level = 99%) when the data were analyzed with a general linear model, using a square root transform in the SAS-GLM program. The sequence of the region studied is shown in Fig. 1 D (28.Proudhon D. Wei J., J.F., B. Theil E.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Attempts to use co-transfection of the tissue with an 35 S GUS construct (PBI221) to quantitate DNA delivery by bombardment failed because the background luminescence in the leaf tissue obscured the signal. Instead, a series of constructs was made with the set of promoter fragments used in the luciferase assay (Fig. 1 B) and the GUS reporter in the PBI221. Expression of GUS was measured histologically. The results for cells in the histological analysis paralleled those obtained using the luciferase reporter on tissue extracts. For example, constitutive expression of the GUS was observed in SoF-P84, SoF-P156, and SoF-P218 with or without iron. Further, GUS expression was greatly decreased in SoF-P304, SoF-P600, and SoF-P1900 in the absence of iron, suggesting that a negative control element exists between 218 and 304 bp upstream from transcription start site. Finally, increased GUS activity with SoF-P304, SoF-P600, and SoF-P1900 in iron-treated leaf fragments suggests that the iron signal derepresses, rather than induces, ferritin gene activity. The ratio of GUS or luciferase activities in iron-treated soybean leaf sections compared with control leaf sections was approximately 1.0 for the 35 S and 84-, 156-, and 218-bp promoter sequences. In contrast, for SoF-P304, the ratio of iron-treatment/control was 13.2 for GUS activity and 6.2 for luciferase activity, emphasizing the importance of the region from bp 218 to 304 in the iron response. The response of the soybean ferritin gene to environmental stimuli appears to be very specific. For example, among the metals tested, at 500 μm (CuCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, and iron citrate) only iron had any effect on soybean leaf ferritin expression (47.Wei J. Ferritin Gene Regulation in Plants. Ph.D. thesis. North Carolina State University, 1998Google Scholar). Salt stress (300 mmNaCl) and drought also had no effect on ferritin expression. An oxidative pathway of ferritin induction has been suggested for maize and Arabidopsis thaliana (30.Briat J.F. Lobreaux S. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2102028715,"Activation of p85/p110 type phosphatidylinositol kinase is essential for aspects of insulin-induced glucose metabolism, including translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface and glycogen synthesis. The enzyme exists as a heterodimer containing a regulatory subunit (e.g. p85α) and one of two widely distributed isoforms of the p110 catalytic subunit: p110α or p110β. In the present study, we compared the two isoforms in the regulation of insulin action. During differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, p110β was up-regulated ∼10-fold, whereas expression of p110α was unaltered. The effects of the increased p110 expression were further assessed by expressing epitope tagged p110β and p110α in 3T3-L1 cells using adenovirus transduction systems, respectively. In vitro, the basal lipid kinase activity of p110β was lower than that of p110α. When p110α and p110β were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, exposing cells to insulin induced each of the subunits to form complexes with p85α and tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 with similar efficiency. However, whereas the kinase activity of p110β, either endogenous or exogeneous, was markedly enhanced by insulin stimulation, only very small increases of the activity of p110α were observed. Interestingly, overexpression of p110β increased insulin-induced glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 cells without significantly affecting basal glucose transport, whereas overexpression of p110α increased both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Finally, microinjection of anti-p110β neutralizing antibody into 3T3-L1 adipocytes abolished insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface almost completely, whereas anti-p110α neutralizing antibody did only slightly. Together, these findings suggest that p110β plays a crucial role in cellular activities evoked acutely by insulin. Activation of p85/p110 type phosphatidylinositol kinase is essential for aspects of insulin-induced glucose metabolism, including translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface and glycogen synthesis. The enzyme exists as a heterodimer containing a regulatory subunit (e.g. p85α) and one of two widely distributed isoforms of the p110 catalytic subunit: p110α or p110β. In the present study, we compared the two isoforms in the regulation of insulin action. During differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, p110β was up-regulated ∼10-fold, whereas expression of p110α was unaltered. The effects of the increased p110 expression were further assessed by expressing epitope tagged p110β and p110α in 3T3-L1 cells using adenovirus transduction systems, respectively. In vitro, the basal lipid kinase activity of p110β was lower than that of p110α. When p110α and p110β were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, exposing cells to insulin induced each of the subunits to form complexes with p85α and tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 with similar efficiency. However, whereas the kinase activity of p110β, either endogenous or exogeneous, was markedly enhanced by insulin stimulation, only very small increases of the activity of p110α were observed. Interestingly, overexpression of p110β increased insulin-induced glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 cells without significantly affecting basal glucose transport, whereas overexpression of p110α increased both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Finally, microinjection of anti-p110β neutralizing antibody into 3T3-L1 adipocytes abolished insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface almost completely, whereas anti-p110α neutralizing antibody did only slightly. Together, these findings suggest that p110β plays a crucial role in cellular activities evoked acutely by insulin. phosphatidylinositol insulin receptor substrate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis multiplicity of infection Activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular activities, including proliferation (1.Evans J.L.

The best known form of PI 3-kinase is p85/p110, which exists as a heterodimer consisting of a regulatory and a catalytic subunit. The regulatory subunit contains two Src homology 2 domains and functions as an adaptor protein transmitting the signal from a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein to the catalytic p110 subunit (16.Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, five isoforms of the regulatory subunit and three isoforms of the catalytic subunit (p110α, p110β, and p110δ) have been identified. The regulatory subunits include two 85-kDa proteins (p85α and p85β) (17.Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M.J. Ruiz-Larrea F. Panayotou G. Thompson A. Dhand R. Hsuan J. Totty N.

This suggests that the different regulatory subunit isoforms function within specific signal transduction pathways induced by various growth factors and hormones. On the other hand, although some reports suggest different roles for p110α and p110β, far less is known about functional differences of the catalytic subunits. Insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is itself sufficient to elicit translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface with a resultant increase in glucose uptake (24.Katagiri H.

In addition, we have observed that expression of 110β is markedly increased in 3T3-L1 cells during their differentiation into adipocytes. The aim of the present study was to better understand the respective roles of the p110α and p110β subunits in the regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism by insulin. This was accomplished by examining the effects of p110 catalytic subunits overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an adenovirus transduction system and by microinjecting neutralizing anti-p110α and anti-p110β antibodies into the cells. PI, PI 4-phosphate, PI 4,5-bisphosphate, and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma; 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 2-deoxy-d-glucose were from WAKO (Osaka, Japan); the ECL detection system was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; [γ-32P]ATP and 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose were from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents from commercial sources were of analytical grade. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Ab) 4G10 and anti-p85 antiserum were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-GLUT4 Ab was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). The anti-p110α and anti-p110β Abs were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 1048–1068 of the p110α protein and to residues 1039–1070 of the p110β protein, respectively. These Abs were affinity-purified on Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) columns to which the corresponding peptides had been coupled. They were then extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Abs raised against IRS-1 and the C-terminal GLUT2 tag were prepared as described previously (24.Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol.

Two days after the fibroblasts reached confluence, differentiation was induced by incubating them for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 4 mg/ml dexamethasone, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Thereafter, the cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, which was renewed every other day. The cells were infected with the indicated adenoviruses on day 4 after inducing differentiation, and the experiments were conducted on day 6 when >90% of cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype and GLUT4 was almost fully expressed. Cloning and construct reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out on human embryonic heart cDNA; the cDNA encoding p110β was amplified based on its reported sequence (28.Hu P. Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), yielding its entire coding region. The coding region of p110α cDNA was obtained as described in our previous paper (24.Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16987-16990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A portion of human GLUT2 cDNA corresponding to residues 510–524 was then ligated to p110α and to p110β, generating PI kinase catalytic subunits that were tagged at their C termini (24.Katagiri H.

The entire coding regions of p110α and p110β, along with the GLUT2 epitope tag, were cloned into the expression cosmid cassette pAdexCAwt. Recombinant adenoviruses were obtained by homologous recombination of those cosmids and the parental virus genome as described previously (24.Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y.

Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton, 0.35 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm sodium vanadate, after which the lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g and 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies, after which protein A-Sepharose was added. The immune complexes were then collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS containing 1% Triton, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with an ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, band intensities were quantitated using a Molecular Imager GS-525 (Bio-Rad). PI 3-kinase assays were carried out using transduced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes plated in 24-well culture dishes were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with or without selected concentrations of insulin for 5 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.35 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm sodium vanadate. Cell lysates were cleared of insoluble materials by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and immunoprecipitated with the indicated Ab and protein A-Sepharose. PI 3-kinase activities in the immunoprecipitates were measured as described previously (24.Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16987-16990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) using PI as a substrates. The results were quantitated with Fuji BAS2000 (Tokyo, Japan). 3T3-L1 adipocytes plated in 24-well culture dishes were serum-starved as indicated above, after which they were incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer for an additional 45 min prior to incubation with or without 10−7minsulin for 15 min. The assay was initiated by adding 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (0.5 mCi/sample, 0.1 mmol) and was terminated 4 min later by washing the cells once with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 0.3 mmphloretin and then twice with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 0.1% SDS, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinized, reseeded onto acid-washed glass coverslips, and then incubated in serum-free DMEM for 3 h. Microinjection of the affinity-purified anti-p110 Abs or control rabbit IgG at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in PBS was carried out using a semiautomated Eppendorf microinjection system with an injection pressure of 100 hectopascals and an injection time of 0.8 s. The injection volume is approximately 10% of the cell volume under these conditions. In each experiment, 200–250 cells were microinjected with each anti-p110α, anti-p110β Ab, or control rabbit IgG. After microinjection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with/without insulin for 15 min. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared by sonication as described previously (29.Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Adherent plasma membrane were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal anti-GLUT4 Ab followed by fluorescein-conjugated, anti-mouse IgG secondary Ab. The intensity of fluorescence from GLUT4 on the plasma membrane of each cell was analyzed using Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). The quantitation was carried out based on the statistical analysis from approximately 100 cells for each injected Ab. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes was induced as described under “Materials and Methods,” and expression of p110α and p110β, along with that of C/EBPα and GLUT4 as differentiation markers, was measured by immunoblotting using their specific Abs, respectively. To avoid influences from cell division after induction, each sample was normalized by protein contents. As shown in Fig. 1, C/EBPα was detected from Day 2, showed maximum expression on Day 4 and continued to express at a high level (Fig. 1 A). GLUT4 could be detected from Day 2, and its expression level continued to increase (Fig. 1 B). Expression level of p110α was unchanged during the differentiation (Fig. 1 C). On the other hand, although the expression of p110β was under detectable level before induction, it could be detected from Day 2 and continued to increase significantly during differentiation, of which the time course was very similar to that of GLUT4 expression (Fig. 1 D). p110α or p110β was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by using recombinant adenovirus such that similar levels of p110α and p110β proteins were expressed (Fig.2 A, top panel). From the optical density of the blots, the degree to which p110α and p110β were overexpressed was calculated to be approximately 8-fold over their endogenous expression levels in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig.2 A, middle and bottom panels). Overexpressed p110α and p110β were not recognized by the anti-p110β and anti-p110α Abs, respectively (Fig. 2 A,middle and bottom panels), indicating that these antibodies are highly specific for their corresponding isoforms. The association of the overexpressed p110α and p110β isoforms with the p85α regulatory subunit was shown by the presence of p85α in the respective immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 B). p110α and p110β exhibited a very similar binding ability with the regulatory subunit, p85α, in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, it was also revealed that IRS-1, which was tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound to p85α in the presence of insulin, complexed with p110α or p110β with equal efficiency (Fig. 2 C). Thus, it appears that p110α and p110β are not different in regard to their molecular association with the regulatory subunit or with IRS-1. To compare PI 3-kinase activities of p110α and p110β, either catalytic subunit was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-GLUT2 tag Ab (Fig. 3 A). Without insulin stimulation, overexpressed p110α exhibited 34-fold higher PI 3-kinase activity as compared with overexpressed p110β, despite these catalytic subunits having similar affinity for p85α, as shown in Fig.2 B. The concentration response curves for endogenous p110α and p110β were next investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 B, insulin-stimulated lipid kinase activity in the p110β immunoprecipitate was increased as much as 3.4-fold over basal activity in the absence of insulin. In contrast, insulin stimulation increased the kinase activity in the p110α immunoprecipitate by only about 60%. When the two catalytic subunits were then overexpressed using the adenovirus expression system, the kinase activity in the p110β immunoprecipitates from the cells overexpressing p110β were insulin-dependently increased as much as ∼19-fold (Fig.3 C), whereas the kinase activity in the p110α immunoprecipitate from the cells overexpressing p110α was unaffected. To avoid any effect caused by using different Abs, anti-p110α and anti-p110β, for immunoprecipitation, overexpressed p110α or p110β were immunoprecipitated by anti-GLUT2 tag Ab (Fig. 3 D). Essentially the same results were obtained, clearly indicating that PI 3-kinase activity catalyzed by p110β is highly insulin-sensitive, whereas the activity catalyzed by p110α is not. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were subjected to various multiplicities of infection (M.O.I.) with p110α, p110β, or control Lac-Z adenovirus, and the resulting effects on glucose transport were assessed. Infection with less than 250 M.O.I. of Lac-Z adenovirus had no affect on glucose transport into 3T3-L1 cells in either the absence or presence of insulin (Fig.4, upper panel). Overexpression of p110α increased basal as well as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a M.O.I-dependent manner, which confirms the findings in our previous report (24.Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16987-16990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, despite the fact that overexpression of p110β did not significantly affect basal uptake, it increased the insulin-stimulated glucose transport as much as 2-fold over control. The lower panel in Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the degree of overexpression of each catalytic subunit and the basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into the cells. Note that overexpression of p110α increased both basal and insulin-stimulated uptake, whereas overexpression of p110β increased only the stimulated uptake. After confirming the specificity of the anti-p110α and anti-p110β Abs (Fig. 2 A), we found that these Abs exert inhibitory effects on their corresponding isoforms. The anti-p110α Ab drastically reduced the lipid kinase activity of p110α by 96–99% (30.Hooshmand-Rad R. Hajkova L. Klint P. Karlsson R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the Ab raised against residues 1039–1070 of p110β protein reduced the lipid kinase activity by approximately 98% based on the same method as that used for anti-p110α Ab (data not shown). To analyze the isoform-specific functions of endogenously expressed p110α and p110β, inhibitory anti-p110α or anti-p110β Ab was microinjected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, followed by membrane sheet assay. Microinjection of control rabbit IgG had no effect on insulin-induced translocation of the GLUT4 transporter to the cell surface (Fig. 5,A and B). Microinjection of either anti-p110α or anti-p110β Ab into cells had no effect on GLUT4 localization in the basal state (data not shown). Microinjection of anti-p110α Ab attenuated insulin-evoked GLUT4 translocation by approximately 25% (Fig. 5 C; also quantified in Fig. 5 E). In contrast, microinjection of anti-p110β Ab inhibited insulin-evoked GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface by approximately 94% (Fig.5 D; also quantified in Fig. 5 E). p85/p110 type PI kinase has been implicated in a wide range of cellular activities, including control of proliferation (1.Evans J.L.

Most of these findings have been derived from experiments in which lipid kinase activity was diminished by antagonists such as wortmannin and LY294002 or by microinjection or overexpression of a dominant negative p85α mutant that binds to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins but lacks a p110 binding site. More recent studies entailing overexpression of constitutively active p110α or GLUT2-tagged p110α have shown that elevation of this lipid kinase activity is itself sufficient to induce some of these cellular activities, including translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporter and activation of an intracellular signaling pathway known to mediate proliferation (24.Katagiri H.

The aim of the present study was to better understand regulation of the PI kinase activities associated with two isoforms of its catalytic subunit, p110α and p110β, and to assess how regulatory differences might influence the cellular effects of insulin. In fact, during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, in which they acquire insulin-induced glucose uptake, expression of p110α is unchanged, whereas that of p110β is markedly up-regulated (Fig. 1). On the basis of in vitro PI 3-kinase assays of p110α and p110β expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, basal p110β activity is substantially lower than that of p110α (Fig. 3 A). However, p110β appears to be highly insulin-sensitive, whereas p110α was activated only slightly by insulin (Fig. 3, B–D). Although the two isoforms bind to p85α and to IRS-1 with similar efficiency (Fig. 2,B and C), by these bindings, p110β may change its conformation more dramatically than does p110α. Such a difference may be attributable to isoform specific binding of p110 to unknown molecules, although further investigations are required. It should be noted, however, that each isoform-specific anti-p110 Abs markedly inhibited PI kinase activity of p110α or p110β (30.Hooshmand-Rad R. Hajkova L. Klint P. Karlsson R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, because the lipid kinase activity of p110 incubated with each concentration of insulin should be similarly inhibited, it still seems reasonable to conclude that the p110β isoform is a highly insulin-sensitive form of the catalytic subunit, whereas the p110α isoform is a rather insulin-insensitive form. In addition, we can speculate the reason why the insulin-induced response of endogenous p110β was lower than that obtained from the experiment using overexpressed p110β. In the plain or Lac-Z expressing 3T3-L1 cells, p85α is present as a heterodimer with endogeneous p110α or p110β. Because IRS-1 possesses four potential binding sites for the Src homology 2 domain of p85α and thus can bind to two molecules of p85α, a detectable amount of p110α was co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-p110β antibody in the insulin-stimulated condition, although this amount was small (data not shown). This co-immunoprecipitated “low-insulin responsive” p110α is likely to reduce the insulin responsiveness of the anti-p110β immunoprecipitate as compared with the control 3T3-L1 cells. In case of p110β-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells, most p85α is occupied by overexpressed p110β, and the amount of p110α bound with p85α is much smaller than in control cells, and thus the effect of co-immunoprecipitated p110α becomes much smaller. Earlier reports have suggested that different p110 catalytic subunit isoforms have distinct functions. For example, the p110α subunit is involved in platelet-derived growth factor- and epidermal growth factor-mediated mitogenic responses, but not in responses mediated by bombesin or lysophosphatidic acid (33.Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In contrast, p110β is apparently necessary for insulin- and lysophosphatidic acid-mediated mitogenic responses but not platelet-derived growth factor-mediated responses (34.Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in response to insulin stimulation, p110β but not p110α associates with the GLUT4 glucose transporter compartment (35.Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the previous studies showing that overexpressed p110α induces GLUT4 translocation may not directly indicate the importance of p110α itself, because these membrane-targeted or constitutively active forms of p110α are considered to function in all of the membrane fractions but are not limited to the membrane of a specific compartment. Such an ectopic expression of p110α, which is always active even without insulin stimulation, might have brought insulin-independent phosphoinositide production at a place where phosphoinositide is critical to cause GLUT4 translocation. Because p110β seems to require insulin stimulation to be an active form, overexpression of p110β without insulin treatment might not cause translocation of GLUT4. Thus, it seems very likely that both subcellular localization of the enzyme and kinetics of the kinase activity are key factors in determining the specific functions of the various PI kinase isoforms. Taking into consideration that both the subcellular localization and kinetics of p110 may influence cellular function, we tried to determine which endogenous catalytic subunit, p110α or p110β, is involved in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, by microinjecting isoform-specific anti-p110 to neutralize activities of each p110 (Fig. 5). The neutralizing antibodies used in this study were highly isoform-specific and very strongly inhibited the lipid kinase activity of the corresponding isoform. The obtained data clearly suggested that p110β plays a major role in transmitting the signals to translocate GLUT4. On the other hand, the contribution of p110α to insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation is likely to be relatively small. To date, some evidence has been obtained suggesting that high levels of basal PI 3-kinase activity associated with p110 may be important for prevention of apoptosis. On the other hand, acute cellular activities rapidly evoked by growth factors or hormones may require a large increase in PI kinase activity against a background of low basal activity. In this way, maintenance of the appropriate levels of basal and stimulated PI kinase activities may be governed by the ratio of the expressions of the p110α and p110β isoforms. We therefore speculate that PI kinase activity derived from p110α functions mainly in carrying out such “housekeeping” activities as prevention of apoptosis and sustaining basal glucose uptake, whereas p110β plays a crucial role in carrying out cellular responses to insulin and possibly other hormones as well. This is the first report differentiating the two isoforms of the PI kinase catalytic subunit as regards regulation of basal and insulin-stimulated lipid kinase activity and glucose transport. The respective roles played by p110α and p110β may be applicable to the signal transduction cascades activated not only by insulin but also by other growth factors. In addition, we have recently reported that p85/p110 type PI kinase phosphorylates both the D-3 and the D-4 position of the inositol ring in vivo (36.Funaki M. Katagiri H. Kanda A. Anai M. Nawano M.

In this report, it was shown that p110β exhibits a higher ratio of PI 4-kinase activity/PI 3-kinase activity than p110α. Additional studies will be required before a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the localization and regulation of p110 activities under basal and stimulated conditions can be obtained.

Similar structural changes have been observed in the switch regions of Ha-Ras bound to its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos.

The Rho family members, including Rac and Cdc42, regulate a wide spectrum of cellular processes, including regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion, smooth muscle contraction, cell morphology, cell motility, neurite outgrowth/retraction, cytokinesis, and phagocytosis (for review see Refs. 1.Aelst L.V.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Like all members of the Ras superfamily, RHOA functions as a molecular switch, cycling an active GTP- and an inactive GDP-bound state. Extensive structural studies have shown that large conformational changes occur between the two states in two regions, designated switch I and switch II. These switch regions play important roles in interactions with downstream targets to transduce signals. The GTP/GDP cycle is regulated by accessory proteins such as GTPase-activating proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs).1 The active GTP-bound form is converted to the GDP-bound form by its intrinsic GTPase activity, and GTPase-activating protein often dramatically enhances the rate of GTP hydrolysis. In contrast, the inactive GDP-bound form is turned on by GEF that accelerates the exchange of GTP for GDP. Crystallographic studies of GEF-small G protein complexes (4.Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 5.Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) have shown that GEFs induce the GDP/GTP exchange through transient disruption of the Mg2+ coordination in the nucleotide-binding pocket while stabilizing a nucleotide-free and cation-free conformation. Mg2+ is an essential cofactor for not only small GTPases but also other GTPases. In the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of the small GTPases, Mg2+ is coordinated in an octahedral arrangement with a high (nanomolar range) and moderate affinity (micromolar range), respectively (6.John J.

Although the conformational changes of small GTPases between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms have been extensively studied, little is known about the structures of the Mg2+-free forms. Biochemical data indicate that the dissociation of Mg2+ leads to a large conformational change (7.Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20470-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11.Pan J.Y. Sanford J.C. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have reported the structure of Cdc42 complexed with GDPNH2, a hydrolyzed product of GppNHp. This structure has been shown to be a Mg2+-free form, but the switch regions are invisible, and GDPNH2 is not a natural ligand. We report here the crystal structure of the Mg2+-free form of GDP-bound RHOA at 2.0-Å resolution. The Mg2+-free GDP-bound structure of RHOA shows large conformational changes; these changes are especially large in the switch I region, which is distinct from both structures of the GDP/Mg2+-bound (13.Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This structure indicates an intrinsic ability of switch I to fold into an open conformation in the absence of Mg2+. The structural changes have several similarities with those of Ha-Ras bound to its GEF, Sos (4.Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). This structure reveals an important regulatory role for Mg2+ and suggests that GEF might make use of this intrinsic ability of switch I in GDP/GTP exchange. The cloning, expression, and purification of the dominantly active form of recombinant human RHOA, a mutant in which glycine 14 is replaced by valine (RHOAVal-14, hereafter referred to as RHOA), complexed with GDP and Mg2+, were carried out according to the methods described previously (14.Ihara K.

In brief, a truncated (residues 1–181 out of 194) RHOA was cloned into the vector plasmid pRSET B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), expressed as a His-tagged protein, and purified by column chromatography using HiTrap chelating (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the Ni2+ ion. To separate the GDP-bound form from the GTP-bound form, further purification was carried out using HiTrap Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), an anion exchanger, yielding RHOA complexed with GDP as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein solution was concentrated by Centricon-10 (Amicon Inc.) for crystallization to about 6 mg/ml. The resulting sample, used in this study, was verified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (LMS-ELITE, PerSeptive Diagnostics) and N-terminal analysis (M492, Applied Biosystems), which showed spontaneous truncation of N-terminal His tag during the preparation (14.Ihara K.

Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method from solutions containing 3 mg/ml RHOA-GDP, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm citrate, pH 5.5, 0.6 mLi2SO4, 5% Polyethylene Glycol-400 equilibrated against 100 mm citrate, pH 5.5, 1.2m Li2SO4, and 10% Polyethylene Glycol-400. Typically, crystals grew to 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm in a week. The crystals were found to diffract up to 1.9-Å resolution and to belong to space group P41212 or P43212 (a =b = 91.2 Å, c = 56.5 Å), with a Vm value (15.Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab The initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (16.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) using a search model based on the structure of human RHOAAsn-25-GDP-Mg2+ (PDB code 1FTN; see Ref.13.Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These calculations used the reflections from 6 to 3 Å, and the radius of integration was 20 Å. AMoRe gave the highest correlation coefficient (0.457) and the lowest R factor (0.460) when the crystal belonged to P43212. The second highest correlation coefficient and the second lowestR factor were 0.340 and 0.495, respectively. After optimization of the highest solution by a simultaneous six-dimensional search, we obtained a rotational matrix of α = 77.71°, β = 56.59°, and γ = 140.20° with Eulerian angles and a translational matrix of x = 0.9141, y= 0.7042, and z = 0.2976 with the fractions of unit cell axes. This optimization led to a correlation coefficient of 0.628 and an R factor of 0.40. The initial electron density map using phases of the starting model showed three large discrepancies around the switch I and II regions and a 13-residue insertion helix unique to the Rho family. These three regions were inspected on the resulting 2F o − F c and omit maps that were generated with the program O (17.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaad M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The structure was built and refined by the method of simulated annealing through alternating cycles using the program O and CNS (18.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P.

After several cycles of refinement and incorporating solvent water molecules using the diffraction data between 100 and 2.0 Å, we were able to obtain a reliable enough structure with an R work factor of 20.1% and an R free factor of 25.2%. The GDP molecule was clearly observed in its omit map, but no Mg2+ion was observed in this omit map or in the final 2F o − F c map. Since three N-terminal residues were disordered, no model was built for these regions. A summary of the refinement statistics are presented in TableI. The structure consists of one RHOA molecule of 179 residues, one GDP, and 187 water molecules. The side chains of Leu-69, Arg-128, and Glu-142 are poorly defined in the current structure and are replaced by alanines. There are no residues in disallowed regions as defined in PROCHECK (19.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and 93.0% of all residues are in most favored regions and 7.0% are in additional allowed regions. The structure was inspected and illustrated using the program O, MOLSCRIPT (20.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) rendered with RASTER3D (21.Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar), and GRASP (22.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (1DPF). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Hitachi model F-4500 spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and emission data between 300 and 400 nm were collected at room temperature. Fluorescence emissions of the purified GDP-bound form of RHOA were measured both in solution A (50 mm citrate, 1 m Li2SO4, pH 5.5) and solution B (50 mm acetate, 1 m KCl, pH 5.5). The protein concentration was 0.56 μm. Changes in the emission spectra induced by the addition of 5 mmEDTA or 100 mm Mg2+ were also monitored. The tertiary fold of the Mg2+-free GDP-bound form of RHOA (hereafter referred to as the Mg2+-free form) (Fig.1 a) is very similar to that of the GDP/Mg2+-bound form of RHOA (the GDP/Mg2+-bound form) and the GTPγS/Mg2+-bound form of RHOA (the GTPγS/Mg2+-bound form), consisting of six β-strands (B1–B6), five α-helices (A1, A3, A3′, A4, and A5), and three short 310-helices (H1–H3), although one 310-helix (H1) at the switch II region is collapsed in the Mg2+-free form. Comparisons of the coordinates of the GDP/Mg2+-bound form (PDB code 1FTN) and the GTPγS/Mg2+-bound form (PDB code 1A2B) with the Mg2+-free form show a small root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of ∼0.5 Å for the Cα carbon atoms, excluding the two switch regions, its flanking region, and the 13-residue insertion helix that is characteristic of the Rho family. In contrast, superposition of all the Cα carbon atoms of the current model on the GDP/Mg2+-bound and GTPγS/Mg2+-bound forms resulted in r.m.s. deviations of 3.3 and 3.6 Å, respectively. These large deviations are primarily due to differences in the switch I region (Figs. 1 b and 2). Compared with the GDP/Mg2+-bound form, the switch I region (28–44) has an average displacement of 8.7 Å for Cα carbons, with the largest displacement of 19 Å being located at Val-33. Other segments displaying large conformational changes are the switch II region and the insertion helix, with average displacements of 3.6 and 1.3 Å for the Cα carbons, respectively.Figure 2A histogram showing the distances of the corresponding Cα carbon atoms between the RHOAVal-14-Mg2+-free and GDP/Mg2+-bound forms. Large deviations are located in switch I, switch II, and the 13-residue insertion helix. Residues 64–66 are missing because the regions are disordered in the GDP/Mg2+-bound form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Extensive structural studies of small GTPases have provided a wealth of information on the octahedral coordination of a single Mg2+ion in the guanine nucleotide-binding pocket in both the GDP/Mg2+-bound and GTP/Mg2+-bound forms. However, there is no Mg2+ ion in the current structure. Fig. 3 shows an omit map for GDP around the nucleotide-binding site. The electron density clearly shows the GDP molecule, but no density was identified that could be interpreted as a Mg2+ ion. Since removal of Mg2+ leads to a change in fluorescence intensity in Ras (6.John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rab (7.Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), tryptophan fluorescence emissions were measured to verify the Mg2+-unbound state of the RHOA-GDP complex (Fig.4). In solution A, which is similar to the crystallization conditions, the addition of EDTA caused no significant change. In contrast, as a reference, the spectrum changed in solution B after the addition of EDTA. The re-addition of Mg2+ to both solutions led to a change of fluorescence. These results indicate that no Mg2+ ion was bound to the RHOA-GDP complex in solution A, implying that RHOA was in a Mg2+-free state under the crystallization conditions. The Mg2+ dissociation from RHOA seems to be caused by Li2SO4 at high concentrations. No such effect was observed for KCl at 1 m concentration (Fig. 4). The lack of Mg2+ leads to significant changes in the GDP-protein and water molecule interactions (Fig.5). There are no direct or water-mediated interactions between switch I and the nucleotide. Lys-18, which recognizes the β-phosphate group and the water molecule in the GDP/Mg2+-bound form, forms a salt bridge with Glu-64. Residues in switch I including Thr-37 do not participate in this recognition due to the large conformational change. Three water molecules are coordinated to the Mg2+ ion in the GDP/Mg2+-bound form, but two of these are missing in the current form. It is of interest that, as in the Ras-Sos complex, Ala-61 occupies the position of one of the missing water molecules (see “Discussion”). In contrast, the guanine base and ribose are recognized in a similar manner to both the GDP/Mg2+-bound and GTPγS/Mg2+-bound forms (Fig. 5). Three additional water molecules are observed. Two are hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate group, and the other interacts with 3-OH of the ribose. Val-35 in the GDP/Mg2+-bound form occupies the position of one of the additional water molecules coordinated to the phosphate, whereas this residue of the current structure is located far away. The glycosyl conformation of GDP is anti with a C2′-endo sugar pucker; this structure is basically identical to the sugar conformations of GDP and GTPγS complexed with RHOA in the Mg2+-bound states. Compared with the GDP/Mg2+-bound form, the nucleotide of the current structure seems to be less tightly bound to RHOA because of the lack of several contacts including coordination to the Mg2+ ion. In the case of Rab (7.Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20470-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the removal of Mg2+ leads to a significant increase (∼1000-fold) in the dissociation rate of the bound nucleotide, whereas the association rate does not change significantly (24.Rensland H. Lautwein A. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11181-11185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This phenomenon coincides with the decreased contacts observed in the current Mg2+-free form. Moreover, the averaged B factor (23.9 Å2) of the nucleotide is somewhat higher than that of the protein atoms (20.7 Å2) in the Mg2+-free form, whereas the former (29.1 Å2) is lower than the latter (16.7 Å2) in the GDP/Mg2+-bound form. These findings also indicate that GDP is loosely bound in the Mg2+-free form. The most notable feature of the current structure is the drastic conformational changes in the switch I region caused by the lack of a Mg2+ ion. The switch I regions in both the GDP/Mg2+-bound and GTPγS/Mg2+-bound forms normally rise up from the end of helix A1 toward the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) to sandwich the nucleotide. However, in the Mg2+-free form, switch I is completely removed from the nucleotide-binding site and cannot participate in nucleotide recognition (Fig. 1, b andc). The electron density around switch I is well defined, and the averaged B factor is relatively low (19.2 Å2) compared with that of the GDP/Mg2+-bound form (31.4 Å2). The large conformational difference is derived from a hinge motion localized around Asn-28, which is located at the N terminus of switch I. The torsion angle (φ,ϕ) = (65.9° and 23.4°) in the GDP/Mg2+-bound form is changed to (φ,ϕ) = (−78.5° and −9.1°) in the Mg2+-free form. The large Δφ of 144° leads to a sharp turn of switch I to open the nucleotide-binding site. Large torsion angle differences also occur around residues 42 and 43 at the C terminus of switch I with a Δφ of 40 to 60°. The peptide bond at Pro-31 is converted to thecis-form to make a sharp turn. In the switch I region, Gln-29 makes contact with Tyr-42 and Asp-45 of strand B2. In addition, a hydrophobic core, which consists of Lys-27, Val-35, Pro-36, and Phe-39, stabilizes the switch I conformation (Fig.6). The switch I regions in the Mg2+-free and GDP/Mg2+-bound forms protrude toward the solvent region with similar accessible surface areas, although the orientations are significantly different. It may be possible to fix the conformation of switch I by crystal packing. However, switch I does not have extensive contact with the symmetry-related molecules. The residues around the edges of switch I are involved in the crystal packing, but the contact areas are similar to that of the GDP/Mg2+-bound form (∼600 Å2). The switch II region is in general disordered in the GDP-bound forms of small GTPases due to the lack of a γ-phosphate group. In fact, residues 63–65 of switch II cannot be modeled into electron density in the GDP/Mg2+-bound form of RHOA (13.Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GTPγS/Mg2+-bound form of the dominantly active RHOAVal-14 (14.Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) shows a clear density around the switch II region due to the contacts among the bulky side chain of Val-14 in the P-loop, and Gly-62 and Gln-63 in switch II in addition to the water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the γ-phosphate group. In the current Mg2+-free form, the electron density is well defined around this region with an averaged B factor (21.8 Å2). In addition to the Lys-18 to Glu-64 contact, Val-14 probably makes contact with Glu-64 in a similar way to that in the GTPγS/Mg2+-bound form. The crystal packing is unlikely to alter significantly the stability of the conformation, since the contact area is very small (∼240 Å2). One 310-helix (H1) is converted to a β-turn, whereas the two 310-helices, H2 and H3, are retained. Compared with the GDP/Mg2+-bound form, the structural changes occur around Thr-60, which is the starting residue of switch II with a Δϕ of 165°. We have for the first time visualized the structure of the Mg2+-free form of the small GTPases bound to GDP, and we have shown that the loss of Mg2+ induces the large conformational changes. In general, switch regions are intrinsically mobile. For example, even the active form of Rac1 shows poor density around switch I (25.Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The absence of Mg2+ state would enhance the mobility of the switch I region. Moreover, this structural feature allows a comparison with the structure of the conformation of Ras complexed with the Cdc25 domain of Son of sevenless (Sos) which is a Ras-GEF (4.Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) in which the Ras structure exhibits a cation-free form and large conformational changes in the switch regions. GEFs for the Rho family GTPases share a common sequence motif, designated as the Dbl homology domain (26.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). They have a helical domain like Sos Cdc25. Moreover, the structure of the Dbl homology domain, together with sequence and NMR spectroscopic and mutational analysis (27.Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28.Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schunuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A.

Zheng Y. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1098-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), leads us to suggest that a conserved helix may contain a Rho- or Rac-binding site similar to that offered to Ras by the H helix of Sos and that the nucleotide exchange mechanism is similar in the Rho and Ras families. Therefore, it is reasonable to compare the Ras structure in the Ras-Sos complex with the current Mg2+-free form of RHOA. One striking similarity between Ras bound to Sos and the current RHOA structure is that switch I of both structures is far from the nucleotide-binding site that opens the pocket (Fig. 1, b andc). The large hinge motion of the Ras switch I in the transformation to the open form is derived from a change in the torsion angle localized at the N terminus of switch I similar to that occurring in RHOA. The torsion angle of Asn-26 in Ras (Asp-28 in RHOA) changes dramatically, with a Δφ of 140°. Strikingly similar interactions are also observed in both structures. In the Ras-Sos complex, Glu-60 in switch II is hydrogen-bonded to the amide nitrogen of Gly-62 and forms a salt bridge with Lys-16 in the P-loop that is a crucial phosphate ligand. In the Mg2+-free form of RHOA, the same contact occurs as described previously: Glu-64 (Glu-62 in Ras) comes into contact with Lys-18 (Lys-16 in Ras) and Gly-62. It should be noted that these three residues (Lys, Glu, and Gly) are completely conserved among the Rho family and Ras. Moreover, Ala-61 in the Mg2+-free form is near the Mg2+-binding site similar to Ala-59 in the Ras-Sos complex, with Ala-59 being thrust into the phosphate- and Mg2+-binding sites (Fig. 3). It is of particular interest that the overall conformation of the switch II region is quite similar. The superposition of the two switch II regions yields an r.m.s. deviation of only 1.0 Å for the Cα carbons. Both of these regions form β-turns as a result of conformational change. GEFs has been assumed to promote GDP dissociation from its GTPase by disrupting the Mg2+ coordination (for review see Refs. 30.Sprang S.R. Coleman D.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31.Pan J.Y. Wessling-Resnick M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32.Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Actually, in the Ras-Sos complex, a hydrophobic residue blocks the Mg2+-binding site, and an acidic residue displaces the α-phosphate group of GDP. GEF also stabilizes the nucleotide- and cation-free conformation by tightly holding the switch II region. Taking these observations into account, the crystal structure of the Mg2+-free form suggests that the disruption of Mg2+ coordination induces a large conformational change to prepare a template for GEF binding. Several lines of evidence support our idea. RasS17N (33.Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Rab3AT17N (34.Burstein E.S. Brondyk W.H. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22715-22718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RanT24N (35.Kornbluth S. Dasso M. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (corresponding to Thr-19 in Rho) mutants have been shown to have a much higher affinity for their respective GEFs than their wild-type forms. These mutants have a weak affinity for Mg2+ because mutated amino acids are critical for Mg2+ coordination. p21RAS has a 13-fold greater affinity for GTP than GDP in solutions containing low Mg2+ concentrations, whereas the affinities of the protein for GTP and GDP are approximately the same at high Mg2+ concentrations (9.Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results also suggest that the open conformation is produced at low Mg2+concentrations and that the dissociation of the Mg2+ ion from p21RAS is a critical step in GDP dissociation. Clearly, the role of Mg2+ for GDP binding is the stabilization of the GDP-binding state, since it is known that physiological (mm) levels of Mg2+ inhibit GDP dissociation in various small GTPases including Rho (31.Pan J.Y. Wessling-Resnick M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the chelation of Mg2+ results in an increased rate of GDP dissociation and allows exchange with exogenous nucleotides (9.Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of GDP/Mg2+-bound form in RHOA clearly shows that Mg2+ coordinates directly with the β-phosphates of GDP and Thr-37 (13.Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and its features are consistent with the highly conserved Mg2+ coordination among other small GTPases (for review see Ref. 36.Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent structural studies of Rac or Cdc42 complexed with its guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors also provide a dissociation inhibitory mechanism based on the stabilization of the Mg2+ binding (37.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 38.Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As a consequence, absence of Mg2+ leads to a drastic decrease for GDP binding affinity (9.Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.John J. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11792-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and large conformational change (23.Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the nucleotide exchange mechanisms described in the Ras-Sos and Arf1-Gea2 complexes share similarities, in that GEFs engage switch II extensively and induce a large conformational change in switch I to open up the nucleotide-binding site, Arf1-Gea2 is less similar to the Mg2+-free form of RHOA than the Ras-Sos complex. For example, Lys-30 in Arf1 (Lys-18 in Rho) makes contact with Glu from Gea2. This difference is probably due to the catalytic domains of the different classes of GEFs sharing no sequence homology and being structurally unrelated, and it may be a distinctive feature in the nucleotide exchange mechanism. In contrast to small GTPases, some structures of Mg2+-free forms in GTPases have been reported. The structure of a heterotrimeric GTPase α-subunit has been determined in a GDP-bound form complexed with Mg2+ (39.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) but also without Mg2+ (40.Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric G proteins do not necessarily require Mg2+in order to bind GDP or to form complexes with Gβγ, since the helical domain is thought to act as a barrier to GDP release. Significant conformational changes in switch I have not been observed, and switch II is disordered in the Giα1-GDP complex (40.Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), whereas both regions are well ordered in the Gtα-GDP-Mg2+ complex (39.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The structure of the EF-G-GDP complex (41.Al-Karadaghi S. Aevarsson A. Garber A. Zheltonosova J. Liljas A. Structure. 1996; 4: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) also shows that the complex is formed without Mg2+ binding. EF-G binds weakly to GDP and appears to undergo nucleotide exchange without the need for an exchange factor. Recently, three forms, Mg2+-GDP, GDP, and apo (GDP- and Mg2+-free), of signal recognition particle GTPase have been determined by x-ray crystallography (42.Freymann D.M. Keenan R.J. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 43.Freymann D.M. Keenan R.J. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nature. 1997; 385: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This protein also does not require a separate nucleotide exchange factor, since the signal recognition particle GTPases have a low affinity for GDP in vitro. Freymann et al. (42.Freymann D.M. Keenan R.J. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have proposed that these three structures suggest a pathway for the stepwise release of Mg2+ and GDP; first, Mg2+ is released and then the release of GDP occurs. It is of interest that upon the release of the Mg2+ ion, Lys-111 (Lys-18 in Rho and Lys-16 in Ras), which is coordinated to the β-phosphate group, forms a salt bridge with Asp-187 in motif III which corresponds to switch II of small GTPases. It is assumed that GEFs activate GTPases through the disruption of Mg2+ coordination. It is possible that GEFs can catch a protein in the Mg2+-free state that is spontaneously dissociated, since Mg2+ has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant in the micromolar range and is in fast equilibrium with the solvent. We thank Dr. Goldberg for providing the coordinates of Arf1/Gea2."

Conserved region II of HNF3β (amino acids 361–388) is responsible for the interaction with TLE1. A mammalian two-hybrid assay was used to confirm that this interaction occurs in vivo. Overexpression of TLE1 in HepG2 and HeLa cells decreases transactivation mediated through the C-terminal domain of HNF3β, and Grg5, a naturally occurring dominant negative form of Groucho/TLE, also increases the transcriptional activity of this region of HNF3.

The HNF3 family of proteins is also involved in the hormonal control of hepatic gene expression. For instance, HNF3 serves as an accessory factor for glucocorticoid-mediated transcription of the hepatic PEPCK, tyrosine aminotransferase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 genes (7.Zimmermann P.L.

The HNF3 proteins are pleiotropic transcription factors, and the isoforms have selective effects. These proteins are expressed in tissues other than the liver, such as the pancreas and lung, where they are involved in establishing tissue-specific gene transcription (11.Wu K.L. Gannon M.

For example, mice homozygous for a null mutation in HNF3α have reduced islet glucagon gene expression, but the genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis are not affected, suggesting a specific role of HNF3α in the pancreas (6.Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HNF3 family members also play an important role in development. HNF3α and HNF3β are required for normal mesoderm and neural axis formation (15.Ang S.L. Rossant J. Cell. 1994; 78: 561-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Mice lacking HNF3β do not have a properly formed notochord, which results in defects in neural tube formation, somite organization, and gut endoderm invagination (16.Weinstein D.C. Ruiz i Altaba A.

Furthermore, in transgenic mice in which HNF3β is ectopically expressed, the hindbrain region is converted to the floorplate (17.Sasaki H. Hogan B.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The three HNF3 family members share four distinct conserved regions (CRI–CRIV) (see Fig. 1). There is more than 90% homology between the family members at CRI, which functions as the DNA binding domain (Fig.1) (18.Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). CRII and CRIII are located in the C terminus, whereas CRIV is located in the N terminus (Fig. 1). CRII, CRIII, and CRIV are required for the transcriptional activity of HNF3β (19.Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRII and CRIII are part of a position-independent transactivation domain, and deletions of either region result in decreased transactivation activity of HNF3β (19.Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of CRIV also reduces transcriptional activity of HNF3β; however, CRIV cannot function independently, as its activity requires the participation of the C-terminal transactivation domain (CRII and CRIII) (19.Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this C-terminal transactivation domain is required for the accessory factor activity of HNF3β in the stimulation of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids (20.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar), and CRIV is not involved. By contrast, CRIV plays a crucial role in the activation of apoAI gene transcription in conjunction with HNF4 (21.Harnish D.C. Malik S. Kilbourne E. Costa R. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13621-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, these domains of HNF3 are capable of distinct functional interactions with other transcription factors. We show here that members of the transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) transcriptional corepressor family interact with the CRII domain of HNF3β. Overexpression of TLE1, a member of the TLE family, specifically represses the transcriptional activity of a chimeric protein that consists of the GAL4 DBD and the HNF3β C-terminal transactivation domain. This interaction could play an important role in determining the physiologic actions of HNF3β. Oligonucleotides that were used in this report were synthesized by an Expedite 8909 oligonucleotide synthesizer (Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The plasmids that express various GST·HNF3β chimeric proteins in Escherichia coli were generated in two steps. First, the nucleotide sequences of rat HNF3β corresponding to amino acids 361–458 (CRII/CRIII), 361–442 (CRII), and 388–458 (CRIII) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the primer pairs H3/N/361 (GCGCGGATCCGTGAGGCCCACCTGAAGCC) and H3/C/458/E (CGGGAATTCTTAGGTCGAGTTCATAATAG), H3/N/361 and H3/C/442/E (CGGGAATTCTTAGTCTGCAGCCAGGGGC), and H3/N/388 (GCGCGGATCCGTCATCATCATCACAGCCACCAC) and H3/C/458/E, respectively. These polymerase chain reaction fragments were then digested withEcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into the pGEX3X plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The construction of plasmids that encode various GAL4·HNF3β fusion proteins has been described previously (20.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a mammalian expression plasmid for the TLE1 protein, the cDNA of TLE1 was isolated by digesting pBluescript TLE1, which is used for the in vitro translation of TLE1, with HindIII and XbaI. This DNA fragment was then subcloned into the Rous sarcoma virus-promoter driven plasmid, pGM4 (22.Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plasmid TLE1-VP16 was generated by the subcloning of a polymerase chain reaction fragment that contains full-length TLE1 cDNA (using primers CGGGAATTCATGTTCCCGCAGAGCCG and GCGCGGATCCTCAGTAGATGACTTCATAGA) into the EcoRI andBamHI sites of pVP16 plasmid (CLONTECH). The construction of the (GAL4)5E1bLuc reporter plasmid has been described previously (23.Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30847-30850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). BL21 cells containing each of the GST·HNF3β expression plasmids were grown in LB media, and expression of the fusion proteins was induced by treating the cells with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were then collected, resuspended with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmdithiothreitol), and sonicated at 4 °C. After centrifugation, an aliquot of the supernatant was incubated with 50% glutathione-agarose overnight at 4 °C. The agarose beads bound with various GST·HNF3β fusion proteins were washed with lysis buffer three times and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either [35S]methionine-labeled (0.1 mCi/ml) H4IIE whole cell lysate, HeLa cell nuclear extracts, or TLE1 protein that was translatedin vitro using the Promega TNT system. After washing three times with lysis buffer, 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the agarose beads, the mixture was boiled for 5 min, and the eluent was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were enhanced, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film, and proteins were visualized by autoradiography. H4IIE whole cell lysates were prepared by adding lysis buffer to phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells for 15 min at 4 °C, and then the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. The preparation of the nuclear extracts is described elsewhere (24.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). The procedure used to purify proteins that interact with GST·HNF3β fusion proteins was basically a scaled-up version of the protocol described above with some modifications. A HeLa cell nuclear extract (provided by Dr. P. A. Weil, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) containing 75 mg of protein was first incubated with the agarose beads bound to GST protein to exclude proteins that interact with either GST or the agarose beads. The HeLa cell nuclear extract was then incubated with agarose beads bound to the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3 (GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII)). About 2.8 mg of both the GST and GST·HNF3β proteins were used for this purpose. Proteins that specifically associated with GST·HNF3β (CRII/CRIII) were analyzed on a preparative SDS-PAGE gel. The 100–110-kDa band was excised and sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for sequencing. The transient transfection procedure and the maintenance of HepG2 and HeLa cells are described elsewhere (23.Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30847-30850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25.Whelan J. Poon D. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3253-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase kit (Promega). Affinity chromatography was used to identify proteins that interact with the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β. The C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β fused to glutathioneS-transferase, GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII), is highly expressed in E. coli (data not shown). GST or GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) was bound to agarose beads and incubated with a whole cell lysate obtained from [35S]methionine-labeled H4IIE hepatoma cells. The beads were washed with either 150 or 500 mm NaCl, and the proteins that remained on the beads were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Two major bands were associated with the beads containing GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) but not with those that contained GST (Fig. 2 A). One protein had a molecular mass of approximately 100–110 kDa, and the other had a mass of about 84 kDa as determined by migration on SDS-PAGE gels. Washing the beads with a high salt concentration (500 mm) did not influence the interaction between GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) and these two proteins (Fig. 2 A). Although a nonspecific 84-kDa protein appears to bind to GST, a band of stronger intensity was bound to GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII). Thus, we conclude that this 84-kDa protein specifically associates with GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) and comigrates with a GST-interacting protein. These two proteins were also identified when the nuclear extracts prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled H4IIE cells were used to perform the GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) pull-down experiments (data not shown). We also determined that these GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII)-interacting proteins were present in HeLa S3 cells, which can be grown in suspension for production of large quantities of nuclear extracts for further protein purification (26.Martelli A.M. Cocco L. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1994; 12: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar,27.Wu J. Jupp R. Stenberg R.M. Nelson J.A. Ghazal P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7547-7555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Previous studies have shown that deletion of either CRII or CRIII markedly reduces the activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β (19.Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We speculated that co-regulatory proteins that are important for transmitting the activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain would not interact with mutants that lack either of these domains. Two GST fusion proteins with deletions of either CRII (GST·HNF3β(CRIII)) or CRIII (GST·HNF3β(CRII)) were prepared. These two proteins, along with GST or GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII), were bound to agarose beads and incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells. GST, GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII), GST·HNF3β(CRIII), and GST·HNF3β(CRII) were all expressed at equal amounts inE. coli (data not shown). One of the two previously identified bands, the 100–110-kDa band, interacts with both GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) (lane 1) and GST·HNF3β(CRII) (lane 2) but not with GST·HNF3β(CRIII) (lane 3) (Fig. 2 B). This suggests the presence of a nuclear protein that associates with the CRII of HNF3β. The 84-kDa band interacts with all of the GST·HNF3β proteins but does not interact with GST alone (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the interaction of this 84-kDa protein with the C-terminal transactivation domain of GST·HNF3β does not require either CRII or CRIII but does require amino acids 388–442. This report focuses on the 100–110-kDa nuclear protein(s) because it appears to interact with CRII, which is a crucial component of the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β. The GST pull-down protocol used in the experiments described above was employed to purify the 100–110-kDa protein from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. This extract was preincubated with GST-bound agarose beads to remove nonspecific binding proteins. The residual nuclear extract was then incubated with agarose beads bound with GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII). After extensive washing, the proteins that remained on the agarose beads were eluted and subjected to a preparative SDS-PAGE gel. The 100–110-kDa band was excised and sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for sequencing. Three peptide sequences were obtained. Using the NCBI blast search protocol, two peptides had a sequence identical to that of TLE3, a member of the TLE family of proteins (28.Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The sequence of the other peptide is very similar to that of the other TLE proteins, TLE1, TLE2, and TLE4 (Fig.3). Because all four members of the TLE family have a similar molecular weight and a very similar structural organization, we may have isolated more than one TLE protein in the purification process. A cDNA encoding authentic, full-length TLE1 (28.Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) was used to test for an interaction between this protein and the transactivation domain of HNF3β. TLE1 was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with agarose beads bound to various GST·HNF3β fusion proteins. In vitro translated TLE1 interacted with GST·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) and with GST·HNF3β(CRII) (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4) but not with GST·HNF3β(CRIII) (Fig. 4,lane 5). These results provide additional confirmation that the proteins identified are members of the TLE family. A mammalian two-hybrid assay was used to confirm an in vivointeraction between TLE1 and HNF3β. The basal transcription activity of the various GAL4·HNF3β fusion proteins was monitored by cotransfecting their cognate expression vectors with a luciferase reporter plasmid that contains five copies of a GAL4 binding site positioned upstream of a E1B TATA box ((GAL4)5E1bLuc). Overexpression of a chimeric protein that consists of TLE1 and the VP16 activation domain (TLE1·VP16) in HeLa cells does not influence the transcriptional activity of the GAL4 DBD (Fig.5). However, overexpression of TLE1·VP16 potentiates the transcriptional activities of both GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) and GAL4·HNF3β(CRII) but not GAL4·HNF3β(CRIII), when compared with the activity provided by VP16 alone (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the in vitro GST pull-down experiments described above and suggest that the HNF3β CRII directly associates with TLE1 in vivo. TLE proteins share a high degree of homology with theDrosophila Groucho protein, which functions as a corepressor in conjunction with several transcription factors (29.Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We tested whether TLE proteins can modulate the activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β in order to begin to understand the physiological significance of the TLE-HNF3β interaction. The expression vector that encodes the TLE1 protein was cotransfected with plasmids that encode various GAL4·HNF3β chimeric proteins and the (GAL4)5E1bLuc reporter gene. In HepG2 hepatoma cells, the transcriptional activities of GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII), GAL4·HNF3β(CRIII), and GAL4·HNF3β(CRII) are 7-fold, 4-fold, and 1-fold that of the GAL4 DBD, respectively (Fig.6 A) (8.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of TLE1 significantly reduced the activity of GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) and GAL4·HNF3β(CRII), but the activity of GAL4·HNF3β(CRIII), which does not interact with TLE1, was not affected (Fig. 6 A and see above). As in HepG2 cells, the overexpression of TLE1 inhibits the activity of GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) and GAL4·HNF3β(CRII) in HeLa cells but has no effect on GAL4·HNF3β(CRIII) in these cells (Fig.6 A). Thus, in both HepG2 and HeLa cells, TLE1 co-represses transcription through a specific interaction with the CRII of HNF3β. All of the constructs are more active in HeLa cells, an observation that may be related to transfection efficiency. Some qualitative differences in the responses are noteworthy, however. Deletion of CRII resulted in decreased activity in HepG2 cells and a 5-fold increase in activity in HeLa cells; thus, CRII could act in a cell-specific fashion. It appears to be an activation domain in HepG2 cells and a repression domain in HeLa cells. This observation could be explained if HeLa cells have a higher concentration of TLE, which, in the absence of CRII, is unable to function. An immunoblot analysis was performed to test this possibility. As shown in Fig. 6 B, HeLa cells express approximately five times more TLE than HepG2 cells. Homologues of Groucho/TLE have been isolated from mouse, rat, and human cDNA libraries (28.Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 30.Pinto M. Lobe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33026-33031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These proteins have an N-terminal Gln (glutamine-rich) domain, a Gly/Pro-rich sequence (Gly/Pro region), and C-terminal Ser/Pro-rich and WD40 motifs. The multimerization of Groucho/TLE, through the Gln domain, is required for its repressive effects (30.Pinto M. Lobe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33026-33031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31.Chen G. Nguyen P.H. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7259-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32.Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The families of Groucho/TLE genes in mouse, rat, and human also each include one gene that encodes a truncated protein that only has the Gln domain and part of the Gly/Pro region (30.Pinto M. Lobe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33026-33031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For instance, Grg5 is a truncated protein that lacks the C-terminal Ser/Pro and WD40 motifs. Thus, it can dimerize (through the Gln domain) with TLE1/Groucho and block its repressive function (30.Pinto M. Lobe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33026-33031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34.Ren B. Chee K.J. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). An expression vector that encodes the dimerization domain of the Grg5 protein was cotransfected into HeLa cells with a plasmid that encodes the GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) chimeric protein and with the (GAL4)5E1bLuc reporter gene. Overexpression of Grg5 increased the transcriptional activity of GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) by about 5-fold (Fig. 7). By contrast, overexpression of Grg5 did not potentiate the transcriptional activity of the GAL4 DBD or of GAL4·HNF4(128–374), neither of which associates with Groucho/TLE (data not shown). These data suggest that Grg5 interferes with the repressive effect of TLEs in this system, probably by dimerizing with TLE1 as shown previously (30.Pinto M. Lobe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33026-33031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34.Ren B. Chee K.J. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This experiment provides further evidence that Groucho/TLE can specifically modulate the transcriptional potential of HNF3β through its C-terminal transactivation domain. Protein-DNA interactions are an essential component of transcription regulatory mechanisms. In recent years, it has become apparent that protein-protein interactions, which can change the magnitude or direction of a response within a given promoter, are equally important. HNF3 binds to a specific DNA element (gAF2) (glucocorticoid accessory factor 2 element) in the PEPCK gene promoter and is an essential component of the glucocorticoid response unit that enhances the transcription of this gene (8.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). The gAF2 element also serves as an insulin response sequence and is involved in the repression of the PEPCK gene by insulin (35.O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions involving HNF3 were sought in an effort to understand how this protein functions as a regulator of transcription and to help explain its role in the glucocorticoid response unit, and perhaps in the insulin response. We detected an interaction between the TLE1 transcription corepressor protein and the CRII of HNF3β. The TLE proteins are remarkably similar in functional organization and amino acid sequence (28.Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 36.Miyasaka H. Choudhury B.K. Hou E.W. Li S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37.Schmidt C.J. Sladek T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25681-25686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so it is therefore quite possible that these proteins all interact with this domain of HNF3β. The CRII is conserved between all three mammalian HNF3 proteins (α, β, and γ) and the Drosophila forkhead protein. Thus, it is likely that other members of the extensive HNF3 family associate with TLE proteins. The CRII of HNF3β does not contain the WRPW motif that is required for the interaction between TLE/Groucho and Hairy/Enhancer of split-like proteins (29.Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 32.Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38.Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The CRII also does not resemble the eh1/GEH motif that is required for the interaction between TLE/Groucho and Engrailed or Goosecoid (39.Jimenez G. Verrijzer C.P. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2080-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CRII, however, does have an FNHPF sequence that may serve as a TLE binding site because it has two aromatic residues separated by a proline. In HepG2 cells, GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII) is a stronger transcription activator than GAL4·HNF3β(CRIII), which contains CRIII but lacks CRII. This suggests that CRII is required for complete activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β. However, GAL4·HNF3β(CRII), which contains CRII but not CRIII, does not have transcriptional activity, so maximal activity requires both domains. Interestingly, the CRII functions as a repressor of the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β in HeLa cells, and in this cellular context, GAL4·HNF3β(CRIII) is five times more active than GAL4·HNF3β(CRII/CRIII). The function of CRIII is also not completely understood. CRIII appears to independently bind to another protein(s), presumably a coactivator(s), because it can provide strong transcriptional activity in the absence of CRII. The identification of other proteins that associate with the C-terminal transactivation domains of HNF3β will be an important step in understanding the regulation of transcription by HNF3β. TLE binds to the mammalian transcription activators acute myeloid leukemia-1 and lymphoid enhancer factor-1, interactions that reduce the transactivation potential of these proteins (40.Imai Y. Kurokawa M. Tanaka K. Friedman A.D. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 582-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 41.Levanon D. Goldstein R.E.

Data acquired from the analysis of related proteins suggest that TLE proteins could modulate the transcriptional activity of the HNF3 proteins and do so by several different mechanisms. For example, the Drosophilaprotein Groucho, a homolog of TLE, interacts with a number of transcription repressors, such as the Hairy, Engrailed, Goosecoid, and Hairy/Enhancer of split-like proteins. In this context, it serves as a transcriptional corepressor (29.Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 32.Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S.

In certain promoter contexts, Groucho can also convert an activator into a repressor, as exemplified by its interaction with Drosophila Dorsal (43.Dubnicoff T. Valentine S.A. Chen G. Shi T. Lengyel J.A. Paroush Z. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2952-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In a third mechanism, Groucho binds to the Drosophila T cell factor, and this interaction accounts for the repressive function ofDrosophila T cell factor (33.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J.

However,Drosophila T cell factor acts as a transcriptional activator when it associates with Armadillo, a coactivator (33.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 44.Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Roose J. Polevoy G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A. Nature. 1998; 395: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism has precedent in mammalian cells. NcoR, a co-repressor, interacts with and blunts the transactivation function of Pit-1 (45.Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The activity of Pit-1 is apparently regulated by the balance between a corepressor complex that contains NcoR and a coactivator complex that contains CREB-binding protein/p300 (45.Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, the ratio of TLE and Grg5 proteins in cells could also influence the transactivation potential of HNF3. Grg5, a naturally occurring dominant-negative form of Groucho/TLE, can also potentiate the transcriptional activities of several Groucho/TLE-associated proteins, such as PRD1-BF/Blimp-1 andDrosophila T cell factor (33.Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34.Ren B. Chee K.J. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the ratio of coactivators and corepressors bound to the C-terminal transactivation domain determines the activity of HNF3. Although the physiologic significance of the TLE-HNF3 interaction has not been established, certain clues suggest that this could be important. For example, the TLE and HNF3 proteins play critical roles in embryonic development. In mammals, the expression of the TLE1 and TLE3 genes correlates with segmentation, central and peripheral neurogenesis, and epithelial differentiation. This expression pattern is analogous to the role Groucho plays in Drosophiladevelopment (46.Yao J. Liu Y. Husain J. Lo R. Palaparti A. Henderson J. Stifani S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The absence of HNF3β in mice results in major defects in the development of the neural axis, somite organization, and gut endoderm invagination and an early embryonic lethal phenotype (15.Ang S.L. Rossant J. Cell. 1994; 78: 561-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar,16.Weinstein D.C. Ruiz i Altaba A. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Prezioso V.R. Jessell T.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). An interaction between TLE proteins and HNF3β may therefore have an important role in these developmental processes. HNF3 has not been directly linked to the repression of genes, but HNF3 binding sites are required for the induction of gene transcription by glucocorticoids in the PEPCK, tyrosine aminotransferase, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 gene promoters, and these sites overlap with the insulin response sequences that mediate the repressive effect of insulin on these genes (9.O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Suwanichkul A. Allander S.V. Morris S.L.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to the cis-trans model of gene regulation, there is presumably a protein that binds to the insulin response sequence and mediates the insulin response; however, this protein has not been unequivocally identified. The possibility that HNF3 participates in the insulin response through a protein-protein interaction has not been excluded. Insulin could enhance either the interaction between HNF3 and TLE (as with the Groucho-Dorsal interaction), or the repressive activity of TLE (as with the interactions of Groucho with Hairy, Engrailed, Goosecoid, or Hairy/Enhancer of split-like). Alternatively, because phosphorylation plays an important role in the nuclear localization of TLE (49.Husain J. Lo R. Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the insulin signaling pathway may induce the phosphorylation of TLE and thereby increase the amount of TLE in the nucleus, which would favor its binding to HNF3. In this regard, it is of interest to note that the activity of Groucho is influenced by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, such as Torso and the epidermal growth factor receptor (14.Paroush Z. Wainwright S.M. Ish-Horowicz D. Development. 1997; 124: 3827-3834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Price J.V. Savenye E.D. Lum D. Breitkreutz A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1139-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies designed to test for a role of TLE in insulin-mediated gene repression are under way. We thank Cathy Caldwell for excellent technical assistance, Deborah Brown for preparation of the manuscript, and Don Scott for careful review of the manuscript. Jing Yao constructed several of the TLE plasmids. The HNF3 cDNA was obtained from R. Costa, University of Illinois (Chicago, IL)."

To clarify the mechanisms by which this interaction takes place, we have examined the effect of a peptide corresponding to the effector domain of MRP, the so-called effector peptide, on both the dynamic and the structural properties of actin. We show that in the absence of cations the effector peptide polymerizes monomeric actin and causes the alignment of the formed filaments into bundle-like structures. Moreover, we document that binding of calmodulin or phosphorylation by protein kinase C both inhibit the actin polymerizing activity of the MRP effector peptide. Finally, several effector peptides were synthesized in which positively charged or hydrophobic segments were deleted or replaced by alanines. Our data suggest that a group of six positively charged amino acid residues at the N-terminus of the peptide is crucial for its interaction with actin. While its actin polymerizing activity critically depends on the presence of all three positively charged segments of the peptide, hydrophobic amino acid residues rather modulate the polymerization velocity.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22310-22315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MARCKS is a ubiquitous 32-kDa protein, whereas MRP (also known as F52 or MacMARCKS) has a molecular mass of 20 kDa and is mainly expressed in brain and reproductive tissues (3.Aderem A.

A comparison of their primary structures reveals three conserved domains: 1) the N-terminal domain contains the recognition site for myristoylation (5.McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar); 2) the MARCKS homology 2 domain, a 15-amino acid residue-long stretch whose function is unknown, shows sequence identity with the cytoplasmic tail of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (3.Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar); 3) an extremely basic domain, known as the phosphorylation site domain or effector domain that is 24–25 amino acid residues long, is responsible for most of the interactions of MARCKS proteins with their common ligands (see below). Both MARCKS and MRP bind to calmodulin (CaM) with nanomolar affinity (6.Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only little information is available on the cellular functions of MARCKS and even less on MRP. Evidently, both proteins are essential for brain development (19.Wu M. Chen D.F. Sasaoka T. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20.Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 6275-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is well documented that at the cellular level MARCKS proteins mediate cross-talk between CaM and PKC (reviewed in Refs. 22.Schmitz A. Schleiff E. Vergères G. NATO ASI (Adv. Sci. Inst.) Ser. Ser.

Furthermore, these proteins colocalize with filamentous actin or actin-binding proteins in response to a number of cellular events during which a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is involved, such as cell spreading (24.Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25.Manenti S. Malecaze F. Darbon J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), neurosecretion (26.Wu W.S. Walaas S.I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5249-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), or macrophage activation (27.Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In 1992, Hartwig et al. (28.Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) found that MARCKS cross-links actin filaments in vitro. The findings that upon phosphorylation MARCKS is translocated from the membrane (16.Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and that binding of CaM inhibits its cross-linking of actin filaments (28.Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) led to the model that the primary function of MARCKS is to regulate the structure of the actin cytoskeleton by cross-linking actin filaments to networks or bundles at the membrane (28.Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To this end, it is assumed that this protein-protein interaction is mediated to a large extent by the effector domain of MARCKS (3.Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Since the effector domains of MARCKS and MRP exhibit very high sequence homology (96% identity), a similar function has been assumed for MRP. To gain insight into the role of the effector domain during the presumed interaction of MRP with actin, we investigated the effect of a peptide corresponding to the effector domain of MRP, the so-called effector peptide, on rabbit skeletal muscle actin. The 24-amino acid residue-long MRP effector peptide is highly basic and has the following primary sequence:KKKKK FSF KKPF K LSGLSF KRNRK, with the 12 positively charged residues (i.e. 10 Lys and 2 Arg) typed in bold letters and hydrophobic residues in italics. It differs from the MARCKS effector domain mainly in the lack of one arginine after the five N-terminal lysine residues and in the proline residue, which is replaced by a serine in MARCKS (3.Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, both peptides are highly polycationic, but also possess hydrophobic regions which are probably involved in their binding to membranes (29.Qin Z. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence has been obtained that the MARCKS effector peptide assumes a random coil structure both in solution (30.Coburn C. Eisenberg J. Eisenberg M. McLaughlin S. Runnels L. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A60Google Scholar) as well as when bound to CaM (31.Porumb T. Crivici A. Blackshear P.J. Ikura M. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or membranes (29.Qin Z. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and similar properties can be assumed for the MRP effector peptide (31.Porumb T. Crivici A. Blackshear P.J. Ikura M. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the structure of actin filament networks is strongly altered in the presence of very high concentrations of divalent cations (32.Hanson J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1973; 183: 39-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or by polycations (33.Oriol-Audit C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). While high concentrations of divalent and polyvalent cations lead to the formation of paracrystalline arrays (34.Fowler W.E. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), lower concentrations of polycations like polylysine or [Co(NH3)6]3+ align actin filaments laterally to form bundles (35.Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The effect of polycations can be explained by the condensation theory of Manning (36.Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 179-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar), which assumes that (poly)cations are bound as counterions along the filaments and partially compensate the negative charges on actin, which normally prevent single filaments from forming bundles. In agreement with its polycationic nature, two studies have demonstrated that the effector domain of MARCKS or the corresponding effector peptide bundles actin filaments (28.Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 35.Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The interaction of this peptide with actin was, however, not investigated from a kinetic point of view. This latter aspect is addressed in particular in this article. Moreover, the possibility for a regulatory function of CaM and PKC on the effector peptide activity is assessed by investigating their capability to affect the actin polymerization kinetics or the formation of higher order actin filament structures induced by the MRP effector peptide. Last but not least, to obtain some information on the role of the distinct sequence segments of the peptide during its interaction with actin, three groups of peptides were synthesized in which a particular amino acid segment was deleted or replaced by alanines: In group 1, some or all hydrophobic amino acid residues (i.e. phenylalanine and leucine) are replaced by alanines. In group 2, the N-terminal positively charged Lys residues are replaced by alanines or deleted, with or without replacement of the serine groups or the hydrophobic segments (for further details, see “Experimental Procedures”). In group 3, the central and/or the C-terminal positively charged Lys and Arg residues are replaced by alanines. These group 1 to group 3 “mutant” peptides are evaluated for their effect on both actin polymerization and/or actin filament reorganization into higher order structures, aimed at ultimately acquiring a more rational understanding of the interactions of the intact proteins MARCKS and MRP with actin. Actin was isolated and prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to the method of Spudich and Watt (37.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as recently described by Steinmetz et al. (38.Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and stored at 4 °C in G-buffer (2.5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP) containing 0.001% NaN3. For fluorescence measurements, actin was labeled at cysteine 374 withN-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes Europe B. V., Leiden, Netherlands) following the method of Kouyama and Mihashi (39.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The extent of labeling was typically 80%. Actin concentration and its extent of pyrene labeling were determined as described by Cooperet al. (40.Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The absorption measurements were performed on a Kontron UVIKON spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Zürich, Switzerland). A peptide corresponding to the effector domain of murine MRP (amino acid residues 86–109), the MRP effector peptide, was obtained from AMS Biotechnology (Lugano, Switzerland). The amino acid composition as well as the concentrations of the effector peptides were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. CaM from bovine brain was purchased from Sigma (Division of Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland), and the catalytic subunit of rat brain protein kinase C (PKM) was obtained from Calbiochem. “Wild type” MARCKS effector peptide (wt peptide) and the 13 mutant peptides, which were a kind gift of Prof. Felix Althaus from the Tierspital, University of Zürich, Switzerland, were synthesized by Alexis Corp. (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). All other chemicals were purchased from Fluka (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) in the highest purity grade available. The following peptides were used (“mutations” are underlined). All peptides were of a purity grade >80% as determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis (data sheet provided by the manufacturer). Actin polymerization was monitored by following the fluorescence increase of the pyrenated actin moiety, according to Kouyama and Mihashi (39.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, pyrene-labeled actin was mixed with unlabeled actin to yield a final extent of 5%. 400 μl of actin solution was put into a 5 × 5-mm quartz glass cuvette (Hellma Suprasil, Hellma, Müllheim, Germany), and the fluorescence was recorded at an angle of 90°. The sample was excited at 365 nm with a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and emission was measured at 407 nm with a bandwidth of 5 nm. To minimize scattering effects, a cut-off filter at 395 nm was used for the emitted light. The measurements were performed on a Jasco Spectrofluorometer FP-777 (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). In all experiments, the temperature was kept constant at (20 ± 1) °C. The data were evaluated with EasyPlot 3.0 (by Spiral Software, Brookline, MA and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Unless indicated otherwise, polymerization of actin was induced by adding MgCl2 to 2 mm and KCl to 50 mm to G-buffer (F-buffer). All polymerization experiments were performed with at least three different actin preparations to ensure that the observed results were not due to variations in the quality of a particular actin preparation. Phosphorylation of the MRP effector peptide at its Ser residues was achieved as described recently (7.Schleiff E. Schmitz A. McIlhinney R.A.J. Manenti S. Vergères G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26794-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5.4 μm MRP effector peptide was phosphorylated for 9 h at 30 °C in a total volume of 130 μl containing 6 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.001% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 20 nm PKM. Positive controls included the same reaction mixture except that PKM was substituted by the PKM storage buffer (Calbiochem data sheet). For negative controls, PKM was substituted by the PKM storage buffer, and the effector peptide was substituted by an equal amount of G-buffer. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was determined by parallel incubation of aliquots with [γ-32P]ATP and by quantification of the incorporated radioactivity as described (7.Schleiff E. Schmitz A. McIlhinney R.A.J. Manenti S. Vergères G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26794-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 5-μl aliquot of F-actin was adsorbed to a carbon-coated copper grid rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low air pressure. After 30 s, the sample drop was removed, and the grid briefly washed with water, before the sample was negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate or 0.75% uranyl formiate. Specimens were inspected in a Philips 400 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV acceleration voltage, and micrographs were recorded on electron image film (SO-163, Eastman Kodak Co.) at a nominal magnification of × 55,000. For further details of specimen preparation and electron microscopy, see Steinmetz et al. (38.Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The effector domain of MRP is involved in most of the interactions with its reaction partners, including CaM, membranes, and PKC (5.McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 17.Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,18.Graff J.M. Rajan R.R. Randall R.R. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that the effector domain of MARCKS, which is almost identical to the effector domain of MRP, is essential for its actin cross-linking activity. Hence, we investigated the possibility that a peptide representing the effector domain of MRP might mediate an interaction of MRP with actin. In particular, with respect to the dynamic properties of the actin cytoskeleton, we have investigated these interactions from a kinetic point of view. The 24-amino acid-long effector domain of MRP contains 12 positively charged residues (i.e. 10 Lys and 2 Arg), so it is conceivable that its strong polycationic nature might influence actin polymerization. To assess this question, a peptide consisting of these 24 amino acids, the MRP effector peptide, was added to actin in G-buffer at different stoichiometries. Immediately upon addition, the effector peptide causes actin to polymerize in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig.1 a, curves 3 and4). Upon reaching steady state, 2 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl were added to polymerize the remaining actin (arrows). Comparison of the steady-state values in the absence and presence of Mg2+/K+clearly documents that the fraction of polymerized actin correlates with the concentration of effector peptide. This concentration dependence suggests the formation of a stoichiometric complex between actin and the effector peptide. These results can best be explained by assuming that the effector peptide binds to actin monomers and saturates the low affinity cation binding sites, which are normally occupied by mono- and divalent cations (41.Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9271-9277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10785-10792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this way, the effector peptide could “mimic” the cations that lead to filament formation under physiological salt concentrations. Hence, it might be argued that the observed polymerization reaction is an unspecific event that could be initiated by many different polycations (34.Fowler W.E. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 44.Brown S. Spudich J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, polymerization of G-actin was induced by addition of polylysine at an equimolar actin:Lys18 ratio. As can be gathered fromcurve 1 in Fig. 1 a, polylysine is indeed capable of inducing actin polymerization in the absence of any other mono- or multivalent cations, but the kinetics is about 2 orders of magnitude slower than when using MRP effector peptide. A comparably fast polymerization kinetics was only observed with polylysines of a very high degree of polymerization (for example, Lys38; data not shown). Evidently, the effector peptide interacts with actin monomers in a specific manner. We propose that the effector peptide has a distinct structure (e.g. amino acid sequence, secondary structure, aggregation state, or charge distribution), which, together with electrostatic interactions, leads to very fast association of the peptide with actin monomers in the absence of any other cations. Since the experiments described so far were performed in a rather unphysiological environment, it is necessary to also evaluate how the MRP effector peptide affects actin filament formation when polymerization is induced by addition of monovalent and divalent cationic salts; upon increasing the ionic strength I by a factor of 100–200 by adding 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, the Debye-length λD will decrease approximately by a factor of 10 (since λD∝1/√I) (45.Atkins P.W. Physical Chemistry. 5th Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, Great Britain1997: A8-A10Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction between actin monomers and the MRP peptide should be attenuated. Fig.1 b displays the fluorescence signal upon addition of an equimolar concentration of MRP effector peptide to 4 μmpyrene-labeled G-actin in the presence of 2 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. As expected, the actin polymerization velocity is still markedly increased (curve 2), however, at a considerably slower rate than at low salt concentration. The relatively long lag phase indicates that elongation rather than nucleation is enhanced by the peptide. It should be noted that more effector peptide is required to enhance actin polymerization when increasing the KCl concentration from 50 to 100 mm (data not shown). This suggests that the binding of the effector peptide to actin is, at least to some extent, governed by electrostatic interactions. However, the mechanism of the interaction is independent of the salt concentration. Only the effective concentration of effector peptide complexed with actin is lowered. A rather puzzling result is found when the amount of peptide is lowered to substoichiometric concentrations at a given salt concentration; compared with control experiments with actin, polymerized in the absence of the effector peptide, the polymerization rate is decreased (data not shown). We have recently developed a model approach that can qualitatively account for this interesting phenomenon (49.Wohnsland, F., Schmitz, A. A. P., Steinmetz, M. O., Aebi, U., and Vergères, G. (2000) Biophys. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). In 1982, Fowler and Aebi (34.Fowler W.E. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) documented the formation of F-actin bundles upon addition of polyvalent cations such as polylysine to F-actin. Similarly, bundling of F-actin filaments, which had previously been polymerized in F-buffer, has also been reported for a peptide corresponding to the MARCKS effector domain (35.Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To test whether the MRP effector peptide exhibits a similar behavior, G-actin was incubated at a 1:1 molar ratio with the MRP effector peptide, and aliquots were prepared for and observed by transmission electron microscopy by negative staining after different incubation times. The micrographs displayed in Fig. 2, a–c, clearly document that, even in the absence of mono- or divalent cations, the MRP effector peptide induces the formation of actin filament bundles. Interestingly, after short incubation times (less than 5 min) occasionally very short bundles appeared that aligned along already existing filament bundles (Fig. 2 c) so as to anneal longitudinally into longer filament bundles, indicating that lateral association of filaments occurs before significant filament elongation takes place. The MARCKS effector peptide leads to the formation of actin bundles at a considerably lower stoichiometry than polycations of comparable charge (35.Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This is in good agreement with the observed higher polymerizing activity of the MRP effector peptide, confirming a high specificity for actin. The electron micrographs recorded during the initial phase of filament formation (see Fig. 2 c) further document the assumption that two processes contribute to the drastic spontaneous polymerization in the absence of salt: 1) upon addition of the effector peptide to a G-actin solution, peptide molecules bind with very high affinity to actin monomers, thereby activating them by inducing a similar conformational change as is caused by mono- or divalent cations (as described, e.g. in Refs. 42.Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10785-10792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

Cell Motil. 1986; 7: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); 2) this monomer binding/activating step, in turn, greatly enhances polymerization into filaments. Last but not least, it is worth noting that the drastic effect of effector peptide on actin polymerization was also observed with the MARCKS effector peptide instead of the MRP effector peptide (data not shown), indicating that"

MS is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. In this disease, activated T cells are able to cross the damaged blood-brain barrier and then migrate into the central nervous system, where they initiate inflammation as well as tissue injury. The T cells, microglia/macrophages, and astrocytes in turn produce cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, lymphotoxin, and interferon-γ. Lymphotoxin and TNF-α are present in MS plaques (11.Selmaj K. Raine C. Canella B. Brosnan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and the encephalitogenicity of T cell clones is correlated with their production of lymphotoxin-α and/or TNF-α (12.Powell M. Mitchell D. Lederman J. Buckmeier J. Zamvil S. Graham M. Ruddle N. Steinman L. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). TNF-α is thought to be one of the most important inflammatory cytokines associated with MS. The down-regulation of TNF-α by the phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor rolipram is effective in reducing the progression of demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model for autoimmune-mediated demyelination disease (13.Genain C.P. Roberts T. Davis R.L. Nguyen M.H. Uccelli A. Faulds D. Li Y. Hedgpeth J. Hauser S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3601-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Studies showing the inhibition of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis symptoms by antibodies to TNF-α also support a pathogenic role for this cytokine (14.Ruddle N. Bergman C. McGrath K.

TNF-α-induced cell death is executed by the activation of caspases, which are the common mediators of programmed cell death (19.Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 20.Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The administration of TNF-α to primary cultures of OLGs induces DNA fragmentation and significantly decreases the number of live OLGs. The chemical inhibitors acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (a specific inhibitor of caspase-1 (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme)-like proteases) and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (a specific inhibitor of caspase-3 (CPP32)-like proteases) and the baculovirus caspase inhibitor p35 enhance the survival of TNF-α-treated OLGs, suggesting that caspase-mediated cell death pathways are activated in TNF-α-induced OLG cell death (6.Hisahara S.

Among the neurotrophic factors, nerve growth factor (NGF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor levels have been shown to increase in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients affected by MS (21.Laudiero L.B. Aloe L. Levi-Montalcini R. Buttinelli C. Schilter D. Gillessen S. Otten U. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22.Massaro A.R. Soranzo C. Carnevale A. Eur. Neurol. 1997; 37: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of these neurotrophic factors seems to be one of the defense mechanisms of neural cells against the inflammatory response in MS. Thus, it is important to evaluate the anti-apoptotic function of these cytokines for OLGs in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Ciliary neurotrophic factor has been shown to protect against TNF-α-induced OLG cell death in vitro (23.Louis J.C. Magal E. Takayama S. Varon S. Science. 1993; 259: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 24.D'Souza S.D. Alinauskas K.A. Antel J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, an anti-apoptotic function of neurotrophins in TNF-α-induced OLG cell death has not been shown. Most studies of neurotrophin action have focused on their survival- and differentiation-inducing effects on neurons. The neurotrophin family consists of NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin (NT)-3, NT-4/5, and NT-6. Neurotrophins trigger a variety of biological responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (25.Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways of neurotrophins are mediated through two transmembrane glycoproteins, the Trk receptor tyrosine kinase family (25.Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 26.Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) and the p75 low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (27.Radeke M.J. Misko T.P. Hsu C. Herzenberg L.A. Shooter E.M. Nature. 1987; 325: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The expression of p75 increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA in sympathoadrenal cells (28.Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Kaplan D.R. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and p75 participates in forming high-affinity binding sites for NGF together with TrkA (29.Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 30.Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of NGF to TrkA on the cell surface causes receptor dimerization and leads to the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of TrkA (31.Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). NGF promotes cell survival by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (32.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 33.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

In this study, we thought to determine whether neurotrophins could protect OLGs from the cell injury mediated by TNF-α. We examined the expression of Trk receptors and p75 in cultured rat OLGs and found that p75 and TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC are expressed in these cells. TNF-α-induced OLG cell death was most effectively prevented by NGF. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) could also prevent TNF-α-induced OLG cell death, and a neutralizing antibody against NGF partially inhibited the anti-apoptotic effects of ACM, suggesting that NGF is a physiological anti-apoptotic factor produced by astrocytes. NGF prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (LMP) by TNF-α. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt, one of the downstream targets of PI3K, in OLGs effectively prevented both the TNF-α-induced LMP and cell death, but overexpression of constitutively active MEK did not. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant-negative Akt negated the protective effects of NGF on TNF-α-mediated OLG cytotoxicity. Our results are the first to show that activation of the Akt signaling pathway can prevent the OLG cell death induced by TNF-α. Primary cultures of OLGs were prepared from whole rat brains harvested on embryonic days 17∼19. The meninges were completely removed from the brains in a dish containing Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). The brains were then minced quickly with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing trypsin/EDTA solution (0.01% trypsin and 0.1 mm EDTA; Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated in a CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 5 min. The cells were then spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin at 100 units/ml and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively). The suspended cells were transferred to flasks (two to four brains/75-cm2 flask) and cultured for 12∼15 days. Numerous pre-O2A progenitor clusters appeared, overlying a confluent layer of astrocytes. The flask was shaken by hand 40∼60 times to release the progenitors into the medium. The medium was filtered through a cell strainer (pore size of 40 μm; Falcon) to eliminate lumps of feeder cells. The filtered suspension was transferred to culture dishes (Corning) and incubated in a CO2 incubator for 45 min to allow microglia and type 1 astrocytes to attach to the dish. Progenitors were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended with differentiation medium (Bottenstein Sato (BS) medium) (35.Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) containing 2% FBS and transferred onto 12- or 24-well dishes containing poly-l-lysine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.)-coated micro-coverslips (Matsunami). Mature OLGs were obtained by culturing OLG progenitors in BS medium containing 2% FBS for 4 days and used to test the effects of cytokines. Mouse NGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Amgen), or NT-3 (Amgen) was administered to OLGs cultured in BS medium containing 2% FBS simultaneously with 100 ng/ml human recombinant TNF-α (Sigma). Rat astrocytes were cultured in BS medium containing 2% FBS and incubated for 3 days, and the medium was used as ACM. NGF-neutralizing antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to ACM together with TNF-α, and the mixture was used to examine the effect of NGF in preventing TNF-α-induced injury to OLGs. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were blocked with blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum and 0.1% skim milk in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature. The samples were incubated with rabbit anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antibody (1:500 dilution) at room temperature for 90 min and then washed with PBS three times. Anti-MBP antibody (BP-7) was produced by immunizing a rabbit with purified mouse MBP (18.Hisahara S. Shoji S. Okano H. Miura M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:500 dilution; Chemicon International, Inc.). Samples were then incubated with substrate solution (0.1 mTris (pH 9.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and 0.3 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the number of OLGs was counted under an Olympus microscope. For double labeling, OLGs on coverslips were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as described above. The samples were incubated with polyclonal anti-p75 (1:500 dilution; Promega), anti-TrkA, -TrkB, or -TrkC (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-phospho-Akt (1:200; New England Biolabs Inc.) antibody together with monoclonal anti-CNPase antibody (1:200 dilution; Sigma) at 4 °C overnight and then washed with PBS three times. For anti-phospho-Akt antibody staining, OLGs were permeabilized with ethanol for 1 min at −20 °C. Samples were incubated with rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution; Chemicon International, Inc.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution; Chemicon International, Inc.). Samples were mounted (PermaFluorTMaqueous mounting medium, Shandon-Lipshaw) and examined with an Olympus laser scanning microscope (LSM-GB200). OLGs were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well dishes with BS medium containing 2% FBS (400 μl/well) and treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) and TNF-α (100 ng/ml) for 3 h. MitoTracker Red CMXRos (25 nm; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to the culture medium, and the MitoTracker-positive OLGs were viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70) and counted. For propidium iodide staining, TNF-α with or without NGF was administered to 24-well dishes of OLGs and incubated for 36 h. Then, MitoTracker Red CMXRos and propidium iodide (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.) were added to each well and incubated for 5 min. Propidium iodide-stained OLGs as dying cells were counted in one-quarter area of each well. The cDNA fragments composing the entire coding regions of human MEK1 and human AKT1 were isolated from HEK293 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and has two glutamic acid substitutions at phosphorylation sites Ser218 and Ser222, was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (37.Mansour S.J.

Constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt), which lacks the pleckstrin homology domain (amino acids 4–129) but has an Src myristoylation signal sequence (MGSSKSKPKDPSQRR), was also prepared by polymerase chain reaction (38.Kohn A.D.

Constitutively active MEK (da-MEK) was subcloned into pAxCAwt (39.Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The myr-Akt fragment was subcloned into pAxCALNLw, a Cre-inducible expression cassette (41.Sato N. Wang S. Li L. Okabe K. Hashimoto M. Yaginuma H. Mikoshiba K. Uchiyama Y. Uetsuki T. Yoshikawa K.

Akt-AA (Akt T308A/S473A), which contains a hemagglutinin tag at its N terminus and works as a dominant-negative mutant of Akt (42.Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M.

This fragment was also subcloned into pAxCALNLw. The recombinant adenoviral vectors AxCAda-MEK, AxCALNLmyr-Akt, and AxCALNLAkt-AA were constructed by the COS-terminal protein complex method (39.Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The viral titers were determined by a plaque-forming assay in HEK293 cells. AxCANCre and AxCALacZ (43.Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. I. Saito (University of Tokyo). OLGs were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well with BS medium containing 2% FBS and cultured for 4 days as described above. The mature OLGs were infected with both AxCALNLmyr-Akt (106 pfu/ml) and AxCANCre (3 × 105 pfu/ml) or with either AxCAda-MEK (106pfu/ml) or AxCALacZ (106 pfu/ml) and maintained for 24 h. The mature OLGs were also infected with both AxCALNLAkt-AA (106 pfu/ml) and AxCANCre (3 × 105pfu/ml) and maintained for 24 h. The infected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α alone or together with 100 ng/ml NGF for 3 days, and then the number of OLGs was determined by staining with anti-MBP antibody as described above. To examine the effects on the LMP, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos 3 h after TNF-α (or TNF-α and NGF) administration. OLGs were infected with 106pfu/ml recombinant adenovirus for 24 h and then lysed with SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Protein samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) at 80 mA for 2 h. The membrane was blocked with 4% skim milk in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated with anti-hemagglutinin antibody (for myr-Akt and Akt-AA; 1:200; Promega), anti-Myc antibody (for da-MEK; 1:200; Pharmingen), anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:2000; Cappel), or anti-phospho-Akt antibody (1:200) for 90 min at room temperature and then washed with TBST five times (for >5 min each time). The membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; Dako Corp.) for 60 min at room temperature and then washed with TBST five times (for >5 min each time). The membrane was then incubated with coloring solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, and 0.2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate). OLGs that had differentiated from OLG progenitor cells in rat mixed glial cell culture were used. OLG precursor cells were separated from the astrocyte monolayer by shaking the culture flask by hand, and they were then transferred to BS medium containing 2% FBS. OLG precursors differentiated into CNPase-positive mature OLGs within 2–4 days after transfer. Since OLGs start to die spontaneously after 7 days in culture, we used OLGs cultured in BS medium containing 2% FBS for 4 days for most of this study. To characterize the neurotrophin receptors expressed by OLGs under our culture conditions, we performed immunocytochemical staining. OLGs expressed both of the low-affinity NGF receptor p75 and TrkA (Fig. 1). In addition to these NGF receptors, TrkB and TrkC were also present in our OLG preparation. OLG cell death was induced by 100 ng/ml TNF-α given for 3 days (Fig.2 A), which is similar to the dose of TNF-α that kills mouse OLGs (6.Hisahara S. Araki T. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Suzuki M. Abe K. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Momoi T. Saruta T. Bernard C.C.A. Okano H. Miura M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18.Hisahara S. Shoji S. Okano H. Miura M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Most of the OLGs were detached from the dish, and the total number of OLGs identified by anti-MBP antibody immunostaining was dramatically reduced at this stage (Fig. 2 C). At 36 h after TNF-α administration, most of the OLGs still remained on the dish. To study the changes in the number of dying OLGs, we stained OLGs with propidium iodide because it is taken up only by dying cells (Fig. 2 B). Dying OLGs were markedly increased in the TNF-α-treated dishes (Fig. 2 B). We then examined whether neurotrophins could prevent TNF-α-induced OLG cell death. Among the neurotrophins tested, NGF most effectively prevented the OLG cell death induced by TNF-α (Fig. 2, Band C), with almost complete prevention occurring with 100 ng/ml NGF. Both brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NT-3 could partially prevent TNF-α-induced OLG cell death, but their protective effects were much smaller than those of NGF. In mixed glial cell cultures, TNF-α did not kill OLGs as efficiently as in pure OLG cultures (data not shown). Thus, astrocyte-derived trophic factors might have prevented TNF-α-induced OLG cell death. Furthermore, when purified OLGs were cultured in ACM, most of the killing activity of TNF (100 ng/ml) was eliminated (Fig.3). Since astrocytes are known to secrete NGF in the central nervous system (44.Yamakuni T. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Amano T. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 45.Yoshida K. Gage F.H. Brain Res. 1991; 538: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 46.Yoshida K. Gage F.H.

Neurochem. 1992; 9: 919-931Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), NGF could be one of the astrocyte-derived trophic factors preventing TNF-α-induced OLG cell death. This possibility was supported by the observation that the trophic effect of ACM was partially prevented by the addition of an NGF-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3). ACM contains a number of cytokines, including ciliary neurotrophic factor (48.Rudge J.S. Morrissey D. Lindsay R.M. Pasnikowski E.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is possible that ciliary neurotrophic factor or other factors can also prevent OLG cell death by TNF-α. Collectively, these data suggest that NGF might protect against TNF-α-induced OLG cell death under physiological conditions. Among the subcellular events that are commonly observed during cell death, accumulating evidence supports a pivotal role for mitochondrial changes in bringing about cell death (49.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These changes include the LMP, the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition, and the release of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, which induce apoptosis (7.Liu X.

Once cells are stimulated by TNF-α, rapid LMP and membrane permeability transition have been observed (52.Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To test whether the LMP lies on the TNF-α-induced cell death pathway in OLGs, we stained OLGs with a mitochondrion-selective, mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dye, MitoTracker (54.Macho A. Decaudin D. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 55.Poot M. Pierce R.H. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), with or without TNF-α treatment. As shown in Fig.4 A, the OLG cell bodies and processes were well stained by MitoTracker. In contrast with untreated control cells, MitoTracker staining was dramatically reduced 3 h after treatment of OLGs with TNF-α (Fig. 4 C). This result indicates that TNF-α induced the LMP in cultured OLGs. We then examined whether or not the addition of NGF would affect the LMP induced by TNF-α. When NGF was administered to OLGs simultaneously with TNF-α, no LMP was observed (Fig. 4, D andE). These results strongly suggest that NGF protects against TNF-α-induced OLG cell death upstream of the LMP. The Akt protein kinase is activated by a variety of trophic factors via a PI3K-dependent pathway (32.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

To examine the function of Akt in NGF-mediated prevention of the LMP induced by TNF, we tested whether endogenous Akt was stimulated in OLGs treated with NGF. After 30 min of NGF stimulation, OLGs were clearly positive when stained with an antibody specific for phosphorylated Akt (active form of Akt) (Fig.5 C).

https://openalex.org/W1978224022,"cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with a number of DNA-binding proteins and cofactor proteins involved in the regulation of transcription. Relatively little is known about the structure of CBP, but it has been noted that it contains three domains that are rich in cysteine and histidine (CH1, CH2, and CH3). The sequence of CH2 conforms to that of a leukemia-associated protein domain (PHD finger), and it has been postulated that this and both CH1 and CH3 may be zinc finger domains. This has not, however, been demonstrated experimentally. We have studied CH1 and show that it is composed of two novel zinc-binding modules, which we term “zinc bundles.” Each bundle contains the sequence Cys-X 4-Cys-X 8-His-X 3-Cys, and we show that a synthetic peptide comprising one zinc bundle from CH1 can fold in a zinc-dependent manner. CH3 also appears to contain two zinc bundles, one with the variant sequence Cys-X 2-Cys-X 9-His-X 3-Cys, and we demonstrate that this variant motif also undergoes Zn(II)-induced folding. CH1 acts as a transcriptional activation domain in cellular assays. We show that mutations in any of the four zinc-chelating residues in either zinc bundle of CH1 significantly impair this activity and that these mutations also interfere with certain protein-protein interactions mediated by CH1. Our results indicate that CBP is a genuine zinc-binding protein and introduce zinc bundles as novel protein interaction domains. cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with a number of DNA-binding proteins and cofactor proteins involved in the regulation of transcription.

Although the mechanisms by which DNA-binding proteins activate or repress transcription are not completely understood, these proteins often work by recruiting coactivators such as cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)1 and p300 (1.Chrivia J.C.

Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). It is now clear that CBP is capable of interacting with a wide array of other DNA-bound transcription factors and that it mediates or modulates the transcriptional activity of these proteins (4.Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5.Xu L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The molecular mode of action of CBP is complex. It has been shown that it possesses intrinsic histone acetylase activity and that it is able to recruit P/CAF, another acetyl transferase (10.Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 11.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CBP is involved in the remodeling of chromatin, since it has been shown that the degree of histone acetylation significantly alters chromatin structure (12.Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CBP can interact directly with the basal transcriptional machinery (13.Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 14.Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), underlining its central role as a transcriptional adaptor. The intracellular concentration of CBP is thought to be limiting, and it has consequently been proposed that CBP may be instrumental in coordinating different signaling pathways. Thus, for example, the inhibitory effects of nuclear hormone receptors on AP-1 activity have been attributed to the competition between hormone receptors and Jun/Fos for CBP (15.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). CBP has consequently been termed a transcriptional cointegrator (15.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar).One of the most remarkable properties of CBP is its ability to physically associate with and modulate the activity of so many different and apparently unrelated DNA-bound transcription factors. A diagram of CBP and some of its partner proteins is shown in Fig. 1. A substantial number of these partner proteins associate with either CH1 or CH3 or both. Almost nothing is known about the molecular nature of these CH1/CH3-mediated interactions, although other interactions made by CBP, such as that made with cAMP-response element-binding protein (which does not involve the Cys/His-rich domains), have been studied in some detail (1.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 16.Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P.

Hoeger C. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In this case the solution structure of the complex formed between the KIX domain of CBP and the cAMP-response element-binding protein KID domain has been determined (18.Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar).The fact that CH1 and CH3 contain a large number of residues that are capable of chelating zinc ions has led to the suggestion that these domains may constitute zinc fingers (1.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 2.Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Many classes of zinc finger domains have been described and ascribed roles in nucleic acid binding, protein recognition, or both (19.Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20.Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, neither CH1 nor CH3 resemble any previously reported zinc-binding modules. In this study, we show that the CH1/CH3 regions of CBP proteins contain a highly conserved arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues. These regions can be broken down into discrete modules that each contain four putative metal-ligating residues and share the consensus sequence Cys-X 2–4-Cys-X 8–9-His-X 3-Cys. We have termed these modules “zinc bundles.” We show that chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to individual zinc bundles from both CH1 and CH3 are capable of forming stable secondary structure in the presence of Zn(II) and that this structure appears to contain a substantial degree of helical character. These results are consistent with 1H NMR studies of the first zinc bundle of CH1 (CH11); Hα secondary chemical shifts suggest that the domain is largely helical in nature. Finally, we demonstrate that the integrity of both zinc bundles in the CH1 domain of CBP is essential for its interaction with some partner proteins and for the transactivation activity of CH1 in cellular assays. Taken together, these results indicate that the zinc bundles of CBP constitute novel protein domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. The regulation of transcription is coordinated primarily by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that recognize elements within the promoters and enhancers of their target genes. Although the mechanisms by which DNA-binding proteins activate or repress transcription are not completely understood, these proteins often work by recruiting coactivators such as cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)1 and p300 (1.Chrivia J.C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The molecular mode of action of CBP is complex. It has been shown that it possesses intrinsic histone acetylase activity and that it is able to recruit P/CAF, another acetyl transferase (10.Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 11.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CBP is involved in the remodeling of chromatin, since it has been shown that the degree of histone acetylation significantly alters chromatin structure (12.Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CBP can interact directly with the basal transcriptional machinery (13.Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 14.Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), underlining its central role as a transcriptional adaptor. The intracellular concentration of CBP is thought to be limiting, and it has consequently been proposed that CBP may be instrumental in coordinating different signaling pathways. Thus, for example, the inhibitory effects of nuclear hormone receptors on AP-1 activity have been attributed to the competition between hormone receptors and Jun/Fos for CBP (15.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). CBP has consequently been termed a transcriptional cointegrator (15.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). One of the most remarkable properties of CBP is its ability to physically associate with and modulate the activity of so many different and apparently unrelated DNA-bound transcription factors. A diagram of CBP and some of its partner proteins is shown in Fig. 1. A substantial number of these partner proteins associate with either CH1 or CH3 or both. Almost nothing is known about the molecular nature of these CH1/CH3-mediated interactions, although other interactions made by CBP, such as that made with cAMP-response element-binding protein (which does not involve the Cys/His-rich domains), have been studied in some detail (1.Chrivia J.C.

Hoeger C. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In this case the solution structure of the complex formed between the KIX domain of CBP and the cAMP-response element-binding protein KID domain has been determined (18.Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The fact that CH1 and CH3 contain a large number of residues that are capable of chelating zinc ions has led to the suggestion that these domains may constitute zinc fingers (1.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 2.Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Many classes of zinc finger domains have been described and ascribed roles in nucleic acid binding, protein recognition, or both (19.Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20.Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, neither CH1 nor CH3 resemble any previously reported zinc-binding modules. In this study, we show that the CH1/CH3 regions of CBP proteins contain a highly conserved arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues. These regions can be broken down into discrete modules that each contain four putative metal-ligating residues and share the consensus sequence Cys-X 2–4-Cys-X 8–9-His-X 3-Cys. We have termed these modules “zinc bundles.” We show that chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to individual zinc bundles from both CH1 and CH3 are capable of forming stable secondary structure in the presence of Zn(II) and that this structure appears to contain a substantial degree of helical character. These results are consistent with 1H NMR studies of the first zinc bundle of CH1 (CH11); Hα secondary chemical shifts suggest that the domain is largely helical in nature. Finally, we demonstrate that the integrity of both zinc bundles in the CH1 domain of CBP is essential for its interaction with some partner proteins and for the transactivation activity of CH1 in cellular assays. Taken together, these results indicate that the zinc bundles of CBP constitute novel protein domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. We are grateful to Gerd Blobel and to members of our laboratories for helpful suggestions and careful reading of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1983357815,"The aim of this study was to define the structural elements that determine the differences in substrate recognition capacity of two protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), PTP1B and PTPα, both suggested to be negative regulators of insulin signaling. Since the Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 peptide is well recognized by PTP1B, but less efficiently by PTPα, it was chosen as a tool for these analyses. Cα regiovariation analyses and primary sequence alignments indicate that residues 47, 48, 258, and 259 (PTP1B numbering) define a selectivity-determining region. By analyzing a set of DADE(pY)L analogs with a series of PTP mutants in which these four residues were exchanged between PTP1B and PTPα, either in combination or alone, we here demonstrate that the key selectivity-determining residue is 259. In PTPα, this residue is a glutamine causing steric hindrance and in PTP1B a glycine allowing broad substrate recognition. Significantly, replacing Gln259 with a glycine almost turns PTPα into a PTP1B-like enzyme. By using a novel set of PTP inhibitors and x-ray crystallography, we further provide evidence that Gln259 in PTPα plays a dual role leading to restricted substrate recognition (directly via steric hindrance) and reduced catalytic activity (indirectly via Gln262). Both effects may indicate that PTPα regulates highly selective signal transduction processes.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). PTPs are a diverse family of intracellular and receptor-type enzymes that are characterized by one or two structurally conserved catalytic domain(s) of about 250 amino acid residues. The catalytic domain in intracellular PTPs is often associated with proximal or distal sequence homology containing regulatory elements such as SH2 and FERM domains (3.Chishti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M. Hanspal M. Jindal H. Liu S.C. Low P.S. Rouleau G.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Conboy J.G. Gascard P. Takakuwa Y. Huang S.C. Benz E.J. Bretscher A. Fehon R.G. Gusella A.F.

Sci. 1998; 23: 281-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) directing protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization, or enzyme stability. Most receptor-type PTPs contain two catalytic domains in their intracellular region and, in addition, have a single transmembrane region and an extracellular domain. The diversity of the extracellular domains suggests that these PTPs are regulated by specific extracellular ligands. The intricate regulation of signal transduction processes into temporarily and spatially ordered pathways requires recruitment of regulatory molecules, including PTPs, into macromolecular assemblies (reviewed in Ref. 4.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Thus, subcellular localization is considered to play a significant role in defining the substrates that are dephosphorylated by specific PTPs (5.Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence that substrate specificity is also conveyed directly by the catalytic domains of PTPs. Thus, several studies with synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates (6.Zhang Z.-Y. MacLean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7.Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. MacLean D. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12405-12412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or peptides containing nonhydrolyzable phosphotyrosine analogs (10.Huyer G. Jelly K. Moffat J. Zamboni R. Jia Z. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have shown significant preferences for specific residues adjacent to the phosphorylated tyrosine or Tyr(P) mimetic. One of the most convincing demonstrations of the functional importance of direct substrate recognition by PTPs came from recent studies of the highly homologous PTPs, SHP-1 and SHP-2. By using chimeric constructs of these two PTPs, Böhmer and co-workers (11.Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5966-5973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the differential interaction of SHP-1 and SHP-2 with the epidermal growth factor receptor is due to the specificity of the catalytic domains rather than the SH2 domains. In a detailed study of the influence of SHP-1 and SHP-2 onXenopus oocyte maturation, O'Reilly and Neel (12.O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that the most important substrate recognition elements reside in the catalytic domain. Furthermore, in a functional cell-based rescue assay, we found PTPα and PTPε to be the most efficient negative regulators of insulin signaling, whereas other receptor-type PTPs had little or no influence (13.Lammers R. Moller N.P.H. Ullrich A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14.Møller N.P.H. Møller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Finally, studies with so-called substrate-trapping mutants show selective substrate recognition that seems to be mediated by the catalytic domains (15.Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16.Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PTPs are generally considered potentially important therapeutic targets due to their pivotal roles as control elements in signal transduction pathways (17.Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As an example, several candidate PTPs have been proposed as negative regulators of the insulin receptor signaling pathway, including PTP1B and PTPα (reviewed in Ref. 18.Evans J.L. Jallal B. Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 1999; 8: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, selective inhibitors of these enzymes could potentially be useful in the treatment of diabetes. Recently, analysis of PTP1B knock-out mice (19.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) and treatment of diabetic ob/ob mice with selective PTP1B inhibitors (20.Wrobel J. Sredy J. Moxham C. Dietrich A. Li Z.N. Sawicki D.R. Seestaller L. Wu L. Katz A. Sullivan D. Tio C. Zhang Z.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3199-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) provided support for the view that PTP1B is a major regulator of insulin signaling. By using a structure-based design, we have recently been able to make selective, low molecular weight non-phosphorus PTP1B inhibitors. A basic nitrogen in the inhibitor forms a salt bridge with the selectivity-determining residue Asp48 in PTP1B. In other PTPs with an asparagine in the equivalent position, this basic nitrogen causes repulsion. The net effect is a remarkable selectivity for PTP1B (21.Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Branner S. Mortensen S.B. Peters G.H. Norris K. Olsen O.H. Jeppesen C.B. Lundt B.F. Ripka W. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10300-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacing the basic nitrogen in the inhibitor structure with an oxygen atom increased the potency of the inhibitor for all PTPs with an asparagine in position 48. In the present study, we decided to get further insight into the elements that determine the substrate specificity of different PTPs and, hence, by inference also information that can be used in structure-based design of selective inhibitors. In particular, we wanted to study the difference in substrate recognition of PTP1B and PTPα. Tyrosine-phosphorylated synthetic peptides have been used extensively to analyze the substrate specificity of PTPs. The peptide Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2, which is derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor, has been particularly useful. This peptide is well recognized by PTP1B but less efficiently by PTPα. Based on Cα regiovariation analyses and primary sequence alignments, we have previously identified regions in close proximity to the catalytic cleft that are likely to confer specificity onto PTPs. 2J. N. Andersen, O. H. Mortensen, G. H. Peters, P. G. Drake, N. K. Tonks, and N. P. H. Møller, manuscript in preparation. 2J. N. Andersen, O. H. Mortensen, G. H. Peters, P. G. Drake, N. K. Tonks, and N. P. H. Møller, manuscript in preparation. The combination of residues 47, 48, 258, and 259 (PTP1B numbering) might be a specificity-determining region. PTP1B and PTPα mutants, in which these four residues are exchanged either in combination or alone, were used to analyze the substrate specificity against Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 peptide and a set of analogs. Residue 259, which is a glutamine in PTPα and a glycine in PTP1B, was found to be a major determinant of substrate recognition capacity and hydrolysis. Phosphopeptides were purchased from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). The purity of the peptides was greater than 97%. Water was purified in a Millipore purification system (18 megohm-cm; Millipore Inc.). Glutathione-Sepharose, Sephadex G-25, Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, Mono Q, and Superdex 200 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. One volume of 10% (w/v) ammonium molybdate was mixed with 3 volumes of 0.2% (w/v) malachite green in 4n HCl. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the solution was filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter (Millex-GV). The solution was stored at 4 °C in a foil-wrapped container. Before usage, the solution was stirred for 30 min and filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter. All enzyme assays with synthetic peptide substrates were performed at a constant ionic strength of 100 mm using a three-components buffer system consisting of 50 mm Tris, 50 mm Bis-Tris, and 100 mm acetate (22.Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23.Ellis, K. J., and Morrison, J. F. (1982) Methods Enzymol. 405–426Google Scholar). The buffer contained 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (24, 25). Concentrations are given as final concentrations in the 75-μl assay. Cloning, expression, and purification of the catalytic domains of PTP1B (26.Chernoff J. Schievella A.R. Jost C.A. Erikson R.L. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) were done as described previously (28.Andersen H.S. Iversen L.F. Jeppesen C.B. Branner S. Norris K. Rasmussen H.B. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7101-7108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The following PTP mutants were made by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction using appropriate restriction sites for cloning purposes (29.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar): PTP1B to PTPα, (i) R47V, D48N, C258M, and G259Q; (ii) R47V and D48N; (iii) C258M and G259Q; and (iv) G259Q; PTPα to PTP1B (PTP1B numbering): (v) V47R, N48D, M258C, and Q259G; (vi) M258C and Q259G; and (vii) Q259G. All constructs were inserted into pGEX expression vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In addition, for x-ray protein crystallography the cDNA encoding the first 321 amino acids of PTP1B and the PTP1B(R47V,D48N,C258M,G259Q)mutant were inserted in the pET11a expression vector. All coding sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and the proteins for x-ray protein crystallography were done as described previously (28.Andersen H.S. Iversen L.F. Jeppesen C.B. Branner S. Norris K. Rasmussen H.B. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7101-7108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity was determined using the malachite green microtiter plate assay (30.Fisher D.K. Higgins T.J. Pharmacol. Res. 1994; 11: 759-763Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The catalytic reaction was performed in half-area 96-well plates (Costar) with a final volume of 75 μl. Both the reaction solution containing appropriate amounts of peptide and the diluted enzyme solution were temperature-equilibrated for at least 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was started by addition of PTP and terminated after 20 min by addition of 25 μl of malachite green solution. The plates were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with continuous shaking before measuring the absorbance in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at 620 nm. A standard curve of KH2PO4 used for calculating the release of inorganic phosphate in the samples was determined parallel to and on the same plate as the samples. Kinetic parameters were determined by a nonlinear least squares fit of the initial rates at various substrate concentrations to the Michaelis-Menten equation. In some of the kinetic experiments, the K m values of particular peptides were larger than the maximum substrate concentration used. WhenK m is much larger than the substrate concentration used, the Michaelis-Menten equation reduces to a first-order rate equation, where the catalytic efficiency can be obtained by linear least squares fitting of the rate of production versussubstrate concentration. The reported standard deviations are calculated from at least four independent experiments using the nonbiased method. The enzyme reactions were carried out using standard conditions essentially as described by Burke et al. (31.Burke T.R. Ye B. Yan X.J. Wang S.M. Jia Z.C. Chen L. Zhang Z.Y. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15989-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The assay conditions were as follows. Diluted inhibitors (6 different concentrations, 2-fold dilution) were added to the reaction mixtures containing different concentrations of the substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) (usual range, 0.16–10 mmfinal assay concentration). The buffer used (total volume, 100 μl) consisted of 100 mm sodium acetate, 50 mmsodium chloride, 0.1% (w/v) human serum albumin, 5 mmglutathione, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5. The reaction was started by addition of the enzyme and carried out in microtiter plates at 25 °C for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 1n NaOH. The enzyme activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm with appropriate corrections for absorbance of the compounds and p-NPP. The data were analyzed using nonlinear regression hyperbolic fit to classical Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic models. Inhibition is expressed as K i values in μm. A 10 mg/ml preparation of PTP1B(R47V,D48N,C258M,G259Q) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, and 3 mm dithiothreitol, was used for crystallization. Crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. A 1:10 (PTP1B(R47V,D48N,C258M,G259Q), compound 1) molar ratio mixture was prepared at least 1 h prior to crystallization. Two μl of PTP1B(R47V,D48N,C258M,G259Q)/compound 1 solution were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 0.1m Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 0.3–0.4 m sodium acetate or magnesium acetate, 12–16% polyethylene glycol 8000. The reservoir volume was 1 ml. Crystals grew to the size of 0.5 × 0.07 × 0.07 mm within 3 days. Data collection was performed at 100 K. The following cryo conditions were used: to the sitting drop 3 μl of 50% glycerol (containing 0.5 mmol of inhibitor) were added. The crystal was removed from the drop after 20 min and transferred to 50% glycerol (containing 0.5 mmol of inhibitor) for 5–10 s and flash-frozen. Data were collected using a mar345 image plate detector at the 711 beam line at the MAX-lab synchrotron facilities at Lund University (Sweden). A 1° oscillation was used for 60 images. A full data set to 2.1-Å resolution was obtained. The space group was determined to be P3121. Data processing was performed using Denzo, Scalepack, and the CCP4 program suite (32.Otwinowski Z.

Furthermore, alanine substitutions in the mutated positions were performed. All refinements were performed with Xplor. version 3.851 (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Interchanging cycles of model building using X-build (Molecular Simulations Inc.) and refinement were performed. The alanines for the mutated residues were substituted with the correct side chains and build into the 2F o − F c maps. The 2F o − F c maps were inspected by the use of X-ligand (Molecular Simulations Inc.) at a 1.3ς level for densities that could correspond to the structure of the inhibitor. A well suited inhibitor electron density was identified in the active site pocket, see Fig. 6 below. No other densities were identified to fit the inhibitor.

For further details see Table I. 2-(Oxalyl-amino)-4,7-dihydro-5H-thieno[2,3-c]thiopyran-3-carboxylic acid (compound 1, Fig. 1) was synthesized in the following way. Tetrahydro-thiopyran-4-one was treated under conditions described by Gewald et al. (35.Gewald K. Schinke E. Böttcher H. Chem.

The ester groups were cleaved using 25% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromentane, which afforded compound1. Compounds 2–4 were synthesized as described previously (28.Andersen H.S. Iversen L.F.

The goal of this study was to identify structural elements that are critically involved in determining the substrate specificity of PTPs. We have chosen to describe at the molecular level the difference in substrate recognition by two widely expressed PTPs, PTP1B and PTPα. Both enzymes have been implicated as negative regulators of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, and hence they are potential therapeutic targets in type 2 diabetes. An understanding of the difference in substrate recognition should assist in designing selective PTP inhibitors. Whereas PTP1B seems to recognize a broad variety of synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, PTPα shows limited recognition capability. The synthetic peptide Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 and analogs thereof have previously been used extensively to study substrate recognition by PTPs (36.Wu L. Buist A. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6994-7002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present context it is of significance that this peptide is recognized well by PTP1B but not by PTPα (6.Zhang Z.-Y. MacLean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7.Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. MacLean D. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 peptide offers a unique possibility for identifying key structural elements that determine the differences in substrate recognition by PTP1B and PTPα. In accordance with previous studies, we found that PTP1B dephosphorylates this peptide about 30 times more efficiently than PTPα (Table II).Table IIKinetic constants for the hydrolysis of Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 with PTP1B, PTPα, and PTP1B(R47V,D48N,M258C,G259Q) at pH 5.5, 30 °CEnzymek catK mk cat/K m · 10−3s−1μmm −1 s −1PTP1B33.6 ± 0.622.8 ± 1.51475PTPα9.9 ± 1.9219.6 ± 58.245PTP1B(R47V,D48N,M258C,G259Q)11.6 ± 2.863.8 ± 15.3181 Open table in a new tab By using primary sequence alignments and Cα regiovariation-score analyses, we have previously identified residues 47, 48, 258, and 259 (PTP1B numbering) as a potential selectivity determining area of PTPs.2 To get initial insight into the significance of this region for substrate recognition, we first made a PTP1B mutant in which these four amino acid residues were substituted for the corresponding residues in PTPα (i.e.Arg-Asp-Met-Gly to Val-Asn-Cys-Gln). Table II shows that introduction of the putative selectivity-determining residues from PTPα into PTP1B caused a remarkable decrease in activity against the Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 peptide. Importantly, x-ray crystallography of this mutant shows that the overall folding and structure is similar to that of the wild type enzyme (see below). Thus, the observed differences in K m andk cat values are due to the introduction of the four “PTPα residues” into PTP1B thereby providing significant support for the view that these four residues are critically involved in the substrate recognition capacity and hydrolysis. To dissect further the role of the individual amino acid residues in the putative selectivity-determining region, we next introduced either residues 47–48 or 258–259 from PTPα into PTP1B. Table III shows that the replacement of residues 47–48 resulted in a 1.5-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m), whereas the introduction of residues 258–259 reduced the overall catalytic efficiency about 4-fold. In comparison to the wild type enzyme, the lower catalytic efficiency for PTP1B(R47V,D48N) is due to the 1.4-fold reduction in the turnover number (Table III), whereasK m is apparently not affected by these mutations. In contrast, introduction of a cysteine (residue 258) and a glutamine (residue 259) resulted in an almost 2-fold increase inK m value. Thus, when comparing the PTP1B(R47V,D48N) and PTP1B(M258C,G259Q)mutants, it seems that the region comprising residues 258–259 is the most important determinant for the catalytic efficiencies of these enzymes toward the DADE(pY)L peptide. Hence, we decided to focus our attention on residues 258 and 259.Table IIIKinetic constants for the hydrolysis of Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 with PTP1B, PTP1B(R47V,D48N), and PTP1B(M258C,G259Q) at pH 5.5, 30 °CEnzymek catK mk cat/K m · 10−3s −1μmm −1 s −1PTP1B33.6 ± 0.622.8 ± 1.51475PTP1B(R47V,D48N)23.9 ± 4.324.6 ± 3.5973PTP1B(M258C,G259Q)15.2 ± 1.342.4 ± 4.4358 Open table in a new tab The published x-ray structure of PTP1B co-crystallized with the DADE(pY)L-NH2 peptide shows that the leucine residue (pY+1) is located on a hydrophobic region of the protein surface forming van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Val49, Ile219, and Gln262. In addition, a water-mediated hydrogen bond was observed between the pY+1 amide group and the side chain of Gln262. Since these residues are positioned adjacent to Gly259 and Met258, we reasoned that in particular introduction of the corresponding residues from PTPα into PTP1B could influence/impair the interaction of the pY+1 residue with PTP1B. Indeed, Cys258 and Gln259 seemed to be responsible for the limited catalytic activity against the Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2peptide of the PTP1B(M258C,G259Q) mutant and possibly PTPα (Table III). It should be noted that previous studies with murine PTPα have shown that thek cat/K m value for DADE(pY)-NH2 is about 3-fold higher than for DADE(pY)L-NH2, thus indicating a negative influence of the pY+1 residue (36.Wu L. Buist A. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6994-7002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, to study in closer detail the influence of the pY+1 position on substrate recognition by PTP1B, we compared a series of Ac-DADE(pY)L-NH2 analogs as shown in Fig.2. Although some differences are observed, the wild type enzyme in general seemed to be influenced very little by the actual pY+1 residue, probably indicating that the contribution of this residue to the overall binding affinity is mainly due to the above water-mediated hydrogen bond to Gln262. By introduction of residues 258–259 from PTPα into PTP1B, a significant increase in K m and a corresponding decrease ink cat/K m values were observed for all peptides. It is particularly noteworthy that the effects of the pY+1 residues seem to be independent of charge, suggesting that structural constraints are important in determining substrate specificity. In contrast to PTP1B, the peptide side chain of the pY+1 residue had significant influence"
https://openalex.org/W1970384874,"Evidence indicates that neuronally released thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is selectively inactivated by TRH-degrading ectoenzyme (TRH-DE) (EC 3.4.19.6). TRH-DE inhibitors may be used to enhance the therapeutic actions of TRH and to investigate the functions of TRH and TRH-DE in the central nervous system. Although TRH-DE appears to exhibit a high degree of specificity toward TRH, systematic specificity studies, which would facilitate inhibitor design, have not been previously conducted for this enzyme. In this paper we present the first description of TRH-DE specificity across a directed peptide library in which the histidyl (P1′) residue of TRH was replaced by a series of amino acids. Peptides were synthesized using standard solid phase chemistry. Kinetic parameters were measured either by continuous or discontinuous fluorometric assays or by quantitative high pressure liquid chromatography. The P1′ residue was found to influence significantly both the ability of the peptides to bind to TRH-DE, as measured by theirK i values, and the ability of TRH-DE to catalyze their hydrolysis. Moderately bulky, uncharged P1′ residues were found to bind preferentially to TRH-DE. Results from this screen provide valuable information for the development of TRH-DE inhibitors and have led to the identification of two potent, reversible TRH-DE inhibitors,l-pyroglutamyl-l-asparaginyl-l-prolineamide (K i = 17.5 μm) and Glp-Asn-Pro-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (K i = 0.97 μm).

All amino acids are in the l configuration unless otherwise stated Thyrotropin-releasing hormone-degrading ectoenzyme (TRH-DE)1 (EC 3.4.19.6) is a type II cell surface peptidase located on synaptosomal membranes in the central nervous system (1−4). TRH-DE catalyzes the hydrolysis of the Glp-His bond in thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a tripeptide with the amino acid sequencel-pyroglutamyl-l-histidyl-l-prolineamide (Glp-His-ProNH2) (5−10). This enzyme is strategically placed to play a significant role in extracellular inactivation of TRH, and current evidence strongly indicates that TRH-DE is the principal enzyme responsible for terminating the actions of neuronally released TRH (11−14). Although first recognized as a hypothalamic regulatory hormone, TRH is now believed to function as a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator within the central nervous system (15.Griffiths E.C. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1985; 10: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16.Horita A. Carino M.A. Lai H. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) where it displays a broad spectrum of stimulatory actions independent of its neuroendocrine functions (15−17). Based on its central nervous system effects, TRH has been found to have potential use in the treatment of brain and spinal injury (18.Faden A.I. Fox G.B. Fan L. Araldi G.L. Qiao L. Wang S. Kozikowski A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1196-R1204PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Faden A.I. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 78: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and several central nervous system disorders, including spinocerebellar degeneration, cognitive deficits, and spinal cord pain transmission (16.Horita A. Carino M.A. Lai H. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17.Horita A. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which TRH improves these conditions are not fully elucidated but appear to involve the potentiation by TRH of other neurotransmitter systems. Despite its promise, the use of TRH as a therapeutic agent is critically undermined by its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation (20.Kelly J.A. Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 133-149PubMed Google Scholar). Compounds that potently and selectively inhibit TRH-DE may be used to enhance the therapeutic actions of TRH in the central nervous system by either potentiating endogenous TRH and/or protecting exogenously administered TRH or TRH analogs from degradation. TRH-DE inhibitors may also be powerful tools for investigating the respective biological roles of TRH-DE and TRH within the central nervous system (13.Bauer K. Heuer H. Ifflander F. Schmitmeier S.

TRH-DE appears to be an exceptional example of a neuropeptide-specific peptidase (23.Turner A.J. Kenny A.J. Boustead C.M. Cell-Surface Peptidases in Health and Disease. BIOS Scientific Publishers Limited, Oxford, U. K.1997: 275-301Google Scholar) because no other ectopeptidase has been shown to be capable of degrading TRH, and TRH-DE appears to exhibit remarkable specificity for TRH (24.Heuer H. Schäfer M.K.H. Bauer K. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This peptidase does not catalyze the hydrolysis of other, larger neuropeptides that also contain an NH2-terminal Glp residue, such as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, neurotensin, bombesin, and gastrin (5, 8−10). With this unusual dual selectivity, TRH-DE is more similar to acetylcholinesterase than to angiotensin-converting enzyme. Inhibition of TRH-DE as a means of enhancing TRH signaling is attractive because it should affect TRH signals exclusively, and consequently it may offer significant investigative and therapeutic advantages. On the other hand, the design of TRH-DE inhibitors is made difficult by the narrow specificity of this enzyme (13.Bauer K. Heuer H. Ifflander F. Schmitmeier S. Schomburg L. Turwitt S. Wilkins M. Kenny A.J. Boustead C.M. Cell-Surface Peptidases in Health and Disease. BIOS Scientific Publishers Limited, Oxford, U. K.1997: 239-248Google Scholar). Only a few inhibitors have been synthesized so far which exhibit a significant effect on TRH-DE activity in vitro, none of which has been found to be sufficiently effective for pharmacological studies in vivo (13.Bauer K.

With a K iof 8 μm,N-[1-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]N-imidazole benzyl histidyl-β-naphthylamide (CPHNA) appears to be the most potent of these (21.Charli J.-L. Mendez M. Vargas M.-A. Cisneros M. Assai M. Joseph-Bravo P. Wilk S. Neuropeptides. 1989; 14: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CPHNA has been shown to increase the recovery of TRH released from rat brain slices, indicating that TRH levels, and thus, TRH neurotransmission, may be increased through TRH-DE inhibition (21.Charli J.-L.

Cell-Surface Peptidases in Health and Disease. BIOS Scientific Publishers Limited, Oxford, U. K.1997: 239-248Google Scholar). The design of TRH-DE inhibitors is hampered by the fact that a three-dimensional structure has not been ascertained for TRH-DE or the aminopeptidases A and N, with which, according to cDNA sequence analysis, TRH-DE shares approximately 30% homology (1.Schauder B. Schomburg L. Kohrle J. Bauer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9534-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the absence of a target structure, however, structure-activity studies to identify structural requirements for interaction with the enzyme's active site can be used as a basis for the rational design of enzyme inhibitors (25.Cushman D.W.

No systematic structure-activity studies of TRH-DE have been previously undertaken, and there is no active site model for TRH-DE. Thus, to date, there has been insufficient information to identify the structural features that need to be incorporated into TRH-DE inhibitors. Several investigators previously examined the ability of TRH derivatives, with modifications to TRH's COOH- and/or NH2-terminal residues, to act as substrates or inhibitors of TRH-DE (6.Wilk S. Wilk E.K. Neurochem. Int. 1989; 15: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8.Elmore M.A. Griffiths E.C. O'Connor B. O'Cuinn G.O.

None was found to inhibit TRH-DE activity to any significant extent. Until recently, a histidine residue in the P1′ position was thought to be essential for TRH-DE activity (5.O'Connor B. O'Cuinn G.

To investigate further the influence of P1′ residues on ligand binding and catalytic activity of TRH-DE and to facilitate the rational design of TRH-DE inhibitors, we have conducted kinetic studies on a directed peptide library in which the central histidyl residue of TRH was replaced by a series of amino acids.

Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were employed to investigate the kinetic properties of the peptide library rigorously. The data presented here provide the first illustration of TRH-DE specificity across a library of TRH-like peptides. Furthermore, two potent, reversible TRH-DE inhibitors were identified from the screen of this library. Pyroglutamyl-histidyl-prolylamido-4-methyl coumarin (TRHAMC) and 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (AMC) were purchased from Bachem U. K. Ltd. Glp-Asn-ProAMC was custom synthesized by the American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA). All other chemicals, except those specified below, were of analytical grade and obtained from either Sigma-Aldrich (Ireland) or Merck (Germany). Glp-His-ProNH2, Glp-Glu-ProNH2, and Glp-His-ProOH were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Glp-Gln-ProNH2 and Glp-Phe-ProNH2 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. (U. K). Glp-Asn-ProNH2, Glp-Tyr-ProNH2, and Glp-d-Asn-ProNH2 were obtained from the American Peptide Company in addition to being synthesized by the method described below. All other TRH-like peptides in the library were synthesized either manually using a bubbler system (for details, see Ref. 33.Walker B. Wisdom G.B. Peptide Antigens : A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, U. K.1994: 27-81Google Scholar) or using a Synergy Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, U. K.). In both cases, standard solid-phase Fmoc chemistry was employed (33.Walker B. Wisdom G.B. Peptide Antigens : A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, U. K.1994: 27-81Google Scholar). Pyroglutamic acid and Fmoc amino acid derivatives were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem U. K. Ltd. Trifunctional amino acids were obtained with side chain-protecting groups as follows: Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-d-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH, and Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH. Synthesis was carried out on Rink amide 4-methylbenzylhydrylamine resin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem U. K. Ltd.) with a loading capacity 0.64 mmol g−1. The resin was swollen usingN,N-dimethylformamide and deprotected with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. Coupling was performed twice for each amino acid using the Synergy Peptide Synthesizer and once when the bubbler system was employed. Three equivalents (i.e. 3-fold excess over the resin loading capacity) of each amino acid were coupled onto the resin with HBTU/HOBt/DIPEA (1:1:2 equivalents) at each step. No deprotection step was necessary after the coupling of pyroglutamic acid. On completion of peptide assembly, the resin was washed thoroughly with dichloromethane followed by methanol and allowed to dry overnight. In the absence of labile amino acids and side protection groups, cleavage of the peptide from the resin was achieved by placing the dry resin in a round bottomed flask and adding 95% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (10 ml/g of dry resin). This reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for approximately 1 h before filtering the suspension through a sintered glass funnel. Sequences containing Asn were deprotected and cleaved using a trifluoroacetic acid solution containing 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, and 2.5% triisopropylsilane (v/v/v). For sequences containing Ser, Trp, or Arg, cleavage/deprotection was achieved using reagent K (82.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% water, 5% thioanisole, 5% phenol, 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol, v/v/v/v/v) in place of trifluoroacetic acid (33.Walker B. Wisdom G.B. Peptide Antigens : A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, U. K.1994: 27-81Google Scholar,34.Dick F. Pennington M.W. Dunn B.N. Peptide Synthesis Protocols Methods in Molecular Biology. 35. Humana Press, Totowa, N. J.1994: 63-72Google Scholar). These small peptides proved difficult to precipitate directly from the filtrate using diethyl ether, so the trifluoroacetic acid and scavengers were first removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum. The residue was washed with petroleum ether. Diethyl ether was then added to the semisolid residue to crystallize the peptide. Because of the hygroscopic nature of these peptides during isolation, after decantation of the bulk of the solvent, a steady stream of nitrogen was used to evaporate the diethyl ether and to dry the peptide pellet simultaneously. The peptide pellets were dried thoroughly under nitrogen before transferring the dried material to preweighed glass containers for storage in a desiccator. After weighing the dried material, the peptides were stored at −20 °C. Stock solutions were prepared from this material. Peptides were analyzed and judged to be homogeneous by HPLC. HPLC analysis was conducted using a Thermo Separation Products Inc. Spectra System HPLC. Standard 1 mm solutions of each peptide in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, were analyzed on a C-18 reverse phase column (Hypersil U. K.) using a linear gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid as described previously (31.Kelly J.A. Loscher C.E. Gallagher S. O'Connor B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 114SCrossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). TRH-DE was purified almost 20,000-fold from porcine brain as described previously (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 35.Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A Coomassie-stained gel of the purified enzyme after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed one major band, the molecular mass of which was consistent with that of 116 kDa reported previously for TRH-DE (35.Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This highly purified TRH-DE preparation did not contain any of the various peptidase activities tested, including aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, and dipeptidyl aminopeptidases, and it was completely devoid of other TRH-degrading enzymes, including pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase I (EC 3.4.21.26) and prolyl oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.19.3) (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The preparation was found to have (i) a protein concentration of 0.8 mg ml−1 using a modification of the Lowry method (36.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and (ii) a specific activity of 0.17 unit mg−1 with TRHAMC as substrate under standard conditions of a continuous assay described previously (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and outlined below. Dipetidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) (EC 3.4.14.5) was purified 370-fold from bovine kidney (37.Brownlees J. Williams C.H. Brennan P. Halton D.W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and was found to have a protein concentration of 7.7 mg ml−1 using the method of Markwell et al. (38.Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). This preparation did not contain any measurable amount of either dipeptidase or oligopeptidase activity. The specific activity was 17.5 units mg−1 with Gly-ProAMC as substrate (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). 1 unit of enzyme activity was defined as that amount catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of product in 1 min under the standard conditions employed. All incubations in the assays described below were carried out in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer fitted with a thermostatted cell holder. Wavelengths for excitation and emission were set at 370 and 440 nm, respectively, with slit widths of 10 and 5 nm, respectively. The ability of each peptide in the library to act as a TRH-DE substrate was assessed using HPLC. As an initial screen, 1 mm peptide was incubated with 0.8 μg of TRH-DE in a total volume of 1 ml for 18 h at 37 °C. Control samples were included in which peptide (1 mm) or Glp (0.2–0.8 mm) was incubated under identical conditions in the absence of TRH-DE. TRH-DE activity was terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (0.15%, v/v), and samples were then analyzed using HPLC as described previously (31.Kelly J.A. Loscher C.E. Gallagher S. O'Connor B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 114SCrossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Products resulting from TRH-DE hydrolysis were separated on a C-18 reverse phase column using a linear gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The concentration of Glp formed by the action of TRH-DE on the peptide library was measured by UV absorbance at 206 nm with a quantitative detection limit of 0.1 mm for a 40-μl injection volume, employing a signal to noise ratio of 10. Following the incubation of each peptide with TRH-DE, evidence of Glp in the sample was taken to indicate that the peptide was a TRH-DE substrate. The rates of hydrolysis for each of those peptides identified as substrates were then compared by measuring Glp production using microassays with shorter incubation times (39.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Bauer K. Abstr. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73 (suppl.): S45AGoogle Scholar). In these assays, peptide (1 mm) was incubated at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl, and incubation times and TRH-DE concentration were adjusted to produce a detectable amount of Glp while remaining within the initial rate period of the reaction. Typically, 0.8–3.2 μg of TRH-DE and incubations times of 5 min to 18 h were used. Measurements were made in triplicate. The rate of TRH-OH hydrolysis was also measured by this method. The HPLC assay lacked sufficient sensitivity for determining kinetic constants. Therefore, those peptides undergoing significant hydrolysis (i.e. those that exhibited rates of hydrolysis ≥ 0.5 unit mg−1) were examined as competitive substrates of TRH-DE using a recently published discontinuous fluorometric TRH-DE assay (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This assay employs TRHAMC as the substrate and depends on the measurement of the fluorescence of AMC produced as shown in Reactions 1 and 2. Glp­His­Pro­AMC →TRH­DE His­Pro­AMC His­Pro­AMC →(cyclization)5 h,80°C His­ProDKP+AMC REACTIONS 1 AND 2We have shown that the amount of AMC formed under these conditions is a quantitative measure of TRHAMC cleavage (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Initial rates for the hydrolysis of TRHAMC by TRH-DE were determined in triplicate at five different substrate concentrations, both in the absence and presence of at least three concentrations of peptide.K i values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of the data collected. When determined in this way (i.e. by treating the peptide substrates as inhibitors of TRHAMC hydrolysis), these K i values correspond to the Michaelis constants for those library peptides hydrolyzed by TRH-DE (40.Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Longman, London1979: 72-75Google Scholar). A recently developed continuous coupled fluorometric assay (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was used to investigate the ability of those library peptides that were not hydrolyzed by TRH-DE to inhibit TRHAMC degradation by TRH-DE. Glp-Asn-ProAMC was also included in this study. In this assay, TRHAMC is the substrate, and DPP-IV is the coupling enzyme. The sequence is shown in Reaction 3. Glp­His­Pro­AMC →TRH­DE His­Pro­AMC →DPP­IV His­Pro+AMC REACTION 3The reaction was monitored continuously by measuring the increase in AMC fluorescence. A linear progress curve with no discernible lag period was observed when the reaction was monitored over a period of 10 min. Nevertheless, data sampling was not commenced until 100 s from the start of the reaction to ensure that measurements were taken after a steady state had been reached (see Ref.32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This continuous assay permits accurate assessment of nonlinear progress curves that may arise in the presence of tight binding inhibitors. In a preliminary experiment, the peptides were screened for their ability to inhibit TRH-DE activity. The initial rate of TRHAMC hydrolysis by TRH-DE was measured by incubating 5 μmTRHAMC with 1.23 μg of DPP-IV and 0.32 μg of TRH-DE, both in the absence and presence of each library peptide (1 mm final concentration) under standard assay conditions (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Peptides showing < 20% inhibition (K i > 1 mm) were not examined further. The K ivalues for the remainder of the peptides were determined by measuring their effects on TRHAMC degradation by TRH-DE using the continuous assay. Data were collected in duplicate at five different substrate concentrations and at least three different concentrations of each peptide. All peptides that were observed to inhibit AMC production in the continuous coupled assay were assessed for their ability to inhibit the coupling enzyme, DPP-IV, using a direct continuous assay for DPP-IV which employed Gly-ProAMC as the substrate (32.Kelly J.A. Slator G.R. Tipton K.F. Williams C.H. Bauer K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Peptide concentrations similar to those used to determine the K i values above were employed in the DPP-IV assay. None of these peptides was found to inhibit DPP-IV hydrolysis of Gly-ProAMC. Thus, the effects produced by the peptides can be attributed solely to their inhibition of TRH-DE. Reversibility and time dependence of the inhibition produced by Glp-Gln-ProNH2, Glp-Asn-ProNH2, and Glp-Asn-ProAMC were examined by initially preincubating TRH-DE with each peptide at 37 °C for various periods up to 75 min. To investigate time dependence, the enzyme-peptide solution was subsequently added to a reaction mixture containing TRHAMC, DPP-IV, buffer, and peptide, and TRH-DE activity was measured using the continuous assay. The final concentration of Glp-Gln-ProNH2, Glp-Asn-ProNH2, and Glp-Asn-ProAMC used was 400, 160, and 1 μm, respectively. To test for reversibility, the enzyme-peptide solution was added to a reaction mixture that did not contain peptide. TRH-DE activity was not affected by preincubation at 37 °C. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using the computer program Prism (Graph Pad Software Inc.). Linear regression analysis employing proportional weighting was used to fit data to linear plots for display purposes only. Unless otherwise stated, all values are shown as"

Targeting of the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) relies on multiple signals within the protein, including twelve C-terminal amino acids.

The postsynaptic density (PSD)1 is an electron-dense cytoskeletal structure beneath the plasma membrane of excitatory synapses where neurotransmitter receptors and signaling molecules aggregate to respond to synaptic stimuli. Biochemical studies have helped to define the protein composition of the PSD, but the mechanisms for targeting and assembly of these protein complexes are just beginning to be elucidated. Some components of the PSD may be recruited into signaling networks by the PSD-95 family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins (1.Craven S.E. Bredt D.S.

Membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins also contain an orphan Src homology 3 domain and a C-terminal guanylate kinase-like domain, which binds proteins of the neuronal cytoskeleton (8.Kim E.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1805-1813Crossref Google Scholar). Postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 relies on multiple signals within the protein including N-terminal palmitoylation, the first and second PDZ domains, and a 12-amino acid C-terminal targeting domain (12.Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13.Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which palmitoylation and the PDZ domains contribute to postsynaptic targeting likely involve membrane association and protein-protein interactions, respectively. However, the mechanism by which the C-terminal domain regulates targeting is unknown.The presence of a C-terminal targeting domain in PSD-95 is reminiscent of cytosolic C-terminal motifs in integral membrane proteins that mediate a diverse set of intracellular sorting events, including endocytosis from the plasma membrane and targeting to endosomes, lysosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the basolateral and dendritic plasma membrane (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 15.Jareb M. Bankers G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A subset of these C-terminal sorting signals contain a critical tyrosine residue and conform to the motif YXXΦ, where Y is a tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid. These tyrosine motifs interact directly with the medium chain of the clathrin adaptor proteins 1 and 2 to assemble clathrin-coated transport vesicles (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar,16.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95 contains a similar tyrosine motif.Here we define the functional signals within the C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95. We find that postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 in cultured hippocampal neurons requires the C-terminal YXXΦ tyrosine motif as well as a nearby pair of hydrophobic amino acids. When appended to an integral membrane protein, the tyrosine-based signal of PSD-95 is sufficient to mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Systematic mutagenesis of the C terminus indicates a strict correlation between postsynaptic targeting and endocytosis, suggesting that a tyrosine-based signal able to mediate clathrin-coated vesicle formation participates in postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95.DISCUSSIONProper postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 requires a C-terminal targeting domain between amino acids 700 and 711 (12; Fig.1 A). The important targeting signal within this domain is a tyrosine-based motif, YXXΦ, followed by a pair of hydrophobic amino acids. This motif is functionally conserved in other PSD-95 family members and is sufficient to confer clathrin-mediated endocytosis on a transmembrane receptor. Mutagenesis of the C terminus indicates a tight correlation between postsynaptic targeting and endocytosis. These data suggest that cellular trafficking of PSD-95, and likely PSD-95 homologs, involves a tyrosine-based signal that can mediate clathrin-dependent vesicular transport.Protein sorting signals often consist of either a tyrosine-based motif or a dileucine motif (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Though some proteins contain both motifs, either motif can be sufficient to mediate protein internalization from the plasma membrane (21.Letourner F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Thus it is unusual that endocytosis mediated by the C-terminal trafficking signal of PSD-95 requires both a tyrosine motif and a pair of hydrophobic amino acids that superficially resemble a dileucine motif. Perhaps both these motifs in PSD-95 have weak affinities for the clathrin adaptor proteins so that a combination of both is necessary for internalization to occur. Alternatively, because the presence of both a tyrosine and a dileucine motif can result in protein sorting that differs from sorting that occurs with either motif alone (21.Letourner F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), the combination within PSD-95 may be key for protein trafficking that contributes to postsynaptic targeting.Attempts to establish a direct link between postsynaptic targeting and clathrin-mediated trafficking were unsuccessful. Overexpression of dominant negative (K44A) dynamin has no effect on postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95. 2S. E. Craven and D. S. Bredt, unpublished results. However, dynamin may participate in clathrin-dependent transport solely from the plasma membrane (22.Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) leaving open the possibility that the tyrosine-based signal of PSD-95 is involved in clathrin-mediated intracellular trafficking. To evaluate this possibility, we overexpressed the clathrin hub domain to act as a dominant negative inhibitor of all clathrin coat formation (23.Liu S.-H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), yet we found no effect on targeting of PSD-95.2 One caveat is that cells overexpressing dominant negative dynamin or the clathrin hub may compensate for the loss of clathrin-dependent endocytosis by inducing an alternative endocytic pathway (24.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we co-transfected mature neurons with the dominant negative proteins and PSD-95. However, PSD-95 overexpressed this way in mature neurons is not properly targeted to the synapse, precluding analysis of the dominant negative effects. This latter result may explain why a second group studying the postsynaptic targeting PSD-95 did not identify the C-terminal targeting motif (13.Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In their study, PSD-95 localization in cultured cortical slices was assessed 40 h post-infection, a time at which PSD-95 expression in our system is not fully synaptic.We were also unable to detect direct interactions between the C terminus of PSD-95 and clathrin adaptor proteins that must occur to mediate endocytosis. Yeast two-hybrid did not yield positive results, even when the motif was repeated three times in tandem (16.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar).2 However, a bait containing the PSD-95 motif did not express as highly in yeast as did that containing the tyrosine motif of TGN38, which served as a positive control. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from heterologous cells or directly from brain also failed to detect a direct interaction.2 However, because interactions with clathrin adaptors are transient, they may not be easily revealed by these methods.The strong correlation between the ability of the C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95 to mediate both postsynaptic targeting and receptor endocytosis suggests that clathrin-dependent trafficking is an important step in localizing PSD-95 to synapses. However, the relevance of clathrin-mediated transport for peripheral membrane proteins such as PSD-95 is not well established. One example is the cytosolic Nef protein of the Simian immunodeficiency virus, which interacts with clathrin adaptor protein 2 to internalize the transmembrane protein CD4 (25.Piquet V. Chen Y-L.

It is thought that viral Nef may mimic endogenous proteins involved in linking cell surface proteins to components of the endocytic machinery. We failed, however, to uncover evidence that PSD-95 facilitated the endocytosis of interacting membrane proteins such as the NMDA receptor or Kv1.4 potassium channel.2 Rather, a recent report suggests that palmitoylated PSD-95 suppresses the endocytosis of Kv1.4, whereas nonpalmitoylated PSD-95 can enhance endocytosis (26.Jugloff D.G.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that internalization mediated by PSD-95 is regulated by lipidation.Vesicle transport may play one of several possible roles in synaptic targeting of PSD-95. Membrane association of PSD-95 via palmitoylation may occur in the secretory pathway where sorting of many transmembrane proteins occurs (27.Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Indeed PSD-95 localizes to an intramembranous compartment that partially overlaps with the trans-Golgi and endosomal vesicles in heterologous cells and in developing neurons in culture (28.El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). PSD-95 may be sorted from these intracellular membranes into clathrin-coated vesicles for transport to the postsynaptic membrane. Alternatively, PSD-95 may target diffusely to the plasma membrane, and from there, clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles may mediate transport to the synapse. Because PSD-95 protein lacking the tyrosine-based targeting motif does accumulate at the synapse to some degree, there may be multiple mechanisms for synaptic localization with one dependent on and one independent of clathrin-dependent vesicular transport. Alternatively, this partial clustering may result from passive association of the PSD-95 C-terminal mutants with postsynaptic membranes rather than active targeting. Future research into the cellular trafficking of PSD-95 will help to differentiate between these models and to determine mechanisms by which additional postsynaptic proteins are targeted and assembled at the PSD. Proper synaptic function requires assembly of protein complexes at specialized pre- and postsynaptic membranes. The postsynaptic density (PSD)1 is an electron-dense cytoskeletal structure beneath the plasma membrane of excitatory synapses where neurotransmitter receptors and signaling molecules aggregate to respond to synaptic stimuli. Biochemical studies have helped to define the protein composition of the PSD, but the mechanisms for targeting and assembly of these protein complexes are just beginning to be elucidated. Some components of the PSD may be recruited into signaling networks by the PSD-95 family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins (1.Craven S.E. Bredt D.S.

Science. 1999; 284: 845-848Crossref Scopus (709) Google Scholar). PSD-95 and its homologs contain three PDZ protein-protein interaction motifs that bind to specific synaptic proteins includingN-methyl-d-aspartate- (NMDA) type glutamate receptors, Shaker-type K+ channels, and intracellular signaling enzymes (3.Kim E.

Membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins also contain an orphan Src homology 3 domain and a C-terminal guanylate kinase-like domain, which binds proteins of the neuronal cytoskeleton (8.Kim E.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1805-1813Crossref Google Scholar). Postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 relies on multiple signals within the protein including N-terminal palmitoylation, the first and second PDZ domains, and a 12-amino acid C-terminal targeting domain (12.Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13.Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which palmitoylation and the PDZ domains contribute to postsynaptic targeting likely involve membrane association and protein-protein interactions, respectively. However, the mechanism by which the C-terminal domain regulates targeting is unknown. The presence of a C-terminal targeting domain in PSD-95 is reminiscent of cytosolic C-terminal motifs in integral membrane proteins that mediate a diverse set of intracellular sorting events, including endocytosis from the plasma membrane and targeting to endosomes, lysosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the basolateral and dendritic plasma membrane (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 15.Jareb M. Bankers G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A subset of these C-terminal sorting signals contain a critical tyrosine residue and conform to the motif YXXΦ, where Y is a tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid. These tyrosine motifs interact directly with the medium chain of the clathrin adaptor proteins 1 and 2 to assemble clathrin-coated transport vesicles (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar,16.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95 contains a similar tyrosine motif. Here we define the functional signals within the C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95. We find that postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 in cultured hippocampal neurons requires the C-terminal YXXΦ tyrosine motif as well as a nearby pair of hydrophobic amino acids. When appended to an integral membrane protein, the tyrosine-based signal of PSD-95 is sufficient to mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Systematic mutagenesis of the C terminus indicates a strict correlation between postsynaptic targeting and endocytosis, suggesting that a tyrosine-based signal able to mediate clathrin-coated vesicle formation participates in postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95. DISCUSSIONProper postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 requires a C-terminal targeting domain between amino acids 700 and 711 (12; Fig.1 A). The important targeting signal within this domain is a tyrosine-based motif, YXXΦ, followed by a pair of hydrophobic amino acids. This motif is functionally conserved in other PSD-95 family members and is sufficient to confer clathrin-mediated endocytosis on a transmembrane receptor. Mutagenesis of the C terminus indicates a tight correlation between postsynaptic targeting and endocytosis. These data suggest that cellular trafficking of PSD-95, and likely PSD-95 homologs, involves a tyrosine-based signal that can mediate clathrin-dependent vesicular transport.Protein sorting signals often consist of either a tyrosine-based motif or a dileucine motif (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Though some proteins contain both motifs, either motif can be sufficient to mediate protein internalization from the plasma membrane (21.Letourner F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Thus it is unusual that endocytosis mediated by the C-terminal trafficking signal of PSD-95 requires both a tyrosine motif and a pair of hydrophobic amino acids that superficially resemble a dileucine motif. Perhaps both these motifs in PSD-95 have weak affinities for the clathrin adaptor proteins so that a combination of both is necessary for internalization to occur. Alternatively, because the presence of both a tyrosine and a dileucine motif can result in protein sorting that differs from sorting that occurs with either motif alone (21.Letourner F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), the combination within PSD-95 may be key for protein trafficking that contributes to postsynaptic targeting.Attempts to establish a direct link between postsynaptic targeting and clathrin-mediated trafficking were unsuccessful. Overexpression of dominant negative (K44A) dynamin has no effect on postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95. 2S. E. Craven and D. S. Bredt, unpublished results. However, dynamin may participate in clathrin-dependent transport solely from the plasma membrane (22.Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) leaving open the possibility that the tyrosine-based signal of PSD-95 is involved in clathrin-mediated intracellular trafficking. To evaluate this possibility, we overexpressed the clathrin hub domain to act as a dominant negative inhibitor of all clathrin coat formation (23.Liu S.-H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), yet we found no effect on targeting of PSD-95.2 One caveat is that cells overexpressing dominant negative dynamin or the clathrin hub may compensate for the loss of clathrin-dependent endocytosis by inducing an alternative endocytic pathway (24.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we co-transfected mature neurons with the dominant negative proteins and PSD-95. However, PSD-95 overexpressed this way in mature neurons is not properly targeted to the synapse, precluding analysis of the dominant negative effects. This latter result may explain why a second group studying the postsynaptic targeting PSD-95 did not identify the C-terminal targeting motif (13.Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In their study, PSD-95 localization in cultured cortical slices was assessed 40 h post-infection, a time at which PSD-95 expression in our system is not fully synaptic.We were also unable to detect direct interactions between the C terminus of PSD-95 and clathrin adaptor proteins that must occur to mediate endocytosis. Yeast two-hybrid did not yield positive results, even when the motif was repeated three times in tandem (16.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar).2 However, a bait containing the PSD-95 motif did not express as highly in yeast as did that containing the tyrosine motif of TGN38, which served as a positive control. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from heterologous cells or directly from brain also failed to detect a direct interaction.2 However, because interactions with clathrin adaptors are transient, they may not be easily revealed by these methods.The strong correlation between the ability of the C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95 to mediate both postsynaptic targeting and receptor endocytosis suggests that clathrin-dependent trafficking is an important step in localizing PSD-95 to synapses. However, the relevance of clathrin-mediated transport for peripheral membrane proteins such as PSD-95 is not well established. One example is the cytosolic Nef protein of the Simian immunodeficiency virus, which interacts with clathrin adaptor protein 2 to internalize the transmembrane protein CD4 (25.Piquet V. Chen Y-L.

Stat1 acquires the ability to bind DNA by becoming phosphorylated on Tyr701. However, to effectively stimulate gene transcription, it must also be phosphorylated on Ser727. We show that engagement of T cell antigen receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex in either Jurkat cells or peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulates phosphorylation of Ser727 but not Tyr701 of Stat1. This process does not require the expression of tyrosine kinases Lck and Zap-70. Interestingly, pretreatment of T cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 completely abrogated CD3-mediated serine phosphorylation of Stat1, whereas inhibitors to MEK1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase had no effect. Phosphorylation of Ser727 of Stat1 in T cells is not restricted to TCR/CD3 but also results when cells are stimulated via the costimulatory molecule CD28. The combination of CD3 and CD28 did not augment phosphorylation of Stat1 Ser727. Surprisingly, Stat1-mediated transcriptional activity in response to IFN-α was enhanced with CD3 stimulation, whereas CD3 alone had little effect. These findings suggest that Stat1 is a signaling molecule in TCR signaling and may play a role in T cell function.

One of the earliest detectable events in this process is the rapid activation of several protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) including Fyn, Lck, and Zap-70 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase, CD45. Ultimately, transcription factors become activated and initiate gene expression critical for T cell activation and survival (1.Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Lck and Fyn are two critical cytoplasmic PTKs of the Src family involved in T cell maturation. Both PTKs can partially substitute for the activity of each other. Mice deficient in Lck show a profound block in T cell development at the early double positive CD4+/CD8+ stage (3.Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E.

Interestingly, mice lacking both Lck and Fyn display a complete block in T cell maturation at two stages: CD4−/CD8− to CD4+/CD8+ and CD4+/CD8+to CD4+ and CD8+ (5.van Oers N.S. Lowin-Kropf B.

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) become activated in response to cytokines, growth factors, and osmotic stress (10.Darnell Jr., J.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, Janus family PTKs (Jaks) become activated and tyrosine phosphorylate Stats. This allows Stats to dimerize through Src homology 2 phosphotyrosine and translocate to the nucleus where they are able to bind DNA and regulate gene transcription (10.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Ser727 is conserved in the transactivation domains of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat4. This site contains a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) recognition motif, PX n(S/T)P (n = 1 or 2) that must be phosphorylated for Stats to gain maximal transcriptional activity (12.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Cytokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats can occur independently of serine phosphorylation (13.Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The identity of the Stat serine kinase has remained elusive. Both ERK2 and p38 MAPK have been shown to be activated in response to IFNs, and dominant negative forms of these proteins can inhibit transcriptional reporter activity of Stat1 (14.David M.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). T cells in mice deficient in Stat4 and Stat6 are impaired in the development of Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively (17.Thierfelder W.E. van Deursen J.M. Yamamoto K. Tripp R.A. Sarawar S.R.

Nature. 1996; 32: 174-177Crossref Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Stimulation of T lymphoblasts via their TCR receptor has been shown to induce serine but not tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (19.Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways (19.Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, a different study showed that stimulation of an allogen-specific CD4+ human T cell line with anti-CD3 antibody or bacterial superantigen triggered both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 with similar kinetics (20.Gerwien J. Nielsen M. Labuda T. Nissen M.H. Svejgaard A. Geisler C. Ropke C. Odum N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1742-1745PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD3 stimulation of murine T cells triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5, a process mediated by the Src kinase Lck, and this stimulation induces transient association of Stat5 with the TCR (21.Welte T. Leitenberg D. Dittel B.N. al-Ramadi B.K. Xie B. Chin Y.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Bothwell A.L.M. Bottomly K. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1999; 283: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we show that signaling through the TCR/CD3 and CD28 costimulation induces serine but not tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in Jurkat cells, a human T cell leukemia line. This observation can be seen in nontransformed naive, primary human T cells. Phosphorylation of Ser727 of Stat1 can be effectively blocked by the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 in response to TCR/CD3 stimulation and occurs independently of Lck and Zap-70 tyrosine kinases. Moreover, CD3 stimulation augments Stat1-dependent gene transcription in response to IFN-α. These results suggest that Stat1 is another component in T cell signal transduction pathways. The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat, subclone E6, mutant lines derived from this clone, Lck-deficient (J.Cam.1.6), (a gift from A. Weiss, UCSF, San Francisco, CA) and Zap-70-deficient (P116) (a gift from R. Abraham, Duke University, Durham, NC), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (10 units/ml) and streptomycin (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by removal of monocytes by plastic adherence at 37 °C. Antiserum that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of serine 727 of Stat1 was used at 1:10000 dilution (a generous gift of D. Frank, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Phosphospecific antibodies against tyrosine 701 of Stat1 and active ERK1/2 were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) and used at 1:2000 dilution. Monoclonal antibodies to Stat1 and pan-ERK were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and used at 1:1000 dilution. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3 was from Ortho Biotech, Inc. (Raritan, NJ). Anti-CD28 was purchased from Pharmingen (Palo Alto, CA). The inhibitors H7, PD98059, U0126, PP1, SB203580, wortmannin, and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). For TCR/CD3 stimulation, cells were left untreated or incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-CD3 OKT3 antibody. For CD28 stimulation, a final dilution of 1:200 dilution of CD28 antibody was used. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C followed by addition of 10 μg/ml of anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at 37 °C for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were treated for 30 min at 37 °C prior to CD3 stimulation with MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm), p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm), MEK1 inhibitor U0126 (10 μm), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 (10 μm), wortmannin (100 nm), serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7 (50 μm), or Src kinase inhibitor PPI (10 μm). Cells were then washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate. Lysates were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min, and insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins (30 μg of whole cell extract) were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies using concentrations and conditions recommended by manufacturers. Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Jurkat cells were transiently transfected using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with 2 μg of 3 × IRF-GAS luciferase reporter plasmid. To normalize for luciferase activity and control for transfection efficiency, 0.5 μg of pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) was also included. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were left untreated or stimulated with anti-CD3 OKT3 antibody as described above, IFN-α or the combination of anti-CD3 plus IFN-α for 6 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured with a Luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) using the dual luciferase reporter system according to the manufacturer (Promega). The participation of Stat transcription factors in TCR signaling was unknown until it was discovered that Stat3 and Stat5 become activated in response to TCR/CD3 stimulation (19.Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21.Welte T. Leitenberg D. Dittel B.N. al-Ramadi B.K. Xie B. Chin Y.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Bothwell A.L.M. Bottomly K. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1999; 283: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We set out to examine whether TCR/CD3 stimulation may also lead to activation of Stat1 in T cells because this transcription factor is critical in the generation of antiviral and antibacterial responses as demonstrated in mice deficient in Stat1 gene, suggesting a defect in T cell-mediated immunity (22.Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 23.Rodig S.J. Meraz M.A. White J.M. Lampe P.A. Riley J.K. Arthur C.D.

To address this, Jurkat cells were stimulated by cross-linking with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3), which mimics TCR activation. Total cell extracts were prepared and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The serine phosphorylation status of Stat1 was monitored by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes Stat1 phosphorylated on Ser727. As shown in Fig.1 A, serine phosphorylated Stat1 was detected as early as 15 min after CD3 stimulation of Jurkat cells, and this form of Stat1 continued to be activated up to 1 h. Reprobing the blots for Stat1 demonstrates that equal amounts of the protein are present in all the samples (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). Despite the extensive use of Jurkat cells as a model to study TCR signaling pathways, these cells are transformed and grow in the absence of exogenous growth factors. We wanted to extend our observations to a more physiological relevant T cell; therefore we assayed PBLs from normal volunteers to determine whether Stat1 was serine phosphorylated in response to CD3 stimulation. PBLs were incubated for various times with anti-CD3, and whole cell extracts were analyzed for phosphorylation of Ser727 of Stat1 (Fig.1 B). Detection of phosphorylated Stat1 on Ser727with similar kinetics as seen with Jurkat cells was observed as early as 15 min, and the signal was sustained up to 1 h post-stimulation. IFNs activate serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. We decided to examine whether the level of activation of serine phosphorylation of Stat1 induced after CD3 stimulation was similar to that of IFN stimulation. PBLs were stimulated with either CD3 antibody or IFN-α for 30 min. Serine phosphorylation of Stat1 in whole cell extracts prepared from these cells was analyzed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 C, CD3 stimulation induced phosphorylation of Ser727 of Stat1 with similar levels to those detected with IFN-α treatment. Previous studies have shown that Stat3 becomes phosphorylated on Ser727 after TCR stimulation. However, there are conflicting data about whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 occurs in T cells (19.Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20.Gerwien J. Nielsen M. Labuda T. Nissen M.H. Svejgaard A. Geisler C. Ropke C. Odum N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1742-1745PubMed Google Scholar). In light of this observation, we decided to examine whether CD3 stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in Jurkat cells by immunoblot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies that recognize only the tyrosine phosphorylated form of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 D, CD3-mediated T cell activation failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 over a course of 1 h. The lack of Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to a defect in Stat activation in these cells because treatment of Jurkat cells with IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 (Fig. 1 D). Similar results were obtained when normal PBLs were analyzed (Fig.2 B). This suggests that activation of the TCR complex only stimulates serine phosphorylation of Stat1. CD28 is a molecule expressed on T cells that provides a second signal to T cell activation when bound to its ligand, B7/CD80 (24.Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter H.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G. Leiden J.M. June C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). B7/CD28 interactions lead to cytokine gene expression and rescues T cells from entering an unresponsive state or anergy (25.Greenfield E.A. Nguyen K.A. Kuchroo V.K. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 389-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CD28 plays a pivotal role in T cell activation and is intimately linked with activation through the TCR, we set out to explore the possibility that stimulation through CD28 may also result in the activation of Stat1. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD28 antibody induced the phosphorylation of Ser727 Stat1 (Fig.2 A). The levels of phosphorylated Stat1 Ser727were similar to those observed with CD3 stimulation. No increase in the level of serine phosphorylation of Stat1 was observed by the combination of CD3+CD28 stimulation (lanes 2 and3 versus lane 4). The kinetics of activation of Stat1 Ser727 phosphorylation were the same as with CD3 stimulation (data not shown). This suggested that the signaling machinery that leads to Stat1 activation in T cells through TCR/CD3 or CD28 receptor stimulation may be shared. To show that CD28-mediated Stat1 activation could also occur in primary T cells, PBLs were activated by CD3, by CD28 stimulation, or by the combination of both activators. Fig. 2 B demonstrates that like Jurkat cells, these activators also stimulate phosphorylation of Stat1 Ser727 in normal peripheral T cells. Again, signaling via both CD3 and CD28 did not enhance phosphorylation of Ser727of Stat1. Similar to the CD3 response, CD28 or the combination of CD3 and CD28 stimulation does not trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in Jurkat or in primary T cells (Fig. 2). Serine phosphorylation of Stat3 was observed in response to CD28 costimulation with similar kinetics as those seen with Stat1 (data not shown). Signaling cascades regulated via the TCR require the expression and activation of Lck and Zap-70 tyrosine kinases, which are critical in T cell differentiation and function (3.Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E. Wakeman A. Paige C.J. Hartmann K.-U. Veillette A. Davidson D. Mak T.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 9.Elder M.E. Lin D. Clever J. Chan A.C. Hope T.J. Weiss A. Parslow T.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recently, Lck has been shown to be required for TCR-mediated activation of Stat5 (21.Welte T. Leitenberg D. Dittel B.N. al-Ramadi B.K. Xie B. Chin Y.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Bothwell A.L.M. Bottomly K. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1999; 283: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To examine further whether these signaling molecules were required for TCR induced serine phosphorylation of Stat1, we made use of variant Jurkat cell lines, which lack expression of either Lck or Zap-70 (26.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 27.Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R. Samelson L.E. Abraham R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Treatment of either Lck- or Zap-70-deficient Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 antibody stimulated phosphorylation of Stat1 Ser727 with similar kinetics to those observed in parental cells (Fig.3). These findings indicate that phosphorylation of Stat1 Ser727 in response to CD3 stimulation occurs independently of Lck and Zap-70 kinases. The fact that neither Lck nor Zap-70 are required for TCR stimulated serine phosphorylation of Stat1 was surprising. We therefore decided to explore what other kinases might be implicated for this event. Pretreatment of either Jurkat cells or PBLs with MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 did not block the induction of serine phosphorylation of Stat1 but effectively inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK (Fig. 4). The H7 serine/threonine kinase inhibitor used at 50 μm, a concentration reported to effectively block serine phosphorylation of Stats (28.Frank D.A. Mahajan S. Ritz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3140-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), did not affect TCR/CD3-mediated phosphorylation of Stat1 Ser727. The p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 had no effect in blocking activation of Stat1 Ser727 in Jurkat cells and PBLs. Because phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI-3)-kinase is important in T cell activation, we also evaluated the role of this kinase in Stat1 serine phosphorylation. Again, both LY294002 and wortmannin, potent inhibitors of PI-3 kinase, did not alter Stat1 serine phosphorylation in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 A). Similar responses were detected when primary T cells were evaluated or when rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70S6K kinase was used (data not shown). Surprisingly, the Src kinase inhibitor PP1, completely blocked CD3-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat1 in both Jurkat and primary T cells (Fig. 4). This was also accompanied by inhibition of ERK1/2 MAPK activation (Fig. 4, lower panels in both Aand B). To understand the possible significance of CD3-mediated phosphorylation of Ser727 of Stat1 in T cells, we wanted to determine whether CD3 stimulation of T cells would have an effect on Stat1-dependent transcriptional responses induced by IFN-α. To address this possibility, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with an IRF-GAS luciferase reporter, and cell lysates were prepared after 6 h of stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody, IFN-α, or the combination of anti-CD3 plus IFN-α (Fig. 5). Incubation of cells with anti-CD3 induced a 2 ± 0.5-fold increase in reporter activity compared with untreated cells. IFN-α treatment of cells stimulated the IRF-GAS luciferase reporter 11.8 ± 0.3-fold using 100 units/ml of cytokine or 20.9 ± 2-fold in cells incubated with 1000 units/ml. Interestingly, CD3 stimulation of these cells in the presence of IFN-α significantly enhanced the level of transcriptional activity. For instance, compare 20.9 ± 2-fold induction, with IFN-α (1000 units/ml) alone versus50.7 ± 2.3 with IFN-α plus anti-CD3. These findings indicate that IFN-α and CD3 signals synergize to augment Stat-dependent gene transcription. In this study, we report that triggering of the antigen receptor complex in T cells results in the phosphorylation of serine 727 but not tyrosine 701 of Stat1. This activation differs in B cells, where engagement of the B cell receptor induces both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 (29.Su L. Rickert R.C. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31770-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that the transcription factor Stat1 is a component in TCR signal transduction. The role that phosphorylated Ser727 Stat1 and Stat3 play in T cell biology remains to be elucidated. It is widely accepted that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats allows these proteins to dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind DNA sequences found in promoters of Stat target genes. Serine phosphorylation is required to augment the transcriptional activity of Stats (12.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). A variety of activators such as ultraviolet light irradiation, TNFα, and LPS can trigger Stat1 phosphorylation on Ser727 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (30.Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 31.Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Serine 727 of Stat1 also appears to play a critical role in the constitutive expression of Stat1 target genes such as members of the caspase family of proteins as well as in the protection of TNFα-mediated induction of apoptosis (32.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that TCR signals can synergize with IFN-α to increase Stat-dependent transcriptional response. A similar observation has been made in monocytes where pretreatment with LPS resulted in an enhanced transcriptional activity in response to IFN-γ (30.Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In such a study, it was postulated that tyrosine phosphorylated Stat1 may be a better substrate for a Stat1 serine kinase. We can speculate that a similar mechanism may also occur with signals derived from IFN-α and CD3 stimulation in T cells. It is thus likely that CD3-mediated serine phosphorylation of Stat1 might modulate one or several of the biological outcomes in T cells. The identity of the Stat1 serine kinase that mediates CD3/CD28 triggered phosphorylation of Stat1 is not clear. Pharmacological inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580, which block the activation of MEK1 and p38 MAPK, respectively, fail to inhibit CD3-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Stat1. In addition, the broad spectrum serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H7, that has been reported to inhibit serine phosphorylation of Stats is also without effect on CD3-mediated phosphorylation of this protein. This is in contrast to Stat3 phosphorylation on Ser727 in response to CD3 stimulation, which can be blocked by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (19.Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The inability of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6Kkinase inhibitors (data not shown) to affect Stat1 phosphorylation of Ser727 indicated that these proteins also were not involved in Stat1 activation. All TCR-mediated signaling cascades require the activity of one or several tyrosine kinases, including Lck and Zap-70. To address whether these PTKs were needed for the serine phosphorylation of Stat1, we examined Jurkat cell variants that lack expression of Lck or Zap-70. Triggering the TCR complex in these cells did not alter the induction of Stat1 serine phosphorylation. By contrast, the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 could effectively block phosphorylation of Stat1 Ser727 and ERK1/2 activation. This result demonstrates that neither Lck nor Zap-70 may be involved in Stat1 activation. However, the fact that the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 did prevent serine phosphorylation of Stat1 suggests that another tyrosine kinase in this family is involved in mediating this process. One kinase that is well known to be required for TCR function is Fyn. It is interesting that TCR activation of the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 requires Fyn but neither Lck nor Zap-70 (33.Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Pyk2 has also been reported to be required for IFN-γ-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Stat1 (34.Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Mitani Y. Miyazaki T. Fujii H. Sato M. Kovarik P. Decker T. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One might speculate that TCR-stimulated Fyn activity allows for the activation of Pyk2 followed by activation of a MAPK member responsible for serine phosphorylation of Stat1. Experiments are in progress to test this hypothesis. The fact that Stat1 can be selectively serine phosphorylated through engagement of the TCR provides another potential physiological role for this transcription factor. Relating this event to T cell-mediated responses and/or clonal selection will allow for further understanding of the pleotropic actions of Stat1 through a variety of tyrosine kinase-regulated signaling events."

In this paper, we report on the base substitution error rate of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe pol δ HE and core for comparison with data with the E. colipol III HE-catalyzed error rates (26.Bloom L.B.

The enzyme reaction buffer contained 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 170 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 7 mmMgCl2. Bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Promega. E. coli single strand DNA-binding protein and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.DNA SubstratesThe p/t DNA was made up of a synthetic 100-mer template annealed to complementary 30- or 35-mer primers or to a 35-mer primer containing a single noncomplementary base at its 3′-end. The 30-mer primer was annealed at the middle of the template leaving equal length (35 nt) ssDNA overhangs on each side. The matched 35-mer primer was annealed to the template leaving 35 nt of ssDNA at the 3′-end of the template and 30 nt of ssDNA at 5′-end. The mismatched 35-mer primer was identical to the matched 35-mer except that the nucleotide at the 3′-end contained an A in place of C. All oligomers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer) and gel-purified. The 100-mer was synthesized as two half-length oligomers and then ligated together.Sequence 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sequences for the 30-mer primer/100-mer template were as follows:where G is the target site where misincorporation frequencies were measured.The sequences for the matched 35-mer primer/100-mer template were as follows:The sequences of the mismatched 35-mer primer/100-mer template differed only in that A replaced C at the primer-3′-end.NucleotidesdNTP substrates were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals.MethodsThe primer was 5′-end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase in enzyme reaction buffer at 37 °C for 60 min. p/t DNA was annealed in enzyme reaction buffer using a ratio of 1 primer to 1.2 templates by heating to 90 °C and gradually cooling to room temperature. The concentration of p/t DNA after annealing was 100 nm (primer termini).Assay for 3′-Exonuclease Activity of S. pombe pol δ10 nm either matched or mismatched 35/100-mer DNA were incubated at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml (0.2 unit/μl) S. pombe pol δ in reaction buffer in the presence and absence of all 4 dNTPs (0.5 mm each if present) in separate reactions containing 20 μl. One unit of pol δ supports the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP under the conditions specified above. The 35-mer primers were 5′-end-32P-labeled. The mismatched 35-mer primer (10 nm) was used as single-stranded DNA substrate and incubated at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml (0.2 unit/μl) S. pombe pol δ in reaction buffer (20 μl). Aliquots (4 μl) were removed from each reaction and quenched by mixing with 10 μl of 20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide at different time points. Reaction products were separated on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel run for 2 h at 2,000 V. The amount of primer extension catalyzed by pol δ (gel bands above the primer band) or degradation catalyzed by pol δ 3′-exonuclease activity (gel bands below the primer band) was measured as percentage of total gel band intensity in each lane using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Processive Synthesis on 30/100-Mer p/t DNAp/t DNA was preincubated at 37 °C with different combinations of ATP and accessory proteins PCNA, RFC, and SSB in enzyme reaction buffer (16 μl) containing glycerol (4%) for 1 min. Following preincubation of enzyme reaction buffer (4 μl) containing glycerol (4%), the four dNTPs and pol δ were added to initiate the reaction. Aliquots (4 μl) were removed at different times and mixed with formamide/EDTA (10 μl) to quench the reaction. Final substrate concentrations in the reactions were p/t DNA (10 nm), pol δ (0.5 μg/ml), dATP (0.5 mm), dCTP (0.5 mm), dGTP (0.5 mm), dTTP (0.5 mm), ATP, and the accessory proteins, if present as follows: ATP (1 mm), RFC (54 μg/ml), (PCNA)3 (90 nm), SSB (320 nm). Aliquots (4 μl) were removed from each reaction at different times and quenched by mixing with formamide/EDTA (10 μl).Gel Kinetic Fidelity AnalysisA gel fidelity assay was used to determine the kinetics of incorporation of each of the four dNTPs opposite the target site (26.Bloom L.B. Chen X. Kuchnir Fygenson D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31.Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Primer extension reactions for pol δ in the absence of processivity accessory proteins were performed as follows. p/t DNA and the dNTP to be incorporated opposite the target were first mixed together in the reaction buffer. A mixture of S. pombe pol δ and the running-start nt (dATP) in the same reaction buffer was then added to initiate the reaction. Reactions were run for 5 min to measure the incorporation of dCMP opposite G and for 20 min to measure the misincorporation of dTMP opposite G. The assay conditions for correct incorporation satisfied single-completed hit conditions, whereby most of the p/t DNA molecules that undergo extension encounter a polymerase only once (27.Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31.Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, multiple hit conditions were required to detect dTMP·G misincorporations for pol δ in the absence of the processivity factors, and the minor modifications required to analyze properly multiple encounter kinetics were made as described in Ref. 27.Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. The final concentrations were 1 mmdATP, 10 nm p/t DNA, 1.0 μg/ml S. pombe pol δ, and dNTP concentrations as indicated in the figures. Control reactions were run for 5 min using just the running-start dATP to verify that misincorporation of the running-start nt opposite the target G site did not occur.Primer extension reactions for pol δ in the presence of processivity accessory proteins were performed as follows. Solution A contained 33 nm p/t DNA, 150 μg/ml RFC, 270 nm(PCNA)3, 1 μm SSB, 2 mm ATP, and 4% glycerol in enzyme reaction buffer. Solution B consisted of the enzyme reaction buffer containing various concentrations of the dNTP to be incorporated opposite target site. Solution C contained 0.5 μg/ml pol δ, running start dATP (188 μm), and 4% glycerol in the enzyme reaction buffer. The reaction was performed as follows: solution A (3 μl) was mixed with solution B (3 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 min to allow RFC to load PCNA onto the DNA; then solution C (4 μl) was added to the mixture of A + B to initiate the primer extension reaction. The final concentrations in the 10-μl reaction mixture were 10 nm p/t DNA, 0.2 μg/ml pol δ, 75 μm dATP, 45 μg/ml RFC, 80 nm(PCNA)3, 300 nm SSB, 0.6 mm ATP, and various concentrations of dNTP for incorporation opposite the target site. Control reactions were run with the running-start dATP only to ensure that it did not misincorporate opposite G. The reactions, run at 37 °C for 2 min for both correct incorporation and misincorporations opposite G, approximately satisfied single-completed hit conditions, in which about 20% of the primers were extended, so that no further corrections were required in the kinetic analysis. Reactions were quenched by addition of formamide/EDTA (20 μl) to the reaction mixture. The samples were heated to 100 °C for 6 min, placed on ice for 3 min, and then loaded on a 16% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The gel was run at 2000 V for 4 h to separate reaction products.Integrated polyacrylamide gel band intensities were measured on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The nucleotide incorporation efficiency opposite the target site was obtained by measuringI TΣ /I T−1, where I TΣ is the integrated gel band intensities of primers extended to the target site and beyond, andI T−1 is the integrated gel band intensity of primers extended to the site just prior to the target site (26.Bloom L.B.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).A plot of the relative incorporation rate,I TΣ /I T−1as a function of the dNTP substrate concentration, results in a rectangular hyperbola whose slope in the initial linear region is the apparent V max/K m. ApparentK m and relative V max values were obtained using a least squares fit to a rectangular hyperbola. The relative V max value is equal to the maximum value ofI TΣ /I T−1. In reactions where misincorporation opposite the target site was relatively inefficient, a plotI TΣ /I T−1 versus dNTP concentration showed little or no curvature, and apparent V max/K m values were obtained by a least squares fit of the data to a straight line. Apparent V max/K m values that were obtained under multiple-completed hit conditions were corrected to single-completed hit conditions as described in Ref. 27.Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, but these corrections were essentially negligible. The misincorporation efficiency, f inc, which is the inverse of the fidelity, is given by the ratio shown in Equation 1, finc=fidelity−1=(Vmax/Km) W(Vmax/Km) REquation 1 where the subscripts W and R refer to wrong and right incorporations, respectively. Measurement errors forV max/K m are ± 30% and for f inc are ± 40% (1 S.D.).RESULTSpol δ, thought to be one of the principal eucaryotic replication polymerases (32.Burgers P.M.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), forms a processive holoenzyme complex in the presence of the trimeric PCNA sliding clamp and RFC, which is responsible for loading PCNA onto DNA (7.Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Eucaryotic pol δ is analogous to E. coli pol III core which uses both the β sliding clamp and the clamp loading γ complex to form the highly processive pol III HE. In this study, we have measured the fidelity of S. pombe pol δ HE in the same sequence context that was used previously to study the fidelity of E. coli pol III HE (26.Bloom L.B. Chen X. Kuchnir Fygenson D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although similar in some respects, the biochemical properties of the E. coli andS. pombe pol holoenzymes revealed several unanticipated differences, particularly with respect to the contribution of proofreading to fidelity.A 30/100-mer p/t DNA Serves as a “Minimal” Substrate Supporting Processive Synthesis by S. pombe pol δ HEWe chose to measure the fidelity of S. pombe pol δ HE when copying a synthetic 100-mer DNA template. The advantage of using relatively short synthetic oligonucleotide minimal p/t DNA is that pol fidelity can be measured at arbitrary template target sites in defined sequence contexts that can be easily varied. However, before such a system can be used, it is necessary to show that it recapitulates the properties observed with much longer biological substrates, e.g. SV40 DNA (33.Chalberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 671-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A time course showing extension of a 32P-labeled primer is arranged in seven groups of lanes to test the effects of PCNA, RFC, and SSB on pol δ processivity (Fig. 1). pol δ copied the synthetic 100-mer DNA template in a completely distributive manner in the absence of PCNA (Fig. 1, groups 1and 3). A marked stimulation in pol δ processivity occurred in the presence of PCNA, PCNA + RFC, or PCNA + RFC + SSB (Fig.1, group 2, group 4, and group 5, respectively). The observation that PCNA stimulated pol δ synthesis in the absence of RFC suggests that the processivity clamp can load onto the short DNA by itself and stabilize the pol δ-p/t DNA complex. Threading of PCNA onto linear DNA in the absence of RFC has been reported previously forSaccharomyces cerevisiae PCNA (34.Burgers P.M.J. Yoder B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19923-19926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that SSB strongly inhibited synthesis by pol δ in the presence of PCNA (Fig.1, group 6), but processive synthesis was restored by the addition of RFC (Fig. 1, group 5), clearly demonstrating that RFC was active in the assay.Figure 1Effects of PCNA, RFC, SSB on DNA synthesis byS. pombe pol δ on a 30-mer primer/100-mer template. Primer extension reactions were run with pol δ, 4 dNTPs, and indicated (±) proteins and ATP on a 30/100-mer DNA. Four lanes in each group represent reaction products of 4 time points of 3, 8, 18, and 40 min. The left-hand lane, designated as 0, contained the band corresponding to the unextended 32P-labeled primer. Final concentrations in the reactions were p/t DNA (10 nm), pol δ (0.5 μg/ml), dATP (0.5 mm), dCTP (0.5 mm), dGTP (0.5 mm), dTTP (0.5 mm); and the accessory proteins and ATP, if present, were as follows: ATP (1.0 mm), RFC (54 μg/ml), (PCNA)3 (90 nm), and SSB (320 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The apparent stimulation of the RFC-dependent reaction by SSB (compare Fig. 1, groups 4 and 5) was caused most likely by the inhibition of a 3′-exonuclease contaminant present in our purified preparation of RFC. This adventitious 3′-exonuclease appeared to digest the primer extension products causing a uniform reduction in the gel band intensities in group 4 bands relative to either groups 5 or 2, while maintaining similar processivity patterns for these three groups.The assays shown in Fig. 1 were performed in the presence of ATP (1 mm) required for RFC-mediated loading of PCNA onto p/t DNA (12.Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hubscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol.

Further characterization of the effects of PCNA and RFC on pol δ synthesis was carried out by performing similar primer elongation experiments in the absence of ATP. We found that processive synthesis observed in the presence of PCNA (Fig. 1, group 2) was retained in the absence of ATP (data not shown), whereas ATP must be present to observe processive synthesis in presence of PCNA, RFC, and SSB (Fig. 1, groups 5 and 7). We conclude the following: (i) ATP is required for loading of PCNA onto DNA by RFC but that PCNA can also “thread” itself onto short linear p/t DNA in the absence of RFC, in a “passive” reaction not requiring ATP; (ii) SSB significantly inhibits the ATP-independent passive loading reaction but does not affect loading of PCNA by RFC.S. pombe pol δ Base Substitution FidelityThe nucleotide misincorporation value, f inc, which is the reciprocal of the fidelity, was determined using a gel kinetic assay suitable for measuring fidelity in the presence of proofreading and polymerase processivity proteins (27.Fygenson D.K.

The assay measured the relative rates of incorporating either a right (R) or wrong (W) nucleotide opposite a template target site base. Integrated gel band intensities corresponding to primers extended opposite a template target site and beyond were compared with extended primers terminating 1 base before the target site and were plotted as a function of dRTP and dWTP substrate concentrations to determineV max/K m values, in accordance with Equation 1 (27.Fygenson D.K.

https://openalex.org/W2060181264,"We have isolated a novel restriction endonuclease, Hpy188I, from Helicobacter pylori strain J188. Hpy188I recognizes the unique sequence, TCNGA, and cleaves the DNA between nucleotides N and G in its recognition sequence to generate a one-base 3' overhang. Cloning and sequence analysis of the Hpy188I modification gene in strain J188 reveal that hpy188IM has a 1299-base pair (bp) open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 432-amino acid product. The predicted protein sequence of M.Hpy188I contains conserved motifs typical of aminomethyltransferases, and Western blotting indicates that it is an N-6 adenine methyltransferase. Downstream of hpy188IM is a 513-bp ORF encoding a 170-amino acid product, that has a 41-bp overlap with hpy188IM. The predicted protein sequence from this ORF matches the amino acid sequence obtained from purified Hpy188I, indicating that it encodes the endonuclease. The Hpy188I R-M genes are not present in either strain of H. pylori that has been completely sequenced but are found in two of 11 H. pylori strains tested. The significantly lower G + C content of the Hpy188I R-M genes implies that they have been introduced relatively recently during the evolution of the H. pylori genome."
https://openalex.org/W2061827840,"N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor overactivation has been proposed to induce excitotoxic neuronal death by enhancing membrane phospholipid degradation. In previous studies, we have shown that NMDA releases choline and reduces membrane phosphatidylcholine in vivo. We now observed that glutamate and NMDA induce choline release in primary neuronal cortical cell cultures. This effect is Ca2+-dependent and is blocked by MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate). In cortical neurons, the NMDA receptor-mediated choline release precedes excitotoxic cell death but not neuronal death induced by either osmotic lysis or serum deprivation. Glutamate, at concentrations that release arachidonic acid, does not release choline in cerebellar granule cells, unless these cells are rendered susceptible to excitotoxic death by energy deprivation. The NMDA-evoked release of choline is not mediated by phospholipases A2 or C. Moreover, NMDA does not activate phospholipase D in cortical cells. However, NMDA inhibits incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into both membrane phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. These results show that the increase in extracellular choline induced by NMDA receptor activation is directly related with excitotoxic cell death and indicate that choline release is an early event of the excitotoxic process produced by inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis and not by activation of membrane phospholipid degradation.

Excitotoxicity has been postulated to underlie the neuronal death observed in brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury and in some chronic neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases (3.Meldrum B.

It has been established that Ca2+ influx through theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors is an initial event that plays a central role in glutamate-evoked neuronal excitotoxicity. However, the immediate Ca2+-dependent pathogenic targets that trigger NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity are not fully understood. Excitotoxic neuronal death induced by glutamate has been hypothesized to occur via both necrosis and apoptosis, depending on the intensity and duration of glutamate exposure (6.Ankarcrona M.

Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is considered to be an active process of cell destruction characterized by nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic shrinking, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane blebbing followed by phagocytosis. In contrast, necrotic cell death is considered to be a passive process of cell death produced by cell swelling, injury to cytoplasmic organelles, and membrane lysis. Nonetheless, in neurons, apoptosis and necrosis represent only the extreme ends of a wide range of possible morphological and biochemical deaths (8.Cheung N.S. Pascoe C.J. Giardina S.F. John C.A. Beart P.M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9.Leist M. Nicotera P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Mature cortical or granule cell cultures exposed to mild excitotoxic insults undergo a cell death that is mediated by posttranslational activation of caspases and exhibits apoptotic morphology but does not require new RNA and protein synthesis (7.Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 10.Du Y. Bales K.R. Dodel R.C. Hamilton-Byrd E.

As the exposure time or concentration of NMDA receptor agonist increases, excitotoxic cell death changes its shape from apoptotic to necrotic. However, despite the fact that apoptosis and necrosis may share some biochemical mechanisms, the major distinction between them is that in necrosis there is cytoplasmic membrane breakdown and release of cell contents that causes an inflammatory reaction in vivo. We hypothesized that the cytoplasmic membrane breakdown associated with necrosis, instead of being a passive process of cell destruction, is produced by alteration of biochemical processes involved in membrane building. Choline-containing phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) are major structural components of cell membranes. It has been postulated that the cytoplasmic membrane damage associated with excitotoxic neuronal cell death is caused by increased hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by various phospholipases (11.Farooqui A.A. Yang H.C. Rosenberger T.A. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Previous results obtained in our laboratory using in vivomicrodialysis demonstrated that NMDA receptor activation increases extracellular choline (Cho) levels (12.Zapata A. Capdevila J.L. Trullas R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3597-3605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NMDA-evoked increase in extracellular Cho concentration was associated with a reduction of membrane phosphatidylcholine and with delayed excitotoxicity in prefrontal cortex. In the present experiments, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the increase of extracellular Cho induced by NMDA. The objectives were to determine whether choline release is directly related with excitotoxic cell death and to assess whether NMDA receptor-mediated choline release results from membrane phospholipid degradation. We now report that the increase in extracellular Cho observed after NMDA receptor activation precedes necrotic but not apoptotic cell death. Moreover, the increase in extracellular Cho induced by NMDA receptor activation is produced by inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis and not by an increase in phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis. Primary cultures of brain cortical and cerebellar granule neurons were performed essentially as described previously (13.Viu E. Zapata A. Capdevila J.L. Fossom L.H. Skolnick P. Trullas R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical and cerebellar granule cells were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley E18 rat fetuses and 7-postnatal day rat pups, respectively. Frontal-lateral cortical lobes or cerebellum were dissected, and cells were chemically dissociated in the presence of trypsin and DNase I and plated in poly-l-lysine-coated (10 μg/ml) wells. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 9 × 105 cells/cm2 in 750 μl of basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin, 2 mml-glutamine, 25 mm KCl, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. In experiments measuring phospholipase D activity, cells were plated in six-well plates at the same density. For cortical cell cultures, medium was supplemented withd-glucose to reach a final concentration of 25 mm. Cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added to cerebellar and cortical cells 24 and 72 h after seeding, respectively. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Medium remained unchanged until experiments were performed (8–10 days in vitro). For experiments using Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide (PI) staining, cells were plated at lower concentrations (4.5 × 105 cells/cm2) to facilitate cell counting under microscope. The effect of NMDA or GLU on Cho release and cell death was measured in both cortical and cerebellar granule cells. For experiments in cortical cell cultures, medium was removed, cells were washed twice, and incubations with different treatments were performed in 300 μl of modified Locke Hepes buffer without Mg2+ (MLH) (154 mm NaCl, 3.6 mmNaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 5.6 mmd-glucose in 5 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4). In cells treated with serum deprivation (SD), medium was replaced by fresh medium without fetal bovine serum. In experiments examining the effects of phospholipase inhibitors, these compounds were added 20 min before treatment with NMDA. Cho levels were measured in the incubation media at the indicated times after each treatment. Neuronal cell death was determined with PI staining at the indicated times after treatment. In experiments with cerebellar granule cells, medium was removed and saved for later use as conditioned media. Cells were preincubated for 40 min with MLH with or withoutd-glucose. Previous studies have shown that a 40 min incubation with MLH without glucose renders cerebellar granule neurons susceptible to GLU toxicity (14.Lysko P.G. Cox J.A. Vigano A. Henneberry R.C. Brain Res. 1989; 499: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After this pretreatment, both control and energy-compromised cerebellar granule cells were exposed to either GLU or vehicle for 30 min in 300 μl of MLH. At the end of this period, Cho was measured in the incubation buffer and cultures were washed twice with 1-ml aliquots of Locke Hepes buffer containing Mg2+ (1.2 mm). Conditioned medium was added to the cells and cultures were returned to the incubator. Neuronal cell death was determined 24 h after exposure to glutamate. Cell death was assessed using PI staining. PI is excluded by the plasma membrane of viable cells. Injury to the cytoplasmic membrane allows the entry of PI, which, by interacting with nuclear DNA, yields a bright red fluorescence. PI fluorescence was measured in 24 well plates using a CytoFluor 2350 scanner (Millipore, Barcelona, Spain) with 530 nm (25 nm band pass) excitation and 645 nm (40 nm band pass) emission filters. The percentage of nonviable cells was measured using a modification of the method described by Rudolph et al. (15.Rudolph J.G. Lemasters J.J. Crews F.T. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 221: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, a background fluorescence reading F(−1) was obtained immediately after addition of PI (30 μm). Baseline fluorescence was measured immediately after treatment F(0). Subsequent fluorescence readings were obtained at different times after the beginning of treatment. At the end of the experiment, cells were permeabilized with 375 μm digitonin for 10 min at 37 °C to obtain the maximum fluorescence corresponding to 100% of cell death (F(max)). Percentage of cell death was calculated as follows: % cell death = 100 × (X − F(−1))/(F(max) − F(−1)), where X is fluorescence at any given time. Cells were kept in the incubator between measurements. In some experiments, the percentage of dead cells was measured counting the number of PI-stained cells and dividing by the total number of cells using simultaneous fluorescence and phase contrast observation in an epifluorescence microscope. In these experiments, cells were incubated with 10 μm PI for 30 min and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature before the addition of a final glycerol protective layer. Extracellular Cho levels were measured in the incubation medium using a high pressure liquid chromatograph coupled to an enzyme reactor and an electrochemical detector (BAS, West Lafayette, IN). Cho was separated in a BAS/Sepstik microbore column with a mobile phase consisting of 50 mmNaH2P04, 0.005% Kathon, and 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 8.5 (adjusted with NaOH), at a flow rate of 140 μl/min. Cho was enzymatically converted to hydrogen peroxide by a postcolumn enzyme reactor containing immobilized Cho oxidase. The resulting hydrogen peroxide was detected on a platinum electrode at +500 mV (versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, BAS-LC4B). Results were expressed in pmol/mg of protein. Protein content was measured in each well using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Nuclear condensation or pyknosis, a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death, was examined in permeabilized cells with Hoechst 33342 staining. Following treatments, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 5 min in ice-cold methanol. Once fixed, cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (0.1 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and a final Mowiol protective layer was added. Cells with pyknotic nuclei and total cells were counted (3 fields per well) by direct observation using an epifluorescence microscope. Phospholipase D (PLD) (EC3.1.4.4) activity was assayed in the presence of alcohol using the transphosphatidylation reaction, which is catalyzed specifically by PLD (16.Llahi S. Fain J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3679-3685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLD normally hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine producing free choline and phosphatidic acid. In the presence of a primary alcohol, the enzyme catalyzes a transphosphatidylation reaction that transfers the phosphatidyl moiety to the alcohol, forming a phosphatidylalcohol (17.Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The concentrations of ethanol generally used to determine PLD activity (18.Boss V. Conn P.J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been reported to inhibit NMDA receptor activation (19.Chandler L.J. Sumners C. Crews F.T. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In fact, ethanol and butanol induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of NMDA-evoked Cho release (results not shown). Thus, to measure PLD activity after NMDA receptor activation, we used butanol at a concentration (0.15%) that did not inhibit NMDA-evoked Cho release but allowed sufficient production of phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut). Cells were prelabeled for 4 h in 1.5 ml of MLH with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi/well). Then, cells were incubated for 1 h with 1.5 ml of MLH containing 0.15% butanol and vehicle, 10 μm ionomycin, or 100 μm NMDA. Incubation buffer was removed and cells were sonicated in ice-cold HCl:methanol (1:100 (v/v)). Lipid extraction was performed by adding chloroform and H2O (final proportion of methanol/chloroform/H2O, 2:2:1 (v/v/v)) and separating phases by centrifugation (10 min at 400 g). The lower organic phase was removed, dried under vacuum and dissolved in 10 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1 (v/v)). [32P]PtdBut was separated from other phospholipids in silica TLC plates (HPTLC 60, 10 × 20 cm, Merck) using ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/water (13:2:3:10 (v/v/v/v)) as a mobile phase. Phospholipid spots were identified by exposure to iodine and co-migration with standards. Radioactivity co-migrating with PtdBut and radioactivity present in the total lipid fraction was determined. [32P]PtdBut production was expressed as a percentage of total labeled phospholipids. To determine the effect of NMDA on de novo synthesis of PC and SM, we measured incorporation of [methyl-3H]Cho into membrane PC and SM. As a positive control, we used hemicholinium 3 (HCh-3) a choline kinase inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 1 h in MLH with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (0.5 μCi/well) in the presence of vehicle, 1 mm HCh-3, or 100 μm NMDA. Immediately after incubation, medium was removed, ice-cold HCl:methanol (1:100 (v/v)) was added and the methanolic cell suspension was sonicated. Lipid extraction was performed by adding chloroform and H2O (final proportion of methanol/chlorofom/H2O, 2:2:1 (v/v/v)) and separating phases by centrifugation (10 min at 400 × g). The lipids present in the lower organic phase were dried under vacuum centrifugation and dissolved in 10 μl of chloroform/methanol (4:1 (v/v)). Lipids were separated on silica TLC plates (HPTLC 60, 10 × 20 cm, Merck) using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (75:45:3:1 (v/v/v/v)) mobile phase. Phospholipids were identified by exposure to iodine and co-migration with standards. The spots identified as PC and SM were scraped, and the radioactivity was measured. Results are expressed as dpm of [3H]Cho incorporated into PC and SM. Cortical cells were treated with vehicle or NMDA (100 μm) and 0.5 μCi/well of [methyl-3H]choline chloride for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice with 500 μl of MLH. Ice-cold HCl:methanol (1:100, (v/v)) was added. Cells were scraped and briefly sonicated. Cellular lipids were extracted by adding chloroform and H2O (final proportion of methanol/chloroform/H2O, 2:2:1), and phases were separated by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was dried under vacuum centrifugation. Water soluble metabolites were dissolved in 50% ethanol/water. Choline, phosphocholine and CDP-choline were separated on silica gel chromatographic plates (TLC 60, 20 × 20 cm) and developed in the solvent methanol/0.9% NaCl/ammonium hydroxide (50:50:5 (v/v/v)). Lipids in the chloroform phase were separated in the solvent, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (75:45:3:1 (v/v/v/v)). The spots were revealed by iodine vapor and scraped, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. NMDA, glutamic acid monosodium salt, 4-bromophenacyl bromide, propidium iodide, aristolochic acid, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, trypsin, DNase I, poly-l-lysine, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside, ionomycin, and Hoechst 33342 were from Sigma. l-Glutamine was from Fluka (Madrid, Spain). Basal Eagle's medium, gentamicin, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. D-609 potassium, (+) MK-801 and hemicholinium-3 were from RBI (Natick, MA). Silica gel plates 60 20 × 10 were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). [32P]Orthophosphate was from NEN Life Science Products. [methyl-3H]Choline chloride was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Madrid, Spain). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments with triplicate samples in each. Statistical significance of differences was examined using independentt tests or using one-way ANOVA when required. Post hoc multiple comparisons were performed using Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Incubation of cortical cell cultures with different concentrations of Glutamate or NMDA for 1 h induced a concentration-dependent release of Cho (Fig.1 A) (Emax = 277 ± 14% and 336 ± 19%, and EC50 with 95% confidence intervals = 7 (2–22) μm and 17 (7–39) μm for glutamate and NMDA, respectively). NMDA (100 μm) and GLU (200 μm) increased extracellular Cho levels to 277 ± 25% (n = 9) and 264 ± 40% (n = 5) of control values, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The effect of both GLU and NMDA on extracellular Cho was completely blocked by MK-801 (10 μm) (Fig. 1 B). Removal of extracellular Ca2+ inhibited the increase in extracellular Cho evoked by NMDA, indicating that this effect is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies in cortical cell cultures have shown that NMDA induces excitotoxic cell death that is predominantly necrotic when the culture medium contains physiological ion concentrations (20.Gwag B.J. Koh J.Y. Demaro J.A. Ying H.S. Jacquin M. Choi D.W. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increase in extracellular Cho induced by NMDA is produced before or after cell death, we performed time course studies. First, the effects of NMDA on excitotoxic neuronal death and extracellular Cho levels were investigated in serum-free Locke Hepes buffer (Figs. 1 and2), because both serum and basal Eagle's medium contain Cho. In addition, exposure of cortical cell cultures to fresh serum-containing medium triggers excitotoxicity (21.Yan G.M. Ni B.H. Weller M. Wood K.A. Paul S.M. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows the time course of neuronal cell death induced by NMDA in serum-deprived cortical cell cultures. A significant cell death was observed in serum-deprived controls (38 ± 1%, after 24 h of serum deprivation). Simultaneous treatment with SD and with 100 μm NMDA for 24 h produced 57 ± 1% cell death, an effect that is significantly different from the observed in cultures treated with SD alone. Thus, exposure of cortical cells to 100 μm NMDA for 24 h produced a cell death of approximately 19%. Whereas both SD and NMDA were neurotoxic, the cell death induced by SD was significant after the first half-hour of treatment compared with controls not deprived of serum. In contrast, cell death induced by NMDA was not significant until 6 h of continuous treatment, compared with controls deprived of serum for 6 h (Fig. 2 A). Exposure of cortical cell cultures to 100 μm NMDA induced a marked increase in extracellular concentration of Cho. This effect was observed 30 min after addition of NMDA and reached a maximum after 4 h of continuous treatment with NMDA. 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after addition of NMDA, extracellular Cho was increased approximately 2-, 6-, 12-, and 14-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Exposure of control cells to SD alone did not modify extracellular Cho levels during the first 4 h; however, a small but significant increase in extracellular Cho levels was observed between 4 and 24 h of treatment (Fig.2 B). The NMDA-evoked increase in extracellular Cho was observed well before cytoplasmic membrane breakdown associated with necrotic cell death. Excitotoxicity induced by NMDA was not significant until after 6 h of continuous treatment (Fig. 2 A). However, the increase in extracellular Cho occurred within the initial 4 h after the addition of NMDA (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, trophic factor withdrawal produced a significant cell death but did not modify extracellular Cho levels. Cell death induced by SD was significant after 30 min of treatment (Fig. 2 A), but no significant increase was observed in extracellular Cho until 24 h of SD (Fig. 2 B). To assess whether the NMDA-evoked Cho release depends on the presence of extracellular Cho and to determine whether it is produced only before excitotoxic cell death, we investigated the effect of NMDA (100 μm) on extracellular Cho levels in cortical cell cultures incubated with serum-containing conditioned medium. In these experiments, NMDA was added directly to conditioned medium that contains Cho and serum. The results obtained confirmed that the increase in extracellular Cho levels precedes excitotoxic cell death but not cell death induced by growth factor withdrawal (Figs.3). No significant cell death was observed after 1 h of continuous treatment with either NMDA or SD (Fig. 3 A). However, a pronounced cell death was observed 24 h after continuous exposure to both treatments (43 ± 3% and 56 ± 4% for SD and NMDA, respectively) (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, exposure of cortical cells for 1 or 24 h to 100 μm NMDA in conditioned medium produced an increase in extracellular Cho of 79 ± 12 and 426 ± 69 pmol/well over control levels at 1 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, SD did not significantly modify extracellular Cho content after either 1 or 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3 B). To gain further insight on the type of cell death that is preceded by Cho release, we measured the number of condensed nuclei (pyknosis), an index of apoptosis. SD for 12 h produced a significantly higher pyknosis than the observed after 12 h of treatment with NMDA (26 ± 2% and 12 ± 2%, respectively (Fig.4 A)). Energy-compromised cerebellar granule cells are sensitive to excitotoxic cell death but are resistant to excitotoxicity when there is enough energy supply (14.Lysko P.G. Cox J.A. Vigano A. Henneberry R.C. Brain Res. 1989; 499: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22.Boje K.M. Wong G. Skolnick P. Brain Res. 1993; 603: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23.Fossom L.H. Basile A.S. Skolnick P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 981-987PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the increase in extracellular Cho was directly linked to cell death, we assessed whether NMDA receptor overactivation was able to induce Cho release in cerebellar granule cells resistant to excitotoxicity. Incubation of energy-compromised cerebellar granule cells with glutamate for 30 min killed 61 ± 3% of the cells, 24 h after treatment. In contrast, in the presence of glucose, 30 min incubation with glutamate did not produce significant cell death compared with controls (19 ± 3% of dead cells 24 h after treatment with glutamate compared with 18 ± 2% cell death in control cells) (Fig. 5 A). Glutamate released Cho only in energy-compromised cells, in which exposure to glutamate leads to cell death. Neither glucose deprivation nor incubation with glutamate in the presence of glucose induced significant Cho release or cell death (Fig. 5). To determine whether NMDA-evoked Cho release originates from hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids we investigated whether phospholipase A2(PLA2) and phospholipase C inhibitors modify this effect of NMDA. The contribution of PLA2 to the NMDA-evoked increase in extracellular Cho was investigated in primary cortical cell cultures using the PLA2 inhibitors 4-bromophenacyl bromide (10 μm) and aristolochic acid (100 μm). None of these inhibitors antagonized the effect of NMDA on extracellular Cho levels. In fact, aristolochic acid potentiated the effects of NMDA on Cho release (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, D-609 (100 μm), an inhibitor of phospholipase C, did not modify the effect of NMDA on extracellular Cho (Fig. 6 A, inset). The contribution of PLD to the NMDA-evoked increase in extracellular Cho was investigated by measuring PtdBut, the product of the PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation reaction in the presence of butanol. Ionomycin, a compound that activates PLD, increased the amount of PtdBut. However, NMDA did not significantly modify PtdBut levels (Fig. 6 B). Because Cho released by NMDA did not proceed from catabolism of membrane phospholipids, we tested the hypothesis that this effect of NMDA might be induced by inhibition of PC synthesis. Indeed, NMDA induced a marked inhibition of exogenous [methyl-3H]Cho incorporation into membrane PC. Incorporation of [methyl-3H]Cho into membrane PC was investigated in cortical cell cultures that were incubated for 1 h with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (0.5 μCi/well) in the presence of HCh-3 (1 mm), a choline kinase inhibitor, or in the presence of NMDA (100 μm). HCh-3 completely blocked the incorporation of [3H] Cho into both PC and SM (by 91 and 84%, respectively). Likewise, NMDA (100 μm) inhibited by 74% the incorporation of [3H] Cho into both PC and SM (Figs.7). Time course analysis of incorporation of [methyl-3H]Cho into membrane PC indicated that inhibition of PC synthesis by NMDA is already significant 10 min after the initiation of treatment (Fig.8 D). However, analysis of the intermediates of the CDP-choline pathway (Fig. 8, B andC) did not reveal significant differences between control and NMDA-treated cells. Thus, CDP-choline labeling was identical in NMDA-treated cells versus control (Fig. 8 C). Labeling of phosphocholine was also identical in control and treated cells in most time points, with the exception of 60 min after treatment with NMDA, when there is a small but significant accumulation of [methyl-3H]phosphocholine compared with control cells (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, NMDA treatment induces a marked accumulation of intracellular [met"

It is known, with respect to CFTR regulation of ROMK2 (renally derived K ATPchannel), that the first transmembrane domain and the first nucleotide binding fold domain (NBF1) of CFTR are necessary for this interaction to occur. It has been shown that under conditions that promote phosphorylation, the ROMK2-CFTR interaction is attenuated. To elucidate the complex nature of this interaction, CFTR constructs were co-expressed with ROMK2 in Xenopus oocytes, and two microelectrode voltage clamp experiments were performed. Although the second half of CFTR can act as a functional chloride channel, our results suggest that it does not confer glibenclamide sensitivity on ROMK2, as does the first half of CFTR. The attenuation of the ROMK2-CFTR interaction under conditions that promote phosphorylation is dependent on at least the presence of the R domain of CFTR. We conclude that transmembrane domain 1, NBF1, and the R domain are the CFTR domains involved in the ROMK2-CFTR interaction and that NBF2 and transmembrane domain 2 are not essential.

It is a member of the ATP binding cassette superfamily, and like other members of this group it is comprised of transmembrane spanning domains and nucleotide binding folds (NBFs); however, it has a regulatory domain (R domain), which is unique to CFTR (3.Sheppard D.N.

The domains of CFTR involved in its regulation of other ion channels may be functionally distinct from those involved in its Cl−channel function. CFTR expression has been linked to protein kinase A regulation of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC), the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and a K ATP channel, ROMK2 (4.Egan M.

The first nucleotide binding domain of CFTR and the R domain are important for it's regulation of ORCC and ENaC (7.Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M. Devidas S. Egan M.E. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For CFTR to regulate ROMK2 channels, in vitro, an intact NBF1 is required (9.McNicholas C. Nason Jr., M.W. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F843-F848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although many groups are investigating the role of NBF1 and NBF2 with regard to channel gating, their role with regard to regulation of other ion channels has yet to be elucidated. For instance, it is not known if NBF2 can have the same effect as NBF1 with respect to regulation of ROMK2 channels. Many of the disease-producing mutations are located in the NBF domains of CFTR, predominantly within NBF1. These mutations are often associated with abnormal CFTR channel activity, as well as abnormal kinase regulation of ORCC and ENaC. For example, the protein kinase activation of ORCCs depends on CFTR expression and is affected by mutations in NBF1, as is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent inhibition of ENaC (4.Egan M.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The majority of cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites are located in the R domain of CFTR (11.Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). It is not known what role the phosphorylation-rich R domain plays in these processes. With respect to the ROMK2-CFTR interaction, it has been shown that this interaction is attenuated under conditions that promote phosphorylation. It is not known if the R domain of CFTR is important in this phosphorylation-dependent attenuation (6.McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To examine further the structure-function relationships of the NBFs and the R domain, with respect to the ability of CFTR to act as a regulator of ROMK2 channels, CFTR constructs (see Fig. 1) and ROMK2 were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques were applied. First, to determine if the R domain of CFTR is involved in the phosphorylation process that attenuates ROMK2/CFTR coupling, we co-expressed ROMK2 with CFTR constructs containing truncations before and after the R domain. Next, we substituted SUR1 for CFTR in our ROMK2/CFTR co-expression experiments to learn more about the dephosphorylation/phosphorylationdependent ROMK2-CFTR interaction. SUR1 is an ABC transporter that does not contain an R domain and is known to regulate another K ATPchannel (12.Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). Lastly, we investigated if CFTR constructs containing NBF2 alone can confer glibenclamide on ROMK2. Stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and injected with RNA as described previously (6.McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were adjusted such that a 1:4 molar ratio was preserved between ROMK2 and the ABC transporter (50 nl of total RNA was injected). Experiments were performed on days 1–6 after injection. The two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique was used to measure whole-cell currents. Recordings from either a Warner Oocyte Clamp (Model OC-72513, Warner Instrument Corp., CT) or a GENECLAMP 500 (Axon Instruments, CA) were obtained from currents elicited by 20-ms test pulses stepped from −100 to 40 mV in 20-mV increments (V HOLD = −65 mV). Microelectrode pipettes (Kimax-51®, Kimble Products) typically had resistances of 0.5–2.0 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl solution. Experiments were performed at 20–22 °C. Oocytes were bathed with a control solution containing: 105 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 5 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4). The experimental protocol consisted of a 10-min equilibration in control solution, impalement, a 5-min control period, a 15-min exposure to 500 μm glibenclamide (a sulfonylurea) in standard bath solution followed by a 3-min exposure to 2 mm barium (Ba2+) before a control solution wash (5 min) (Fig. 2). All experiments were done under two conditions (i) basal and (ii) after stimulation with 100 μm forskolin (FSK), 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthene (IBMX)(Sigma), a mixture used to maximize cAMP-dependent phosphorylation processes (13.Cunningham S.A. Worrell R.T. Benos D.J. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C783-C788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Drumm M.L. Wilkinson D.J. Smit L.S. Worrell R.T. Strong T.V. Frizzell R.A. Dawson D.C. Collins F.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1797-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). FSK/IBMX was added to the preincubation, control, and glibenclamide-containing solutions. Glibenclamide was diluted to the required concentration from a 100 mm stock solution dissolved in an ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) mixture 2:1 v/v ratio. Stock solutions of FSK (20 mm) and IBMX (200 mm) were prepared with Me2SO as the vehicle. To address the possibility that the current observed, under conditions that promote phosphorylation, was stimulated Cl− current and not K+ current, a subset of experiments were subjected to an alternate protocol. It contained an additional 3-min barium pulse after the initial control period. These experiments were performed on oocytes expressing ROMK2/CFTR-K593X and ROMK2/CFTR-D835X and showed that the current was Ba2+-sensitive K+ current and not stimulated Cl− current. For oocytes injected with ROMK2 cRNA, only cells expressing ≥500 nA whole-cell current were selected. Experiments were discounted if a stable baseline current was not obtained (>10% variation in control current). Data were compared using a paired Student's ttest within a single experiment or with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) when comparing multiple conditions and/or groups. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Cells were injected with ROMK2 alone, ROMK2/CFTR-WT, ROMK2/SUR, ROMK2/CFTR-D835X (a CFTR construct with an intact nucleotide binding fold and a functional R domain), ROMK2/CFTR-K593X (a CFTR construct with an intact nucleotide binding fold but no R domain), or ROMK2/RT2N2CFTR (a CFTR construct containing the R domain, the second nucleotide binding fold domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the first 159 bases of CFTR-WT so as to include the Kozak methionine for translation initiation) (Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described by Kunkel et al. (15.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Mutations were created in the CFTR clone pBQ4.7 by standard oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded DNA using the Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit as described previously (16.Ho K.

Zeitlin P.L. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 10-18Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were CFTR-K593X, 5′-CTGTTAACTGATGGCTAGCAAACTAGG-3′ and CFTR-D835X, 5′CACGAAAAGTGTCACTGGCCCCTCAGGCAAACTTCGATATATTACTGTCCACAAGAGCTTAATTTTGTGC-3′. The RT2N2CFTR mutation was constructed as outlined by Devidaset al. (18.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To prepare cRNA, the plasmid was linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine, Ambion) as described previously (9.McNicholas C.

CFTR-D835X and CFTR-K593X are expressed at membrane level, in varying expression systems (9.McNicholas C. Nason Jr., M.W. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Am. J.

In addition it has been demonstrated that the second half of CFTR forms a functional chloride channel (18.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These experiments were repeated, and confirmed RT2N2CFTR is expressed at membrane level with 0.278 ± 0.041 μA of current (V HOLD = −40 mV using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp) (p < 0.05 when compared with an uninjected oocyte) (Fig. 2). To assess how conditions that promote phosphorylation affect the ROMK2-CFTR interaction, ROMK2 and CFTR-WT were co-expressed in Xenopusoocytes and exposed to 100 μm/1 mm FSK/IBMX. Under these conditions the majority of observed current was Ba2+-sensitive K+ current. This current was insensitive to glibenclamide (9 ± 2.9% inhibition,n = 9) (Fig. 3). This finding was similar to the glibenclamide insensitivity observed when ROMK2 was expressed alone (17 ± 4.3% inhibition under basal conditions, n = 11, 26 ± 6% inhibition with FSK/IBMX, n = 6) (TableI, Fig. 4). These data support the previous observation made in excised patches that cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation can uncouple the ROMK2-CFTR interaction. This finding can be contrasted to the enhanced glibenclamide sensitivity of the resultant K+current when ROMK2 is co-expressed with CFTR-WT in the absence of FSK/IBMX (55 ± 5.7% inhibition, n = 19) (p < 0.0001) (Table I, Fig. 4). These data suggest that phosphorylation of CFTR, ROMK, or both uncouples this interaction and led us to investigate which domains of CFTR participate in this process.Table ISensitivity of average ROMK2 K + currents to glibenclamide when expressed alone and when co-expressed with CFTR, SUR, and CFTR constructsConstructBasal conditionsaAverage whole cell current (V m = −60 mV), under basal conditions, using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique, observed in oocytes injected with ROMK2 alone, ROMK2 co-expressed with a designated CFTR construct or co-expressed with SUR. n is the number of experiments for each condition.

In addition to all pairwise comparisons, we analyzed the data via ANOVA comparing all coexpression groups against oocyte expressing ROMK2 alone (using it as the reference or control group). To investigate, under conditions that maximize intracellular cAMP, which domain of CFTR is important for the attenuated ROMK2-CFTR interaction, CFTR constructs with mutations involving the R domain were chosen to be co-expressed with ROMK2. When ROMK2 was co-expressed with a CFTR construct containing transmembrane domain 1 and NBF1 without an R domain (CFTR-K593X) and exposed to FSK/IBMX, the resultant Ba2+-sensitive K+current was inhibited by glibenclamide (66 ± 4.3% inhibition,n = 18) (Table I, Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Without cAMP stimulation glibenclamide inhibited 46 ± 4.5% (n = 6) of K+ current when ROMK2 and CFTR-K593X were co-expressed, which is similar to previous findings. These data suggest that CFTR constructs without the R domain or NBF2 can influence ROMK2 currents. In addition the data suggest there is no attenuation of the interaction by cAMP stimulation when the R domain is absent. Furthermore, after cAMP stimulation there is a significant enhancement of glibenclamide effect on ROMK2/CFTR-K593X currents (Table I). However, when ROMK2 and CFTR-D835X (a CFTR construct with an intact nucleotide binding fold and a functional R domain) were co-expressed and stimulated with the cAMP-enhancing mixture, the resultant K+ current demonstrated an attenuated sulfonylurea response (26 ± 5% inhibition, n = 16) (Fig. 4). In the absence of FSK/IBMX there was a 48 ± 10% inhibition of K+ current when ROMK2 and CFTR-D835X were co-expressed (n = 9) (Table I, Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation uncouples the ROMK2-CFTR interaction in the presence of an R domain. To further assess the effect of an R domain on this interaction, SUR1 (pancreatic β cell sulfonylurea receptor), an ABC transporter that does not contain the R domain (20.Tusnady G.E. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Letts. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 21.Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Weschsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), was substituted for CFTR in the ROMK2-ABC transporter interaction. SUR1 can substitute for CFTR in imparting sulfonylurea sensitivity on ROMK2 potassium current with 55 ± 9% inhibition, (n = 10) (Table I, Fig. 4), in agreement with previous findings (22.Nason Jr., M.W. Yao T.Y. Thomas P. Egan M.E. Pediatr. Pulm. 1997; Suppl. 14: 217Google Scholar). After stimulation with FSK/IBMX the ROMK2-SUR interaction retained sulfonylurea sensitivity, that is, 55 ± 6.5% of the Ba+-sensitive K+ current was inhibited by glibenclamide (n = 7). This suggests that the ROMK2/SUR proteins remain functionally interactive under conditions that increase cAMP-dependent phosphorylation unlike the ROMK/CFTR-WT and ROMK2/CFTR-D835X proteins. However, in contrast to the ROMK2/CFTR-K593X currents, glibenclamide inhibition is not enhanced after cAMP stimulation. To assess if the second half of the CFTR protein can confer properties of channel regulation on ROMK2, a CFTR construct comprised of the second half of the molecule was substituted for CFTR-WT in the ROMK2-CFTR interaction. When RT2N2CFTR was co-expressed with ROMK2, the resultant Ba2+-sensitive K+ current remained glibenclamide insensitive (19 ± 3.1% inhibition,n = 10) (Table I, Fig.5). This suggests that co-expression of the RT2N2CFTR construct with ROMK2 does not alter the sulfonylurea sensitivity of the K+ current. Conditions that promote phosphorylation did not alter the glibenclamide insensitive (29 ± 5.3% inhibition, n = 6). Therefore, although the second half of CFTR can act as a functional chloride channel (18.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), these data indicate that it does not act as a conductance regulator of ROMK2 K+ channels. Both the first and second halves of the CFTR protein can act as functional chloride channels (18.Devidas S. Yue H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29373-29380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23.Morales M.M. Carroll T.P. Morita T. Schwiebert E.M. Devuyst O. Wilson P.D. Lopes A.G. Stanton B.A. Dietz H.C. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1038-F1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, they do not have the same function when it comes to conferring properties of channel regulation on ROMK2 channels. The first nucleotide binding fold along with the first transmembrane domain is necessary for the ROMK2-CFTR interaction to occur (9.McNicholas C. Nason Jr., M.W. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F843-F848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the attenuation of the ROMK2-CFTR interaction, under conditions of phosphorylation, only occurs in the presence of an R domain. It suggests that the R domain is not essential for this coupling to take place; however, it is necessary for the regulation of this interaction. The data presented also suggest that NBF2 is not involved in the ROMK2-CFTR interaction. It is unknown whether the ability of CFTR to act as a channel regulator is because of a direct protein-protein interaction or another process. Studies on the CFTR regulation of ORCC suggest that the NBF1 of CFTR is an essential domain for this interaction (7.Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M. Devidas S. Egan M.E. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Investigators postulate that there is direct protein-protein interaction involving NBF1 and ORCC, but no direct evidence has been provided. Evidence of a direct interaction between CFTR and other channel proteins is provided by the analysis of CFTR domains and recombinant ENaC subunits in yeast two hybrid assays. These assays demonstrate that NBF1 and the R domain of CFTR interact directly with the C-terminal tail of α-recombinant ENaC (8.Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). CFTR may be coupled directly with ROMK2 in the cell membrane, providing the missing domain to the cloned K+ channel and thus restoring the sulfonylurea sensitivity seen in native tissue (25.Wang W-H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar). Such a coupling process would be similar to the subunit interactions proposed for SUR and Kir 6.2 where SUR couples with Kir 6.2 and forms the native β cellK ATP channel (26.Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Gribble F. Ashfeld R. Proks P. Smith P.A. Sakura H. Coles B. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F. Nature. 1996; 379: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that additional proteins may be involved in the interactions of CFTR with other ion channels such as cytoskeletal proteins or PDZ-containing proteins (24.Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). If these proteins are involved, it would suggest that the interaction is not because of a direct coupling of CFTR with other ion channel pores but secondary to a complicated cascade of events. The uncoupling of this interaction by phosphorylation may result from a conformational change in the entire ROMK2/CFTR heteromultimeric structure such that the glibenclamide binding site is altered. Previous studies have shown that when phosphorylated the R domain of CFTR interacts with NBF1 and alters CFTR channel properties (27.Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Such a process may also alter the ability of CFTR to act as a channel regulator. Lastly, the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, a multifunctional ABC transporter, is postulated to have two functionally distinct states with respect to its ability to act as a channel regulator and its transport activities (28.Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Valverde M.A. Mintenig G.M. Sepulveda F.V. Cell. 1992; 71: 23-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It has been shown that active transport of chloride is not necessary for the ROMK2-CFTR interaction to occur, as this interaction occurs without CFTR activation (6.McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It may be that CFTR is also demonstrating bifunctional properties: a phosphorylated state to act primarily as a Cl− channel and a basal state to act purely as a channel regulator. This is supported by the ability of CFTR to regulate ROMK2, ORCC, and ENaC independent of its Cl− channel activity. When assessing cystic fibrosis phenotype/genotype, it has been suggested that the severity of pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis may be primarily associated with the regulatory properties of CFTR (29.Fulmer S.B. Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (6826): 6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); thus understanding the regulatory properties of CFTR is crucial to potential future interventions for cystic fibrosis. The cDNA for ROMK2 was a generous gift from S. Hebert, and the CFTR-WT and mutant constructs were a generous gift from W. B. Guggino. We would like to thank G. Giebisch and G. Fyfe for their helpful discussions in preparing this manuscript."
