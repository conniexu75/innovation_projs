https://openalex.org/W2009094792,"The quantum-confined Stark effect in single cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystallite quantum dots was studied. The electric field dependence of the single-dot spectrum is characterized by a highly polarizable excited state ( approximately 10(5) cubic angstroms, compared to typical molecular values of order 10 to 100 cubic angstroms), in the presence of randomly oriented local electric fields that change over time. These local fields result in spontaneous spectral diffusion and contribute to ensemble inhomogeneous broadening. Stark shifts of the lowest excited state more than two orders of magnitude larger than the linewidth were observed, suggesting the potential use of these dots in electro-optic modulation devices."

Two cloned transfectants and a population of neomycin (G418)-resistant cells were used as donors for nuclear transfer to enucleated oocytes. Six transgenic lambs were liveborn: Three produced from cloned cells contained factor IX and neo transgenes, whereas three produced from the uncloned population contained the marker gene only. Somatic cells can therefore be subjected to genetic manipulation in vitro and produce viable animals by nuclear transfer. Production of transgenic sheep by nuclear transfer requires fewer than half the animals needed for pronuclear microinjection."
https://openalex.org/W2063221585,"The NPH1 (nonphototropic hypocotyl 1) gene encodes an essential component acting very early in the signal-transduction chain for phototropism. Arabidopsis NPH1 contains a serine-threonine kinase domain and LOV1 and LOV2 repeats that share similarity (36 to 56 percent) with Halobacterium salinarium Bat, Azotobacter vinelandii NIFL, Neurospora crassa White Collar–1, Escherichia coli Aer, and the Eag family of potassium-channel proteins from Drosophila and mammals. Sequence similarity with a known (NIFL) and a suspected (Aer) flavoprotein suggests that NPH1 LOV1 and LOV2 may be flavin-binding domains that regulate kinase activity in response to blue light–induced redox changes."

This interaction suggests that BRCA2 participates in DNA repair. Residues 3196–3232 of the murine BRCA2 protein were shown to be involved in this interaction. Here, we report the detailed mapping of additional domains that are involved in interactions between the human homologs of these two proteins. Through yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the RAD51 protein interacts specifically with the eight evolutionarily conserved BRC motifs encoded in exon 11 of brca2 and with a similar motif found in a Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein. Deletion analysis demonstrates that residues 98–339 of human RAD51 interact with the 59-residue minimal region that is conserved in all BRC motifs. These data suggest that the BRC repeats function to bind RAD51. Recent work has shown that the murine BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein interacts with the murine RAD51 protein.

Currently the mechanism of action of these two genes remains largely undefined. The brca1 and brca2 genes encode large proteins, 1863 and 3418 amino acids, respectively (1Miki Y. Swensen J.

Genet. 1996; 12: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). A search of the public sequence data bases has revealed little sequence homology to previously identified proteins. However, analysis of the protein sequence has revealed several statistically significant repeated motifs in these genes (5Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat.

For example, eight internal repeats, known as BRC motifs, are found clustered in exon 11 of the human BRCA2 protein. These motifs are not found in BRCA1 but are conserved in all mammalian BRCA2 proteins that have been sequenced. A similar motif is also present in the hypothetical protein encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans gene T07E3.5 (5Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat.

Knock-outs of the mouse homologs of these genes indicate that they are essential during development. The ablation of either brca1 or brca2 results in an embryonic lethal phenotype characterized by failure of proliferation during approximately days 6–8 of gestation (8Hakem R. de la Pompa J.L.

Levels of RNA expression from brca1 and brca2 are coordinately regulated during proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelial cells (11Rajan J. Wang M. Marquis S.T. Chodosh L.A. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, their expression varies at different stages of the cell cycle, with RNA levels peaking at the G1/S boundary (13Vaughn J.P. Cirisano F.D. Huper G. Berchuck A. Futreal PA. Marks J.R.

These findings provide preliminary evidence that these breast cancer genes participate in a common functional pathway. Three independent studies have now established that the RAD51 DNA repair protein is linked to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathways (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A.

Immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that RAD51 forms a complex with BRCA1, and immunofluorescence analysis shows that both proteins are co-localized to the synaptonemal complex of mouse meiotic chromosomes (15Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). The direct interaction of murine RAD51 with murine BRCA2 has been demonstrated in a yeast two-hybrid assay (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P.

The loss of interaction of these two proteins probably accounts for the hypersensitivity to γ irradiation that is observed in mouse embryos deficient in BRCA2 (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A. Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). rad51, a homolog of the Escherichia coli recA gene, is known to function in recombination and DNA repair (16Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 17Heyer W.-D. Experientia. 1994; 50: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear how the interaction of RAD51 with either BRCA1 or BRCA2 affects its function. Alteration of normal DNA repair function may lead to genomic instabilities that eventually contribute to tumorigenesis.We have conducted yeast two-hybrid searches using various segments of the human brca2 gene as “baits” and identified a number of interacting proteins, one of which is RAD51. To further understand the structural and functional relationships between human BRCA2 and RAD51, we map the minimal regions of the BRCA2 protein that mediate binding to RAD51. Specifically we show that RAD51 interacts with the eight BRC motifs of the human BRCA2 protein. These sites of interactions are distinct from those that have been previously reported for the murine BRCA2 and RAD51 proteins.DISCUSSIONThe identification of components in the BRCA2 functional pathway should further our understanding of BRCA2 function and its role in tumorigenesis. Through yeast two-hybrid screens of human cDNA libraries, we identified RAD51 as a BRCA2-binding protein. Sharan et al. (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A. Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that the C-terminal region of murine BRCA2 interacts with the N-terminal portion of murine RAD51. We identified eight sites of interaction between these proteins. Specifically the eight BRC motifs encoded in exon 11 of the human brca2 gene interact with RAD51. In addition, a similar motif found in a C. elegans hypothetical protein also interacts with RAD51. These data suggest that the BRC motifs function to bind RAD51.Sequence comparison of the BRCA2 proteins from six mammalian species have revealed sequences conserved among the eight BRC motifs, which strongly implies functional significance (5Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 7Bignell G. Micklem G. Stratton M.R. Ashworth A. Wooster R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our findings that RAD51 binds to different protein sequences encoded by the 5-kilobase exon 11 of BRCA2 led us to examine whether the BRC internal repeats are the actual sites of interactions with RAD51. Because the amino acid sequences of these motifs are not identical, we analyzed each BRC motif individually to determine if they could associate with RAD51. All eight human BRC motifs showed interaction in biochemical assays, but only six of eight BRC motifs bound specifically to RAD51 in the yeast two-hybrid assays. This discrepancy in binding specificity might be caused by the different protein context of Gal4p and GST fusions. Subtle changes in the amino acid sequence of BRC motif 5 and 6 could have affected the proper folding of the predicted globular domain in these motifs in yeast.Deletion analyses of the BRC motif 3 and RAD51 identified the minimal regions in both proteins that are required for binding. Our results indicate that the minimal region defined for the BRC motif 3 encompasses the entire consensus sequence that is highly conserved among mammalian species (7Bignell G. Micklem G. Stratton M.R. Ashworth A. Wooster R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Similarly, the minimal region of human RAD51, amino acid residues 98–339, that interacts with human BRCA2 is conserved among prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. The homologous region in the E. coli recA protein has been demonstrated to contain ATPase activity and is involved in oligomer formation and recombination (26Ogawa T. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of multiple RAD51-binding sites in BRCA2 is open to interpretation. It seems reasonable that BRCA2 might bind several molecules of RAD51 simultaneously and therefore might serve as a scaffold for RAD51 assembly during DNA repair and recombination. Alternatively the multiple binding sites might play a role in the sequestration of active RAD51 or the facilitation of functional interactions of RAD51 with itself or other proteins. Because a similar BRC motif in a hypothetical protein from C. elegans is capable of binding to human RAD51, this same structural and functional relationship may hold in other eukaryotic species.Using biochemical assays, we have confirmed that the association between RAD51 and BRCA2 is direct (10Mizuta R. LaSalle J.M. Chieng H.-L. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Copeland N. Jenkins N.A. Lalande M. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6927-6932Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding of RAD51 to BRCA1 may be mediated through another protein in a complex (15Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). We have searched extensively for possible interactions between RAD51 and BRCA1 using the yeast two-hybrid assay, but so far without success (data not shown). It is interesting to note that the tumor suppressor gene p53 also associates with RAD51 (27Sturzbecher H.-W. Donzelmann B. Henning W. Knippschild U. Buchhop S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1992-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Together these data strongly suggest that RAD51 represents a crucial functional junction linking recombination and repair to cell cycle checkpoint signaling.Our protein-protein interaction data, coupled with the previous observations that 1) brca2-null mouse embryos are hypersensitive to γ irradiation, 2) brca1 and brca2-null mouse embryos drastically overexpress p21 and suffer a failure of embryonic cell proliferation, and 3) there is a direct protein-protein interaction between RAD51 and p53, raise a critical question about the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (28Kinzler K.W.

Is the primary deficit in brca1-null and/or brca2-null tumors a failure of DNA repair, or is it a failure of signal transduction associated with the need for DNA repair? The answer to this question could have bearings on the rationale for use of brca1 and brca2 as anti-tumor gene therapy agents in patients. The restoration of BRCA1 and BRCA2 function might stabilize genome integrity in the tumor without reversing the damages that have already occurred. In contrast, restoration of signal transduction might render the tumors more sensitive to apoptosis, a process that can be triggered by p53 or possibly chemotherapeutic agents. Further research is needed to address these possibilities. Germline mutations in the brca1 and brca2tumor suppressor genes account for approximately 5–10% of all breast cancer cases (1Miki Y.

Currently the mechanism of action of these two genes remains largely undefined. The brca1 and brca2 genes encode large proteins, 1863 and 3418 amino acids, respectively (1Miki Y. Swensen J.

Genet. 1996; 12: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). A search of the public sequence data bases has revealed little sequence homology to previously identified proteins. However, analysis of the protein sequence has revealed several statistically significant repeated motifs in these genes (5Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat.

For example, eight internal repeats, known as BRC motifs, are found clustered in exon 11 of the human BRCA2 protein. These motifs are not found in BRCA1 but are conserved in all mammalian BRCA2 proteins that have been sequenced. A similar motif is also present in the hypothetical protein encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans gene T07E3.5 (5Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat.

Knock-outs of the mouse homologs of these genes indicate that they are essential during development. The ablation of either brca1 or brca2 results in an embryonic lethal phenotype characterized by failure of proliferation during approximately days 6–8 of gestation (8Hakem R. de la Pompa J.L.

Levels of RNA expression from brca1 and brca2 are coordinately regulated during proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelial cells (11Rajan J. Wang M. Marquis S.T. Chodosh L.A. Proc. Natl.

These findings provide preliminary evidence that these breast cancer genes participate in a common functional pathway. Three independent studies have now established that the RAD51 DNA repair protein is linked to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathways (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A.

The direct interaction of murine RAD51 with murine BRCA2 has been demonstrated in a yeast two-hybrid assay (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A. Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 10Mizuta R. LaSalle J.M. Chieng H.-L. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Copeland N. Jenkins N.A. Lalande M. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl.

The loss of interaction of these two proteins probably accounts for the hypersensitivity to γ irradiation that is observed in mouse embryos deficient in BRCA2 (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A. Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). rad51, a homolog of the Escherichia coli recA gene, is known to function in recombination and DNA repair (16Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 17Heyer W.-D. Experientia. 1994; 50: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear how the interaction of RAD51 with either BRCA1 or BRCA2 affects its function. Alteration of normal DNA repair function may lead to genomic instabilities that eventually contribute to tumorigenesis. We have conducted yeast two-hybrid searches using various segments of the human brca2 gene as “baits” and identified a number of interacting proteins, one of which is RAD51. To further understand the structural and functional relationships between human BRCA2 and RAD51, we map the minimal regions of the BRCA2 protein that mediate binding to RAD51. Specifically we show that RAD51 interacts with the eight BRC motifs of the human BRCA2 protein. These sites of interactions are distinct from those that have been previously reported for the murine BRCA2 and RAD51 proteins. DISCUSSIONThe identification of components in the BRCA2 functional pathway should further our understanding of BRCA2 function and its role in tumorigenesis. Through yeast two-hybrid screens of human cDNA libraries, we identified RAD51 as a BRCA2-binding protein. Sharan et al. (9Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.-S. Regel E. Dinh Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A. Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that the C-terminal region of murine BRCA2 interacts with the N-terminal portion of murine RAD51. We identified eight sites of interaction between these proteins. Specifically the eight BRC motifs encoded in exon 11 of the human brca2 gene interact with RAD51. In addition, a similar motif found in a C. elegans hypothetical protein also interacts with RAD51. These data suggest that the BRC motifs function to bind RAD51.Sequence comparison of the BRCA2 proteins from six mammalian species have revealed sequences conserved among the eight BRC motifs, which strongly implies functional significance (5Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 7Bignell G. Micklem G. Stratton M.R. Ashworth A. Wooster R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our findings that RAD51 binds to different protein sequences encoded by the 5-kilobase exon 11 of BRCA2 led us to examine whether the BRC internal repeats are the actual sites of interactions with RAD51. Because the amino acid sequences of these motifs are not identical, we analyzed each BRC motif individually to determine if they could associate with RAD51. All eight human BRC motifs showed interaction in biochemical assays, but only six of eight BRC motifs bound specifically to RAD51 in the yeast two-hybrid assays. This discrepancy in binding specificity might be caused by the different protein context of Gal4p and GST fusions. Subtle changes in the amino acid sequence of BRC motif 5 and 6 could have affected the proper folding of the predicted globular domain in these motifs in yeast.Deletion analyses of the BRC motif 3 and RAD51 identified the minimal regions in both proteins that are required for binding. Our results indicate that the minimal region defined for the BRC motif 3 encompasses the entire consensus sequence that is highly conserved among mammalian species (7Bignell G. Micklem G. Stratton M.R. Ashworth A. Wooster R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Similarly, the minimal region of human RAD51, amino acid residues 98–339, that interacts with human BRCA2 is conserved among prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. The homologous region in the E. coli recA protein has been demonstrated to contain ATPase activity and is involved in oligomer formation and recombination (26Ogawa T. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of multiple RAD51-binding sites in BRCA2 is open to interpretation. It seems reasonable that BRCA2 might bind several molecules of RAD51 simultaneously and therefore might serve as a scaffold for RAD51 assembly during DNA repair and recombination. Alternatively the multiple binding sites might play a role in the sequestration of active RAD51 or the facilitation of functional interactions of RAD51 with itself or other proteins. Because a similar BRC motif in a hypothetical protein from C. elegans is capable of binding to human RAD51, this same structural and functional relationship may hold in other eukaryotic species.Using biochemical assays, we have confirmed that the association between RAD51 and BRCA2 is direct (10Mizuta R. LaSalle J.M. Chieng H.-L. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Copeland N. Jenkins N.A. Lalande M. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6927-6932Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding of RAD51 to BRCA1 may be mediated through another protein in a complex (15Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). We have searched extensively for possible interactions between RAD51 and BRCA1 using the yeast two-hybrid assay, but so far without success (data not shown). It is interesting to note that the tumor suppressor gene p53 also associates with RAD51 (27Sturzbecher H.-W. Donzelmann B. Henning W. Knippschild U. Buchhop S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1992-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Together these data strongly suggest that RAD51 represents a crucial functional junction linking recombination and repair to cell cycle checkpoint signaling.Our protein-protein interaction data, coupled with the previous observations that 1) brca2-null mouse embryos are hypersensitive to γ irradiation, 2) brca1 and brca2-null mouse embryos drastically overexpress p21 and suffer a failure of embryonic cell proliferation, and 3) there is a direct protein-protein interaction between RAD51 and p53, raise a critical question about the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (28Kinzler K.W.

Is the primary deficit in brca1-null and/or brca2-null tumors a failure of DNA repair, or is it a failure of signal transduction associated with the need for DNA repair? The answer to this question could have bearings on the rationale for use of brca1 and brca2 as anti-tumor gene therapy agents in patients. The restoration of BRCA1 and BRCA2 function might stabilize genome integrity in the tumor without reversing the damages that have already occurred. In contrast, restoration of signal transduction might render the tumors more sensitive to apoptosis, a process that can be triggered by p53 or possibly chemotherapeutic agents. Further research is needed to address these possibilities.

https://openalex.org/W2046228091,"The sequence of a promoter determines not only the efficiency with which it forms a complex with RNA polymerase, but also the concentration of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) required for initiating transcription. Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA (rrn P1) promoters require high initiating NTP concentrations for efficient transcription because they form unusually short-lived complexes with RNA polymerase; high initiating NTP concentrations [adenosine or guanosine triphosphate (ATP or GTP), depending on the rrn P1 promoter] are needed to bind to and stabilize the open complex. ATP and GTP concentrations, and therefore rrn P1 promoter activity, increase with growth rate. Because ribosomal RNA transcription determines the rate of ribosome synthesis, the control of ribosomal RNA transcription by NTP concentration provides a molecular explanation for the growth rate-dependent control and homeostatic regulation of ribosome synthesis."

Here we report the cloning of a new human gene encoding a G protein-coupled receptor that behaves as a selective purinoceptor and is coupled to the stimulation of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. Trypsin was from Flow Laboratories (Bioggio, Switzerland). Culture media, G418, fetal calf serum (FCS), 1The abbreviations used are: FCS, fetal calf serum; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; 2MeSATP, 2-methylthio-ATP; 2MeSADP, 2-methylthio-ADP; MTN, multiple human tissue Northern blot; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; kb, kilobase(s). restriction enzymes, and Taq polymerase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The radioactive products myo-d-[2-3H]inositol (17.7 Ci/mmol) and [α32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham (Ghent, Belgium). Dowex AG1X8 (formate form) was from Bio-Rad. ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine, UTP, UDP, AP4A, AP6A, all-trans retinoic acid, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were obtained from Sigma. 2-Methylthio-ATP (2MeSATP), 2-methylthio-ADP (2MeSADP) and 8-(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Forskolin was purchased from Calbiochem. (Bierges, Belgium). Indomethacin and Me2SO were from Merck. Rolipram was a gift from the Laboratoires Jacques Logeais (Trappes, France). The HL-60 human cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The human genomic DNA library was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The human placenta cDNA library was kindly given by Prof. P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France). pEFIN3 is an expression vector developed by Euroscreen (Brussels, Belgium). Multiple human tissue Northern blot (MTN) were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A human placenta cDNA library was screened at moderate stringency with an [α-32P]dATP-labeled P2Y4 receptor probe corresponding to a partial sequence covering the third to the seventh transmembrane segments. Three overlapping clones encoding a new G protein-coupled receptor were isolated but did not contain the 3′ end of the coding region. A human genomic DNA library was then screened with this partial sequence to obtain the complete sequence of this new receptor. The hybridization conditions for screening the two libraries were 6 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate) and 40% formamide at 42 °C for 14 h, and the final washing conditions were 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Four genomic clones were purified and shown to contain the 3′ end of the open reading frame missing in the cDNA clones. The sequence was obtained on both strands after subcloning of overlapping restriction fragments in M13mp18 and M13mp19 using the Sanger dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method. Two blots of human organs (MTN I and MTN II; 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane) and a blot containing total RNA from differentiated and undifferentiated HL-60 cells (10 μg of total RNA/lane) were hybridized with a probe corresponding to the new receptor to characterize its tissue distribution. The HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 5 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The HL-60 cells were incubated for 6 days with or without 1 μmretinoic acid or 1.25% Me2SO or for 8 h with 25 nm TPA. The RNA from the differentiated or undifferentiated HL-60 cells was prepared with the RNeasy kit (Quiagen). The blots were prehybridized 8 h at 42 °C in a 50% formamide, 2% SDS solution and hybridized for 18 h in the same solution supplemented with the α-32P-labeled probe. The final washing conditions were 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The blots were exposed for 12 days and visualized as an autoradiography or using the PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics). The complete sequence of the new receptor was subcloned between the HindIII and NheI sites of the bicistronic pEFIN3 expression vector. 1321N1 and CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the recombinant pEFIN3 plasmid or with the plasmid alone using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (19Velu T.J. Beguinot L. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Pastan I. Lowry D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 in complete medium (10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)) 2 days after transfection and maintained in the same medium (10Communi D. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 1321N1 cells were labeled for 24 h with 10 mCi/ml [3H]inositol in inositol-free DMEM containing 5% FCS, antibiotics, amphotericin, sodium pyruvate, and 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer Hepes (KRH) buffer of the following composition (124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 1.45 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 8 mm glucose) and incubated in the same medium for 30 min. The cells were then challenged by various nucleotides for 30 s. The incubation was stopped by the addition of an ice-cold 3% perchloric acid solution. Inositol phosphates were extracted and separated on Dowex columns as described previously (20Communi D. Raspé E. Pirotton S. Boeynaems J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stably transfected CHO-K1 or 1321N1 cell lines were spread on Petri dishes (150,000 cells/dish) and cultured in Ham's F-12 or DMEM medium containing 10% FCS, antibiotics, amphotericin, sodium pyruvate, and 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were preincubated for 30 min in KRH buffer with Rolipram (25 μm) and incubated for different times in the presence of the agonists (15 min in most experiments). The incubation was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m HCl. The incubation medium was dried up, resuspended in water, and diluted as required. Cyclic AMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay after acetylation as described previously (21Brooker G. Harper J.F. Teraseki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar). A human cDNA placenta library was screened at moderate stringency with a human P2Y4 probe. Nine clones that hybridized weakly with the P2Y4 probe were obtained, purified, and analyzed. Six of them corresponded to the sequence of the P2Y6 receptor (10Communi D. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas three overlapping clones corresponded to a partial sequence encoding a new G protein-coupled receptor, displaying about 30% identity with the other P2Y receptors. The partial open reading frame started with an ATG codon in a Kozak consensus, but the 3′ end was missing in all three cDNA clones (data not shown). We then screened a human genomic DNA library using this partial sequence as a probe. Four overlapping genomic clones were obtained. Mapping of the coding sequence and partial sequencing allowed determination that the gene encoding the new receptor contains an intron interrupting the coding sequence at the 5′ end of the gene. This intron separates the three first codons from the rest of the coding sequence (data not shown). Beside these first codons, the four genomic clones contained the complete open reading frame including the 3′ end missing in the cDNA clones. The full open reading frame appeared as 1113 base pairs long and encoded a protein of 371 amino acids containing one potential site for N-linked glycosylation and two potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C or calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (Fig.1). The new receptor, provisionally named P2Y11, displays significant homologies with the other P2Y receptors (Fig. 2). In particular, 33 and 28% amino acid identity were observed with the human P2Y1and P2Y2 receptors, respectively (Fig. 2).Figure 2Dendrogram representing the structural relatedness of the P2Y11 receptor with the other P2Y subtypes. The plot was constructed using the multiple sequence alignment program Pileup of the GCG package. The P2Y5-like published sequence (18Janssens R. Boeynaems J.M. Godart M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 226: 106-112Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is identical to the P2Y9 sequence submitted to the GenBank/EMBL™ Data Bank.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The tissue distribution of the new receptor transcripts was investigated by Northern blotting (Fig. 3). We first used a probe corresponding to a partial sequence encoding transmembrane segments 3–7. The strongest signal was observed for human spleen and corresponded to a 2-kilobase (kb) messenger RNA (MTN II). A weaker signal was observed in small intestine (MTN II). All the lanes in MTN I (heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas) were negative (data not shown). We also detected specific 2-kb transcripts in HL-60 cells. The signal was very weak in the undifferentiated HL-60 cells but increased when the cells had been treated with retinoic acid or Me2SO. No increase was observed when the HL-60 cells were stimulated with TPA. A weak nonspecific hybridization with 18 S rRNA was observed. These data were confirmed with a nonoverlapping probe corresponding to the first 300 base pairs of the coding region, presenting limited homologies with the other P2Y subtypes. The complete sequence of the new receptor was introduced in the pEFIN3 expression vector to transfect the 1321N1 astrocytoma cell line, used previously to characterize several P2Y subtypes (6Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ATP (100 μm) induced a strong inositol trisphosphate (IP3) accumulation in cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid, whereas ADP, AMP, adenosine, UTP, UDP, AP4A, and AP6A were inactive at the same concentration (data not shown). All nucleotides were totally inactive on the cells transfected with the vector alone. We then tested ATP, 2MeSATP, ADP, and 2MeSADP in a large range of concentrations. As shown in Fig. 4 A, ATP was the most potent agonist (EC50 ATP = 38 ± 7 μm; EC50 2MeSATP = 118 ± 15 μm; means ± range of two independent experiments). The effects of ADP and 2MeSADP were minimal. Pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml; 24 h pretreatment) had no effect on the ATP response (data not shown), whereas a lower concentration of pertussis toxin was previously shown to abolish the response to UTP in P2Y4 transfected 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (22Communi D. Motte S. Boeynaems J.M. Pirotton S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A response to ATP (10 μm) was also obtained following [Ca2+] i measurements performed on the 1321N1 transfected cells, whereas ADP was inactive at this concentration (data not shown). The 1321N1 cells transfected with the new receptor displayed a strong cAMP increase in response to ATP. A much lower but significant endogeneous response due to the degradation of adenine nucleotides into adenosine was also obtained in the 1321N1 cells transfected with the vector alone (data not shown). The CHO-K1 cells express an endogeneous P2Y2 receptor coupled to the phosphoinositide pathway (23Iredale P.A. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) but do not possess adenosine receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase. We therefore used CHO-K1 cells to characterize the coupling of the new receptor to the cAMP pathway. A pool of G418-resistant CHO-K1 clones was first tested for its response to several nucleotides at a concentration of 100 μm. ATP was able to induce a strong increase in the cAMP content, whereas it was inactive on cells transfected with the vector alone (data not shown). ADP, AMP, adenosine, UTP, and UDP were completely inactive. Concentration-action curves were established for ATP, 2MeSATP, ADP, and 2MeSADP (Fig.4 B). The rank order of potency was the same as in the inositol phosphate study on 1321N1 cells. The curves were obtained after 15 min of stimulation by the agonists; however, a significant cAMP response to ATP was already obtained after 2 min of stimulation (data not shown). The response to ATP (30 μm) was inhibited neither by indomethacin (10 μg/ml, present from 30 min before the stimulation and readded in the stimulation medium) nor by 8-(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline (100 μm) (data not shown). We describe here the cloning of a new human receptor of the P2Y family. This receptor presents some structural peculiarities that differentiate it from some other P2Y subtypes. Concerning its gene structure, the coding sequence is interrupted by an intron. Comparison between the cDNA and the genomic DNA sequences has clearly demonstrated the absence of intron in the coding regions of the human P2Y1 receptor (24Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 25Janssens R. Communi D. Pirotton S. Samson M. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the rat P2Y2 receptor (26Godecke S. Decking U.K. Godecke A. Schrader J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C570-C577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the rat P2Y6 receptor (11Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of protein structure, the second and third extracellular loops are significantly longer than those of the other P2Y receptors. The homology with the other subtypes is relatively weak (about 30%). The closest G-coupled receptor is the human P2Y1 receptor (33%), which is also a receptor responsive to adenine nucleotides (3Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 4Léon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments with the P2Y2 receptor have identified three positively charged amino acids in the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (His262, Arg265, and Arg292), which play a crucial role in nucleotide binding (presumably by neutralizing the negative charge of the phosphate groups) (27Erb L. Garrad R. Wang Y. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These three residues are conserved in this new receptor. So far, eight P2Y receptor subtypes are described in the literature (P2Y1–P2Y8). In addition, two sequences related to the P2Y5 receptor and named P2Y9 and P2Y10 have been recently submitted to the GenBank/EMBL™ Data Bank. The P2Y9 sequence is identical to that recently published under the name “P2Y5-like” (18Janssens R. Boeynaems J.M. Godart M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 226: 106-112Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the new receptor described in this paper might be called P2Y11. However, it is already clear that the nomenclature needs a revision. It was recently demonstrated that the P2Y7 receptor is actually a receptor for leukotriene B4 (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), and there is no functional evidence that the P2Y5 and related receptors (P2Y5-like or P2Y9 and P2Y10) are nucleotide receptors (17Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,18Janssens R. Boeynaems J.M. Godart M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 226: 106-112Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Among the 16 human organs tested by Northern blotting, P2Y11 transcripts of 2 kb were only detectable in spleen and with lower intensity in small intestine. This distribution is reminiscent of that of the human P2Y6 1.7-kb messenger. We have also observed expression of the P2Y11 receptor in the HL-60 cell line; this expression was strongly increased following treatment by Me2SO or retinoic acid, two agents known to induce the differentiation of these cells into granulocytes (28Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). On the contrary, TPA, which is known to induce the monocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells (29Blaineau C. Avner P. Tunnacliffe A. Goodfellow P. EMBO J. 1983; 11: 2007-2012Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), did not stimulate the expression of the P2Y11 receptor. The confirmation of these data with a second probe of the P2Y11 cDNA, which shares little similarity with other P2Y sequences, excludes possible cross-hybridization with another P2Y receptor transcript. In view of the Northern blot results, it is tempting to speculate that the P2Y11 receptor is involved in the recently described accumulation of cAMP in ATP-stimulated HL-60 cells (30Jiang L. Foster F.M. Ward P. Tasevski V. Luttrell B.M. Conigrave A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A possible role of this new receptor in the immune system has to be investigated. Among the P2Y receptors, the P2Y11 subtype has the unique property of activating both the phosphoinositide and the cAMP pathways. Other cloned P2Y receptors are coupled to phospholipase C exclusively (except for the P2Y5 receptor for which the transduction mechanisms remain unknown). The rank order of potency of agonists was the same for the two pathways. ATP was clearly much more potent than ADP. This difference may be even underestimated as a result of low level ATP contamination in ADP preparation or conversion of ADP into ATP during assays (4Léon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, 2MeSATP had the same maximal effect than ATP but presented a lower potency, whereas 2MeSADP, a potent activator of the P2Y1 and P2T subtypes (4Léon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Leray C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), was almost inactive. The EC50 values were comparable with those obtained in the study concerning the effects of extracellular nucleotides on the cAMP accumulation in the HL-60 cells (30Jiang L. Foster F.M. Ward P. Tasevski V. Luttrell B.M. Conigrave A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Stimulatory effects of adenine nucleotides on the cAMP pathway have been described in different cell types (31Matsuoka I. Zhou Q. Ishimoto H. Nakanishi H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar, 32Song S.L. Chueh S.H. Brain Res. 1996; 734: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In most cases, the stimulatory effect of nucleotides was inhibited by xanthines. These data suffer from the fact that it is difficult to exclude that the effect of adenine nucleotides is mediated by their degradation into adenosine due to the ubiquitous presence of ectonucleotidases expressed at the cell surface. The cAMP study has been performed with CHO-K1 cells to avoid the endogeneous cAMP response to adenosine in the astrocytoma cell line. Neither in untransfected CHO-K1 cells nor in P2Y11-transfected CHO-K1 cells did adenosine increase cAMP accumulation. Furthermore the cAMP response to ATP was insensitive to xanthine inhibition. It was also insensitive to indomethacin, indicating that is not mediated by the release of prostaglandins. It is unlikely that the cAMP response would be an indirect consequence of the calcium response because the use of ATP, which activates the phosphoinositide pathway by the activation of P2Y2endogeneous receptors, or the use of calcium ionophores in the CHO-K1 cells failed to stimulate cAMP accumulation (33Thekkumkara T.J. Du J. Zwaagstra C. Conrad K.M. Krupinski J. Baker K.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 152: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore our data constitute the first strong evidence that a P2 receptor can be coupled to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The physiological relevance of this effect as well as the physiological role of the P2Y11 receptor remain to be determined. We thank Dr. J. E. Dumont and Dr. G. Vassart for helpful advice and discussions. We are grateful to Prof. A. Herschuelz and Dr. C. Lebeau for the Ca2+ measurements. We thank Dr. M.

The two major variants (Thr-Gly)17 and (Thr-Gly)20 are distributed as a highly significant latitudinal cline in Europe and North Africa. Thr-Gly length variation from both wild-caught and transgenic individuals is related to the flies' ability to maintain a circadian period at different temperatures. This phenomenon provides a selective explanation for the geographical distribution of Thr-Gly lengths and gives a rare glimpse of the interplay between molecular polymorphism, behavior, population biology, and natural selection."

Although purified PKC proteins can phosphorylate many different substrates in vitro, individual PKC isoforms appear to mediate distinct and separate functions in vivo, due to their selective localization to different subcellular sites.In unstimulated cells, PKCα resides primarily in the cytoplasm, and upon stimulation of cells with signals that promote the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, it translocates to the plasma membrane (4Kvanta A. Jondal M. Fredholm B.B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as well as the nuclear envelope (5James G. Olson E. J.

It has been proposed that the localization of PKC to different intracellular sites is mediated by specific PKC-binding proteins that can discriminate between different PKC isoforms. A number of PKC binding proteins have been cloned and characterized (8Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 806-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Jaken S. Curr. Opin.

PDZ domain-containing proteins have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions during receptor and ion channel clustering and to recruit kinases and phosphatases to their membrane-associated substrates. Certain PDZ domains have also been shown to homooligomerize, thereby contributing to the formation of multiprotein complexes at specific subcellular sites (23Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S.

Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Here we report that PICK1 contains a PDZ domain at its NH2 terminus, which is required for interaction with a PDZ-binding motif (QSAV) at the extreme COOH terminus of PKCα. This PDZ-binding motif is specific to PKCα and can account for the selective interaction of PICK1 with activated PKCα and not with other PKC isoforms. PICK1 can also homooligomerize through its PDZ domain. We also describe a PICK1-like protein from Caenorhabditis elegans that can function as a PKCα-binding protein, suggesting a conservation of function through evolution. We speculate that the function of PICK1 is to localize activated PKCα to the plasma membrane, thereby bringing the kinase in proximity with specific substrates and lending isoform specificity in vivo to the kinase.DISCUSSIONOur results show that PICK1 contains a PDZ domain that is required for interaction with the COOH terminus of PKCα. PICK1 is also able to homooligomerize through its PDZ domain, but mutations in the putative carboxylate-binding loop that abolish binding to PKCα have no effect on homooligomerization. The finding that determinants for interaction of PICK1 with itself and with PKCα are separable suggests that PICK1 can simultaneously self-associate and interact with PKCα. The fact that the extreme COOH terminus of PKCα mediates binding to PICK1 also suggests that the kinase can be catalytically active when bound to PICK1.Among the vertebrate PKC isoforms, the consensus sequence for PDZ binding is contained only in PKCα. Thus, the specific interaction of this sequence with PICK1 provides a molecular mechanism for the selective targeting of PKCα to distinct subcellular sites, thereby allowing specific phosphorylation events to occur. In Drosophila, the subcellular location and substrate specificity of eye-specific PKC(InaC) has been shown to be regulated by the PDZ domain-containing protein InaD (30Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun J. Bodner R. Suzuke E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zucker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of InaC contains the sequence ITII, which is compatible with PDZ binding (17Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chisti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar).Our results show that the C. elegans PICK1-like protein recognizes the COOH terminus of mammalian PKCα. There have been several PKC proteins identified thus far in C. elegans, but none contain a PDZ-binding domain at their COOH terminus. This suggests either that additional, as yet unidentified PKC proteins exist in this organism or that this PICK1-like protein interacts with other PDZ-binding proteins.It will be of interest to define the spectrum of proteins that interact with PICK1. It is possible that PDZ-PDZ interactions may enable PICK1 to interact with other PDZ domain-containing proteins. The NMDA receptor, for example, which clusters specifically at the postsynaptic density in the neuronal synapse, binds to PSD-95 and has been reported to be regulated by PKC activity (31Tingley W.G.

Here we have examined the influence of three c-myc mRNA 5′-leaders on the translation of chimeric myc-CAT mRNAs. We observed that in the reticulocyte rabbit lysate, these 5′-leaders lead to cap-independent translation initiation. To determine whether this kind of initiation resulted from the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), COS-7 cells were transfected with bicistronic vectors containing the different c-myc5′-leaders in the intercistronic region. An IRES was identified, requiring elements located within the P2 leader, between nucleotides −363 and −94 upstream from the CUG start codon. This is the first demonstration of the existence of IRES-dependent translation for a proto-oncogene.

This IRES could be a translation enhancer, allowing activation of c-myc expression under the control of trans-acting factors and in response to specific cell stimuli. The c-myc proto-oncogene has a fundamental role in various cellular events, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The human c-myc gene is transcribed from four alternative promoters. In normal cells, most of the transcripts start at the P1 and P2 promoters, the latter accounting for 75–90% of the c-myc mRNA. In Burkitt's lymphoma cells that have a c-myc chromosomal translocation, the P1 promoter is preferentially used. In addition, two additional promoters, P0 and P3, are located 600 nucleotides upstream from the P1 promoter and in the first intron of the gene, respectively (2Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Ar-Rushdi A. Nishikura K. Erikson J. Watt R. Rovera G. Croce C.M. Science. 1983; 222: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, P0 mRNA can reach levels of >10% of the total c-myc mRNA (4Eick D. Polack A. Kofler E. Lenoir G.M. Rickinson A.B. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1397-1402PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the coding capacity of the four c-mycmRNAs is different. P1 and P2 mRNAs encode two proteins of 64 and 67 kDa, designated as c-Myc1 and c-Myc2, respectively, by a process of alternative initiation of translation starting at two in-frame codons, CUG and AUG (5Hann S.R. King M.W. Bentley D.L. Anderson C.W. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1988; 52: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). c-Myc1 and c-Myc2 proteins, whose ratio is regulated in response to methionine starvation, are transcription factors with distinct DNA targets (6Blackwood E.M.

P0 mRNA is a natural polycistronic mRNA containing three open reading frames (ORFs). 1The abbreviations used are: ORFs, open reading frames; nt, nucleotide(s); RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: ORFs, open reading frames; nt, nucleotide(s); RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor. The 3′-ORF codes for c-Myc1 and c-Myc2 proteins, whereas the middle and 5′-ORFs, which have initiation codons upstream from the P1 promoter, code for proteins of 188 and 114 amino acids, respectively (2Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Gazin C. Dupont de Dinechin S. Hampe A. Masson J.M. Martin P. Stehelin D. Galibert F. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Only the 188-amino acid product has been characterized in HeLa cells. The function of this MycHEX1 protein remains unknown, however (9Gazin C. Rigolet M. Briand J.P. van Regenmortel M.H.V. Galibert F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast to the coding capacity of P0, P1, and P2 mRNAs, that of P3 mRNA is restricted to the 64-kDa c-Myc2 protein. The transcription starting points of the P0, P1, and P2 c-myc mRNAs are located 1172, 524, and 363 nt upstream from the CUG initiation codon, respectively. According to the classical cap-dependent scanning model, such long leader sequences are expected to impair translation initiation by preventing the ribosome scanning from the capped mRNA 5′-end (10Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). It has indeed been reported that the c-myc P1 leader has an inhibitory effect on translation of the c-myc mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and in Xenopus oocytes (11Parkin N. Darveau A. Nicholson R. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2875-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Fraser S.D. Wilkes-Johnston J. Browder L.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1223-1230PubMed Google Scholar). However, in several mRNAs, mainly of viral origin, the structure of long leader sequences has been shown to constitute an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (13Jackson R.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Jackson R.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), allowing translation initiation to be cap-independent. The internal entry process, first shown for picornaviruses (15Jang S.K.

The best characterized of these factors is the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, also known as a splicing factor (22Jang S.K. Wimmer E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1560-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 23Patton J.G. Meyer S.A. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B.

Due to their positive regulation by cellular factors, IRESs can be considered as translation enhancers, allowing activation of tightly controlled genes in response to specific stimuli (25Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the presence of an IRES in P0, P1, and P2 c-myc mRNAs, implying an element located between nucleotides −363 and −95 upstream from the CUG start codon. The c-myc P1 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of total mRNA from human tumorigenic cells (kindly provided by D. Morello) using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Goldstar Taq DNA polymerase (Eurogentec). The 5′- and 3′-primers used for this amplification, 5′-TCGCTCTAGATGAGGACCCCCGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTGGCGCCGATATCCTCGCTGGGCGC-3′, respectively, gave a cDNA fragment extending from positions 1 to 712 from the P1 leader 5′-end (positions 1 and 712 are 1361 nt downstream from the P0 leader 5′-end and 143 nt downstream from the AUG codon, respectively). This fragment was inserted into the plasmid pFC1, derived from the pSCT vector, upstream from the CAT coding sequence and under the control of cytomegalovirus and T7 promoters (26Prats A.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeric construct, pSCT-MyCAT-P1, was expected to encode two Myc-CAT proteins of 29 and 31 kDa, respectively. The c-myc P2 cDNA was obtained from the construct MyCAT-P1 by PCR amplification and cloning of the fragment extending from the P2 5′-end (610 nt downstream from the P0 5′-end) to 3′ of CAT using oligonucleotides 5′-AGAGTCTAGAACTCGCTGTAGTAATTCCAGC-3′ and 5′-AATCTCGAGTCTAGAGTATTCGCCCCGCCCTGCCA-3′ (CATrev) as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The plasmid pSCT-MyCAT-P2 was constructed by insertion of the Myc-CAT-P2 fragment into the pSCT vector. The c-myc P0 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification of the P0 cDNA leader from the plasmid pHLM-P1 containing the c-myc genomic sequence (kindly provided by D. Morello) with oligonucleotides 5′-AGAGTCTAGAAACAAATGCAATGGGAGTTTATTCATAACGCGC-3′ (5′P0) and 5′-CCCGCCAAGCCTCTGAGAAGCCCTGCCC-3′ as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. This fragment, corresponding to nt 1–750 of the P0 cDNA, was inserted in the MyCAT-P1 construct to recreate the complete P0 leader. The new plasmid was called pSCT-MyCAT-P0. The construct pSCT-MyCAT-Δ1, with a deleted leader, was constructed by PCR amplification from the plasmid pSCT-MyCAT-P0 of the fragment extending from nt 1158 (counting from the P0 5′-end) to 3′ of the CAT sequence using oligonucleotides 5′-AGAGTCTAGAGCAGCTGCTTAGACGCTGGAT-3′ and CATrev as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The PCR fragment was introduced into the pSCT vector. The construct pSCT-MyCAT-Δ2 was obtained using the same strategy as that used for MyCAT-Δ1, but with the 5′-primer 5′-AAAACTAGTCGACGCGGGGAGGCTATT-3′ (with a 5′-end at position 1078 from the P0 5′-end). To mutate the P1 promoter, two PCR fragments were amplified from pSCT-MyCAT-P0 DNA. The first fragment, obtained with oligonucleotides 5′P0 and 5′-TTTCATATGAAAGGGCCGGTGGGCG-3′ as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, extended from nt 1 (from the P0 5′-end) to nt 627 (position of the P1 TATA box), with an NdeI site at the 3′-end in the P1 TATA box; the second fragment, obtained with oligonucleotides 5′-TTTCATATGCGAGGGTCTGGACGGC-3′ and CATrev as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, extended from nt 622 of the P0 leader (P1 TATA box) to 3′ of CAT, with an NdeI site at the 5′-end. The two fragments were cloned in the pSCT vector, and the new plasmid was called pSCT-MyCAT-P0(P1*). The P2 promoter was mutated using the same strategy as that used for the P1 promoter. Two PCR fragments were amplified from the construct MyCAT-P0(P1*). The first, obtained with oligonucleotides 5′P0 and 5′-GGGATGCATACTCAGCGCGATCCCTC-3′ as the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, extended from nt 1 (from the P0 5′-end) to nt 786 (position of the P2 TATA box), with an NsiI site at the 3′-end; the second fragment, obtained with oligonucleotides 5′-GGGATGCATGCCGGTTTTCGGGGCTT-3′ and CATrev as the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, extended from nt 781 of the P0 leader (position of the P2 TATA box) to 3′ of CAT, with an NsiI site at the 5′-end. The two fragments were cloned in the pSCT vector, and the new plasmid, with the two mutated promoters, was called pSCT-MyCAT-P0*. The two series of bicistronic vectors, pSCT-HP-MyCAT and BI-MyCAT (with or without a 5′-hairpin, respectively), were constructed from the bicistronic vectors pHP-FC1 and pBI-FC1 with an FGF-CAT fusion (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The Myc-CAT fusions with different leaders were introduced downstream from CAT, in place of the FGF-CAT fusion. The nucleotide sequences of the different DNA constructs were verified using an automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). DNAs were linearized, and transcription was performed with T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm and ethidium bromide staining on agarose gel, and their integrity was verified. Translation was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The amounts of mRNA present in the translation assays were checked by Northern blotting. The translation products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography and quantitation on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). COS-7 monkey cells were transfected with 1 μg/ml DNA by the DEAE-dextran method (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared 48 h later. Total proteins were prepared, quantified, and analyzed by Western immunoblotting (5 μg of proteins from each cell lysate) as described previously (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). CAT proteins were immunodetected using rabbit polyclonal anti-CAT antibodies prepared in our laboratory (1:20,000 dilution). Total cellular RNA was prepared by the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.) from pellets containing 5 × 106 transfected scraped cells. Northern blotting was performed as described previously (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dATP using a random priming kit (Promega). Total cellular RNA (1 μg/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis through 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized under the conditions described previously (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To evaluate the translational regulation of c-Myc protein expression by the different leaders P0, P1, and P2, the three leader sequences, measuring 1172, 524, and 363 nt, respectively, were fused to the CAT coding sequence (Fig.1 A, pSCT-MyCAT-P0, pSCT-MyCAT-P1, and pSCT-MyCAT-P2). Two deletions were also created in the 5′-region of the MyCAT-P2 construct, resulting in small leaders of 94 and 14 nt for the constructs MyCAT-Δ2 and MyCAT-Δ1, respectively (Fig. 1 A). All these constructs were expected to code for two Myc-CAT proteins translated from the myc CUG and AUG start codons, located at positions 1173 and 1218 from the P0 5′-end. In addition, the vector pSCT-MyCAT-P0 contains two 5′-open reading frames of 114 and 188 amino acids, starting at positions 53 and 625 from P0 5′-end, respectively (Fig. 1 A) (2Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Gazin C. Dupont de Dinechin S. Hampe A. Masson J.M. Martin P. Stehelin D. Galibert F. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The 188-amino acid ORF codes for the MycHEX1 protein. The vector pSCT-MyCAT-P1 should allow the synthesis of a slightly truncated form of the MycHEX1 protein from a CUG codon located 10 nt downstream from the P1 mRNA 5′-end (in fact, 24 nt from the T7 promoter used for in vitrotranscription). The MyCAT-P0 construct contains the P1 and P2 TATA boxes. To distinguish between the transcription and translation capacities of this plasmid in transfected cells, we abolished the putative activity of these internal promoters by mutating the two P1 and P2 TATA boxes in the MyCAT-P0 construct (as described under “Materials and Methods”); the new construct was designated MyCAT-P0* (Fig.1 A). Capped and uncapped mRNAs were transcribed in vitro and translated in RRL in the presence of [35S]methionine. Their translation efficiencies were compared (Fig. 1, B and C). The translational levels of capped P0, P1, P2, and Δ2 mRNAs were approximately 2, 10, 50, and 100% of that of the capped Δ1 mRNA devoid of leader sequence, respectively (Fig. 1,B (lanes 2, 6, 8,10, and 12) and C). P0* mRNA, with mutations of the P1 and P2 TATA boxes, was translated at the same level as P0 mRNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 4). The ratio of the two proteins Myc-CAT1 and Myc-CAT2 was not influenced by the presence of the 5′-leaders P1, P2, and Δ2 (Fig. 1,B (lanes 6, 8, and 10) and C). The Δ1 5′-leader was responsible for lower Myc-CAT1 expression, probably resulting from its shortness (Fig. 1 B,lane 12). In contrast, the P0 and P0* 5′-leaders led to a relative increase in Myc-CAT1 expression (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2 and 4). The translation efficiencies of the capped and uncapped mRNAs were compared to determine the cap dependence of translation initiation. The expression of the Myc-CAT proteins using P0 and P0* mRNAs was cap-independent, whereas the expression of 5′-ORF1 was increased in the presence of the cap (Fig. 1, B (lanes 2–5) and C). Translation of Myc-CAT proteins with P1 mRNA was little influenced by the cap, whereas the expression of the MycHEX1 protein, hardly detectable in the P0 construct, was cap-dependent (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6 and 7). Finally, Myc-CAT protein expression was weakly cap-dependent from P2 mRNA, but strongly cap-dependent from the deleted Δ2 and Δ1 mRNAs (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6–13). In conclusion, these experiments clearly show that cap-independent expression of CUG- and AUG-initiated Myc-CAT proteins is conferred by the three P0, P1, and P2 c-myc 5′-leaders. However, a weak cap-dependent translation initiation was also observed with the P1 and P2 5′-leaders, whereas synthesis of the 5′-ORFs was cap-dependent in P0 and P1 mRNAs. To determine whether the cap-independent translation initiation, observed in the RRL system for the P0 leader and also for the P1 and P2 leaders, occurred by a process of ribosome entry, we looked for the presence of an IRES in the c-myc mRNA. The same bicistronic vector assay as that described for the identification of FGF-2 and murine leukemia virus IRESs in previous reports (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 27Vagner S. Waysbort A. Marenda M. Gensac M.-C. Amalric F. Prats A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20376-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used. This strategy is based on the principle that, according to the cap-dependent ribosome scanning model (10Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar), the second ORF of a bicistronic mRNA will not be expressed unless it is preceded by an IRES. Two series of bicistronic vectors were constructed; the first one had as the first ORF the CAT coding sequence and as the second ORF the above-described Myc-CAT fusion sequence (Fig. 2, BI-MyCAT). The presence of two tandem CAT genes encoding proteins of different sizes allowed comparison of the expression of the two cistrons (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 27Vagner S. Waysbort A. Marenda M. Gensac M.-C. Amalric F. Prats A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20376-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The different c-myc leaders described in Fig. 1 A were inserted in the intercistronic region. The second series of bicistronic vectors was derived from the first by the introduction, upstream from the first ORFs, of a stable hairpin intended to inhibit the cap-dependent, but not the IRES-mediated, initiation of translation (Fig. 2, HP-MyCAT) (17Macejak D.J. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The different bicistronic DNAs, with or without a hairpin, were used to transiently transfect COS-7 cells. The natural tricistronic vector MyCAT-P0* (encoding ORF1, MycHEX1, and Myc-CAT) was also used in these transfection experiments. Northern experiments enabled us to check that the bicistronic mRNAs had the expected size (Fig.3 A). The absence of any additional band allowed us to rule out the presence of an active internal promoter. The expression of CAT and Myc-CAT proteins was analyzed by Western immunoblotting with an anti-CAT antibody. The results showed that in COS cells, the Myc-CAT proteins were efficiently expressed, compared with CAT first cistron, from the bicistronic vectors BI-MyCAT-P0* and HP-MyCAT-P0*: both were expressed as efficiently as the MyCAT-P0* construct, which lacks the CAT first cistron (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2–4). The bicistronic P2 construct also expressed the Myc-CAT cistron (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6). The presence of the 5′-hairpin down-regulated the CAT cistron expression from these vectors, but had no effect on the expression of the Myc-CAT cistron (indicating that Myc-CAT was expressed in a cap-independent manner). In contrast, Myc-CAT expression was barely detectable with the bicistronic Δ2 and Δ1 vectors (Fig.3 B, lanes 7–10). We conclude from these data that an IRES is present in both the P0 and P2 5′-leaders of c-myc mRNA. This structure therefore involves elements located between nucleotides −363 and −94 upstream from the CUG initiation codon. Furthermore, the IRES allows a higher Myc-CAT translational level compared with the CAT first cistron, indicating that it is very efficient. Fig.4 A shows a sequence alignment of c-myc P2 leader sequence with nucleotides 189–487 of human FGF-2 mRNA containing the IRES. Although there is no striking sequence homology, several conserved GC-rich stretches are apparent. According to a recent report, several of these blocks are involved in stems of the E1 and E2 motifs predicted to form the FGF-2 IRES structure (28Le S.-Y. Maizel J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar): in particular, the a/a′, b/b′, and d/d′ elements of the E2 motif (Fig. 4 A). The c-myc P2 RNA structure predicted by the Zuker method (35Zukev M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar), with aΔG of −122 kcal/mol, divides the leader into three major domains (Fig.4 B). The large D1 domain alone has a ΔG of −78 kcal/mol. The D1 and D2 domains, extending from nucleotides 1 to 205 and from nucleotides 206 to 293, respectively, could participate in the IRES as they are not present in the IRES-minus Δ2 construct (starting at nucleotide 269 from the P2 5′-end). In this study, we demonstrate the presence of an IRES in the c-myc mRNA. So far, it is the first IRES to be characterized in the mRNA of a proto-oncogene. Most of the few cellular mRNAs described up to now as containing IRESs code for proteins involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation and require stringent regulation, as do c-myc mRNAs; these genes need to be expressed at very specific stages of cell life and/or in response to different stimuli (17Macejak D.J. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 18Oh S.-K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Teerink H.

The IRES, being a recognition site for translational regulatory factors, allows translational activation of the expression of such messengers presenting a low or even non-existent level of cap-dependent translation; thus, internal ribosome entry constitutes a novel mechanism of gene expression regulation. This has been shown in the case of FGF-2, whose CUG-initiated isoforms are translationally activated in response to stress (25Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the constitutive expression of these FGF-2 isoforms has been observed in transformed cells (25Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 2B. Galy, unpublished results. Such observations suggest that, in the case of c-myc, a relationship may exist between IRES activation and cell transformation. To corroborate this hypothesis, it has been recently reported that c-myc expression is activated at the translational level in cell lines derived from patients with the cancer-prone disorder Bloom's syndrome (29West M.J. Sullivan N.F. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2515-2524PubMed Google Scholar). This activation does not appear to be mediated by the cap-binding eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, suggesting that it occurs through a cap-independent pathway. In the light of our results, one can postulate that in these cells, c-myc is activated by an IRES-dependent translation pathway. This activation may be triggered by the increased level of DNA strand breaks that occurs in Bloom's syndrome cells, as previously proposed (29West M.J. Sullivan N.F. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2515-2524PubMed Google Scholar). This supports our hypothesis, already suggested by the stress activation of FGF-2 isoforms (25Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), that the internal ribosome entry process is a cellular regulation pathway allowing a rapid response to disorder-generating stimuli. The c-myc mRNA is the third example of an mRNA with alternative initiation codons to contain an IRES (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 27Vagner S. Waysbort A. Marenda M. Gensac M.-C. Amalric F. Prats A.-C. J. Biol.

However, in contrast to Moloney murine leukemia virus retroviral mRNA, showing an IRES between its CUG and AUG initiation codons and allowing translation of the AUG-initiated protein exclusively, the c-myc mRNA has an IRES located upstream from the two initiation codons. Thus, this IRES controls the expression of both c-Myc1 and c-Myc2 proteins and is similar in this respect to that found in the FGF-2 mRNA. The sequence alignment of c-myc and FGF-2 IRESs does not show a strong sequence homology (Fig.4 A); however, several conserved GC-rich stretches are apparent that could lead to a structural homology (28Le S.-Y. Maizel J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The c-myc IRES secondary structure prediction shows three major domains (Fig. 4 B), whose function will be investigated. The possible similarity between FGF-2 and c-myc IRESs mentioned above may be related to the fact that both genes play a role in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Indeed, the translation efficiency of oncogene expression emerges more and more in the literature as an important regulatory target in malignant conversion. This translation efficiency can be regulated by at least two pathways. The first pathway is cap-dependent; oncogene messengers with highly structured untranslated regions can be up-regulated by overexpression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, characterized as a proto-oncogene (31de Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 32Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). We show here that a second possible pathway involving the IRESs should be considered. These specific structures are under the control of internal entry factors. Work is in progress to identify the factors involved in this regulation mechanism. Furthermore, both processes are related to one another in a regulatory loop: eukaryotic initiation factor 4E is indeed activated by growth factors (33Frederickson R.M. Mushynski W.E. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and its expression is induced by several oncogenes, including c-myc (34Rosenwald I.B. Rhoads D.B. Callanan L.D. Isselbacher K.J. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6175-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, the disregulation of the c-myc IRES will have a cascade effect that is likely to have drastic consequences on the control of cell growth. Finally, since this IRES is remarkably efficient, it is also particularly interesting in a biotechnological point of view: it can serve for the design of polycistronic vectors expressing several proteins from the same mRNA.

An understanding of the biochemistry and expression patterns of these receptors is therefore central to our overall understanding of the roles played by chemokines in both physiological and pathological processes. To date, eight receptors for the β-chemokine subfamily have been described. We have recently cloned a novel murine β-chemokine receptor and report here the identification and characterization of a highly homologous human gene termed human D6 (hD6). This is a promiscuous β-chemokine receptor and appears to be able to bind the majority of members of the β-chemokine family. It is, however, specific for this family and shows no detectable affinity for members of the α-chemokine or the C or CXXXC chemokines. Unlike the majority of other chemokine receptors, human D6 does not appear to be able to flux calcium following ligand binding, thus it is currently not clear if this novel receptor is indeed a signaling receptor. Human D6 is expressed in a range of tissues including hemopoietic cells although it appears not to be ubiquitously expressed in hemopoietic cells. Human D6, unlike some other β-chemokine receptors, appears not to be able to function as an entry co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-)1 on CD4-expressing cells.

Human D6, unlike some other β-chemokine receptors, appears not to be able to function as an entry co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-)1 on CD4-expressing cells. The chemokine family of peptides is defined on the basis of sequence homology and on the presence of variations on a conserved cysteine motif (1Schall T.J. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 2Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). The family can be subdivided on the basis of this motif into two major subfamilies, in which members of each contain four characteristic cysteine residues. This subdivision therefore defines the CC or β-chemokine family in which the first two cysteines are juxtaposed, and the CXC or α-chemokine family in which there is an intervening amino acid between the first two cysteines. Further, two subfamilies have recently been described, the C family, which has only two cysteines in the mature protein (3Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A.

The sole member of the C family cloned to date is Lymphotactin, and Fractalkine is the only member of the CXXXC family identified thus far. Chemokines display a range of in vitro and in vivo functions ranging from pro-inflammatory activities on a range of cell types to proliferative regulatory activities. All functions of the chemokine family are believed to be signaled into a responsive cell using members of the G-protein-coupled heptahelical receptor family (6Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To date, a number of CC and CXC chemokine receptors have been cloned. In general these receptors are specific for the respective subfamilies, however, they do display complex and overlapping ligand binding profiles. Thus far, four α-chemokine receptors (CXCR1–4) have been described (7Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 8Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.-J.

We now report the identification and characterization of a novel human β-chemokine receptor that has high structural and functional homology to a murine receptor, which we have recently described (30Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.W. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This receptor, which we have designated human D6, is a promiscuous β-chemokine receptor and appears to bind the majority of members of the β-chemokine family. In contrast to some other CC chemokine receptors, hD6 does not appear to support HIV-1 or SIV entry into CD4-expressing cells. We have, so far, been unable to demonstrate signaling through human D6 following ligand binding, and in keeping with the agreed restrictions on chemokine receptor nomenclature, designation of human D6 as CCR9 awaits such data. All chemokines were purchased from PeproTech (London, United Kingdom) except human HCC-1 and murine JE, which were purchased from R&D systems (Abingdon UK). The murine MIP-1α used in these studies is a nonaggregating variant with wild-type activity as described previously (31Graham G.J. Mackenzie J. Lowe S. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Issacson A. Medicherla J. Fang F. Wilkinson P.C. Pragnell I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4974-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All peptides were maintained at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Fragments of human D6 were generated by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR using the following primers designed from the murine D6 receptor (30Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.W. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in two regions that show conservation of amino acid sequence between other human and mouse chemokine receptors: at the 5′ end, hD6TCM, 5′-TG(C/T) GGI ATC TT(C/T) TT(C/T) AT(C/T) ACI TG(C/T) ATG-3′; or hD6DKY, 5′-GAC AA(A/G) TA(C/T) CTI GA(A/G) AT(C/T) GTI CA(C/T) GC-3′; at the 3′end, hD6HCC, 5′-GTA CAG IAC IGG IGT (A/G)CA (A/G)CA (A/G)TG-3′. PCR was performed using variable amounts of MgCl2 (from 1.25 to 2.25 mm), 0.3 mm of each dNTP, and 6 ng/μl of one of the 5′ oligonucleotides and hD6HCC. Genomic DNA template isolated from human lymphocytes was used at 1 μg per reaction. Reactions were incubated for 94 °C for 1 min, 50–52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. Products of expected size were cloned into pCRScript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. Two different products were cloned: hD6, and a fragment identical to the previously cloned orphan heptahelical receptor, RDC-1. 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of the hD6 cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using RACE kits from Life Technologies, Ltd. (Paisley, UK), using oligonucleotide primers designed from the sequenced fragment. Reverse transcribed U937 cDNA was used as a template for the RACE reactions, which had previously been shown to express hD6. Once the start and stop codons were identified, the full-length gene was amplified with Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) in three separate reactions from human lymphocyte DNA. These products were cloned into pCRScript and fully sequenced. The three products were identical. CHO cells were maintained in special liquid medium (Life Technologies, Ltd.) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (TCS Biologicals, Buckingham, UK). The full-length cDNA for hD6 in the pcDNA3 expression vector was transfected into CHO cells as described previously (32Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang M.L.-S. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected in 1.6 mg/ml Geneticin. Hos.CD4 transfectants were generated essentially as described previously (28Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M. DiMarzio P. Marmon S. Sutton R.E. Hill C.M. Davis C.B.

Briefly, hD6 was ligated into the pBABE-puro retroviral vector (34Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), and this construct was used to transduce the Hos.CD4 human osteosarcoma cell line stably expressing the human CD4 cDNA. Transduced cells were selected in 1 μg/ml puromycin and cell surface expression of hD6 confirmed by radioiodinated MIP-1α binding and Scatchard analysis (see below). hD6 expression in poly(A)+ mRNA from human tissue was assessed using blots obtained from Cambridge Bioscience (Cambridge, UK). Full-length hD6 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Ready To Go labeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., St. Albans, UK) and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using NICK-Sephadex G-50 columns (Pharmacia). The probe was denatured by heating at 100 °C for 3 min prior to hybridization, which was performed with Express-Hyb (Cambridge Bioscience) according to instructions obtained with the blots. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film and stripped in 0.1% SDS prior to reprobing with a murine β-actin cDNA probe (D. Jarmin, Beatson Institute). RT-PCR was performed using the RNA PCR core kit (Perkin-Elmer). For each RNA sample tested, reverse transcription was done in two tubes, one with reverse transcriptase (RT) and one without. 1.2 μg of heat denatured total RNA was used per PCR reaction, which had previously been treated with DNase I to remove genomic contaminants (according to Life Technologies, Inc. RACE kits), followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation and 70% ethanol wash. Reactions with RT was split into two tubes with one aliquot used to amplify actin mRNA and the other hD6. Lack of hD6 product from the reaction without RT was used to confirm lack of DNA contamination. Genomic DNA from human lymphocytes (T. Jamieson, Beatson Institute) was used as a positive control for hD6 amplification. Specific PCR primers used were: hD6sense 5′-CGT TCA TGC TCA GCC CTA C-3′ with hD6antisense 5′-CTG GAG TGC GTA GTC TAG ATG C-3′ (expected size, 447 base pairs); and actin-sense 5′-TCC ATC ATG AAG TGT GAC GT-3′ with actin-antisense 5′-TAC TCC TGC TTG CTG ATC CAC-3′ (expected size, 246 base pairs). PCR proceeded for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min. All receptor binding studies were carried out as ligand displacement analyses essentially as described previously (30Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.W. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol.

Cloning of human genes related to murine D6 has taken advantage of the inclusion of the coding region for chemokine receptors within a single genomic exon. PCR primers designed as outlined under “Materials and Methods” from murine D6 were used to generate fragments of a novel human receptor-like gene from genomic DNA. These fragments were subsequently used to design oligonucleotide primers for use in RACE PCR reactions to isolate the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the cDNA using human U937 monocytic RNA as a template, known to be positive for hD6 expression.Pfu polymerase was used to generate a full-length receptor cDNA of 1181 base pairs encompassing an open reading frame of 1152 base pairs (GenBankTM accession number: Y12815). The cDNA encodes a protein of 384 amino acids in length (Fig.1), displaying the characteristic seven transmembrane-spanning domains (dashed lines) and four conserved cysteine residues (underlined C) involved in maintaining receptor structure. hD6 bears a single putative N-linked glycosylation site at the amino terminus (NSS,underlined) and a number of potential phosphorylation sites at the carboxyl terminus, which is rich in serine and threonine residues. The hD6 cDNA displays 71% identity and 86% similarity to the murine D6 receptor, and in common with this protein, it has an alteration in the highly conserved DRYLAIVHA motif seen in other chemokine receptors changing it to DKYLEIVHA in human and murine D6, introducing an additional charged residue into the site (Fig. 1,bold, italicized, and underlined). These particular changes are not observed in any other G-protein-coupled receptors although there is a certain amount of variance in this motif in nonchemokine receptors. Whereas the extent of homology between human and murine D6 (71% identity) is marginally lower than that observed for the murine and human orthologues of other chemokine receptors (generally around 80%), comparison of Southern blots probed with hD6 with the same blots probed at low stringency with murine D6 suggests that the murine D6 gene hybridizes most strongly to this human gene rather than to other receptors in the human genome, implying that these genes are the closest sequence homologues between these two species (data not shown). hD6 has ∼40% identity and ∼50% similarity to the eight other known human β-chemokine receptors, which is a consistently lower homology than these receptors show to one another, implying that hD6 is a more divergent member of this family. However, the amino terminus of hD6, a region believed to be important in ligand binding, contains a number of tyrosines and acidic residues that are also seen in the other β-chemokine receptors. One potentially important sequence difference between D6 and the other receptors is the alteration of a highly conserved aspartic acid residue in the second transmembrane domain to an asparagine (Fig.1, labeled #). This aspartic acid is seen in almost all heptahelical receptors with a few signaling competent virally encoded proteins and DARC being the notable exceptions. When this residue is mutated in hCCR5 or other heptahelical receptors certain intracellular effects, such as Ca2+ flux, are no longer initiated, although ligand binding is usually unaffected (37Farzan M. Choe H. Martin K.A. Sun Y. Sidelko M. Mackay C.R. Gerard N.P. Sodroski J. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6854-6857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This is likely to significantly alter the signaling properties of hD6 (see below). Finally, it is of note that the 3′ sequences of hD6 are identical to an expressed sequence tag derived from a human placental cDNA library, and thus hD6 represents the full-length cDNA corresponding to this expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession number R82383). Tissue blots containing representative mRNA samples from various human tissues were probed with full-length hD6. Two transcripts were detected of around 4 and 6 kilobases, and as shown in Fig.2 A, expression of the receptor was seen to be very high in the placenta, lower in the liver, with weak but detectable expression seen in the lung and thyroid. On prolonged exposure of these blots, weak expression is also detectable in a range of other tissue types, particularly small intestine and the mucosal lining of the colon. However, it should be mentioned that the contribution of resident leukocytes to this weak expression cannot be discounted, although we have been unable to detect significant expression of hD6 in peripheral blood leukocytes using Northern blotting (see Fig. 2 A and below for a discussion of this point). In contrast to the murine D6 receptor (30Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.W. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), hD6 does not appear to be expressed in the spleen; however, it is possible that this could be a reflection of the relatively different cellular composition of the murine and human spleens. Surprisingly, it has proved difficult to detect expression of hD6 in hemopoietic cells using Northern blot analysis of samples from peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow (see Fig. 2 A), and the cell lines HL-60, Raji, K562, and THP-1 (data not shown). However, PCR has demonstrated hD6 expression in RNA prepared from leukocytes derived from umbilical cord blood and in the primitive erythromyeloid leukemic cells lines, K562, and THP-1 monocytic cells. Raji and HL-60 cells remain negative in this more sensitive assay (Fig.2 B). The expression of hD6 in K562 cells correlates well with the documented expression of the murine counterpart of hD6 in primitive bone marrow cells (30Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.W. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The general weak hemopoietic expression of this gene suggests that the solid organ expression of hD6 may be due to nonhemopoietic cells or to the activation status and type of resident leukocytes. In situ hybridization studies should distinguish between these two possibilities. Ligand displacement analysis was performed on CHO cells stably expressing hD6, and the data from these studies are outlined in Fig. 3,A and B and summarized in TableI. The data indicate that hD6 is a highly promiscuous β-chemokine receptor that displays relatively high affinity binding for the majority of members of the β-chemokine family. The highest affinity ligands for hD6 appear to include murine MIP-1α and MIP-1β and murine JE and human MCP2. Human MCP1 has approximately a 30-fold lower affinity for hD6 than the presumed murine homologue (JE), a similar difference in affinity to that seen with the mouse D6 receptor, which again binds human MCP1 with 30-fold lower affinity than murine JE (30Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.W. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that murine MCP5 is the closer murine homologue of MCP1 than JE (39Sarafi M.N. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. MacLean J.A. Charo I.F. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and indeed this is borne out by our binding analysis that shows murine MCP5 and human MCP1 to have very similar dissociation constants for hD6. Binding to hD6 is also seen with the human chemokines RANTES, MCP3, MCP4, and HCC1, and binding of both murine and human eotaxin is detectable, although this is a relatively lower affinity interaction than that seen with many of the other β-chemokines, and the physiological relevance of this interaction remains to be determined. No binding of the β-chemokine C10 is detectable, and in addition, I309 appears not to be a ligand for hD6. The specificity of hD6 for the β-chemokines is confirmed by the inability of various α-chemokines (IL8, Groγ, IP10, and MIP2) and lymphotactin to displace125I-labeled mMIP-1α from the receptor. It is noteworthy that in our hands K562 cells display a receptor that exhibits similar properties with respect to affinity and specificity as does hD6 (not shown).Table IDissociation constants for human and murine β-chemokines on hD6HumanMurineMIP-1α64 nm920 pmMIP-1β1.7 nm755 pmRANTES3.6 nmND1-aND, not determined.MCP116.5 nm613 nmMCP2768 pmNDMCP31.2 nmNDMCP45.97 nmNDMCP5ND6.3 nmEotaxin46 nm30 nmHCC127.2 nmND1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Human and murine D6 exhibit many similarities with respect to ligand binding, and it appears from our recent studies using β-chemokines tested here that were not commercially available at the time of publication of the murine receptor (e.g. MCP4 and 5) that murine D6 displays a similar ligand promiscuity to that seen with hD6 (data not shown). Nevertheless, a number of discrepancies do exist between D6 receptors from these two species. For instance, human MCP2 is a high affinity ligand for hD6 but does not bind to murine D6 (30Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.W. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that the murine homologue of MCP2 may exhibit an affinity for murine D6. Also, surprisingly, human MIP-1α has markedly reduced affinity for hD6 compared with murine MIP-1α for mD6; hMIP-1α may not be able to bind to hD6 at physiological concentrations. However, recent results from our laboratory strongly suggest that the human and murine MIP-1α molecules used in this study cannot be considered to be functionally homologous. 2Robert J. B. Nibbs, Shaeron M. Wylie, Jinying Yang, Nathaniel R. Landau, and Gerard J. Graham, manuscript in preparation. Thus, we suggest that despite these anomalies it is highly likely that human and murine D6 are functionally analogous. The basis for the remarkable promiscuity of hD6 is not immediately obvious. It is likely that this is a reflection of the usage of elements common to the majority of β-chemokines in binding such as the clusters of highly conserved residues between cysteines 3 and 4. This assertion is further substantiated by the observations that alterations to the cluster of basic residues in this area substantially affect binding. Thus, weakly binding chemokines such as eotaxin and MCP1 have nonconservative alterations in this area. In addition, the nonproteoglycan binding variant of murine MIP-1α, which we have previously generated by neutralization of two of the basic residues in this cluster (32Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang M.L.-S. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), shows a 30-fold reduction in affinity for hD6 compared with the wild-type mMIP-1α protein (data not shown). It is important to highlight however that while this region may well be of importance in hD6 binding, it is not a singular requirement as this site is conserved in human MIP-1α, which shows only limited binding to hD6. Therefore it is likely that other regions of the ligands are also important in hD6 binding. The relatively unique nature of the amino terminus of murine and human D6 suggests that this region may be involved to some extent in defining the ligand promiscuity of this receptor. We are in the process of generating receptor chimeras to test this hypothesis. We have been interested in determining the signaling competence of hD6 in response to the various binding β-chemokines, however we have been unable to elicit any detectable calcium flux in hD6 expressing HEK293, human osteosarcoma (see below), or CHO cells. This is in contrast to the murine D6 receptor and to human CCR1 and CCR5, which in our hands do signal in response to ligand binding in 293 cells, and may be indicative of alternative G-protein coupling by the hD6. The divergent nature of the hD6 carboxyl terminus, the altered DRYLAIVHA motif, and the absence of the aspartic acid residue in the second transmembrane domain in hD6 (described above) may conspire with other sequence peculiarities of hD6 to explain this phenomenon, This matter is currently under investigation in our laboratory. It is unclear at present what likely roles a promiscuous β-chemokine receptor may play in either normal or pathological situations. If this receptor is involved in chemokine-mediated chemoattraction then, assuming a relationship between binding and signaling, it appears to be fairly indiscriminate in the ligands to which it will respond. The expression of the murine receptor on a range of cell types including primitive hemopoietic cells, and the expression of the human homologue on the primitive K562 cells and on U937 cells, suggest that it may be a general chemoattractant receptor perhaps involved in the general migration of cells around the body rather than in the direct recruitment to inflammatory sites. However, the high expression in solid organs such as the liver may indicate that hD6 acts as a chemokine receptor for nonhemopoietic cells. Evidence for these roles awaits the generation of hD6-/- mice, which we are in the process of making. The recent characterization of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 as major co-receptors with CD4 for entry of macrophage-tropic or T cell-tropic strains of HIV-1, respectively, into host cells (see the Introduction), has prompted us to examine the ability of hD6 to act in this manner. To this end we have generated a stably transfected cell line Hos.CD4.hD6 that co-expresses the CD4 and hD6 molecules on the cell surface. Expression of functional hD6 on these cells has been confirmed by Scatchard analysis, which calculated that these cells express ∼3 × 106 receptors/cell (data not shown). Neither macrophage-tropic (JRFL) nor T cell-tropic (HXB2) HIV-1 isolates, or the SIV-1A11 SIV strain, were able to infect human osteosarcoma cells expressing either CD4 alone, or CD4 and hD6, whereas virus pseudotyped with amphotropic leukemia virus (A-MLV) env showed a high level of infectivity in both cell lines (data not shown). As expected, human osteosarcoma cells co-expressing CD4 and hCCR5 showed capacity for entry of the macrophage-tropic variant of HIV-1 and in addition displayed co-factor activity toward SIV-1A11. This data suggests that using the strains described, hD6 is unable to act as a co-factor with CD4 for entry of common laboratory strains of M- or T-tropic isolates of HIV-1 or SIV into human cells. However, it remains possible that other less common strains of HIV or SIV could use hD6 as an entry co-receptor, and we are currently investigating this possibility.

Inactivation of one allele of the PBR gene resulted in the suppression of PBR mRNA and ligand binding expression. Immunoblot and electron microscopic immunogold labeling analyses confirmed the absence of the 18-kDa PBR protein in the selected clone. Although mitochondria from the PBR-negative cells contained high levels of the constitutively expressed 30-kDa steroidogenic activity regulator protein, these cells produced minimal amounts of steroids compared with normal cells (5%). Moreover, mitochondria from PBR-negative cells failed to produce pregnenolone when supplied with exogenous cholesterol. Addition of the hydrosoluble cholesterol derivative, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, increased steroid production by the PBR-negative R2C cells, indicating that the cholesterol transport mechanism was impaired. Stable transfection of the PBR-negative R2C Leydig cells with a vector containing the PBR cDNA resulted in the recovery of the steroidogenic function of the cells.

The primary point of control in the acute stimulation of steroidogenesis, that occurs within minutes, by hormones is at the level of cholesterol transport, from intracellular sources to the inner mitochondrial membrane and the subsequent loading of cholesterol in the P-450scc active site (1Hall P.F.

During the last decade, however, two cholesterol transport mechanisms have been identified and characterized as mediators of the acute stimulation of steroidogenesis by hormones, the PBR (5Papadopoulos V. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 222-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and StAR (6Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr.

Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 222-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). PBR are extremely abundant in steroidogenic cells (5Papadopoulos V. Endocr.

Chem. 1986; 261: 576-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PBR is a multimeric complex composed of the 18-kDa isoquinoline-binding protein and the 34-kDa pore-forming voltage-dependent anion channel protein, preferentially located on the outer/inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites (8McEnery M.W.

Likewise, in vivo studies showed that high affinity PBR ligands increase steroid plasma levels in hypophysectomized rats (16Cavallaro S. Korneyev A. Guidotti A. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies, however, demonstrated that StAR does not need to enter the mitochondria to stimulate steroidogenesis, suggesting that it functions by activating a mitochondrial receptor or transport mechanisms(s) (33Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1968; 82: 614-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), maintain their in vitro capacity to synthesize steroids constitutively in a hormone-independent manner (34Shin S.

Thus, one can expect that constitutive steroidogenesis is driven by the unregulated expression of the hormonal mechanism controlling steroid synthesis or by an unknown separate mechanism. In 1994, we demonstrated that diazepam-binding inhibitor maintains constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C Leydig cells by binding to a mitochondrial higher affinity PBR which promotes continuous supply of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial P-450scc (36Garnier M. Boujrad N. Ogwuegbu S.O. Hudson Jr., J.R. Papadopoulos V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This higher affinity site was induced by the addition of constitutive cytosolic proteins on the mitochondrial PBR (36Garnier M. Boujrad N. Ogwuegbu S.O. Hudson Jr., J.R. Papadopoulos V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Stocco and Chen (37Stocco D.M. Chen W. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1918-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) provided evidence that StAR was constitutively expressed in R2C cells. Thus, these cells provide the ideal system to examine the potential sequence of events mediating the mitochondrial cholesterol transport.In this report, we describe the use of gene targeting in the R2C steroidogenic cells to introduce a null mutation into one allele of the PBR gene. Characterization of the wild type and the mutant cell lines, as well as the mutant cells transfected with the PBR cDNA, reveals that PBR is indispensable for cholesterol transport into mitochondria and steroid synthesis.ConclusionWe have used the constitutive steroid-producing R2C Leydig cell to construct a PBR-null steroidogenic cell line using a method of gene inactivation based on targeted homologous recombination using selectable marker genes. In this PBR mutant cell line, steroidogenesis ceased due to the arrest of cholesterol transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial P-450scc. However, introduction of PBR in the PBR-negative R2C cells rescued steroidogenesis. These results are in agreement with our recent in vivo studies where a drug-induced decrease in adrenal PBR expression resulted in reduced circulating glucocorticoid levels in rats (17Amri H. Ogwuegbu S.O. Boujrad N. Drieu K. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and targeted mutagenesis of PBR showed its lethal effect on mouse embryo survival (18Papadopoulos V. Amri H. Boujrad N.

Thus, these data provide unequivocal evidence on the determining role of PBR in cholesterol transport and steroid synthesis.Because PBR is a mitochondrial protein (5Papadopoulos V. Endocr.

Ogwuegbu S.O. Boujrad N. Drieu K. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and StAR does not need to enter the mitochondria to stimulate pregnenolone formation (33Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the observations that (i) a cytosolic protein is required for the appearance of a higher affinity PBR coupled to constitutive (36Garnier M. Boujrad N. Ogwuegbu S.O. Hudson Jr., J.R.

Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), suggest that the coordinated interaction of PBR and StAR may be the key to the induction and maintenance of steroid synthesis. Gonads, adrenal, placenta, and brain are the tissues in the body that have the ability to synthesize steroid hormones. Steroid synthesis begins with the conversion of the precursor cholesterol to pregnenolone by the cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 enzyme (P-450scc) 1The abbreviations used are: P-450scc, C27 cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450; PBR, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor; StAR, steroidogenic activity regulator protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Ro5-4864, 4′-chlorodiazepam; PK 11195, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: P-450scc, C27 cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450; PBR, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor; StAR, steroidogenic activity regulator protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Ro5-4864, 4′-chlorodiazepam; PK 11195, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). and auxiliary electron transferring proteins, localized on inner mitochondrial membranes (1Hall P.F.

Artemenko I. Yamazaki T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The primary point of control in the acute stimulation of steroidogenesis, that occurs within minutes, by hormones is at the level of cholesterol transport, from intracellular sources to the inner mitochondrial membrane and the subsequent loading of cholesterol in the P-450scc active site (1Hall P.F. Knobil E. Neil J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 975-998Google Scholar, 2Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Can. J. Biochem.

Artemenko I. Yamazaki T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This hormone-dependent transport mechanism was shown to be mediated by cAMP and to be localized in the mitochondrion (1Hall P.F. Knobil E. Neil J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 975-998Google Scholar, 2Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 61: 692-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Kimura T. J.

Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although a number of molecules have been proposed as potential candidates mediating this cholesterol transfer (3Kimura T. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Jefcoate C.R. McNamara B.C. Artemenko I. Yamazaki T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), no clear evidence has been presented on the identity of this mechanism. During the last decade, however, two cholesterol transport mechanisms have been identified and characterized as mediators of the acute stimulation of steroidogenesis by hormones, the PBR (5Papadopoulos V. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 222-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and StAR (6Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) proteins. PBR is an 18-kDa protein discovered as a class of binding sites for benzodiazepines distinct from the GABAA neurotransmitter receptor (5Papadopoulos V. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 222-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). PBR are extremely abundant in steroidogenic cells (5Papadopoulos V. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 222-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and found primarily on outer mitochondrial membranes (7Anholt R.R.H. Pedersen P.L. De Souza E.B. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 576-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PBR is a multimeric complex composed of the 18-kDa isoquinoline-binding protein and the 34-kDa pore-forming voltage-dependent anion channel protein, preferentially located on the outer/inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites (8McEnery M.W.

Likewise, in vivo studies showed that high affinity PBR ligands increase steroid plasma levels in hypophysectomized rats (16Cavallaro S. Korneyev A. Guidotti A. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10598-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, drug-induced decrease in adrenal PBR expression resulted in reduced circulating glucocorticoid levels in rats (17Amri H. Ogwuegbu S.O. Boujrad N. Drieu K. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Further in vitro studies on isolated mitochondria provided evidence that PBR ligands, drug ligands, or the endogenous PBR ligand, the polypeptide diazepam-binding inhibitor (5Papadopoulos V. Endocr.

We also showed that hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis involves, at least in part, the participation of PBR (23Papadopoulos V. Nowzari F.B. Krueger K.E. J. Biol.

Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), suggest that the coordinated interaction of PBR and StAR may be the key to the induction and maintenance of steroid synthesis. We have used the constitutive steroid-producing R2C Leydig cell to construct a PBR-null steroidogenic cell line using a method of gene inactivation based on targeted homologous recombination using selectable marker genes. In this PBR mutant cell line, steroidogenesis ceased due to the arrest of cholesterol transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial P-450scc. However, introduction of PBR in the PBR-negative R2C cells rescued steroidogenesis. These results are in agreement with our recent in vivo studies where a drug-induced decrease in adrenal PBR expression resulted in reduced circulating glucocorticoid levels in rats (17Amri H. Ogwuegbu S.O. Boujrad N. Drieu K. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and targeted mutagenesis of PBR showed its lethal effect on mouse embryo survival (18Papadopoulos V. Amri H. Boujrad N. Cascio C. Culty M. Garnier M. Hardwick M. Li H. Vidic B. Brown A.S. Reversat J.L. Bernassau J.M. Drieu K. Steroids. 1997; 62: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, these data provide unequivocal evidence on the determining role of PBR in cholesterol transport and steroid synthesis."

The actions are believed to be mediated through distinct G protein-coupled receptors. To date, two galanin receptor subtypes have been cloned. In this report, we describe the cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding a novel galanin receptor (GalR3). The receptor has 370 amino acids and shares 36 and 54% homology with the rat GalR1 and GalR2 receptors.125I-Porcine galanin binds the rat GalR3 receptor expressed in COS-7 cells with high affinity (K d = 0.6 nm) and could be displaced by galanin and galanin fragments and galanin-chimeric peptides. The pharmacological profile of this novel receptor is distinct from those of GalR1 and GalR2, revealing different pharmacophores within galanin for the three galanin receptor subtypes. Northern blot analysis showed expression in heart, spleen, and testis. Unlike GalR1 and GalR2, no expression of GalR3 was detectable in the brain, suggesting that GalR3 may mediate some of the peripheral functions of galanin.

Unlike GalR1 and GalR2, no expression of GalR3 was detectable in the brain, suggesting that GalR3 may mediate some of the peripheral functions of galanin. Galanin is a 29–30 amino acid neuropeptide with no significant homology to any known family of biologically active peptides (1Tatemoto K. Rokaeus A. Jornwall H. McDonald T.J. Mutt V. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Galanin is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is highly expressed in various regions of the brain. Many physiological processes are modulated by galanin, including neurotransmitter and hormone release (2Dunning B.E. Ahren B. Veith R.C. Bottcher G. Sundler F. Taborsky Jr., G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: E127-E133PubMed Google Scholar), spinal reflexes, nociception (3Verge V.M.K. Xu X.-J. Langel U. Hokfelt T. Wiesenfeld Z. Bartfai T. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 149: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), firing of noradrenergic neurons, and contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle (4Ekblad E. hakanson R. Sundler F. Wahlestedt C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 86: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Crawley J.N. Regul. Pept. 1995; 59: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Like neuropeptide Y, centrally administered galanin potently stimulates food intake in animals (6Crawley J.N. Austin M.C. Fiski S.M. Martin B. Consolo S. Berthold M. Langel U. Fisone G. Bartfai T. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3695-3700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for galanin in control of body weight.A large body of evidence suggests that galanin mediates the various physiological functions through interaction with distinct receptor subtypes. Pharmacological studies with several peptidic agonists and antagonists of galanin receptor suggest the existence of multiple receptor subtypes (7Rossowski W.J. Rossowski T.M. Zacharia S. Ertan A. Coy H.H. Peptides. 1990; 11: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Fisone G. Berthold M. Bedecs K. Unden A. Bartfai T. Bertorelli R. Consolo S. Crawley J. Martin B. Nilsson S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, a second galanin receptor subtype (GalR2) was cloned. GalR2 is markedly dissimilar to the GalR1 receptor, sharing only 40% sequence homology (14Howard A.D. Tan C. Shiao L.-L. Palyha O.C. McKee K.K. Weiger D.H. Feighner S.D. Cascieri M.A. Smith R.G.

Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis suggests that both GalR1 and GalR2 receptors have seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains, typical of members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (16Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The GalR2 receptor is distinguished pharmacologically from the GalR1 receptor by its high affinity for ligand galanin-(2–29). In addition to the pharmacological differences, the GalR2 transcript is widely distributed in both central and peripheral tissues (14Howard A.D. Tan C. Shiao L.-L. Palyha O.C. McKee K.K. Weiger D.H. Feighner S.D. Cascieri M.A. Smith R.G. Van Der Ploeg L.H.T. Sullivan K.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the expression of GalR1 is more restricted to brain and spinal cord (12Parker E.M. Izzarelli D.G. Nowak H.P. Mahle C.D. Iben L.G. Wang J. Goldstein M.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13Wang S. He C. Maguire M. Clemmons A. Burrier R. Guzzi M. Strader C. Parker E. Bayne M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Given that a large number of physiological actions are modulated by galanin, it is unlikely that the two cloned galanin receptors mediate all the functions of galanin. A complete understanding of the roles of galanin requires identification and characterization of all the galanin receptor subtypes. In this report, we describe the cloning of a novel rat galanin receptor subtype by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GalR, galanin receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; DAGO, [d-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin; GMAP, galanin message-associated peptide; kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GalR, galanin receptor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; DAGO, [d-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin; GMAP, galanin message-associated peptide; kb, kilobase pair(s). sib selection and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The receptor shares highest homology with GalR1 and GalR2 and is capable of binding galanin and galanin analogs. We thus designate this new receptor as the GalR3 galanin receptor.MATERIALS AND METHODS125I-Porcine galanin (2200 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP (5000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. LipofectAMINE transfection agent and oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased or custom-synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. and the sequences of the primers are: oligo93C, gctggcagtgctcctgcagcctggc; oligo120B, aagcggccgtaccagaagcacaggatg; oligo164, ccaagtgcctggcaggagccaagcag; oligo167, gcgggttaaggcangagttggcgtaggc; oligo172, tgcgggccccagcagagcgcgtagag, oligo177, catccagtgtgtagatggctgcct; oligo184, cgcgtagagcgcggccactgccagcatg; and oligo185, caagggctgaatcaanaagctccagc. Rat multiple tissue Northern blots were obtained from CLONTECH. Rat galanin, rat galanin-(1–16), M40, C7, preprogalanin-(1–30), and galantide (M15) were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Rat galanin-(2–29), rat galanin-(1–19), rat galanin-(10–29), and rat galanin-(3–29) were custom-synthesized by Bio-synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Galanin-(1–13)-bradykinin-(2–9) (M35), DAGO, somatostatin, and galanin messenger-associated peptides GMAP-(1–41) and GMAP-(44–59) were from Sigma. [Ala6,d-Trp8]galanin-(1–15)-ol and [d-trp6,d-trp8,9]galanin-(1–15)-ol were custom-synthesized by AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, CA).PCR Sib SelectionPCR with galanin receptor-specific primers was used to screen pools of a rat hypothalamus cDNA library. Positive pools so identified were subdivided and screened further by the PCR screening until the final round of screening, at which time individual colonies were selected by analysis of plasmid mini-preps. The rat cDNA library was constructed as described previously (15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).PCR and RACE Amplification of cDNA FragmentUnless otherwise specified, PCR was performed using KlenTaq polymerase, which possesses proof reading activity (CLONTECH) and a cycling profile of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min (40 cycles). Approximately 1 μl of overnight Escherichia coli culture was used in the PCR for sib selection. For RACE, nested primers specific to rat GalR3 cDNA and nested adaptor primers were used in the primary and secondary PCRs. A thermal cycling profile of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s (25 cycles) and rat brain cDNA as a template were used in primary PCR. A cycling profile of 94 °C for 1 min and 70 °C for 4 min (30 cycles) and 5 μl of the primary PCR product (diluted 1:50) as a template were used in the secondary PCR. The RACE product was cloned into vector pCR 2.1. A GC melt reagent (CLONTECH) at 10–20% (v/v) of original stock (5 m) was always used in both PCR and RACE reactions.DNA Sequencing and AnalysisThe DNA sequences of clones were determined on both strands using Applied Biosystems Prism dye termination DNA sequencing reagents and an Applied Biosystems 373 automated sequencing apparatus (Perkin-Elmer). DNA and protein sequence comparisons were performed with the DNA* software (DNAstar Inc., Madison, WI).Transfection of COS-7 CellsRat GalR3 cDNA was introduced into COS-7 cells by electroporation as described previously (15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or by the use of LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two methods gave comparable levels of expression.Receptor Membrane PreparationThree days following the transfection of the COS-7 cells, receptor membrane was prepared as previously described (15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).125I-Galanin Binding AssayBinding of125I-porcine galanin to the membrane preparations was performed as previously described (15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) except that 20 μg of membrane protein was used in the saturation and competition binding assays. All data were analyzed by nonlinear regression (Prism, GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and the K i calculated according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (17Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12185) Google Scholar).Northern Blot Analysis of Rat GalR3A rat multitissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized for 15 h at 55 °C in an ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) using 32P-labeled rat GalR3 cDNA as a probe (labeled with a random priming kit, Life Technologies, Inc., specific activity = 3 × 109 cpm/μg). After hybridization, the blot was washed with wash solution I (2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 30 min at room temperature then with wash solution II (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at room temperature, 1 h at 48 °C, 1 h at 52 °C, and 30 min at 54 °C. The blot was then wrapped with Saran Wrap and exposed to Kodak BioMax films at −80 °C for 1 week. The same blot was stripped and hybridized in a similar manner with a 32P-labeled actin cDNA to ensure loading of poly(A)+ mRNA from the tissues onto the blot.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBLAST search (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) of the GenBank™ data base with the human GalR1 receptor amino acid sequence (10Habert-Ortoli E. Amiranoff B. Loquet I. Laburthe M. Mayaux J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9780-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) as query identified a portion of a human genomic clone (accession number Z82241) that possessed high homology with the amino acids 37–132 of human GalR1 (third reading frame of the positive strand, 55% identity). The homology was greater than that between rGalR1 and rGalR2 (40%), suggesting that this human clone may contain a portion of a new galanin receptor.Several pairs of PCR primers were generated according to the human genomic sequence and used in PCR with cDNA reverse-translated from rat liver RNA as a template to obtain rat GalR3 cDNA (Fig.1 A). A PCR cycling paradigm employing low annealing temperature with two PCR primers, oligonucleotide 93C and oligonucleotide 120B, produced a PCR product. The approximately 700-base pair fragment was cloned into vector pcR3.1 and sequenced. Comparison of the DNA sequence with the nucleotide sequences in GenBank™ revealed 86, 65, and 63% identities with the human genomic clone (Z82241), rat GalR2, and human GalR1, respectively. Therefore, the rat clone appeared to be a portion of a novel rat galanin receptor (Fig. 1 A).RACE and PCR sib selection were performed to extend the cDNA sequence toward the 5′ and 3′ directions. In RACE, primers oligo172 and AP1 (outer adaptor primer) were used in the primary PCR with a rat brain cDNA library as a template and primers oligo177 and AP2 (inner adaptor primer) were used in the secondary PCR with product of the primary PCR as a template. The final RACE product, ∼1.8-kb, overlapped with the 5′ portion of the rat 0.7-kb GalR3 cDNA and the upstream 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 1 A). For PCR sib selection, two primers, oligo164 and oligo167, were used to screen a cDNA library constructed from rat hypothalamus (15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pool A28 gave a positive band and was subdivided and screened until a single clone (clone A28-1, 1.3 kb) was obtained (Fig. 1 A).A full-length clone of GalR3 cDNA was obtained by performing further sib selection on the hypothalamus cDNA library using primer oligo185, designed based on the sequence of the 5′-RACE product, and primer oligo184, designed based on the sequence of clone A28-1. A single clone A5-3, selected from library pool A5, was obtained and sequenced. The clone was 2.2 kb long and contained all the sequence of clone A28-1 and a portion of the 5′-RACE product (Fig. 1 A). A complete open reading frame was identified corresponding to a protein of 370 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40.3 kDa (Fig.1 B). The clone was termed GalR3 receptor. Hydrophathy analysis revealed seven putative transmembrane-spanning domains (TMs) typical of G protein-coupled receptors. The GalR3 receptor also contains a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in the N-terminal region, two Cys residues in the first and second extracellular loops that form a putative disulfide bond in these receptors, and two Cys residues in the C-terminal region that may be involved in palmitoylation (Fig. 1 C).The amino acid sequence of the rat GalR3 receptor is significantly different from those of rat GalR1 and GalR2. The overall homology is 36% to rat GalR1 and 54% to rat GalR2 as analyzed by the Jutun Hein method (19Hein J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 626-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). A search of the SwissProt data bank revealed that rat GalR3 has high homology to the rat somatostatin type 4 receptor (31%) (20Bruno J.F. Xu Y. Song J. Berelowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11151-11155Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and the rat μ-type opioid receptor (27%) (21Fukuda K. Kato S. Mori K. Nishi M. Takeshima H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of rGalR3 with rGalR1 shows the greatest similarity in TM2, TM7, and TM1, being 62, 46, and 46% identical, respectively. Alignment with rGalR2 displayed a generally higher homology in the TMs than rGalR1, with the highest in TM2, TM3, and TM4, being 92, 83, and 71% identical, respectively. The N terminus and the C terminus possess least homology with both rGalR1 and rGalR2 receptors (Fig. 1 C).Northern blot analysis was performed to examine the tissue distribution of GalR3 mRNA. A single band of ∼3.5 and ∼3 kb was detected in heart and testis, respectively (Fig. 2). There was a strong, broad band at higher molecular weight (5–8 kb) in spleen and testis, indicating a heterogeneous population of the transcript in these tissues. There was no significant expression in kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, brain, or lung. The low abundance of GalR3 in the brain is contrasted to the distribution of GalR1, which is significantly expressed only in brain and spinal cord (12Parker E.M. Izzarelli D.G. Nowak H.P. Mahle C.D.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and to that of GalR2, which is expressed in both central and peripheral tissues (14Howard A.D. Tan C. Shiao L.-L. Palyha O.C. McKee K.K. Weiger D.H. Feighner S.D. Cascieri M.A. Smith R.G. Van Der Ploeg L.H.T. Sullivan K.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given that the GalR3 cDNA was cloned from a hypothalamus library, it seems likely that there is a low level of expression of GalR3 in this part of the brain. The overall expression pattern of GalR3 suggests that the receptor may mediate galanin actions in the cardiovascular system (22Ulman L.G. Evans H.F. Iismaa T.P. Potter E.K. McCloskey D.I. Shine J.

Binding of 125I-porcine galanin to membranes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells demonstrated a low but reproducible level of specific binding, while binding of the radioligand to membranes from COS-7 cells transfected with vector alone was negligible. The specific binding was saturable at high affinity, showing a K d value for 125I-galanin of 0.55 ± 0.15 nmand a B max of 28.1 ± 1.1 fmol/mg of membrane protein (mean ± S.D. from three independent transfections). A representative binding curve is illustrated in Fig.3. No specific binding was observed when125I-labeled somatostatin was used in the binding assays.Figure 3Saturation analysis of125I-porcine galanin (125I-pGal) binding to membranes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells with pcDNA3-rGalR3 (clone A5-3). Data shown represent the specific binding (total binding minus nonspecific binding).

Galanin, C7, galanin-(1–19), M35, and galanin-(2–29) bound GalR3 with high affinity (within 9-fold K i of galanin), while M40, galanin-(1–16), and M15 bound rGalR3 with relatively lower affinities (33–60 times K i of galanin) (Table I). No binding was detected in the assays with galanin-(3–29), galanin-(10–29), preprogalanin-(1–30), GMAP-(1–41), GMAP-(44–59), and [d-Thr6,d-Trp8,9]galanin-(1–15)-ol (Table I). [Ala6,Trp8]Galanin-(1–15)-ol, an antagonist shown to inhibit the effect of galanin on forskolin-induced insulin release from RINm5F cells (26Kakuyama H. Mochizuki T. Iguchi K. Yamabe K. Hosoe H. Hoshino M. Yanaihara N. Biomed. Res. 1997; 1: 49-56Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), bound the GalR3 receptor with high affinity (Table I). When tested in the same competition binding assays, somatostatin, dynorphin (κ-opioid receptor-specific ligand) and DAGO (μ-opioid receptor-specific ligand) did not cause detectable displacement of the radioligand. The high affinity of galanin-(2–29) for GalR3 (Table I) revealed that, like GalR2, Gly1 of galanin is not critical for galanin to bind GalR3, whereas this residue is important for binding of galanin to GalR1 (15Wang S. Hashemi T. He C. Strader C. Bayne M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, galanin-(3–29) did not bind either GalR1, GalR2, or GalR3 (Table I), indicating a crucial role of Trp2 of galanin in binding of galanin to all three receptor subtypes.Table ILigand binding profile of the cloned rat GalR3 receptorLigandKi nmKi(ligand)/K i(galanin)Rat GalR3 receptor Rat galanin-(1–29)1.47 ± 0.42 (7)1 C7 (galanin-(1–13)-spantide I)0.75 ± 0.06 (2)0.51 Rat galanin-(1–19)6.25 ± 0.81 (2)4.25 M35 (galanin-(1–13)-bradykinin(2–9))7.50 ± 2.95 (4)5.10 Rat galanin-(2–29)12.6 ± 6.69 (3)8.57 [Ala6,d-Trp8]Galanin-(1–15)-ol17.9 ± 8.6 (4)12.0 Rat galanin-(1–16)49.6 ± 15.3 (3)33.7 M4054 ± 23.7 (2)36.7 M15 (galantide or gal-(1–13)-SP-(5–11))85 ± 52 (4)57.8 Rat galanin-(3–29)>1000 (3)>650 Rat galanin-(10–29)>1000 (2)>650 Preprogalanin-(1–30)>1000 (2)>650 [d-Thr6,d-Trp8,9]Galanin-(1–15)-ol>1000 (2)>650 GMAP-(1–41)>1000 (2)>650 GMAP-(44–59)>1000 (3)>650Rat GalR2 receptor Rat galanin-(1–29)1.48 ± 0.59 (5)1 M151.11 ± 0.16 (4)0.75 Rat galanin-(2–29)1.92 ± 0.92 (4)1.30 M402.88 ± 1.48 (4)1.95 Rat galanin-(1–19)4.7 ± 2.0 (3)3.18 Rat galanin-(1–16)5.66 ± 3.7 (2)3.85 Rat galanin-(3–29)>1000 (4)>650 GMAP-(44–59)>1000 (2)>650Rat GalR1 receptor Rat galanin-(1–29)0.98 ± 0.22 (3)1 Rat galanin-(1–16)4.8 ± 1.5 (2)4.9 Rat galanin-(2–29)85 ± 12 (3)87 Rat galanin-(3–29)>1000 (2)>1020 Open table in a new tab Pharmacological characterization revealed some striking differences between the profile of GalR3 and those of GAlR1 and GalR2. Galanin-(1–16), and two galanin-related chimeric peptides, M40 and M15, displayed significantly lower affinities for GalR3 than GalR2 and GalR1 (Table I and see Refs. 12Parker E.M. Izzarelli D.G.

Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal 10 amino acids (galanin-(1–19)) resulted in a 4-fold decrease in affinity for GalR3 (Table I). However, further truncation to galanin-(1–16) resulted in a further 8-fold decrease in affinity (Table I), indicating the importance of residues 17–19 of galanin in binding to GalR3. Examination of residues 17–19 of the high-affinity ligands reveals that a potential hydrogen bond donor is conserved at position 18 in all high affinity peptides, i.e. Asn in galanin, galanin-(1–19), and galanin-(2–29), Gln in C7, and Ser in M35 (Fig.4 A). Substitution of this position with Ala in M40 or Gly in M15 or deletion of this residue in galanin-(1–16) to remove the potential for hydrogen bond formation, significantly decreased the affinity of the ligands for the GalR3 receptor (Fig. 4 A). Delineation of the site of interaction of this residue with the GalR3 receptor will require a detailed receptor mutagenesis analysis.Figure 4Ligand specificity of the galanin receptor subtypes.

The receptor shares homology (36–54%) to the previously cloned GalR1 and GalR2 receptors. The distribution of GalR3 mRNA expression is strikingly different from those of GalR1 and GalR2 and appears to be restricted to the peripheral tissues. The pharmacology of the GalR3 receptor is distinguished from the other two receptors by the requirement of amino acids 17–19 of galanin (Fig. 4). The three galanin receptor subtypes show different pharmacological profiles with respect to galanin analogs, suggesting that they bind to distinct pharmacophores within the galanin peptide (Fig.4 B). This observation suggests the potential for physiological control of galanin receptor subtype activation by selective ligand modification such as differential proteolysis (27Bedecs K. Langel U. Bartfai T. Neuropeptides. 1995; 29: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,28.Jureus, A., Lindgren, M., Langel, U., Bartfai, T., Seventh Annual Summer Neoropeptide Conference, Key West, FL, June 22–26, 1997, 1997, International Neuropeptide Society.Google Scholar). The characterization of this new galanin receptor should aid in delineating specific physiological roles of the galanin receptor subtypes. Galanin is a 29–30 amino acid neuropeptide with no significant homology to any known family of biologically active peptides (1Tatemoto K. Rokaeus A. Jornwall H. McDonald T.J. Mutt V. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Galanin is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is highly expressed in various regions of the brain. Many physiological processes are modulated by galanin, including neurotransmitter and hormone release (2Dunning B.E. Ahren B. Veith R.C. Bottcher G. Sundler F. Taborsky Jr., G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: E127-E133PubMed Google Scholar), spinal reflexes, nociception (3Verge V.M.K. Xu X.-J. Langel U. Hokfelt T. Wiesenfeld Z. Bartfai T. Neurosci.

The gravitational perturbation of Mathilde on the passing spacecraft was apparent in the spacecraft tracking data. As a result of the accurate targeting achieved, these data could be used to determine Mathilde's mass as 1.033 (± 0.044) × 10 20 grams. Coupled with a volume estimate provided by the NEAR imaging team, this mass suggests a low bulk density for Mathilde of 1.3 grams per cubic centimeter."

ESTs with sequences similar to that of β4Gal-T1 could be grouped into at least two non-identical sequence sets. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the novel ESTs with β4Gal-T1 revealed conservation of short sequence motifs as well as cysteine residues previously shown to be important for the function of β4Gal-T1. The likelihood that the identified ESTs represented novel galactosyltransferase genes was tested by cloning and sequencing of the full coding region of two distinct genes, followed by expression. Expression of soluble secreted constructs in the baculovirus system showed that these genes represented genuine UDP-galactose:β-N-acetylglucosamine β1,4-galactosyltransferases, thus designated β4Gal-T2 and β4Gal-T3. Genomic cloning of the genes revealed that they have identical genomic organizations compared with β4Gal-T1. The two novel genes were located on 1p32-33 and 1q23. The results demonstrate the existence of a family of homologous galactosyltransferases with related functions.

Inclusion of the “G” (bold underline below) results in a single translational initiation codon that shortens the reading frame by 25 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number Y12509 ). This change also affects the position of intron I (previously indicated to be placed in the coding region), which is now located at nucleotide position −53 in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene.

A third successful approach has taken advantage of conserved sequences in glycosyltransferases that share donor and/or acceptor substrates. Thus, searches for novel members of homologous glycosyltransferase gene families utilizing conserved sequence motifs for RT-PCR 1The abbreviations used are: RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tags; bp, base pair(s); Cer, ceramide. cloning with degenerate primers have resulted in the identification and cloning of a number of novel genes (18Livingston B.D.

One part of the human genome project is the establishment of a data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), which currently has over 700,000 unique sequences. ESTs represent short 5′- and 3′-sequences (200–500 bp) of cDNA clones from a large variety of human and animal organs (20Adams M.D. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Dubnick M. Polymeropoulos M.H. Xiao H.

The EST data base is now estimated to contain sequence information from more than half the human genes; it therefore provides a unique source for identifying novel members of homologous gene families (21Gerhold D. Caskey C.T. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The EST data base has recently been successfully utilized in searches for novel glycosyltransferase genes of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family, where several novel members of this homologous gene family have been isolated by identification of ESTs with sequence similarities (22Hagen F.K. Gregoire C.A. Tabak L.A. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,23Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A number of homologous families of glycosyltransferase genes exist. The largest family identified so far is the sialyltransferase family, for which at least 11 distinct members have been identified (24Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence motifs shared between sialyltransferases are part of the catalytic domain, suggesting that conservation of these sequences is related to functional requirements (25Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Additional homologous glycosyltransferase gene families include the α2- and α3/4-fucosyltransferase families (26Lowe J.B. Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1993; 6: 465-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the α3-GalNAc-transferase family (27Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the β6-GlcNAc-transferase family (28Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Kudo S. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the ceramide galactosyltransferase family (29Schulte S. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10265-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the polypeptide GalNAc-transferase family (23Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence similarities within these glycosyltransferase gene families reveals that conserved sequences are generally limited to short sequence stretches in the putative catalytic domains, which are located in the central or C-terminal portions of enzymes that are type II transmembrane proteins. An additional characteristic is that cysteine residues in these areas are conserved in spacing (23Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues are important for intramolecular disulfide bonding as well as for the catalytic activity of glycosyltransferases (31Wang Y. Wong S.S. Fukuda M.N. Zu H. Liu Z. Tang Q. Appert H.E.

Characterization of β4-Gal-transferase activities from different sources, however, indicated that distinct activities exist (36Sheares B.T. Carlson D.M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1990; 2: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence now reveals that several β4-galactosyltransferase genes may exist. Shaper et al.(38Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. Meurer J.A. Chou T.-D.D. Schnaar R.A. Shaper N.L. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 477Google Scholar) have identified two different chick cDNA sequences, which have 65 and 48% sequence similarity to human β4Gal-T1. Both chick cDNAs were shown to encode catalytically active β4-Gal-transferases. Thus, the β4Gal-T1 gene is likely to be part of a homologous gene family with recognizable sequence motifs, and this is supported by a large number of human ESTs with sequence similarities to β4Gal-T1 in EST data bases. 2R. Almeida and H. Clausen, unpublished observation. Two independent groups have analyzed β4-Gal-transferase activities in mice homozygously deficient in β4Gal-T1 (39Lu Q. Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 40Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both studies showed residual β4-Gal-transferase activity, providing clear evidence for the existence of additional β4-Gal-transferases. Uehara and Muramatsu (41Uehara K. Muramatsu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have identified and cloned a mouse cDNA that was shown to encode a protein with low β4-galactosyltransferase activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. This putative β4-galactosyltransferase exhibited little or no sequence similarity to β4Gal-T1, indicating that the gene is unlikely to represent an evolutionarily related member of a galactosyltransferase family. Since the gene was expressed in E. coli, it makes evaluation of the kinetic parameters uncertain as this expression system has been shown to be poor for glycosyltransferases (42Nakazawa K. Furukawa K. Narimatsu H. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we used available human EST sequence information to identify novel genes homologous to β4Gal-T1. The β4Gal-T1 gene was found to be highly represented in the EST data base by ESTs with nearly identical sequences, but in addition, a number of ESTs with similar sequences were identified, and these had shared motifs with conserved cysteine residues previously shown to be functionally important for β4Gal-T1. The full coding sequences of two of these genes were established, and expression demonstrated that these genes represented active UDP-Gal:β-GlcNAc β1,4-Gal-transferase genes. Data base searches were performed with the coding sequence of the human β4Gal-T1 sequence (43Masri K.A. Appert H.E. Fukuda M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using the BLASTn and tBLASTn algorithms against the dbEST data base at the NCBI. The BLASTn algorithm was used to identify ESTs representing the query gene (identities of ≥95%), whereas tBLASTn was used to identify non-identical, but similar EST sequences. ESTs with 50–90% nucleotide sequence identity were regarded as different from the query sequence. The results of tBLASTn searches were evaluated by visual inspection after elimination of ESTs regarded as identical to the query sequence (>95% nucleotide sequence identity). ESTs with several apparent short sequence motifs and cysteine residues arranged with similar spacing were selected for further sequence analysis. Initially, the identified ESTs (5′-sequence) were used in BLASTn searches of the dbEST data base to search for overlapping ESTs (95–100% identity in at least 30 bp) (see Fig. 1). If new ESTs were identified, the procedure was repeated, and sequences were merged. In addition, all identified ESTs were analyzed in the Unigene data base to confirm that they were from the same gene transcript and to select cDNA clones with the longest inserts as well as to identify additional ESTs with a non-overlapping 5′-sequence. Composites of all the sequence information for each set of ESTs were compiled and analyzed for sequence similarity to human β4Gal-T1. EST cDNA clones with the longest inserts (see Fig. 1) were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. Two partly overlapping ESTs were identified (see Fig.1). Sequencing of the inserts revealed an open reading frame that potentially encoded a sequence similar to that of β4Gal-T1, but the 5′-sequence was shorter and without an initiation codon. Further 5′-sequence was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using human fetal brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) in combination with the antisense primers EBER102 (5′-GAAACTGAGCCTTACTCAGGC) and EBER104 (5′-TCCACATCGCTGAAGATGAAGC) for 35 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 3 min using the Expand kit enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim). The products from the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were cloned into the BamHI/NotI site of pT7T3U19, and multiple clones were sequenced. The entire sequence was confirmed by sequencing genomic P1 clones. The composite sequence contained an open reading frame of 1191 bp potentially encoding a protein with a type II domain structure (see Fig. 2), with an overall sequence identity of ∼63% to β4Gal-T1. One EST clone (184081) with a 1980-bp insert was identified by its 3′-EST sequence in Unigene (National Center for Biotechnology Information) (see Fig. 1). Sequencing of the insert revealed an intact open reading frame of 1179 bp potentially encoding a protein with a type II domain structure (see Fig. 3), with an overall sequence identity of ∼54% to β4Gal-T1. An expression construct designed to encode amino acid residues 56–397 of β4Gal-T2 was prepared by RT-PCR with mRNA from the Colo205 cell line using the primer pair EBER100FOR (5′-TACTTTGACGTCTACGCCCAG) and EBER114 (5′-GAAAACAGAGCCCAGTCCAG) with BamHI restriction sites (see Fig. 2). An expression construct designed to encode amino acid residues 23–393 of β4Gal-T3 was prepared by RT-PCR with RNA from the MKN45 gastric carcinoma cell line using the primer pair EBER200FOR (5′-CATGATGTACCTGTCACTGGGG) and EBER214 (5′-TAGCACGGCACCAGAGTTCAG) with BamHI restriction sites (see Fig. 3). The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI site of pAcGP67 (Pharmingen), and the construct was sequenced to verify correct insertion and sequence. A full-length coding expression construct of β4Gal-T3 was prepared by RT-PCR with MKN45 RNA using the primer pair EBER200FUL (5′-CCAGGATGTTGCGGAGGCTGC) and EBER214 (see Fig. 3), and the product was cloned into the BamHI site of pVL1193 (Pharmingen). Plasmids pAcGP67-β4Gal-T2-sol, pAcGP67-β4Gal-T3-sol, and pVL-β4Gal-T3-full were cotransfected with BaculoGold™ DNA (Pharmingen) as described previously (19Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus was obtained after two successive amplifications in Sf9 cells grown in serum-containing medium, and titers of virus were estimated by titration in 24-well plates with monitoring of enzyme activities. Controls included pAcGP67-GalNAc-T3-sol (19Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Standard assays were performed in 50 μl of total reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 100 μm UDP-[14C]Gal (2300 cpm/nmol; Amersham Corp.), and varying concentrations of acceptor substrates (Sigma) (see Table I for structures). The soluble constructs were assayed with 5–20 μl of culture supernatant from infected cells, whereas the full-length construct was assayed with 1% Triton X-100 homogenates of washed cells. Bovine milk β1,4-Gal-transferase (Sigma) was used as control. Assays used for determination of K m of acceptor substrates were modified to include 200 μm UDP-[14C]Gal, and assays for donor substrate K m were performed with 2 mm(for β4Gal-T3 and bovine milk Gal-transferase) or 0.25 mm(for β4Gal-T2) benzyl-β-GlcNAc.Table ISubstrate specificity of β4-Gal-transferasesSubstrate concentrationβ4Gal-T21-aEnzyme sources were media of infected Sf9 cells.

Terminal glycosylation of Lc3Cer (see Table III for definitions of Svennerholm nomenclature) was performed in a reaction mixture consisting of 3 milliunits of β4Gal-T3 (specific activity determined with benzyl-β-GlcNAc), 250 μg of Lc3, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25% Triton CF-54, and 3.5 μmol of UDP-Gal in a final volume of 100 μl.

The crude reaction mixture was taken up in ∼3 ml of 0.1 m NaCl, sonicated thoroughly, applied to a 1-ml disposable octadecylsilica cartridge (Bakerbond, J. T. Baker Inc.), washed through with 4 ml each of 0.1 m NaCl and H2O, and then eluted with 4-ml portions of H2O containing increasing amounts of MeOH from 10 to 90%, followed by 100% MeOH. Following concentration of each fraction, an assessment by high performance TLC analysis showed that the glycosphingolipid product was eluted as a single band with 100% MeOH, whereas the detergent eluted at 80% MeOH. The purified product was deuterium-exchanged by dissolving in CDCl3/CD3OD (2:1), evaporating thoroughly under dry nitrogen (repeating twice), and then dissolving in 0.5 ml of Me2SO-d 6 and 2% D2O (48Dabrowski J.

Here we explore specificity in receptor-G protein coupling by taking advantage of the ability of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B (5-HT1B) receptor to discriminate between G protein heterotrimers containing Gαi1 or Gαt. Gi1 can interact with the 5-HT1B receptor and stabilize a high affinity agonist binding state of this receptor, but Gt cannot. A series of Gαt/Gαi1 chimeric proteins have been generated in Escherichia coli, and their functional integrity has been reported previously (Skiba, N. P., Bae, H., and Hamm, H. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 413–424). We have tested the functional coupling abilities of the Gαt/Gαi1 chimeras to 5-HT1Breceptors using high affinity agonist binding and receptor-stimulated guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding. In the presence of βγ subunits, amino acid residues 299–318 of Gαi1 increase agonist binding to the 5-HT1Breceptor and receptor stimulation of GTPγS binding. Moreover, Gαi1 containing only Gαt amino acid sequences from this region does not show any coupling ability to 5-HT1B receptors. Our studies suggest that the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop region of Gαs are an important region for specific recognition between receptors and Gi family members.

The heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) mediate signaling from a large number of diverse heptahelical cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular effectors. These pathways control numerous essential functions in all tissues and are ubiquitous throughout eukaryotes (1Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A large body of work investigating the mechanisms underlying receptor-G protein interactions now exists. The early view that signaling selectivity would manifest itself on the basis of specific protein interactions allowing a receptor to couple with a unique G protein to modulate a single effector is no longer tenable with the accumulating evidence of a network of interactions that converge and diverge at multiple levels. Even in the earliest receptor-G protein reconstitution studies using phospholipid vesicles, it was clear that, while there were large differences in the efficiencies of coupling among the major families of G proteins, receptors were capable of activating multiple G proteins from distinct families (4Asano T.

Synthetic peptides from the C terminus of αt (amino acids 340–350) have been shown to stabilize the active conformation of metarhodopsin II (17Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) while alanine scanning mutagenesis of the same region has identified four specific residues crucial for αtactivation by rhodopsin (12Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similarly, two C-terminal peptides from αs (354–372 and 384–394), but not the corresponding peptides from αi2, could evoke high affinity agonist binding to β-adrenergic receptors and block their ability to activate αs (16Rasenick M.M. Watanabe M. Lazarevic M.B. Hatta G. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of three to five C-terminal amino acids of αq with the corresponding residues from αi allowed receptors that normally signal exclusively through αi subunits to activate the chimeric α subunits and stimulate the Gq effector, phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) (13Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, a similar chimeric approach revealed that sequences in addition to the C terminus were required for specificity of activation of α16 subunits by the C5a receptor (18Lee C. Katz A. Simon M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 218-223PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have also implicated a role for N-terminal sequences in receptor-G protein coupling (17Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27618-27624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it appears that the molecular determinants of receptor-G protein coupling vary somewhat among specific families of receptors and G proteins. Studies presented below have revealed a previously unappreciated region involved in receptor-G protein coupling that mediates the discrimination between αi and αt subunits by 5-hydroxytryptamine1B(5-HT1B) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ imino)triphosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ imino)triphosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.receptors. Furthermore, these studies implicate a secondary role for an N-terminal α subunit region, but not a C-terminal region, in stabilizing high affinity agonist binding to 5-HT1Breceptors as well as G protein activation (GTPγS binding).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found a new region of Gαiimportant for specific interaction with 5-HT1B receptors using in vitro reconstitution of Sf9 cell membranes containing overexpressed 5-HT1B receptors with chimeric Gα subunits. We provide strong evidence that the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop are critical for specific 5-HT1Breceptor-Gi1 interaction and are required for G protein activation by the receptor. Amino acid sequence alignment shows that Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 are highly conserved in the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop region while Gαt has 9 residues which differ from Gαi1(Fig. 6). In addition, the amino acid sequence of this region is diverse among the different families of Gα subunits, supporting the idea that the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop of Gα is another binding domain necessary for selective interaction with appropriate heptahelical receptors. This domain has previously been implicated in receptor interaction. Mazzoni et al. reported that Arg310 of Gαt is completely protected from tryptic proteolysis in the presence of light-activated rhodopsin while it is a major site of tryptic cleavage of free Gαtor heterotrimeric Gt (30Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30034-30040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that the α4-β6 loop may be a point of receptor contact. In addition, a recent site-directed mutagenesis study demonstrated that four single alanine substituted mutants in the α4-β6 loop region of Gαt(Arg309, Asp311, Val312, and Lys313) are each defective in their ability to interact with light-activated rhodopsin (12Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop of the Gα subunit was originally identified as an effector coupling site. Synthetic peptides from amino acids 293–314 of Gαt activate cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) (31Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and PDEγ can be cross-linked to this loop (32Artemyev N.O. Mills J.S. Thornburg K.R. Knapp D.R. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23611-23615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Arshavsky V.Y. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26900-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our data thus suggest that the receptor binding domain is adjacent to or partially overlaps the effector interacting domain in Gα subunits. In support of this, Artemyev (34Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) recently found that cGMP phosphodiesterase γ subunit, an effector of Gαt, can prevent the interaction between Gtand light-activated rhodopsin.This study also implicates another region of Gαi1important for 5-HT1B receptor interaction. The N-terminal 210 amino acids of Gαi1 imparted increased high affinity agonist binding to the 5-HT1B receptor. Some part of the N-terminal half of Gαi1 (not further specified) acts synergistically with the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop to enhance high affinity agonist binding to 5-HT1B receptors. However, the N-terminal region is not sufficient on its own for functional coupling with 5-HT1B receptors since no significant effect on high affinity agonist binding was observed with chimeras containing only the N-terminal half of Gαi1.It has been postulated that the GDP bound form of the G protein interacts with agonist-activated receptors and results in the release of GDP from the Gα subunit. This guanine nucleotide-free G protein is able to tightly bind agonist-bound receptors, and this complex can be released from the receptor by GDP or GTP (41Lefkowitz R.J. Mullikin D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4686-4692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Keravis T.M. Nehlig H. Delacroix M.F. Regoli D. Hiley R. Stoclet J.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sec. 1991; 207: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that the conformation of “empty-state” Gα subunit is different from the previously crystallized GDP- and GTPγS-bound forms of Gα subunits (6Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 8Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Thus, any defect in receptor-catalyzed GDP release from the Gα subunit would result in a failure to form the ternary complex of agonist, receptor, and G protein. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that all chimeras which lacked the ability to undergo receptor-catalyzed GTP/GDP exchange also failed to induce high affinity agonist binding by the receptor (Table I and Fig. 3). As the rate-limiting step in G protein activation is release of the GDP from the Gα subunit, GTP/GDP exchange should be a direct reflection of GDP release. Therefore, we speculate that the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop of Gα is necessary for GDP release following binding to an activated receptor, and subsequently results in the empty state of Gα that can further stabilize the ligand bound receptor.How does this finding relate to the well-established role of the G protein C terminus in receptor interactions? The C-terminal region clearly plays a central role in coupling G proteins to receptors (12Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R.

Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A body of evidence also demonstrates that it is important in class-specific selectivity of receptor-G protein interactions; changing the last few amino acids at the C terminus can recruit, for example, Gi-coupled receptors to activate Gq (13Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In the case of receptor selectivity within a class of G proteins, in this study the 5-HT1B receptor interaction with Gi1, the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal 35 amino acids of Gαi1 are so highly similar to Gαt that it is unlikely that selectivity is imparted by this region. We show, in fact, that switching the C-terminal 35 amino acids from Gαt to Gαi1 has no effect on coupling with the 5-HT1B receptor. Other regions of G proteins may also be important for receptor interaction. The N-terminal region has been implicated in receptor interaction (17Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27618-27624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the present study, the N-terminal half of Gαi1 has a secondary role in 5-HT1B receptor coupling. In the case of Gα16and the C5a receptor, a chimeric protein approach revealed that yet another region, including the α2 helix and the α2/β4 loop, is involved in receptor-mediated G protein activation (18Lee C. Katz A. Simon M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 218-223PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the α subunit, the C-terminal region of the γ subunit of G proteins is also important for receptor coupling and specificity (35Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol.

The region we have defined is positioned in the three-dimensional structure to potentially affect GDP binding affinities. This region is connected by a short β sheet, β6, to nucleotide binding residues TCAT that engage the guanine ring (6Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 8Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region dramatically decreased affinity for GDP (12Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,39Garcia P.D. Onrust R. Bell S.M. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R.

A. 1993; 90: 10295-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This conserved TCAT is in fact located between the α4-α4/β6 loop and the α5-C terminus, which were previously identified as receptor binding domains (12Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R.

Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Consistent with the structural and biochemical findings, the selective interaction of these regions (α4-α4/β6 loop and α5-C terminus) with an activated receptor may induce a conformational change in the TCAT motif and catalyze GDP release from the nucleotide binding pocket in the Gα subunits.In this study, we clearly show that proper fit between the 5-HT1B receptor and the α4-α4/β6 loop region is required for GDP release from Gi1. It also appears that different receptors have different structural requirements for G protein coupling. Some receptors, such as rhodopsin, do not distinguish between Gi family members. Other Gi coupled receptors are able to distinguish to different degrees among Gi family members (25Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Carter B.D. Medzihradsky F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lett. 1995; 198: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The 5-HT1Breceptor is an example of such selectivity as this receptor fails to couple with transducin or Chi6, the transducin-like chimera. The degree of contact between receptor and the α4-α4/β6 loop region of Gα subunits might vary depending on the three-dimensional surface of each receptor type. Considering the high degree of structural homology among G proteins, we speculate that the general mechanism of G protein-receptor coupling will be conserved among different classes of G proteins and receptors. Future studies will determine in more detail regions on Gα important for selective coupling with other receptors.In summary, we have identified two distinct regions in Gαi1 important in specific G protein 5-HT1Breceptor interaction: 1) 299–318 Gαi1 (α4 and α4-β6 loop), and 2) 1–219 Gαi1. The region of 299–318 Gαi1 is necessary for both high affinity agonist binding and agonist-stimulated G protein activation. The other region, 1–219 Gαi1 has a minor and conditional effect on the apparent affinity state of the receptor. Data on the regions of Gαi involved in the high affinity agonist binding and in receptor-mediated GTP/GDP exchange correlated well. These observations suggest a close relationship between the mechanism of G protein activation by the receptor and the ability of G proteins to stabilize the high affinity agonist binding state of receptors. An important goal is to define the nature of this interaction, the mechanisms by which receptors catalyze GDP release, and the roles of the various contact regions in determining selectivity of receptor G protein interaction. The heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) mediate signaling from a large number of diverse heptahelical cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular effectors. These pathways control numerous essential functions in all tissues and are ubiquitous throughout eukaryotes (1Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 3Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A large body of work investigating the mechanisms underlying receptor-G protein interactions now exists. The early view that signaling selectivity would manifest itself on the basis of specific protein interactions allowing a receptor to couple with a unique G protein to modulate a single effector is no longer tenable with the accumulating evidence of a network of interactions that converge and diverge at multiple levels. Even in the earliest receptor-G protein reconstitution studies using phospholipid vesicles, it was clear that, while there were large differences in the efficiencies of coupling among the major families of G proteins, receptors were capable of activating multiple G proteins from distinct families (4Asano T.

Synthetic peptides from the C terminus of αt (amino acids 340–350) have been shown to stabilize the active conformation of metarhodopsin II (17Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) while alanine scanning mutagenesis of the same region has identified four specific residues crucial for αtactivation by rhodopsin (12Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similarly, two C-terminal peptides from αs (354–372 and 384–394), but not the corresponding peptides from αi2, could evoke high affinity agonist binding to β-adrenergic receptors and block their ability to activate αs (16Rasenick M.M. Watanabe M. Lazarevic M.B. Hatta G. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of three to five C-terminal amino acids of αq with the corresponding residues from αi allowed receptors that normally signal exclusively through αi subunits to activate the chimeric α subunits and stimulate the Gq effector, phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) (13Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, a similar chimeric approach revealed that sequences in addition to the C terminus were required for specificity of activation of α16 subunits by the C5a receptor (18Lee C. Katz A. Simon M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 218-223PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have also implicated a role for N-terminal sequences in receptor-G protein coupling (17Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A.

Thus it appears that the molecular determinants of receptor-G protein coupling vary somewhat among specific families of receptors and G proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2092762008,"Regulatory proteins are often ubiquitinated, depending on their phosphorylation status as well as on their association with ancillary proteins that serve as adapters of the ubiquitination machinery. We previously demonstrated that c-Jun is targeted for ubiquitination by its association with inactive c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Phosphorylation by activated JNK protects c-Jun from ubiquitination, thus by prolonging its half-life. In the study reported here, we determined the ability of JNK to target ubiquitination of its other substrates (Elk1 and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)) and associated proteins (ATF2 and JunB). We demonstrate that phosphorylation by JNK protects ATF2, but not Elk1, from JNK-targeted ubiquitination. We also show that association of inactive JNK with JunB or ATF2 is necessary to target them for ubiquitination. Unlike its targeting of c-Jun, JNK requires additional cellular components, yet to be identified, to target the ubiquitination of ATF2. Elk1 is phosphorylated by JNK, but JNK neither associates with nor targets Elk1 for ubiquitination. The implications for the dual role of JNK in the regulation of ubiquitination and stability of c-Jun, ATF2, and JunB in normally growing versus stressed cells are discussed."

Sphingolipid biosynthesis is initiated by condensation ofl-serine with palmitoyl coenzyme A, a reaction catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50) to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (for a review of sphingolipid biosynthesis, see Refs. 7Merrill Jr., A.H.

Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). 3-Ketodihydrosphingosine is reductively converted to dihydrosphingosine, which is N-acylated and then dehydrogenated to form ceramide. Ceramide is converted to various complex sphingolipids, for instance, sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids in mammalian cells. The structure of the polar head groups of complex sphingolipids is highly diverse, and more than 300 different types of complex sphingolipids have been reported (16Hakomori S. Kanfer J.D. Hakomori S. Sphingolipid Biochemistry. 3. Plenum Press, New York1983: 1-165Google Scholar, 17Hori T. Sugita M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the structure of the ceramide moiety is relatively well conserved from mammals to single-cell eukaryotes, although there are heterogeneities in the acyl chain length and the number of the hydroxyl groups (1Karlsson K.-A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Hori T. Sugita M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). Such structural conservation most likely reflects an evolutional conservation of the biosynthetic pathway for ceramide. SPT is suggested to be a rate-determining enzyme in the sphingolipid synthetic pathway and, thus, to be a key enzyme for regulating cellular sphingolipid content (15Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, the actual mechanisms for regulating ceramide and complex sphingolipid synthesis remain unknown largely because few biosynthetic enzymes have been purified, and a limited number of genes encoding the enzymes have been isolated. Two S. cerevisiae genes, LCB1 and LCB2, have been isolated by complementation of mutant strains defective in SPT activity (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). That the LCB1 and LCB2genes are indispensable for SPT activity suggests that SPT is composed of subunits including at least the Lcb1 and Lcb2 proteins (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Independently, Zhao et al. (21Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated the SCS1gene, which is identical to the LCB2, as an allele whose mutations suppressed the hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant to high concentrations of calcium. Recently, a full-length mouse (m LCB2) and partial human (h LCB2) cDNA homologs of LCB2 have been isolated (22Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence for the isolation of mammalian homologs of LCB1from mouse and CHO cells. In addition, we present biochemical evidence that the CHO LCB1 protein is a component of the SPT enzyme. A mouse LCB1 homolog was isolated by screening a testis cDNA library for hybridization to a 32P-labeled 953-bp human cDNA fragment from the expressed sequence tag clone 6H6 (GenBank accession no. T24597) predicted to encode the LCB1 protein. The human sequence was identified by a computer search of the dbest data base of expressed sequence tags at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the tblastn algorithm (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar) and the S. cerevisiae Lcb1 protein sequence (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) as a query. The largest mouse cDNA clone, 1.2 kbp, lacked a 5′-coding region. The missing 442 bp were obtained by performing the polymerase chain reaction in the presence of a 5′-RACE-ready cDNA, prepared from mouse kidney (CLONTECH), and the LCB1-specific primers 5′-CCCCTCTCTTAGAGTACGCAG-3′ and 5′-GCCAGGCGCTCTTCTAAATC-3′ plus an anchor primer (CLONTECH). The sequence of the mouse LCB1cDNA was determined by using a cycle sequence protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). A cDNA library, made from mRNA of CHO-K1 cells, was prepared by using a SuperScriptTM plasmid system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers used for amplification of c LCB1 were: primer A, 5′-TTAGTCGACATATCTGGATTCTCTTCCATGAT-3′ (reverse); primer B, 5′-TTAGAATTCAGAACTGATTGAAGAGTGGCA-3′ (forward); primer C, 5′-TTAGAATTCATTGAAGAGTGGCAGCCAGAGCC-3′ (forward). The CHO cDNA library was subjected to polymerase chain reaction by using primers A and B (themocycling conditions were 94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s at 40 cycles). The initial amplified DNA was diluted 20,000-fold, and then the diluent was subjected to a secondary polymerase chain reaction with primers A and C (94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s at 30 cycles). After digestion with EcoRI and SalI, the amplified 0.9-kbp DNA was cloned into pBlueScript SK, and its DNA sequence was determined. Based on the sequence of the cloned 0.9-kbp DNA, a 25-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CCATCCTGCTCTCAACTACAACATC-3′), which should perfectly match a portion of the c LCB1 sequence, was synthesized, biotinylated, and used with the GeneTraperTM cDNA positive selection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) to isolate c LCB1. cDNAs hybridizable to the 25-mer oligonucleotide were retrieved from the CHO-K1 cDNA library, using the procedures described in the Life Technologies, Inc. manual, and transformed into Escherichia coli. Bacterial colonies harboring the c LCB1 coding sequence were detected by colony hybridization using the cloned 0.9-kbp fragment of c LCB1, random prime-labeled with [α-32P]CTP, as a probe. In this way, three bacterial colonies with a 2.7-kbp cDNA corresponding to c LCB1 were isolated. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNAs was determined by using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISMTM 310 genetic analyzer, Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). c LCB2 was also isolated by essentially the same procedures as described above with the following exceptions: primer A, 5′-TTAGAATTCTATCAGGATTTTGAAAACTTCTATAC-3′ (forward); primer B, 5′-TTACAGCTGCAGCAGATCCCCAACTTC-3′ (reverse); primer C, 5′-TTAGTCGACAGTCTTCATTGCCATAGATGATGAA-3′ (reverse). A 1.1-kbp DNA fragment of c LCB2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and its DNA sequence was determined. Then, a 25-mer oligonucleotide sequence (5′-AGCCAGGGTGGATATCATGGAGAGA-3′) was synthesized for the cDNA positive selection system. The previously cloned 1.1-kbp fragment of c LCB2 was used for a32P-labeled probe for the colony hybridization. Eventually, one 2-kbp clone of c LCB2 was isolated. Mutant SPB-1 (4Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its parent CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL 61) cell lines were routinely maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml,) and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in 100% humidity at 33 °C. pSV-OKneo was constructed by inserting a G418-resistant determinant from pMC1neo poly(A) (Stratagene) into a blunt-ended ClaI site of pSV-SPORT1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), a mammalian expression vector. To construct a c LCB1-expressing plasmid, the SalI-NotI 2.7-kbp fragment of c LCB1, which was originally cloned into pSPORT1, was transferred between the SalI and NotI sites of pSV-OKneo, and the resultant plasmid was designated pSV-cLCB1. Similarly, the SalI-NotI 2-kbp fragment of c LCB2 was transferred from pSPORT1 to pSV-OKneo, and the resultant c LCB2-expressing construct was designated pSV-cLCB2. SPB-1 cells were transfected with these expression plasmids by lipofection with LipofectinTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and, after selection for G418 resistance (400 μg/ml), transfectant colonies were purified with cloning cups. As a control, SPB-1 cells were transfected with the vector, pSV-OKneo, and one G418-resistant SPB-1 clone was isolated. A Northern blot containing about 2 μg/lane poly(A)+ RNA from mouse tissues (CLONTECH) was hybridized separately with a 32P-labeled 1,308-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment of the mouse LCB1, a 1,458-bp EagI-XhoI fragment of the mouse LCB2, and a 2-kbp fragment of human β-actin cDNA. Stringent hybridization conditions were used as recommended by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). A Hewlett-Packard Jetscan II scanner was used to scan the autoradiograms, and the intensity of hybridizing bands was measured using SigmaGel software (Jandel Scientific). Total RNA was prepared from CHO cells with an RNA isolation kit (ISOGEN, Nippon gene, Toyama, Japan). After electrophoresis in an agarose gel, RNA was blotted onto a Nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham). The membrane was hybridized with the 32P-labeled 0.9-kbp fragment of c LCB1 under stringent conditions, and hybridizing c LCB1 mRNA was detected by autoradiography. CHO cells were cultivated in F-12 medium containing 10% serum at 40 °C for 2 days to subconfluence, and then SPT activity of lysates prepared from the cells was determined as described previously (24Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cell lysates were incubated with various concentrations of sphingofungin B (a gift from Dr. Shu Kobayashi, Department of Applied Chemistry, Science University of Tokyo, Tokyo) at 4 °C for 10 min before the SPT assay. Replicas of CHO cell colonies were prepared on polyester discs and assayed in situ for SPT activity as described previously (4Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were seeded in 5 ml of F-12 medium containing 10% serum in 60-mm dishes and cultured at 40 °C for 2 days to subconfluence. After washing twice with 2 ml of F-12 medium, the cell monolayers were incubated in 1.3 ml of F-12 medium containing 1% Nutridoma-SPTM (Boehringer Mannheim) and 24 kilobecquerels of l-[U-14C]serine (Amersham) at 40 °C for 2 h. The monolayers were washed twice with 2 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and precipitated by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cell pellets were suspended in 0.9 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1 ml and 0.8 ml of the suspension were used for protein determination and lipid extraction, respectively. Lipids extracted from the cells by the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) were separated on TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) with a solvent of methyacetate, propanol-1,chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% KCl (25/25/25/10/9 v/v). Radioactive lipids on the TLC plates were visualized, and their relative radioactivity was determined by using a BAS2000 Image AnalyzerTM (Fuji). CHO cells (1.5–3.5 × 106 cells) were seeded in a 150-mm culture dish containing 15 ml of 10% serum and F-12 medium and cultured at 33 °C for 1 day. Then, after washing twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, the cell monolayers were cultivated in 25 ml of Nutridoma-BO containing gentamicin (10 μg/ml), a sphingolipid-deficient medium, at 40 °C for 2 additional days. After washing twice with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cell monolayers were harvested by scraping, phospholipids were extracted from the harvested cells (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), and the extracted phospholipids were separated by TLC with a solvent of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65/25/10 v/v). The phosphorus content of the phospholipids was determined by the method of Rouser et al. (26Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). c LCB1cloned into pSPORT1 was digested with BsrGI and self-ligated to delete the NcoI site in the 3′-untranslated region. The resultant plasmid, digested with NcoI and SalI, was ligated with annealed oligonucleotides (5′-TCGACCATGGCGCATCACCATCACCATCA-3′ and 5′-CATGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGCCATGG-3′) encoding a His6-tag sequence. The SalI-NotI fragment of the tagged c LCB1 was transferred from pSPORT1 to pSV-OKneo, and the resultant construct was designated pSV-HTcLCB1. The fusion protein encoded by pSV-HTcLCB1 has the sequence Met-Ala-His-His-His-His-His-His before the first methionine of the wild type cLCB1 protein. SPB-1 cells were transfected with pSV-HTcLCB1, and G418-resistant transformants were selected as described above. By an in situ SPT assay of the drug-resistant colonies, transformants having SPT were identified, and one purified clone was designated SPB-1/HTcLCB1. All manipulations were done at 4 °C or on ice unless noted otherwise. After CHO cells were cultured at 40 °C for 2 days, membranes were prepared from the cells as described previously (11Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The membranes (1 mg of protein) were incubated in 0.5 ml of a solubilization buffer consisting of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1% sucrose monolaurate (Mitsubishi Kasei Shokuhin Inc., Tokyo) for 10 min. After centrifugation (105 × g, 30 min) of the sample, 0.4 ml of the supernatant fluid was incubated with 50 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden) in a microcentrifuge tube for 1 h with gentle shaking. The resin was pelleted by centrifuging for 1 min at 2,000 ×g, and the supernatant fluid was stored as an unabsorbed fraction. After washing twice with 1 ml of the solubilization buffer, the resin was incubated with 0.3 ml of an elution buffer consisting of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.1 mimidazole, and 1% sucrose monolaurate for 10 min with gentle shaking. After precipitating the resin, the supernatant fluid was recovered as an absorbed fraction. The recovered fractions were assayed for SPT activity. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. A computer search for sequences with similarity to the yeast Lcb1 protein identified a human expressed sequence tag (GenBank accession no.T24597). Most of the base sequence in this expressed sequence tag clone was determined and then used to identify a 1.2-kbp cDNA in a mouse testis cDNA library by nucleic acid hybridization. Sequence analysis of the mouse 1.2-kbp cDNA indicated that it potentially encoded a homolog of the Lcb1 protein and suggested that it lacked a 5′-end because no ATG start codon was present. The missing 5′-end of the mouse cDNA was cloned using the RACE technique yielding a 1.7-kbp mouse cDNA (designated m LCB1, GenBank accession no. AF003823). Because the size of m LCB1 mRNA was estimated to be about 2.7 kb by Northern blot analysis (see below), the 1.7-kbp clone could not represent a full-length cDNA. However, the 1.7-kbp mouse cDNA appears to encode a complete open reading frame (ORF) but lacks the 3′-untranslated region (see below). We next screened a CHO cell cDNA library, consisting of about 107 independent cDNA clones, and obtained three 2.7-kbp clones. Because these three cDNA clones were found to have identical 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences by nucleotide sequence analysis, we chose one cDNA clone, designated c LCB1(GenBank accession no. AF004831), for further analysis. c LCB1 contains a 1,419-bp ORF predicted to encode a protein of 473 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 52,519 Da (Fig.1). The ACCATGG sequence around the first ATG codon of the ORF corresponds to a Kozak sequence (28Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for efficient translational initiation, and there is a poly(A) attachment signal (AATAAA) 33 bases upstream of the poly(A) tail. The size of mRNA for c LCB1 was estimated by Northern blot analysis to be about 2.7 kb (data not shown). Thus, the 2.7-kbp c LCB1 is suggested to encode a complete ORF. m LCB1 also encodes a homologous 1,419-bp ORF, and there is 95% amino acid identity between the predicted cLCB1 and mLCB1 proteins (Fig. 1). The putative products of c LCB1 and m LCB1 have about 35% amino acid identity to the yeast Lcb1 protein (Fig. 1), suggesting that these mammalian cDNAs are homologs of the yeast LCB1 gene. The ALOM algorithm (29Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) predicts that the cLCB1 and mLCB1 proteins have one transmembrane domain near their amino terminus (Fig. 1), and another algorithm for predicting protein localization sites (29Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) predicts that these mammalian LCB1 proteins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. These predictions are in agreement with SPT being a membrane-bound enzyme enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum (30Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast cells, both the LCB1 and LCB2 genes are necessary for expression of SPT activity (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A mouse LCB2homolog (m LCB2) has been described recently (22Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We isolated an LCB2 homolog from a CHO cell cDNA library by procedures similar to those used to isolate c LCB1. The 2,044-bp cDNA (designated c LCB2; GenBank accession no.AF004830) contains a 1,680-bp ORF that potentially encodes a polypeptide consisting of 560 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 62,882 Da. The cLCB2 protein is 98% identical to the mLCB2 protein and 43% identical to the yeast Lcb2 protein (Fig.2), suggesting that the c LCB2is a CHO LCB2 homolog. The cLCB2 and mLCB2 proteins are predicted to have one transmembrane domain (Fig. 2) and to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The distribution of the LCB1 mRNA in mouse tissue was analyzed and compared with the LCB2 mRNA (22Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from various mouse tissues revealed a 2.7-kb LCB1-specific mRNA in all tested tissues (Fig. 3). The highest level of mRNA, measured relative to the level of the 2-kb β-actin mRNA, was found in kidney followed by brain and liver. Two LCB2-specific messengers were detected. The 2-kb mRNA, whose size corresponds to the cloned 1.89-bp cDNA (22Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was found in all tissues, whereas the 6.5-kb mRNA was present in high level in some tissues but was undetectable in others (Fig. 3). The highest level of the LCB2 mRNA was also found in kidney and brain. We previously isolated an SPT-defective CHO mutant strain, SPB-1 (4Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SPT activity in SPB-1 cells is thermolabile, and thus sphingolipid synthesis stops almost completely at nonpermissive temperatures (4Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if expression of c LCB1 or c LCB2 complemented the SPT defect in SPB-1 cells, we constructed plasmids pSV-cLCB1 and pSV-cLCB2, in which c LCB1 and c LCB2, respectively, were cloned into pSV-OKneo, a mammalian expression vector with a G418-resistant determinant. SPB-1 cells were transfected with these plasmids, and G418-resistant clones were isolated. Colonies of the drug-resistant cells were replicated on polyester discs, and in situ SPT assays using replicated colonies were carried out to determine the population of colonies having SPT activity. When transfected with plasmid pSV-cLCB1, about 50% of the population of G418-resistant SPB-1 colonies had SPT activity. In contrast, no colonies of G418-resistant SPB-1 cells transfected with pSV-cLCB2 showed any recovery of SPT activity. These results demonstrate specific complementation of the SPT defect of SPB-1 cells by the c LCB1 and eliminate the possibility that the recovery of SPT activity in SPB-1 cells transfected with pSV-cLCB1 cells is caused by spontaneous reversion events. For further analysis of SPB-1 cells transfected with pSV-cLCB1, one stable transformant designated SPB-1/cLCB1 was chosen. As a control, a G418-resistant isolate of SPB-1 cells transfected with the pSV-OKneo vector was also isolated. After cells were cultivated at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) for 2 days to inactivate the endogenous SPT activity of SPB-1 cells, lysates were prepared from the cells for SPT assay. SPT activity in SPB-1 cells was less than 5% of that in the parental CHO-K1 cells (TableI) as described previously (4Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SPT activity in SPB-1/cLCB1 cells was more than 90% of that in CHO-K1 cells, whereas the vector-transfected control cells exhibited no recovery of SPT activity (Table I). Sensitivity of SPT activity to sphingofungin B, a potent inhibitor of SPT (31Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25032-25038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was identical between CHO-K1 and SPB-1/cLCB1 cells (the dose producing 50% inhibition of SPT activity was about 10 nm in both cell types; data not shown), indicating that SPB-1/cLCB1 cells produce SPT activity that behaves like the wild type.Table IcLCB1 restores SPT activity to SPB-1 mutant CHO cellsStrainKDS producedpmol/mg protein/10 minCHO-K1548 ± 5SPB-1<20SPB-1/cLCB1501 ± 21SPB-1/pSV-OK<20 Open table in a new tab To monitor de novo sphingolipid synthesis, cells were incubated with l-[14C]serine for 2 h at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C), and metabolically labeled lipids were analyzed. Although SPB-1 cells made no appreciable sphingolipids, SPB-1/cLCB1 cells synthesized sphingolipids (sphingomyelin, GM3 ganglioside, glucosylceramide, and ceramide) as well as wild type CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 4), in agreement with the recovery of SPT activity in SPB-1/cLCB1 cells (TableI). There was no difference in the metabolic labeling of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine with [14C]serine among these cell types (Fig. 4), suggesting a specific effect of the transfected c LCB1 gene on sphingolipid metabolism. Recovery of sphingolipid synthesis in SPB-1/cLCB1 cells was confirmed further by showing that the content of sphingomyelin, the most abundant sphingolipid, was restored in SPB-1/cLCB1 cells. When cells were cultured in a sphingolipid-deficient medium at 40 °C for 2 days, sphingomyelin in SPB-1 cells amounted to 3.9 ± 0.4% (n = 3) of the total phospholipids, whereas that in CHO-K1 cells amounted to 9.6 ± 1.2% (n = 3) (Table II). Sphingomyelin in SPB-1/cLCB1 cells amounted to 9.3 ± 0.8% (n = 3) of the total phospholipids (Table II), indicating full recovery of the sphingomyelin level in SPB1/cLCB1 cells. The content of GM3ganglioside in SPB-1/cLCB1 cells was also restored to the wild type level (not shown).Table IIcLCB1 restores sphingomyelin to mutant CHO cellsStrainPhospholipid compositionSMPtdChoPtdEtnPtdSer/PtdIns% of totalCHO-K19.6 ± 1.249.8 ± 1.927.1 ± 0.413.5 ± 0.7SPB-13.9 ± 0.454.6 ± 1.728.3 ± 0.513.2 ± 0.8SPB-1/cLCB19.3 ± 0.848.5 ± 1.228.7 ± 1.613.4 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab SPB-1 cells show a marked growth retardation at the nonpermissive temperatures compared with the parental CHO-K1 cells (5Hanada K.

Growth of SPB-1 cells at the nonpermissive temperature was partially restored by transfection with pSV-cLCB1 but not with the vector, and was still slower than that of wild type CHO-K1 cells. 2K. Hanada, unpublished observations. Because pSV-cLCB1 restored SPT activity and sphingolipid synthesis to the wild type level, the partial restoration of growth suggests that SPB-1 cells may contain an additional mutation(s), unrelated to sphingolipid synthesis, which affects growth. To prove that the cLCB1 protein is a component of SPT, we constructed a plasmid, pSV-HTcLCB1, expressing a His6-tagged cLCB1 protein, and we determined whether SPT in an SPB-1 transfectant producing the tagged cLCB1 protein bound to a Ni2+-immobilized resin that has a strong affinity to neighboring histidine residues (32Hochuli E. Dobeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). An in situ SPT assay of G418-resistant transformants of SPB-1 cells transfected with pSV-HTcLCB1 showed that about 50% of the drug-resistant colonies had SPT activity, suggesting that the His6-tagged cLCB1 protein functioned as well as the wild type cLCB1 protein. One transformant having SPT activity was purified and named SPB-1/HTcLCB1. Membranes prepared from SPB-1/HTcLCB1, SPB-1/cLCB1, and CHO-K1 cells were solubilized with a non-ionic detergent so that about 90% of the SPT activity was recovered in the supernatant fluid after high speed centrifugation. The supernatant fluid was incubated with a Ni2+-immobilized resin, and unadsorbed proteins were withdrawn. After washing the resin, adsorbed proteins were eluted with a high concentration of imidazole, a chelator of Ni2+. About half of the SPT activity from SPB-1/HTcLCB1 cells adsorbed to the Ni2+-immobilized resin, whereas none of the SPT activity from SPB-1/cLCB1 cells or CHO-K1 cells absorbed to the resin. These results demonstrate that the His6-tagged cLCB1 protein is a component of SPT. That a portion of the SPT activity from SPB-1/HTcLCB1 cells did not bind to the Ni2+-immobilized resin was probably because of a limited accessibility of the tag sequence to the immobilized metal ions inasmuch as a partial population of the solubilized SPT molecules might be oriented inside detergent micelles. We report the molecular cloning of a mouse (m LCB1) and a CHO (c LCB1) cDNA homolog of the yeast LCB1 gene, shown previously to be essential for SPT activity (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on amino acid sequence comparison and functional analysis. The predicted mLCB1 and cLCB1 proteins have about 30% amino acid identity and 36% amino acid similarity to the yeast Lcb1 protein (Fig. 1), indicating that the m LCB1 and c LCB1 encode mammalian structural homologs of the yeast Lcb1 protein. The c LCB1 is probably a functional homolog as well because it was able to complement the SPT deficiency in a CHO mutant strain and restore both SPT activity (Table I) and sphingolipid synthesis (Fig. 4and Table II) to the wild type levels. Moreover, a His6-tagged cLCB1 protein but not an untagged protein produced in SPB-1 cells caused SPT activity to adsorb to a Ni2+-immobilized resin (TableIII), indicating that the tagged cLCB1 protein specifically associates with SPT activity. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the cLCB1 protein is a component of SPT.Table IIISPT activity in SPB-1 cells expressing a His 6 -tagged cLCB1 protein binds to an affinity matrixStrainSPT activity distributionUnadsorbedAdsorbed% of total activitySPB-1/HTcLCB15842SPB-1/cLCB1>90<10CHO-K1>90<10 Open table in a new tab The recovery of SPT activity in SPB-1 cells after transfection with the c LCB1-expressing plasmid but not with the c LCB2-expressing plasmid suggests specific complementation of the SPT defect of SPB-1 cells by the c LCB1. Possibly, the endogenous LCB1 protein in SPB-1 cells is thermolabile, and in SPB-1/cLCB1 cells the LCB1 protein derived from pSV-cLCB1 complexes with the endogenous LCB2 protein to form a functional SPT complex, thereby restoring SPT activity to the wild type level. The nature of the genetic defect in SPB-1 cells leading to loss of SPT activity is not known. It does not appear to affect transcription because there was no difference in the size (2.7 kb) of the LCB1 messenger or in its expression level between SPB-1 and CHO-K1 cells even after culture at the non-permissive temperature, as judged by Northern blot analysis.2 SPT catalyzes the initial step dedicated to sphingolipid biosynthesis and is suggested to be rate-determining for de novo sphingolipid synthesis (for review, see Ref. 15Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of SPT activity. Our finding that the tissue distribution of both LCB1 and LCB2messengers follows a similar pattern in mouse (Fig. 3), as expected for mRNAs encoding subunits of the same enzyme, suggests that transcription of the two genes is coordinately controlled in vivo. The high relative level of LCB messengers (Fig. 3) in mouse kidney, brain, and liver (LCB1 mRNA only) as well as the low level in testis correlates well with the relative level of SPT specific activity found in these tissues in rat (33Merrill Jr., A.H. Nixon D.W. Williams R.D. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 617-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The highest SPT specific activity among rat tissues was found in lung (33Merrill Jr., A.H. Nixon D.W. Williams R.D. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 617-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both LCB messengers are also present at a high level in lung relative to total poly(A)+ RNA (relative intensity (RI) value, Fig. 3), but the level becomes low when calculated relative to the 2-kb actin mRNA (actin-normalized RI value, Fig. 3), whose concentration is high in this tissue. The nature of the relationship between the level of LCB messengers and the specific activity of SPT in various cells and tissues requires further study. There is high amino acid conservation between the mammalian LCB1 proteins and between residues 150–449 of the yeast Lcb1 protein (Fig.1). Such strong conservation, despite a long phylogenetic distance between S. cerevisiae and mammals, leads us to speculate that this region of the LCB1 protein may be necessary for SPT catalytic activity, for regulation of SPT activity, or for self-interaction or interaction with other subunits. That the cLCB2 and mLCB2 proteins are predicted to have about 40% amino acid identity to the yeast Lcb2 protein (Fig. 2) suggests their functional resemblance. The mammalian LCB2 proteins contain a motif, G373TFTKSFG380 (Fig. 2) which is related to a pyridoxal phosphate binding motif found in the E. coli 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase (34Mukherjee J.J. Dekker E.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1037: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The underlined Lys377 of the mammalian LCB2 proteins is predicted to correspond to a lysine residue that forms a Schiff base with pyridoxal phosphate in the 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase (34Mukherjee J.J. Dekker E.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1037: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This motif is conserved perfectly among the predicted yeast, mouse, and CHO LCB2 proteins (Fig. 2), implying that these proteins are a catalytic component of SPT. However, it remains to be shown biochemically that these mammalian LCB2 proteins are a component of the SPT enzyme. The availability of both the mammalian LCB1 and LCB2 cDNA should enable us not only to address this issue but also to elucidate the mechanism(s) for regulating SPT activity in mammalian cells. Purification of SPT may be facilitated by using the His6-tagged cLCB1 protein, and examination of purified SPT should allow identification of all components of SPT. We thank Dr. Juan L. Iovanna (INSERM) for plasmid 6H6 and Dr. Debra J. Wolgemuth (Columbia University) for the mouse cDNA library."

We then used this compound together with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to identify residues in transmembrane segment (TM) 6 and TM12 that are important for function. TM6 and TM12 lie close to each other in the tertiary structure and are postulated to be important for drug-protein interactions. The majority of P-glycoprotein mutants containing a single cysteine residue retained substantial amounts of drug-stimulated ATPase activity and were not inhibited by dBBn. The ATPase activities of mutants L339C, A342C, L975C, V982C, and A985C, however, were markedly inhibited (>60%) by dBBn. The drug substrates verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine protected these mutants against inhibition by dBBn, suggesting that these residues are important for interaction of substrates with P-glycoprotein. We previously showed that residues Leu339, Ala342, Leu975, Val982, and Ala985 lie along the point of contact between helices TM6 and TM12, when both are aligned in a left-handed coiled coil (Loo, T.

The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (product of the MDR1 gene) is an ATP-dependent transporter located in the plasma membrane of many cells and is able to extrude a wide variety of hydrophobic compounds and drugs (reviewed in Ref. 1Gottesman M.M.

Overexpression of P-glycoprotein in tumors appears to be one of several mechanisms responsible for multidrug resistance during chemotherapy. P-glycoprotein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transport proteins. Its 1280 amino acids are organized in two tandem repeats, each repeat consisting of a hydrophobic domain followed by an ATP-binding domain (4Chen C. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Many different approaches have been used to study the mechanism of ATP-dependent drug efflux. It is known that the minimum functional unit is a monomer (5Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both ATP-binding sites are important because inactivation of either site by mutagenesis or chemical modification inhibits drug-stimulated ATPase activity (7Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell.

The transmembrane domains appear to contain the drug-binding site(s) and likely form the translocation pathway through the membrane.

More recently, we have shown that these two segments lie close to each other in the tertiary structure (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a thiol-reactive compound, dibromobimane (dBBn), 1The abbreviations used are: dBBn, dibromobimane; TM, transmembrane segment. that was a potent stimulator of the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-glycoprotein. We then combined it with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to examine the contribution of TM6 and TM12 to coupling of drug binding to ATPase activity. We introduced a cysteine residue at each position in TM6 or TM12 in a Cys-less P-glycoprotein and then probed these cysteine mutants with dBBn. Our rationale was that a thiol-reactive substrate should also occupy the drug-binding site of P-glycoprotein, covalently bind to a nearby cysteine residue, and inhibit drug-stimulated ATPase activity. We show that the compound dBBn is a particularly useful thiol-reactive probe for such an approach, because it was a relatively potent stimulator of the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-glycoprotein and both its reactivity and its ability to act as a substrate could be quenched with cysteine. We show that the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of mutants L339C and A342C (TM6) and L975C, V982C, and A985C (TM12) were particularly sensitive to inhibition by dBBn and that the inhibition was prevented by various drug substrates. These results suggest that the interface between TM6 and TM12 is critical for P-glycoprotein-drug interactions and likely forms part of the potential drug-binding pocket. Cysteine residues were introduced into a Cys-less mutant of P-glycoprotein containing a histidine tag at the COOH terminus as described previously (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The presence of a histidine tag facilitated purification of the mutant P-glycoprotein by nickel-chelate chromatography (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of P-glycoprotein were carried out as described previously (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, forty 10-cm diameter culture plates of HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. The transfected cells were then harvested 24 h later and solubilized with 1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the mutant P-glycoproteins were isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography was diluted with an equal volume of 100 mg/ml crude sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma, Type II, commercial grade) that had been washed with Tris-buffered saline to remove traces of phosphate and then sonicated. ATPase activity was initiated by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and the desired drug to a sample containing 100 ng of P-glycoprotein-lipid mixture. The concentration of the drugs in the ATPase assays was 1 mm verapamil, 0.1 mmvinblastine, 5 mm colchicine, and 1 mm for others. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined by the method of Chifflet et al. (22Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For dBBn inhibition, the mutant P-glycoprotein-lipid mixture was preincubated with 1 mm dBBn (Molecular Probes Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of cysteine, pH 7.5, to a concentration of 40 mm and incubation at 37 °C for another 5 min. ATPase activity was then determined as described above. Whole cell lysates of transfected HEK 293 cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a sheet of nitrocellulose, and probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein and enhanced chemiluminescence (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We previously showed that a Cys-less P-glycoprotein has near wild-type levels of drug-stimulated ATPase activity (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This Cys-less P-glycoprotein was then used to identify thiol-reactive compounds that would be potent stimulators of the Cys-less P-glycoprotein ATPase activity. The compound could then be used with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to identify residues in the transmembrane domain that are important for function. The rationale for this approach was that for a compound to stimulate P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, it must be able to interact at the binding site(s) of P-glycoprotein and that reaction of the compound with a thiol group should inhibit ATPase activity. Because P-glycoprotein transports hydrophobic compounds, hydrophobic thiol-specific compounds were tested. Fig.1 shows the ability of various thiol-reactive compounds to stimulate the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-glycoprotein compared with that of verapamil. There was little or no stimulation of ATPase activity by N-ethylmaleimide,p-chloromercuribenzosulfonate,p-chloromercuribenzoate, or iodoacetamide. Acrylodan (0.25 mm) caused about a 3-fold stimulation of activity, whereas dBBn (1 mm) caused an 8.2-fold stimulation of ATPase activity. This concentration of dBBn caused maximum activation of ATPase activity. Pretreatment of dBBn with cysteine inhibited its ability to stimulate ATPase activity. Therefore, dBBn was considered to be a useful thiol-reactive substrate, because it was a relatively potent stimulator of the Cys-less P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, and its activity could be quenched with cysteine. We constructed 42 different mutants that contained a single cysteine at each position of TM6 and TM12. Each mutant also contained a polyhistidine tag at the COOH terminus to facilitate recovery by nickel-chelate chromatography (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Each mutant P-glycoprotein was expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence of cyclosporin A. The presence of cyclosporin A during biosynthesis increases the yield of the mature form of P-glycoprotein (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The P-glycoprotein mutants were then recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of lipid (Fig.2 A). Most of the mutants exhibited 60–100% of the activity of the Cys-less parent enzyme. One mutant, F335C (TM6) showed enhanced activity (280%), whereas the equivalent residue in TM12 (F978C) showed decreased activity (31%). These results are consistent with our previous findings (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). There was no detectable activity with mutants S344C, G341C, and G984C, whereas mutants A342C, G346C, Q347C, A985C, G989C, and Q990C had much reduced activity (10–40%). These mutants with relatively low activities were checked for expression in the presence or the absence of cyclosporin A, and compared with expression levels of wild-type or Cys-less P-glycoprotein (Fig. 2 B). There was a significant increase in the amount of the mature (170-kDa) P-glycoprotein when the Cys-less mutant was grown in the presence of cyclosporin A (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). A similar pattern was observed for mutants G346C, A985C, G989C, and Q990C, suggesting that the low ATPase activity in these mutants was not due to a processing defect. Mutants G341C and G984C, however, appeared to be degraded quite rapidly. Both mutants contained immunoreactive products of apparent masses 120 and 95 kDa, respectively, as the major products. Mutants A342C and Q347C also showed enhanced degradation in the absence of cyclosporin A, with the 120-kDa protein as the major product. This appeared to be a degradation product rather than a nonglycosylated product because it had a higher mobility than the glycosylation-deficient P-glycoprotein (N91A/N94A/N99A) (Fig.2 B, lanes 23 and 24). For both mutants, the amount of mature protein increased in the presence of cyclosporin A. Mutant S344C consistently yielded very low levels of immunoreactive P-glycoprotein in the presence or the absence of cyclosporin A (Fig. 2 B, lanes 13 and 14). To test for inhibition of ATPase activity by dBBn, each of the 37 active Cys mutants was treated with 1 mm dBBn for 5 min at 37 °C, quenched with cysteine, and then assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig.3). Verapamil was used because it is the most potent stimulator of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity. The activities of the dBBn-treated samples were expressed relative to their mock-treated controls. Mutants G341C, S344C, G346C, G984C, and G989C were not assayed because of their low or defective expression (Fig.2 B). 31 of the 37 mutants retained more than 80% of their activity when treated with dBBn, whereas V981C retained 59% of its activity. In contrast, mutants L339C, A342C, L975C, V982C, and A985C were significantly inhibited by dBBn, because they retained only 10, 40, 13, 25, and 32% of their activities, respectively. The concentration of dBBn required to give 50% inhibition of ATPase activity for mutants L339C, L975C, V982C, A985C, and A342C were 90, 112, 320, 480, and 700 μm, respectively. We then tested whether the drug substrates, verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine, could protect the mutant P-glycoproteins against inactivation by dBBn. Each mutant P-glycoprotein was preincubated with verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine, treated with dBBn, and then quenched with cysteine. The amount of ATPase activity was then measured and compared with a sample that was not treated with dBBn. Due to the low ATPase activities of mutants A342C and A985C, their protection assays were done only in the presence of verapamil. Verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of Cys-less P-glycoprotein is more than twice that obtained with vinblastine or colchicine. As shown in Fig. 4, mutants A342C and A985C were protected from dBBn inactivation by verapamil. Similarly, mutants L339C, L975C, and V982C were also protected from dBBn inactivation by various drug substrates. All three mutants retained more than 80% of their vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity after treatment with dBBn. Colchicine was also very effective in protecting mutant L339C from dBBn inactivation because it retained about 80% of its colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity. More modest protection by colchicine was seen for mutants L975C and V982C. By contrast, verapamil was the least effective of the substrates. It offered little or no protection for mutant V982C and only moderately protected mutants L339C and L975C. The drug-stimulated ATPase activities of the Cys-less P-glycoprotein were not affected by dBBn. The use of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in combination with a thiol-specific substrate to identify important residues in P-glycoprotein-drug interactions has several advantages over approaches that use only mutagenesis (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14049-14057Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or that involve photolabeling with a radioactive analog of drug substrates. A major advantage is that the use of dBBn is a direct approach for probing the active site of P-glycoprotein. It is a relatively good stimulator of Cys-less P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, and its activity can be abolished with cysteine. Covalent attachment of dBBn to a cysteine residue also introduces a large bulky group into the protein, and the presence of such a large covalently bound group in the drug-binding site(s) would disrupt activity. Significant inhibition of activity suggests that the majority of the protein was modified with dBBn. A problem with using only mutagenesis, such as alanine-scanning mutagenesis, is that drug-protein interactions likely involve a large number of residues, so that a single change may not have a measurable effect. In addition, when a change in substrate specificity is observed, it is often difficult to determine if this is due to local or global structural changes. A difficulty in photolabeling with radioactive analogs of drug substrates is that the concentration of photolabel required for stoichiometric labeling of the protein makes it economically unfeasible. In this study we showed that modification of five residues (Leu339, Ala342, Leu975, Val982, and Ala985) in TM6 and TM12 by dBBn inhibited ATPase activity of the mutants. In a recent cross-linking study (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we showed that TM6 and TM12 helices are likely to be arranged in a left-handed coiled coil (Ref. 24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar and Fig.5). Cross-linking between residues F343C/M986C, G346C/G989C, and P350C/S993C was prevented by the presence of drug substrates. Residues Leu339, Ala342, Leu975, Val982, and Ala985 are next to or lie close to these cross-linked residues and along the TM6/TM12 interface. As with the cross-linked residues, inhibition of the activities of these mutants by dBBn was prevented by drug substrates (verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine). Taken together, the results suggest that these residues may form part of a potential drug-binding pocket in P-glycoprotein (Fig. 5). TM6 of other ATP-binding cassette transporters such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator also appears to be important for function. Cheung and Akabas (25Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Cheung M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) mutated each residue in TM6 of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to cysteine and measured the reactivity of the water-accessible residues to charged, hydrophilic sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate reagents. They showed that TM6 contained channel-lining residues and that the cytoplasmic end of TM6 forms part of the anion selectivity filter. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in combination with a thiol-reactive substrate should be a useful tool for determining whether other transmembrane segments contribute to the drug-binding sites(s) in P-glycoprotein. Such an approach could also be used to study other membrane transport proteins. We thank Dr. Randal Kaufman (Boston, MA) for pMT21."
https://openalex.org/W2085491229,"High-pressure diamond-cell experiments indicate that the iron-magnesium partitioning between (Fe,Mg)SiO 3 -perovskite and magnesiowüstite in Earth's lower mantle depends on the pressure, temperature, bulk iron/magnesium ratio, and ferric iron content. The perovskite stability field expands with increasing pressure and temperature. The ferric iron component preferentially dissolves in perovskite and raises the apparent total iron content but had little effect on the partitioning of the ferrous iron. The ferrous iron depletes in perovskite at the top of the lower mantle and gradually increases at greater depth. These changes in iron-magnesium composition should affect geochemical and geophysical properties of the deep interior."

Here we demonstrate that some mutations within this channel protein (K31D and K31E) evoke a cellular phenotype in which the growth rate is severely depressed. Increasing the osmolarity of the growth medium partially rescues this “slowed growth” phenotype and decreases an abnormal cytosolic potassium loss observed in cells expressing the mutants. In addition, upon sudden decrease in osmolarity (osmotic downshock) more cytoplasmic potassium is released from cells expressing the mutants than cells expressing wild-type MscL. After osmotic downshock, all cells remained viable; hence, the differences in potassium efflux observed are not due to cell lysis but instead appear to be an exaggeration of the normal response to this sudden change in environmental osmolarity. Patch clamp studies in native bacterial membranes substantiate the hypothesis that these mutant channels are more sensitive to mechanical stresses, especially at voltages approaching those estimated for bacterial membrane potentials. These data are consistent with a crucial role for MscL in the adaptation to large osmotic downshock and suggest that if the normally tight regulation of MscL gating is disrupted, cell growth can be severely inhibited.

The ability to detect mechanical force, mechanosensation, is an inherent property of essentially all living organisms. Many animals, including humans, need mechanosensation for the senses of touch, hearing, and balance, as well as for regulating cardiovascular function; plants have the ability to detect wind and gravity; even many microorganisms have a primitive sense of touch or require mechanosensation for adapting to changes in osmolarity. Many studies in a variety of organisms have suggested that mechanosensitive (MS) 1The abbreviations used are: MS, mechanosensitive; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; CFU, colony forming units; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: MS, mechanosensitive; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; CFU, colony forming units; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. channels play an important role in mechanosensation (1Martinac B.

Despite their obvious importance to life, little is known about how MS channels function. Although ligand- and voltage-gated channels have had many model systems for a number of years, for mechanically gated channels, the first and currently the only gene shown to encode an activity is mscL, originally isolated from Escherichia coli in 1994 (5Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) (see Refs. 6Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Biol.

Bacteria may provide a system for determining general principles, applicable to many systems, of the structure and function of ion channels. Several bacterial genes predicted to encode voltage-gated ion channels apparently share molecular mechanisms and structural elements with channels in several other systems (8Booth I.R.

In E. coli, MS channel activities have been studied in native membranes (9Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and in reconstituted proteoliposome systems (15Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Blount P. Kung C. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1994; 6: 51-59Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Three classes of MS channel activity have been reported in this organism (16Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) representing at least two discrete molecular entities (17Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). One of these activities is MscL (for mechanosensitivechannel of large conductance), which has fast kinetics and a conductance of greater than 2.5 nS; an activity withsmaller conductance (0.8 nS), MscS; and an MS channel activity with the smallest (mini) conductance (0.4 nS), called MscM. The observation that MscL could be solubilized, fractionated through a chromatographic column, reconstituted into artificial liposomes, and yet retain functional channel activities as measured by patch clamp (15Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Blount P. Kung C. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1994; 6: 51-59Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) permitted the isolation of the protein responsible for this activity and ultimately, cloning of the corresponding gene (5Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). This and subsequent studies (18Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J.

Structural studies have suggested that MscL is a pre-formed homohexamer (18Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (but see Ref. 20Häse C.C. Minchin R.F. Kloda A. Martinac B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Bacterial MS channels are thought to play a role in sensing and/or adapting to changing osmotic environments. Several studies have demonstrated that when bacteria are challenged with a rapid osmotic downshock, many of the smaller cytoplasmic components are jettisoned into the medium, yet the bacteria remain viable (21Britten R.J. McClure F.T. Bacteriol. Rev. 1962; 26: 292-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Epstein W. Schultz S.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 23Koo S.P.

Because of their large conductance, and gating by mechanical stress, bacterial MS channels have been thought to be a major pathway for this cytoplasmic efflux. It was, therefore, disconcerting to find that the mscL-null mutant had no obvious osmotic phenotype (7Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); a redundancy of function with the other MS channels (MscS and MscM), whose activities are still present in the mscL-null, seemed a likely explanation for the apparent lack of phenotype. Recently, we generated a number of site-directed mutants with altered channel properties as assayed by patch clamp of native membranes (26Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that one of these mutants, K31E, inhibits the growth of the bacterial cell. Analysis of this phenomenon by whole cell and electrophysiology has provided evidence that is consistent with MscL being one of the pathways for the normal release of cytoplasmic components upon osmotic downshock, and that Lys-31, a charge in or near the first transmembrane domain (18Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is an important residue for normal gating of MscL in the bacterial cell. The K31D MscL mutation was generated from an M13 construct containing the mscL open reading frame (18Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) using the Sculpture IVM kit (Amersham) employing the following mutating oligonucleotide: GGC ATT CGG GGA TAT TGT CTC T. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing, then subcloned using the pB10a expression construct (5Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Generation of other mutants has been described (26Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All mutants were expressed in the pB10a construct (5Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The mscL-null PB104 bacterial strain (18Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. Nagle S.K. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11652-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was used to host these expression constructs. In all experiments shown, the wild-type control is a PB104 strain containing the p5-2-2 plasmid (pB10a containing the wild-type mscL open reading frame) (5Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). For plate phenotype studies (Fig. 1) and growth for electrophysiological studies (Table I and Fig. 7), cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (LB). For growth and whole cell physiological studies (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4), cells were grown in minimal medium, K10 (27Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): 46 mm Na2HPO4, 23 mmNaH2PO4, 8 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.4 mmMgSO4, 6 μm FeSO4, 1 μg/ml thiamine, 10 mg/ml histidine, leucine, threonine, valine, and isoleucine, 0.2% glucose, 10 mm KCl, and 100 μm ampicillin. K10 was assumed to be 208 mosm. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 1 mm for the induction of wild-type and mutant mscL transcription; normal induction time was 1 h, 2 h for electrophysiological studies. By estimating the number of channels seen by patch clamp in an area of membrane equivalent to that of a single cell, we estimate that there are normally about 10 to 100 functional MscL channels in a normal bacterial cell, absolutely zero in the mscL-null, zero to six in a mscL-null that contains the p5-2-2 expression plasmid but has not been induced by IPTG, and 50 to 200 in a mscL-null containing the p5-2-2 plasmid and has been induced. PB104 without plasmid, with p5-2-2, or with empty plasmid, with or without IPTG, all had similar growth rates, demonstrating that the modest increase in MscL expression in this expression system (about 5 times endogenous levels) had little physiological consequences in normal laboratory conditions. No obvious differences in the number of functional channels per patch were observed between cells expressing the wild-type and mutant MscL; Western analysis has shown previously that the amount of MscL protein in induced cells expressing the wild-type was indistinguishable from the K31E mutant (26Blount P.

After induction of MscL expression for 1 h, 10 ml of culture was harvested by filtration onto a 47-mm diameter 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore). The filter was placed on the wall of a 50-ml conical tube (Falcon) that contained 6–10 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) K0 (46 mmNa2HPO4 and 23 mmNaH2PO4). This tube was then mixed vigorously for 3 to 5 s, and a 1-ml sample was filtered onto a 25-mm diameter 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) and washed with 3 ml of 37 °C K0. For the cells grown in the high osmolarity medium containing NaCl, the NaCl concentration was maintained in the K0 resuspension and wash buffer; no significant osmotic downshock was given. The mixing, filtering, and washing took approximately 20 to 25 s to complete, and therefore the first time point is labeled as 0.4 min. The second time point was taken at 15 min and was again 1 ml of sample filtered and washed. A 15-min time point was chosen because preliminary experiments suggested that a significant percentage of potassium loss that took place over the course of 30 min occurred within the first 10 to 15 min. The potassium efflux assays were designed to measure the decrease of internal potassium due to osmotic downshock and were performed as described previously (22Epstein W. Schultz S.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. All cultures were grown in K10 with 325 mm NaCl, to midlog phase, and induced for 1 h. At harvest, cultures were kept at 37 °C, 1 ml was filtered onto a 25-mm diameter 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter and washed with 3 ml of 37 °C wash solution. The wash solutions contained K0, plus varying concentrations of NaCl. Note that as the concentration of NaCl decreases, the extent of osmotic downshock increases. Under these conditions, increasing the wash solution up to 20 ml had little effect on the values obtained suggesting that there is a phase of very rapid potassium release upon downshock that is essentially complete within the first 3 ml of wash. A normal 3-ml wash took approximately 3 to 5 s. For both the potassium loss and the efflux studies, the filters were placed in a 50-ml plastic beaker and dried at 80 °C to 95 °C overnight, and then the solutes were resuspended in 3 to 4 ml of double-distilled water. The solution was then assayed for potassium by flame photometry (Buck Scientific, PFP7). Cells grown in K10 to midlogarithmic growth were incubated for an additional 1 h induced or uninduced. The OD650 of each culture was determined at harvest, and the cells were serially diluted into LB medium and plated in triplicate onto LB plates containing 100 μm ampicillin. Colony forming units (CFU) were determined per OD650 unit. To determine the viability after downshock, the same procedure was used except that the cells were grown in K10 with 325 mm NaCl, and dilutions were made in K0 with or without 325 mm NaCl; the first dilution of this series was 10 μl of culture into 10 ml of buffer, thus providing the initial osmotic downshock for the cells diluted into buffer not containing NaCl. Giant cells (28Ruthe H.J. Adler J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 819: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were generated and used in patch clamp experiments (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar) as described previously (9Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pipette solution was: 200 mm KCl, 90 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 6.0; the bath solution was the same plus 0.3 msucrose. Pressure was assessed using a pressure transducer (Micro Switch; Omega, Stamford, CT) calibrated by a pneumatic transducer tester (Bio-Tec, Winooski, VT) and is presented normalized to MscS (applied pressure/threshold pressure required to open MscS in the same patch) as previously established (26Blount P.

Data were acquired with 10 kHz filtration and a sampling rate of 30 kHz and analyzed with pCLAMP6 software. Cells expressing one of two site-directed MscL mutants, K31D or K31E, were assayed for a plate phenotype. Because the wild-type and mutated mscL genes were under the transcriptional control of an inducible promoter, expression could be chemically induced by IPTG. As expected, on plates that did not contain IPTG, all cells grew equally well (Fig. 1, left). This growth was comparable to that of the wild-type strains or mscL-null mutants (not shown). However, on plates containing IPTG, the growth of cells expressing the K31D or K31E mutant was severely depressed (Fig. 1, right). No growth retardation was observed on IPTG plates for cells expressing K31R, K31C, or K31I (not shown), suggesting that the plate phenotype observed was due to the charge reversal at the Lys-31 position. Growth rates of cells expressing one of these mutants or wild-type MscL were measured in a liquid medium (Fig.2 A). Induction of expression led to a severe slowed-growth phenotype for cells expressing the mutants but not the wild-type MscL. Interestingly, the slowed-growth phenotype of the mutants in these liquid cultures did not appear as pronounced as on plates, presumably because of differences in the assays. Viability studies demonstrated that the slowed increase in OD650 of liquid cultures expressing the mutants cannot be explained by death of a fraction of the population. In a typical experiment, the number of viable K31E-containing cells prior to induction (1.5 × 108 CFU/OD650 unit) remained the same after 1 h of induction ("

Over the years, cooperative oxygen binding has been explained by different models predicting that the T state of hemoglobin binds oxygen either noncooperatively or with some degree of cooperativity or with strong cooperativity. Therefore, a critical test that discriminates among models is to determine the oxygen binding by the T state of hemoglobin. Fixation of hemoglobin in the T state has been achieved either by crystallization from polyethylene glycol solutions or by encapsulation in wet porous silica gels. Hemoglobin crystals bind oxygen noncooperatively with reduced affinity compared with solution, with no Bohr effect and with no influence of other allosteric effectors. In this study, we have determined accurate oxygen-binding curves to the T state of hemoglobin in silica gels with the same microspectrophotometric apparatus and multiwavelengths analysis used in crystal experiments. The T state of hemoglobin in silica gels binds oxygen noncooperatively with an affinity and a Bohr effect similar to those observed in solution for the binding of the first oxygen molecule. Other allosteric effectors such as inositol hexaphosphate, bezafibrate, and chloride significantly affect oxygen affinity. Therefore, T state hemoglobins that are characterized by strikingly different functional properties share the absence of cooperativity in the binding of oxygen. These findings are fully consistent with the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model and with most features of Perutz's stereochemical model, but they are not consistent with models of both Koshland and Ackers.

These findings are fully consistent with the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model and with most features of Perutz's stereochemical model, but they are not consistent with models of both Koshland and Ackers. Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively with an affinity that is regulated by protons, organic phosphates, chloride, and carbon dioxide (1Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar). These properties are associated to the peculiar structure of the T quaternary state since the R quaternary state exhibits functional properties similar to those of isolated α-β dimers and isolated chains. For this reason, a great effort has been devoted to functionally and structurally characterize the T state and pathway from deoxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin (1Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin.

Karplus M. Poyart C. Bursaux E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1285-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Along this pathway, oxygen binding leads to tertiary conformational changes and to the quaternary transition whose relevance to the functional properties of hemoglobin is model-dependent. In fact, according to the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model (5Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar, 6Shulman R.G. Hopfield J.J.

Biochem. 1975; 44: 209-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), hemoglobin exists in two quaternary states, a low affinity T state and a high affinity R state. Ligand binding to either the T or the R state is predicted to be noncooperative. The progressive shift of the T-R equilibrium in favor of the R state as a function of ligand saturation accounts for the positive cooperativity. The Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model has been extended to include the effect of allosteric ligands on the T state affinity (3Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 8Kister J. Poyart C. Edelstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12085-12091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to fit nanosecond-millisecond kinetics of ligand binding as well as equilibrium data simultaneously (9Henry E.R. Jones C.M. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6511-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extensive investigation of structural, spectroscopic, and functional properties of hemoglobin, carried out by Perutz et al. (3Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem.

Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), has led to the delineation of a stereochemical mechanism of hemoglobin action. According to this mechanism, the binding of oxygen by a hemoglobin subunit in the T state causes tertiary conformational changes that increase the affinity of the other subunits by releasing the constraints on the unreactive quaternary structure. Thus, the oxygen binding by the T state of hemoglobin is predicted to be cooperative (4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 10Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), as also proposed by Koshland et al. (13Koshland D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). Recently, the dimer-tetramer dissociation and the distribution of intermediate ligation states of several artificial systems, including cyanomet derivatives, that should mimic oxygen ligation states, have been carefully analyzed by Ackers and coworkers (14Ackers G.K. Doyle M.L. Myers D.M. Daugherty M.A. Science. 1992; 255: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Holt J.M. Ackers G.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the basis of their findings, a symmetry rule that controls the relationship between the binding affinity and the T to R quaternary transition was proposed. According to this model, the ligand binding within a dimeric half of a T state tetramer is strongly cooperative. However, cyanomet derivatives do not appear to be reliable analogues of intermediate states of oxygenation (16Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Saigo S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4375-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 57Ackers G.K. Perrella M. Holt J.M. Denisov I. Huang Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10822-10829Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The validity of alternative models can be tested by determining accurate oxygen binding curves to the hemoglobin in the T state. The stabilization of the T quaternary state by preventing the T to R transition has been obtained either by the crystallization of deoxyhemoglobin from polyethylene glycol solutions (18Brzozowski A. Derewenda Z. Dodson E. Dodson G. Grabowski M. Liddington R. Skarzinski T. Vallely D. Nature. 1984; 307: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or by the encapsulation of deoxyhemoglobin in wet porous silica gels (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin in the crystal binds oxygen noncooperatively with an affinity 4–40-fold lower than in solution with no Bohr effect and no influence of other allosteric effectors such as inositol hexaphosphate, bezafibrate, and chloride (20Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Eaton W.A. Henry E.R.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin crystals is similar to that measured in solution in the presence of strong allosteric effectors (23Lalezari I. Lalezari P. Poyart C. Marden M. Kister J. Bohn B. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Marden M.C. Bohn B. Kister J. Poyart C. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The absence of the Bohr effect is in keeping with Perutz's stereochemical mechanism (3Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar) and with the three dimensional structures of partially (18Brzozowski A. Derewenda Z. Dodson E. Dodson G. Grabowski M.

Biol. 1990; 256: 775-792Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) showing intact salt bridges. A possible criticism to these studies is that hemoglobin in the crystal might not bind oxygen cooperatively within the T state due to the lattice forces that prevent relevant ligand-induced conformational changes. The encapsulation of deoxyhemoglobin in wet porous silica gels provides a way, which is an alternative to crystallization, of fixing the hemoglobin molecules in the T state (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).

Similar to hemoglobin crystals, wet silica gels contain about 50% water and 50% protein. Weak forces that contrast the quaternary transition are present and are probably associated with the interaction of silanol groups with hemoglobin (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, protein-protein interactions are either absent because the size of the pores is such (<100 Å) (31Dave B.C. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 1120A-1127ACrossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar) that only one hemoglobin tetramer is enclosed in a pore, or, if present, they are random. In the first report on deoxyhemoglobin encapsulated in silica gels by Shibayama and Saigo (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), oxygen was found to bind noncooperatively with an affinity about 2-fold higher than in the crystal. However, the effect of protons and other allosteric effectors was not investigated. In the present work, we have not only determined accurate oxygen-binding curves both in the absence and presence of the allosteric effectors inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate, but also the effect of protons and chloride on the oxygen affinity. Measurements were carried out with the same microspectrophotometric apparatus previously used in the determination of the oxygen binding by hemoglobin crystals (20Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The encapsulation of deoxyhemoglobin in silica gels was carried out following the procedure reported by Shibayama and Saigo (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The silica sol was prepared using tetramethyl orthosilicate according to Ellerby et al. (30Ellerby L.M. Nishida C.R. Nishida F. Yamanaka S.A. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). A solution containing tetramethyl orthosilicate, water and hydrochloric acid was thoroughly mixed in a glass vial and sonicated for 20 min at 4 °C. At this point of the procedure, practically no more tetramethyl orthosilicate is present since the half-time of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is about 2 min (45Brinker C.J. Scherer G.W. Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing. Academic Press, Boston1990Google Scholar). An equal volume of a deoxygenated solution containing 10 mm phosphate, pH 6, was added to the sol and the resulting mixture was further deoxygenated for 40 min at 4 °C. A deoxygenated solution containing 3.6% w/v hemoglobin, 50 mm phosphate, 30 mm dithionite, pH 7.2, was added anaerobically to the sol. The mixture was distributed homogeneously on the wall of the vial. When the gel formed, a solution of 100 mm phosphate, 30 mm dithionite, pH 7, was layered on the gel. The silica wet gels were anaerobically stored at 4 °C. Before measuring, the silica gels were washed once with a fresh solution containing 100 mm phosphate, 30 mm dithionite, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7, four times with a solution containing 100 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 6000 units/ml catalase, pH 8, and then four times with the same solution at the desired pH. The gels were loaded into a Dvorak-Stotler flow cell (46Dvorak J.A. Stotler W.F. Exp. Cell. Res. 1971; 68: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), covered by a gas permeable silicon copolymer membrane. The flow cell was mounted on the thermostatted stage of a Zeiss MPM03 microspectrophotometer (47Rossi G.L. Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rivetti C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A. 1992; 340: 191-207Crossref Google Scholar). The silica gels are optically isotropic and transparent (30Ellerby L.M. Nishida C.R. Nishida F. Yamanaka S.A. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 31Dave B.C. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 1120A-1127ACrossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Unpolarized light was used to record the light transmitted through the gel and the surrounding solution. Spectra were recorded in the wavelength range 480–670 nm at 1-nm intervals using gels that absorb usually less than 1 OD. Oxygen pressures between 0 and 760 torr were prepared by mixing oxygen and helium with a gas mixture generator (Environics, series 200). The gas mixture was humidified by bubbling through a solution containing 100 mm phosphate buffer and passed through the flow cell and then to an oxygen meter. The oxygen electrode was calibrated with three certified oxygen gas mixtures, 1, 5, and 21% and with pure oxygen. The experiments were carried out by first exposing hemoglobin gels either to oxygen or to helium and then to a defined oxygen pressure. Spectra were usually recorded for at least 7 h to monitor both the equilibration with oxygen that is usually completed within 60 min and a slow successive process. The fractional saturation with oxygen and the fractional concentration of oxidized hemes were determined by fitting the complete spectrum to a linear combination of deoxy, oxy, and oxidized hemoglobin spectra (reference spectra) (22Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), recorded in solution, plus a baseline and a slope to take into account the nonperfect optical quality of the gel surface. The absorption spectra of hemoglobin silica gels were recorded as a function of time after the gas, passing through the flow cell where the gel is placed, changed from pure helium to an oxygen pressure of 160 torr (Fig. 1 a). To determine the fractional saturation with oxygen and the fractional concentration of oxidized hemes by using all recorded wavelengths, the spectra were fitted to a linear combination of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and oxidized hemoglobin spectra (reference spectra) plus a baseline and a slope. A representative set of calculated and observed spectra is shown in Fig. 1, b-d. The quality of the fit is such that the two curves are exactly coincident. The change of the fractional saturation with oxygen as a function of time shows a complex kinetics characterized by a fast phase followed by a much slower one (Fig. 1 e). The first phase is associated to the equilibration of the system (humidifier, gas lines, flow cell, and hemoglobin within the silica gel) to the new oxygen pressure. The second slow phase leads to a continuous increase of the fractional saturation and is most probably due to the T to R quaternary transition taking place within the silica gel (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This interpretation is supported by the evidence that the slow phase is absent at fractional saturations lower than about 0.2 (Fig.2). To obtain the fractional saturation of the T state hemoglobin at a defined oxygen pressure without the small contribution arising from the T to R transition, the slow phase was back extrapolated to time 0 assuming a linear dependence (Fig.1 e). The extrapolated value of the fractional saturation with oxygen does not appreciably depend on whether the gel was first equilibrated with helium or oxygen (Fig. 1 e), thus demonstrating the reversibility of the process. This experiment was repeated for nine other oxygen pressures both in the absence and presence of the allosteric effectors inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate (Fig. 2). The binding of oxygen was analyzed by fitting the data to the equation Y =p n /(p n +p 50 n) where p is the oxygen pressure, p 50 is the oxygen pressure at half saturation and n is the Hill coefficient (Fig. 3). The p 50 is 33.6 ± 0.5 torr and 74.2 ± 1.0 torr in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors, respectively. The corresponding Hill plots are shown in Fig. 3,inset. A lower oxygen affinity was found by Shibayama and Saigo (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) possibly due to the limited set of data available and the analysis being carried out at a single wavelength. In solution, under close experimental conditions (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25 °C), the value of K 1, the dissociation constant of the first oxygen that binds to the tetramer, was reported to be 74 torr and 199 torr in the absence and presence of inositol hexaphosphate, respectively (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar). These values, corrected for temperature and pH differences (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar, 12Lee A.W. Karplus M. Poyart C. Bursaux E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1285-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) give a K 1of about 28 torr and 77 torr, indicating that interactions of silanol groups of gels with hemoglobin do not interfere with the modulation of oxygen affinity brought about by these allosteric effectors. The absence of any effect caused by the silica matrix on the structural and functional properties of hemoglobin molecules also holds for the R state of hemoglobin (19Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and for a variety of other proteins including several enzymes (30Ellerby L.M. Nishida C.R. Nishida F. Yamanaka S.A. Dunn B.

A Hill coefficient lower than 1 indicates either a negative cooperativity or a site heterogeneity. The α-subunits exhibit a 2–5-fold higher affinity than β-subunits on the basis of kinetic (48Sawicki C.A. Gibson Q.H.J. J. Biol.

Proteins. 1996; 25: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different oxygen affinities for α- and β-hemes have been structurally explained by the presence in the heme pocket of the β-subunit of Val E11 that obstructs the access of the ligand to the iron (3Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the absence of cooperativity, a value of 0.89 is obtained when a 4-fold difference in oxygen affinity between α- and β-heme is assumed (22Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An analysis of the data reported in Fig. 3, which assumes no cooperativity and two classes of heme sites equally populated, gives an affinity of the α-heme 8.7- and 6-fold greater than the β-heme in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors, respectively. The calculated α-β inequivalencies are much greater than those observed either in solution or in the crystalline state, suggesting that this analysis is oversimplified. In fact, the T state of hemoglobin might possess another source of heterogeneity that should be taken into account. On the basis of the model proposed by Rivetti et al. (22Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), deoxyhemoglobin in solution exists as a distribution of molecules with intact and broken salt bridges that possess low and high oxygen affinities, respectively. An analysis of the oxygen binding curves of hemoglobin in silica gels, with and without allosteric effectors, that assumes a 2–5-fold α-β inequivalence and two distinct populations of hemoglobin molecules with either intact or broken salt bridges does not lead to reliable values due to the limited set of available data. However, when the data were fitted, assuming that (i) the α-subunits with broken salt bridges exhibit a p 50 of 4.1 torr, the value determined for α(Fe2+)2β(Ni2+)2hybrid at pH 8.5 and corrected for temperature difference (51Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Kitagawa T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); (ii) the α-subunits with intact salt bridges exhibit a p 50 of 94 torr, the value determined in hemoglobin crystals (22Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); and (iii) the α-β inequivalence is 2–5-fold, the fraction of sites with broken salt bridges was actually found to decrease from about 50% to 25% in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors, respectively. These results indicate that the T state of hemoglobin in silica gels binds oxygen without any degree of cooperativity, and in conjunction with the results obtained on hemoglobin crystals, limit the validity of most of the models so far proposed to explain the hemoglobin function. Furthermore, they provide evidence that any heme-heme interaction in the T state detected either spectroscopically or crystallographically (4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 25Liddington R. Derewenda Z. Dodson G. Harris D.

Biol. 1990; 256: 775-792Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) does not affect the oxygen affinity of the other subunits. In solution, an important feature associated with the binding of oxygen by the T state of hemoglobin is the release of protons, the so called tertiary Bohr effect (3Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 12Lee A.W. Karplus M. Poyart C. Bursaux E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1285-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This behavior has been explained by the oxygen-induced conformational changes that lead to the breakage of salt bridges (3Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Therefore, a test of the functional integrity of the T state hemoglobin in silica gels is the determination of the effect of protons on the oxygen affinity. We measured the dependence on pH of the fractional saturation with oxygen of hemoglobin silica gels exposed to an oxygen pressure of 40 torr both in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors (Fig.4 a). It was not possible to obtain reproducible data over pH 8 because hemoglobin molecules escape from the silica gel. This behavior might be caused either by an increase of pore size as a function of pH and/or by a pH-dependent dimer-tetramer dissociation with dimers escaping the gel (53Chu A.H. Turner B.W. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 604-617Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Assuming that the Hill coefficient of the T state hemoglobin is pH-independent, the corresponding p 50s were calculated (Fig. 4 b). Oxygen affinity increases about 2-fold between pH 6.3 and 7.5 in the absence of chloride, and 2.7-fold between pH 6.3 and 8.0 in the presence of 200 mm chloride, closely paralleling the effects on K 1 found in solution (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar, 12Lee A.W. Karplus M. Poyart C. Bursaux E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1285-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate, the increase of p 50 over the same pH range is 3.8-fold. In solution, the effect of pH on K 1 in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate is only slightly greater than in its absence, whereas the overall Bohr effect is significantly greater (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar). Furthermore, in hemoglobin silica gels the Bohr coefficient, ΔH+ = d(log p 50)/d(pH), is −0.19 at pH 7.4 in the absence of chloride, −0.35 at pH 7.4 in 200 mmchloride, and −0.55 at pH 7.9 in the presence of 2 mminositol hexaphosphate and 2 mm bezafibrate. In solution, a ΔH+ of −0.28 and −(0.50–0.56) was determined from the dependence of K 1 in 5 mm and 150 mm chloride (12Lee A.W. Karplus M. Poyart C. Bursaux E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1285-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 54Poyart C.F. Bursaux E. Bohn B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 75-8344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Very similar values were determined for the overall Bohr effect (4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 12Lee A.W. Karplus M. Poyart C. Bursaux E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1285-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 54Poyart C.F. Bursaux E. Bohn B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 75-8344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate the value was −(0.7–0.8) (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar, 4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The comparison of these values indicates that the tertiary Bohr effect accounts for most of the protons released upon oxygen binding, which is in agreement with Perutz's stereochemical mechanism (3Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 4Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The difference in the number of Bohr protons released on oxygenation under different experimental conditions indicates that the change of pKs of ionizable residues from the deoxy to the oxy state within a T state is controlled by the binding of other allosteric effectors, as also observed for the overall Bohr effect (55Ho C. Russu I.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6299-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, as noted in solution, the maximal Bohr coefficient of the T state hemoglobin is observed at about pH 6.5 and 7.4 in the absence and presence of chloride, respectively, and at a pH between 7.5 and 8.0 in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate, indicating a progressive shift of pK of the ionizable residues that are linked to oxygenation. The effect of chloride on oxygen affinity has recently been explained by a new kind of allosteric regulation (56Perutz M.F. Shih D.T.-b. Williamson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Chloride decreases oxygen affinity by neutralizing the excess positive charge present in the central cavity of the T state hemoglobin and, consequently, stabilizing the T state. We found that chloride decreases the oxygen affinity of the T state hemoglobin in silica gels by 2-fold (Fig.5), which is close to the 3-fold effect on K 1 in solution (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar). According to the Rivetti et al. (22Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) model, this finding indicates an increase of the population of unliganded T state hemoglobin molecules with intact salt bridges. Indeed, a higher Bohr effect is observed in the presence of chloride than in its absence. The T state of hemoglobin in silica gels is modulated by protons and other allosteric effectors very much in the same way as in solution for the binding of the first oxygen. Therefore, no conformational restriction seems to be imposed by the silica matrix on tertiary conformational changes associated with oxygen binding and effectors regulation. The observed properties unequivocally demonstrate that the T state of hemoglobin binds oxygen noncooperatively in full agreement with that found in crystals of human hemoglobin in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors (20Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Eaton W.A. Henry E.R.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) despite dramatic differences in the oxygen affinity, the Bohr effect, and the influence of other allosteric effectors. The lack of cooperativity of T state hemoglobin is correctly predicted by the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model (5Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar, 6Shulman R.G. Hopfield J.J. Ogawa S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1975; 8: 325-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Edelstein S.J.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which indicates a 36-fold increase of the oxygen affinity within the α1β1 dimer in the T state, as well as with any model that postulates ligand-induced changes of oxygen affinity within the T state (3Perutz M.F.

https://openalex.org/W2006528333,"A key step by which tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signals the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK, also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase or JNK) is the recruitment to the TNF receptor of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). However, the subsequent steps in TRAF2-induced SAPK and NF-κB activation remain unresolved. Here we report the identification of a TNF-responsive serine/threonine protein kinase termed GCK related (GCKR) that likely signals via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) to activate the SAPK pathway. TNF, TRAF2, and ultraviolet (UV) light, which in part uses the TNF receptor signaling pathway, all increased GCKR activity. A TRAF2 mutant, which inhibits both TRAF2-induced NF-κB and SAPK activation, blocked TNF-induced GCKR activation. Finally, interference with GCKR expression impeded TRAF2- and TNF-induced SAPK activation but not that of NF-κB. This suggests a divergence in the TNF signaling pathway that leads to SAPK and NF-κB activation, which is located downstream of TRAF2 but upstream of GCKR."

Expression of the N terminus of MEKK1 lacking the kinase domain increases activation of endogenous JNK/SAPK by MEKK1. The data are consistent with a model in which MEKK1-JNK/SAPK binding facilitates the receipt of signals from upstream inputs and localizes JNK/SAPK to intracellular targets of the pathway. The c-Jun N-terminal-kinase/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK/SAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase; MAP/ERK, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; MEKK1, MEK kinase 1; HA, hemagglutinin; PAK, p21-activated kinase; NIK, NCK-interacting kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MDCK cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; 293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells; GSH, glutathione; GST, glutathione S-transferase. were originally discovered as activities enhanced by exposure of cells to cycloheximide (1Kyriakis J.M.

One of them replaces the function of a MEK involved in dorsal closure in Drosophilaembryogenesis (10Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.A. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

Numerous regulators upstream of the MEKs in the JNK/SAPK pathway have been identified although it has been difficult to assess their physiological roles.

Most of these upstream regulators of the JNK/SAPK pathway appear to be constitutively active. MEKK1 was the first of these to be identified (13Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 15Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro, it phosphorylates several MEK family members that lead to activation of not only JNK/SAPKs but also ERKs and p38 in reconstituted systems (25Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the restricted specificity of MEKK1 in vivo are unexplored. By cDNA cloning, we determined that MEKK1 contains a long, noncatalytic N terminus of nearly 1200 residues with several potential protein-association domains (15Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This N-terminal region binds to putative upstream kinases, such as NIK (20Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this report, we assessed the ability of this portion of MEKK1 to bind to a downstream MAP kinase, JNK/SAPK. pGEX-KX/rMEKK1 30–220 was constructed by ligation of a 575-base pair SacI fragment of MEKK1 encoding residues from 30 to 220 to SacI-digested pGEX-KX, which was modified from pGEX-KG (Invitrogen). pGEX-KG/rMEKK-C was constructed by ligation of a NcoI-XhoI fragment of rMEKK1 that covers the entire catalytic domain to pGEX-KG digested with NcoI and XhoI. pCEP4HA/rMEKK-N was constructed by deleting a 1.4-kilobase EcoRV-BamHI fragment encoding the kinase domain from pCEP4HA/rMEKK1. pCEP4HA/p38 and pCMV5/rMEKK1 were constructed as described (15Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). pCMV5HA/rMEKK-C was provided by Jeff Frost University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 293 cells were transfected and lysed in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin if not specifically indicated. Confluent MDCK cells were starved in serum-free medium for 20–24 h and exposed to ultraviolet (UV)-C for 2 min at 1 J/s/m2. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free medium for 1 h and then lysed in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EGTA, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmDTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation in a microfuge at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for immune complex kinase assays or Western blots. Cell lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. The beads were washed twice with 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, and once with 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl. To assay the activities associated with MEKK1 peptides, cell lysates were incubated with peptide-coupled Sepharose. MEKK1 peptides (P1, EWLERRNRRGPVVVKPIPIK; P3, TPPRRAPSPDGFSPYSPEET; P4, LSPGLRDVAVRCLELQPQDR; and P5, RADWRRQQLRKVRSVELD) were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Sigma) as described (15Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Sepharose subjected to the same coupling procedure without peptide was used as a control. 300 μg of lysate protein was incubated with Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. The beads were washed twice with 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, and once with 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl. c-Jun kinase activity associated with beads was detected by a standard kinase assay. In the inhibition experiments, 200 μg of lysate protein from UV-stimulated MDCK cells was incubated with soluble peptides at concentrations of 0, 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg/ml (0–2.3 mm) at 4 °C for 5 h. Then, P1-Sepharose was incubated with the lysates at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed and kinase activity was determined as above. Transfected 293 cells were lysed by homogenization in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). Clarified lysates were incubated with glutathione (GSH)-agarose or used for anti-HA immunoprecipitation. After 1–2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with cold lysis buffer for 20–30 min at 4 °C with constant rotation. 10 μg of GST, GST-rMEKK1 30–220, or GST-rMEKK-C (1175–1493) was immobilized on GSH-agarose in the presence of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, then incubated with His6-SAPKαI at 0.2 mg/ml in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed six times with 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl. GST-rMEKK-C was expressed from pGEX-KG/rMEKK-C and purified from bacteria as described (15Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Synthetic 16–20 amino acid peptides derived from MEKK1 (Fig. 1 A) were coupled to Sepharose beads to probe their capacity to bind to JNK/SAPKs and other MAP kinase family members in cell lysates. Activity that phosphorylated N-terminal sites on c-Jun from lysates of MDCK cells and other cell lines including 293 cells (data not shown) exposed to UV light or other stress stimuli (data not shown) bound to immobilized peptide P5 as well as it bound an anti-JNK/SAPK polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 1 B). Activity associated with the P5-beads following incubation with lysates of UV-exposed cells was nearly 60-fold greater than activity on P5-beads incubated with lysates of untreated cells, consistent with the extent of activation of JNK/SAPK by exposure to UV light. A second peptide P1 also bound c-Jun kinase activity in lysates (Fig.1 C) as effectively as P5, but other MEKK1 or irrelevant control peptides or beads coupled without peptide did not (Fig. 1,B and C). c-Jun kinase activity bound to P1- or P5-Sepharose was not removed with 0.5 m NaCl but could be competed with unbound peptide; soluble P1 reduced c-Jun kinase activity associated with P1-beads in a concentration dependent manner, but P3 peptide was a poor competitor of this binding (Fig. 1 D). The properties of the c-Jun kinase activity suggested that it was derived from JNK/SAPK. To determine if JNK/SAPK accounted for the activity bound to the beads, proteins associated with MEKK1 peptide-coupled beads were immunoblotted with an anti-JNK/SAPK antiserum (Fig.2). Both 54 and 46 kDa isoforms of JNK/SAPK were detected on P5-beads incubated with stimulated or control lysates. When the antiserum was incubated with recombinant SAPK protein, the immunoreactive bands (p54 and p46) disappeared, indicating that they represent JNK/SAPK isoforms (Fig. 2 A). JNK/SAPKs also bound to P1-beads but not P3-beads or beads without peptide, in agreement with the activity assays (Fig. 2 B). Little or no immunoreactivity was detected on the beads with antibodies to ERKs or p38, under conditions where signals from all three types of kinases in cell lysates were nearly equivalent (data not shown). In addition, no detectable MEK or MEKK activities were detected on P1- or P5-coupled Sepharose following incubation with lysates (not shown). Consistent with the activity assay (Fig. 1 D), the JNK/SAPK bands associated with P1-beads were lost upon incubation with soluble P1 as the competitor but were retained during incubation with P3 as the competitor (Fig. 2 C). The association of JNK/SAPK with MEKK peptides is likely direct since recombinant SAPK-αI binds to P1- and P5- Sepharose (not shown). Therefore, the association of c-Jun phosphorylating activity with peptide-coupled beads parallels JNK/SAPK binding. This supports the conclusion that JNK/SAPK accounts for the UV-stimulated, c-Jun kinase activity associated with P1- and P5-coupled beads. In vitro recombinant SAPK-αI bound to a fragment of MEKK1 that includes the P1 and P5 peptides (residues 30–220; Fig.3 A) but not to a fragment (residues 1175–1493) containing only the protein kinase domain. In examining the interaction of JNK/SAPK with MEKK1 fragments, we found that the JNK/SAPK-binding fragment, residues 30–220, was highly phosphorylated by activated SAPK-αI in vitro (Fig.3 B), although peptides P1 and P5 themselves did not contain any candidate JNK/SAPK phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation of the JNK/SAPK binding fragment of MEKK1 by JNK/SAPK further suggests that the two proteins interact in cells. Phosphorylation of MEKK1 by JNK/SAPK may have a regulatory impact if, for example, phosphorylation alters the affinity of the JNK/SAPK-MEKK1 association. However, under the conditions of our assays, we detected no difference in their association as a function of JNK/SAPK activation state. The capacity of MEKK1 and JNK/SAPK to coimmunoprecipitate was evaluated. MEKK1 was expressed alone or with HA-JNK1 (Fig.4 A). As a control, HA-p38 was coexpressed with MEKK1. MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody. MEKK1 was detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates, if HA-JNK1 was expressed, but not in the absence of HA-JNK1. Negligible coimmunoprecipitation of MEKK1 was detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates if HA-p38 was coexpressed with it (Fig.4 A). We further investigated whether the N-terminal region of MEKK1 coprecipitates with JNK/SAPK. The N terminus of MEKK1 (HA-MEKK-N), residues 1–1197, was expressed separately or with GST-SAPKβ in 293 cells (Fig. 4 B). Transfected cells were lysed, and either MEKK-N was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody or GST-SAPKβ was precipitated with glutathione beads. Coprecipitated proteins were analyzed by probing with anti-MEKK1 or anti-JNK/SAPK antibodies. MEKK-N was bound to glutathione beads when coexpressed with GST-SAPKβ but not in the absence of GST-SAPKβ (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). GST-SAPKβ was present in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates only if HA-MEKK-N (Fig.4 B, upper panel) was expressed. Thus, multiple isoforms of JNK/SAPK, but not p38, are associated with MEKK1 in transfected 293 cells. A catalytic domain fragment of MEKK1 neither coimmunoprecipitates with JNK/SAPK from transfected cells (not shown) nor binds to JNK/SAPKs in vitro (Fig. 3 A), indicating that it does not contain a JNK/SAPK binding domain. Since JNK/SAPK binds to the N terminus of MEKK1, we compared the capacities of transfected MEKK1 and its catalytic domain, MEKK-C, to activate endogenous JNK/SAPKs (Fig.5 A). Measurable activation of JNK/SAPK was detected in immune complex assays upon transfection of 50 ng of DNA of either MEKK1 or MEKK-C; however, equivalent or greater increases were induced by MEKK-C at each DNA amount (Fig.5 A). Western blotting the lysates with anti-active JNK/SAPK confirmed these findings (Fig. 5 B). MEKK1 and MEKK-C also activate coexpressed JNK1 equally well (data not shown). To explore the possible function of the observed association, MEKK-N was expressed in 293 cells to determine its effects on the activity of endogenous JNK/SAPK. Interestingly, MEKK-N alone caused a dose-dependent increase in JNK/SAPK activity present in anti-JNK/SAPK immune complexes (Fig. 5 C). Similar results were obtained when MEKK-N was cotransfected with HA-JNK1 (not shown). In addition, cotransfection of MEKK-N with small amounts of full-length MEKK1 potentiated JNK/SAPK activation. Activity of endogenous JNK/SAPK (Fig. 5 C) or cotransfected HA-JNK1 (not shown) was greater than that caused by the sum of either MEKK-N or full-length MEKK1 alone. These findings suggest a role for the N terminus of MEKK1 in regulating the JNK/SAPK pathway although it is not required for JNK/SAPK activation when MEKK1 is overexpressd. We have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of MEKK1 binds directly to its downstream MAP kinase, JNK/SAPK. MEKK1-derived peptides extract JNK/SAPK activity from cell lysates as effectively as anti-JNK/SAPK antibodies. JNK/SAPK binds to an N-terminal fragment (residues 30–220) of MEKK1 in vitro. Transfected MEKK1 coimmunoprecipitates with multiple JNK/SAPK isoforms in cells. In comparison, p38 MAP kinase interacts poorly with MEKK1, indicating the specificity of MEKK1 association with JNK/SAPKs. Complex formation exists widely in signaling processes and has been found to be an important mechanism to facilitate signal transduction and maintain signaling specificity (27Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Marcus S. Polverino A. Barr M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the pheromone mating factor pathway of budding yeast, three kinases in the MAP kinase module, Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3/Kss1, form a complex through binding to a scaffolding protein, Ste5p. This is essential to the function of the pathway. Our data indicate the existence of a complex between MEKK1 and a MAP kinase in mammalian cascades, which is likely to be important for the function of the cascade. Since the C-terminal half of MEKK1 also binds to MEK4/SEK1, 2J. Kyriakis, personal communication. it will be interesting to investigate whether the three kinases in the MAP kinase module form a complex simultaneously. In transfected cells, the association of MEKK1 and JNK/SAPK is not required for JNK/SAPK activation since the kinase domain alone, which does not bind to JNK/SAPK, activates JNK/SAPK as well as does full-length MEKK1. However, under limiting conditions within the cell, the binding of endogenous JNK/SAPK to endogenous MEKK1 may be essential for activation of the pathway by MEKK1. Interestingly, we found that the N terminus of MEKK1 causes a small but significant activation of endogenous JNK/SAPK. Because the transfection efficiency is approximately 20%, the fold activation of JNK/SAPK by MEKK-N is underestimated. The mechanism by which the N terminus of MEKK1 increases JNK/SAPK activity is not clear at present. One possibility is that MEKK-N binds and colocalizes a portion of endogenous JNK/SAPK with upstream regulators which activate them. A previous study has shown that MEKK1 binds a putative upstream kinase, NIK, at its N terminus (20Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We also find that the N terminus of MEKK1 binds to α-actinin, an actin-binding protein. 3L. Christerson and M. Cobb, unpublished observations. Apparently, the long, non-catalytic region at its N terminus provides binding sites for several proteins with different functions. Perhaps the function of the association of MEKK1 with multiple kinases in the cascade is to hold different components together to facilitate signal transduction and to localize a portion of these kinases to a particular site in cells. For example, the binding of the total JNK/SAPK to MEKK1 may direct a small fraction of JNK/SAPK to the cytoskeleton, among the presumed intracellular targets of the JNK/SAPK pathway. Interaction of MEK4/SEK1 with another actin-binding protein ABP280 has been reported to be important for activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway by tumor necrosis factor-α (30Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C.

Apparently, the N terminus of MEKK1 is involved in many binding events with both upstream and downstream kinases as well as proteins outside the cascade. Elucidation of the function and physiological significance of these binding events will be extremely important to understand the function and regulation of MEKK1.

https://openalex.org/W2016840017,"Laminin-1, a major component of basement membranes, consists of three different chains designated α1, β1, and γ1 and has diverse biological functions. We have identified cell binding sites on the mouse laminin γ1 chain, using systematic screening of 165 overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire chain. We identified 12 cell binding sequences using HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma and B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells in two independent assays employing peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated dishes. Four peptides (C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68) located on the globular domains of the γ1 chain were the most active and showed dose-dependent cell attachment. Cell attachment to C-68 was inhibited by EDTA and by anti-α2β1integrin antibodies. Cell attachment to C-16 and C-64 was partially inhibited by EDTA but was not inhibited by anti-integrin antibodies. EDTA and anti-integrin antibodies did not affect cell attachment to C-28. The four peptides were tested in adhesion and differentiation assays with endothelial, neuronal, and human salivary gland cells. C-16 was the most active for all of the cells, whereas the other three peptides showed cell type specificity in their activities. The active core sequences of C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68 are YVRL, IRVTLN, TTVKYIFR, and SIKIRGTY, respectively. These sequences are highly conserved among the different species and in the laminin γ2 chain. These results suggest that the specific sequences on the laminin γ1 chain are biologically active and interact with distinct cell surface receptors. Laminin-1, a major component of basement membranes, consists of three different chains designated α1, β1, and γ1 and has diverse biological functions. We have identified cell binding sites on the mouse laminin γ1 chain, using systematic screening of 165 overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire chain. We identified 12 cell binding sequences using HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma and B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells in two independent assays employing peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated dishes. Four peptides (C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68) located on the globular domains of the γ1 chain were the most active and showed dose-dependent cell attachment. Cell attachment to C-68 was inhibited by EDTA and by anti-α2β1integrin antibodies. Cell attachment to C-16 and C-64 was partially inhibited by EDTA but was not inhibited by anti-integrin antibodies. EDTA and anti-integrin antibodies did not affect cell attachment to C-28. The four peptides were tested in adhesion and differentiation assays with endothelial, neuronal, and human salivary gland cells. C-16 was the most active for all of the cells, whereas the other three peptides showed cell type specificity in their activities. The active core sequences of C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68 are YVRL, IRVTLN, TTVKYIFR, and SIKIRGTY, respectively. These sequences are highly conserved among the different species and in the laminin γ2 chain. These results suggest that the specific sequences on the laminin γ1 chain are biologically active and interact with distinct cell surface receptors. Laminin-1, a major component of the basement membrane matrix, has multiple biological activities including promotion of cell adhesion, spreading, growth, neurite outgrowth, tumor metastasis, and collagenase IV secretion (1Martin G.R.

The most extensively characterized laminin, laminin-1 (M r = 900,000) from the mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor consists of α1, β1, and γ1 chains, which assemble into a triple-stranded cross-like structure with a coiled-coil domain at the long arm (6Engel J.

Recently, we identified five cell binding sequences in the mouse laminin α1 chain C-terminal globular domain, G domain (positions 2111–3060), by systematic peptide screening using overlapping peptide-polystyrene beads and free peptides.Although the laminin γ1 chain is present in most laminin isoforms except for laminin-5 (5Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M. Deutzmann R. Ekblom P. Engel J. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Meneguzzi G. Paulson M. Sanes J. Timpl R. Tryggvason K. Yamada Y. Yurchenco P.D. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), little is known about its functions or biologically active sites. One of the functions of the laminin γ1 chain is binding to entactin/nidogen, a basement membrane-specific protein, through epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HUVEC, human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell; HSG, human submandibular gland; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HUVEC, human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell; HSG, human submandibular gland; BSA, bovine serum albumin.-like repeats located on its short arm (19Mayer U.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The laminin γ1 chain has also been found to be important for neurite outgrowth (21Wujek J.R. Haleem-Smith H. Yamada Y. Lipsky R. Lan Y.T. Freese E. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 55: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Active sites on the γ1 chain have not been well characterized, and only one sequence on its C-terminal region has been identified as active for neurite outgrowth (22Liesi P. Narvanen A. Soos J. Sariola H. Snounou G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Murtomäki S. Risteli J. Risteli L. Koivisto U.-M. Johansson S. Liesi P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).In this paper, we describe the identification of cell binding sequences on laminin γ1 chain using systematic peptide screening. We examined the cell attachment activities of 165 different peptides by two separate assays using peptide-conjugated beads and peptide-coated plastic plates. Twelve active sequences were identified from the two assays. Four of the peptides showed strong cell attachment activities. Several additional biological activities were also evaluated for the four most active peptides, and attempts were made to determine if the cellular receptors were integrins.DISCUSSIONHere we have employed a systematic peptide screening for identification of cell binding sequences from the laminin γ1 chain. We prepared 165 overlapping peptides and tested their cell binding activities by two separate assays using peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated plates. Six of the peptides showed cell attachment activities on both assays, while other six peptides were active only in the peptide-coated plate assay. C-64 and C-68 showed strong cell attachment activity on the peptide-coated plates, but these peptides were not active in the Sepharose bead assay. C-64 and C-68 contain a lysine residue within their active core sequences. It is possible that the peptides were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads through their ε-amino groups in the lysine residues and this eliminated the cell attachment activity. We showed previously an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) (38Piershbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 301: 30-33Crossref Scopus (2837) Google Scholar) containing 12-mer peptide derived from fibronectin was active in the Sepharose bead assay, but this peptide was not active in the peptide-coated plate assay (29Nomizu M. Song S.Y. Kuratomi Y. Tanaka M. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay is advantageous for determining the cell binding activity of small peptides, which might not bind to the plastic or have the right conformation when bound to plastic. We conclude that the combination of the two separate assay systems is necessary for the identification of cell attachment activity of small peptides.Previously, an octapeptide, Arg-Asn-Ile-Ala-Glu-Ile-Ile-Lys-Asp-Ile (RNIAEIIKDI), derived from the C-terminal region of the γ1 chain was found to promote neurite outgrowth (22Liesi P. Narvanen A. Soos J. Sariola H. Snounou G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Murtomäki S. Risteli J. Risteli L. Koivisto U.-M. Johansson S. Liesi P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). While the C-163 peptide contained most of that sequence except for the arginine residue, it was not active in our cell attachment assay using neuronal cells. 2S. K. Powell, M. Nomizu, H. K. Kleinman, and Y. Yamada, unpublished results. It is possible that the N-terminal arginine is important for biological activity. The Leu-Arg-Glu (LRE) sequence from laminin β2 chain has been shown to bind neuronal cells and inhibit neurite outgrowth (39Hunter D.D. Shah V. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 40Hunter D.D. Porter B.E. Bulock J.W. Adams S.P. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 905-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the laminin γ1 chain, there are two LRE sequences. Two peptides, C-103 and C-130, contain LRE sequence, but HT-1080 and B16-F10 cells did not attach to both the peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and the peptide-coated plates. The C-103 and C-130 peptides may be able to interact with only certain types of neuronal cells.The EGF-like repeats of the γ1 chain have been reported to bind to nidogen/entactin through short peptide sequences (19Mayer U. Nischt R. Poschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 20Poschl E. Fox J.W. Block D. Mayer U. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Peptides C-81, C-82, C-83, and C-84 (residues 829–878), which contained the corresponding region of the entactin/nidogen binding sites, were not active in our cell attachment assays. Recently, the mouse laminin γ2 chain was found to bind to fibulin 2 through the SADFSVHKI sequence (residue 199–207) in domain IV (41Utani A. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2814-2820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The corresponding peptides (C-50, residue 503–514, TNAVGYSVYDIS) in the γ1 chain did not show cell attachment activity. These observations suggest that the matrix protein binding sites on the laminin γ1 chain are not involved in cell attachment.It is interesting that the most active sequences identified here are located on globular domains (Fig. 7), with C-16 and C-28 located on the first globular domain (domain VI) and C-64 and C-68 located on the second globular domain (domain IV). These results suggest that the globular regions of the γ1 chain may play a critical role for cell binding.We attempted to learn more about the cellular receptors for the four major active peptides of the γ1 chain using EDTA and integrin antibodies. Cell attachment to C-68 was blocked by both EDTA and integrin antibodies against β1 and α2. It is likely that cell adhesion to C-68 is mediated via α2β1 integrin. Attachment to C-16 and C-64 were partially inhibited by EDTA, whereas C-28 was not affected. Heparin completely inhibited attachment to C-28 and partially inhibited attachment to C-16 and C-64. 3M. Nomizu, unpublished results. Thus, complex interactions involving multiple ligands are involved in the binding of C-16, C-28 and C-64 to cells.We have studied the cell type specificity of the four most active peptides using endothelial, neuronal, and salivary gland cells (TableIII). C-16 was active with all three cell types, while C-28, C-64, and C-68 showed cell type specificity. Previously, we also showed that the G domain peptides have cell type-specific activity for different neuronal cells (42Takagi Y. Nomizu M. Gullberg D. MacKrell A.J. Keene D.R. Yamada Y. Fessler J.H.

Cell Res. 1996; 228: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that laminin interacts specifically with various cellular receptors through different domains.Four major cell attachment active sequences of the mouse laminin γ1 chain are completely conserved in the human laminin γ1 chain (44Kallunki T. Ikonen J. Chow L.T. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). Furthermore, domain IV peptides (C-64 and C-68) are highly conserved among mouse (45Sugiyama S. Utani A. Yamada S. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Eur. J.

The active core sequences of C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68 each contained one arginine residue, and these arginine residues were conserved among the corresponding peptides. These corresponding regions of C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68 in the other laminin γ chains may also have similar cell binding activities.Figure 8Comparison of amino acid sequences of the active peptides.

Nature. 1989; 338: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 40Hunter D.D. Porter B.E. Bulock J.W. Adams S.P. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 905-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the laminin γ1 chain, there are two LRE sequences. Two peptides, C-103 and C-130, contain LRE sequence, but HT-1080 and B16-F10 cells did not attach to both the peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and the peptide-coated plates. The C-103 and C-130 peptides may be able to interact with only certain types of neuronal cells.The EGF-like repeats of the γ1 chain have been reported to bind to nidogen/entactin through short peptide sequences (19Mayer U.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Peptides C-81, C-82, C-83, and C-84 (residues 829–878), which contained the corresponding region of the entactin/nidogen binding sites, were not active in our cell attachment assays. Recently, the mouse laminin γ2 chain was found to bind to fibulin 2 through the SADFSVHKI sequence (residue 199–207) in domain IV (41Utani A. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2814-2820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The corresponding peptides (C-50, residue 503–514, TNAVGYSVYDIS) in the γ1 chain did not show cell attachment activity. These observations suggest that the matrix protein binding sites on the laminin γ1 chain are not involved in cell attachment.It is interesting that the most active sequences identified here are located on globular domains (Fig. 7), with C-16 and C-28 located on the first globular domain (domain VI) and C-64 and C-68 located on the second globular domain (domain IV). These results suggest that the globular regions of the γ1 chain may play a critical role for cell binding.We attempted to learn more about the cellular receptors for the four major active peptides of the γ1 chain using EDTA and integrin antibodies. Cell attachment to C-68 was blocked by both EDTA and integrin antibodies against β1 and α2. It is likely that cell adhesion to C-68 is mediated via α2β1 integrin. Attachment to C-16 and C-64 were partially inhibited by EDTA, whereas C-28 was not affected. Heparin completely inhibited attachment to C-28 and partially inhibited attachment to C-16 and C-64. 3M. Nomizu, unpublished results. Thus, complex interactions involving multiple ligands are involved in the binding of C-16, C-28 and C-64 to cells.We have studied the cell type specificity of the four most active peptides using endothelial, neuronal, and salivary gland cells (TableIII). C-16 was active with all three cell types, while C-28, C-64, and C-68 showed cell type specificity. Previously, we also showed that the G domain peptides have cell type-specific activity for different neuronal cells (42Takagi Y. Nomizu M. Gullberg D. MacKrell A.J. Keene D.R. Yamada Y. Fessler J.H.

These findings suggest that laminin interacts specifically with various cellular receptors through different domains.Four major cell attachment active sequences of the mouse laminin γ1 chain are completely conserved in the human laminin γ1 chain (44Kallunki T. Ikonen J. Chow L.T. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). Furthermore, domain IV peptides (C-64 and C-68) are highly conserved among mouse (45Sugiyama S. Utani A. Yamada S. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and human (46Kallunki P. Sainio K. Eddy R. Byers M. Kallunki T. Sariola H. Beck K. Hirvonen H. Shows T.B. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) laminin γ2 chains (Fig. 8). The active core sequences of C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68 each contained one arginine residue, and these arginine residues were conserved among the corresponding peptides. These corresponding regions of C-16, C-28, C-64, and C-68 in the other laminin γ chains may also have similar cell binding activities. Here we have employed a systematic peptide screening for identification of cell binding sequences from the laminin γ1 chain. We prepared 165 overlapping peptides and tested their cell binding activities by two separate assays using peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated plates. Six of the peptides showed cell attachment activities on both assays, while other six peptides were active only in the peptide-coated plate assay. C-64 and C-68 showed strong cell attachment activity on the peptide-coated plates, but these peptides were not active in the Sepharose bead assay. C-64 and C-68 contain a lysine residue within their active core sequences. It is possible that the peptides were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads through their ε-amino groups in the lysine residues and this eliminated the cell attachment activity. We showed previously an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) (38Piershbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 301: 30-33Crossref Scopus (2837) Google Scholar) containing 12-mer peptide derived from fibronectin was active in the Sepharose bead assay, but this peptide was not active in the peptide-coated plate assay (29Nomizu M. Song S.Y. Kuratomi Y. Tanaka M. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead assay is advantageous for determining the cell binding activity of small peptides, which might not bind to the plastic or have the right conformation when bound to plastic. We conclude that the combination of the two separate assay systems is necessary for the identification of cell attachment activity of small peptides. Previously, an octapeptide, Arg-Asn-Ile-Ala-Glu-Ile-Ile-Lys-Asp-Ile (RNIAEIIKDI), derived from the C-terminal region of the γ1 chain was found to promote neurite outgrowth (22Liesi P. Narvanen A.

Res. 1992; 32: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). While the C-163 peptide contained most of that sequence except for the arginine residue, it was not active in our cell attachment assay using neuronal cells. 2S. K. Powell, M. Nomizu, H. K. Kleinman, and Y. Yamada, unpublished results. It is possible that the N-terminal arginine is important for biological activity. The Leu-Arg-Glu (LRE) sequence from laminin β2 chain has been shown to bind neuronal cells and inhibit neurite outgrowth (39Hunter D.D. Shah V. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R.

A tunable diode is reported based on a hybrid inorganic-organic, n -indium phosphide|poly- (pyrrole)|nonaqueous electrolyte architecture. By electrochemically manipulating the work function of the conjugated polymer poly(pyrrole), the turn-on voltage (more precisely, the forward bias potential required to pass a particular current) of the diode can be continuously and actively tuned by more than 0.6 volt. The work highlights a distinguishing feature of conjugated polymers relative to more traditional semiconductor materials, namely, the ability of dopant ions to permeate conjugated polymers, thereby enabling electrochemical manipulation."

To defend themselves against microbial attack, plants induce upon perception of microbial signal molecules the production of various antimicrobial substances such as hydrogen peroxide, hydrolytic enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Alternatively, some of these defense molecules are constitutively produced in certain specialized cell types or tissues. One particular family of antimicrobial peptides, occurring in different plant species, is the plant defensins. The plant defensins are small (45–54 amino acids), basic, and have a complex three-dimensional folding pattern, stabilized by eight disulfide-linked cysteines (reviewed in Refs. 1Broekaert W.F.

According to the morphogenic effects caused on treated fungal hyphae, plant defensins can be divided into two different subgroups namely “morphogenic” plant defensins, including Hs-AFP1 1The abbreviations used are: AFP, antifungal peptide; AMP, antimicrobial peptide; CCCP, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; Boc-Met-NHS,t-butoxycarbonyl-l-methionine N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester. from Heuchera sanguinea and Rs-AFP2 from Raphanus sativus, which cause reduced hyphal elongation with a concomitant increase in hyphal branching, and “nonmorphogenic” plant defensins, including Dm-AMP1 from Dahlia merckii, Ah-AMP1 from Aesculus hippocastanum, and Ct-AMP1 from Clitoria ternatea, which slow down hyphal extension but do not induce marked morphological distortions (6Osborn R.W. De Samblanx G.W. Thevissen K. Goderis I. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Attenborough S. Rees S.B. Broekaert W.F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Treatment of hyphae of Neurospora crassa with either of the antifungal plant defensins Rs-AFP2 or Dm-AMP1 induces a series of rapid membrane responses, including K+ efflux, Ca2+ uptake, alkalinization of the incubation medium, and membrane potential changes (7Thevissen K.

In contrast with insect (8Cociancich S. Ghazi A. Hétru C. Hoffmann J.A. Letellier L. J. Biol.

Therefore, it seems likely that these membrane responses are initiated through interaction with a receptor that may either transduce a signal to endogenous ion channels in the membrane or, alternatively, facilitate insertion of the plant defensin into the membrane with subsequent ion channel formation (7Thevissen K.

Our results point to the presence of specific binding sites for plant defensins that have properties expected for plant defensin receptors.

Briefly, N. crassa mycelium was digested with β-glucuronidase (type H1, Sigma) and subsequently homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem-type glass tissue grinder with a Teflon pestle (Arthur H. Thomas Co., Philadelphia). The homogenate was subjected to a series of subsequent centrifugation steps as follows: 1000 × g for 10 min (with recovery of the supernatant); 15,000 × g for 30 min (with recovery of the supernatant); 12,000 × g for 30 min (with recovery of the supernatant) and 40,000 ×g for 40 min (with recovery of the pellet). The final pellet was suspended in 1 mm Tris-EGTA (pH 7.5), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. This fraction contains microsomes that are mainly derived from the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. The specific ATPase activity of this faction was approximately 40 μmol of phosphate released in 1 h at 30 °C per mg of protein in the absence of Na3VO4 (a plasma membrane ATPase inhibitor), and the ATPase activity was inhibited for 80% in the presence of 0.02 mmNa3VO4. ATPase activity was measured as described previously (17Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Total protein in the membranes was determined after addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v), using the bicinchoninic acid assay (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujitomo E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Plant defensins were radiolabeled using Boc-[35S]Met-NHS at 30 Tbq/mmol (Amersham Int.). For each labeling reaction 9.5 Mbq was aliquoted into small glass vials and the solvent removed by passing a stream of nitrogen over the surface. Ten μl of peptide solution (2.5 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris borate buffer (pH 8.5)) was added to the glass vial on ice, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min. One ml of 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6) was added to the reaction mixture, which was subsequently applied to a 1 ml of HiTrap S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) previously equilibrated in 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6). The column was washed with 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6) until all the unincorporated label was removed from the column (about 5 ml of buffer). The labeled peptide was then eluted from the column with 500 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6), and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Five μl of each fraction was added to liquid scintillant and counted in a liquid scintillator counter (Wallac 1410, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and the fractions with the highest counts were pooled. Labeled peptides were stored frozen at −20 °C. In parallel with the radiolabeling reaction, equal aliquots of the peptide solutions were allowed to react with unlabeled Boc-Met-NHS (Bachem) and subjected to chromatography on a HiTrap S-Sepharose column. After the chromatography step, eluate fractions were freeze-dried and redissolved in distilled water, and the protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujitomo E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) with the unlabeled plant defensins as standard. This allowed us to estimate the protein concentration in the final labeled peptide solutions and hence to calculate their specific radioactivity. Specific activities of the labeled peptides were typically around 1 Tbq/mmol. To produce cold-labeled peptides for determination of the antifungal activity, 200 μl of peptide solution (2.5 mg/ml in 0.1 mTris borate buffer (pH 8.5)) was added to 100 μg of Boc-Met-NHS on ice and incubated for 20 min. Trifluoroacetic acid was applied to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 0.1%, and the mixture was separated by high pressure liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column (C2/C18 silica, 25 × 0.93 cm, Pharmacia) using a linear gradient from 0 to 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks containing the unmodified peptide were identified based on comparison of their retention time with those of the purified native peptides separated under identical conditions. Peak fractions containing labeled peptides were collected, dried in a rotating vacuum concentrator to remove the solvents, and redissolved in distilled water. The specific antifungal activity of labeled peptides was compared with that of native peptides in the antifungal activity assay described above. For binding studies with N. crassa hyphae, N. crassa was grown at an inoculum density of 3 × 105 spores/ml as described previously (7Thevissen K. Ghazi A. De Samblanx G.W. Brownlee C. Osborn R.W. Broekaert W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15018-15025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The medium consisted of potato dextrose broth (12 g/liter, Difco). After 20 h of incubation at 22 °C, 80-μl aliquots of the N. crassa culture were incubated, unless stated otherwise, with 3 pmol of [35S]Hs-AFP1 (∼1.2 TBq/mmol) either with or without appropriate concentrations of competing antifungal peptides in a total volume of 100 μl in siliconized polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Sigma) at 22 °C. Total protein in the N. crassa cultures was measured after homogenization by high speed reciprocal shaking in the presence of 10% (w/v) 400–600-μm glass beads (Sigma) in a Fastprep apparatus (Bio 101/Savant, Farmingdale, NY). Protein measurement was done by the bicinchoninic acid method (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujitomo E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Total protein content in N. crassa cultures was approximately 1.8 mg of protein/ml. For binding studies with microsomal membranes, 2-μl aliquots of a membrane suspension containing 1.6 mg of protein/ml were incubated with 3 pmol of [35S]Hs-AFP1 in a total volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm MES, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.2)) in siliconized polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes at 4 °C. After incubation for the times indicated, the samples were transferred to wells of a MultiScreen Durapore 96-well filtration plate (0.65-μm pore size, Millipore, Bedford, MA). After filtration using a MultiScreen vacuum filtration manifold (Millipore), harvested hyphae or microsomal membranes were washed three times with 100 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. Filters with the hyphae or microsomal membranes were punched out manually with MultiScreen punch tips (Millipore), suspended in scintillation mixture (Ready Safe scintillation mixture, Analis, Gent, Belgium), and counted for 35S in a Liquid Scintillation Counter. Nonspecific binding was determined as the amount of radioactivity bound in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled Hs-AFP1. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Reduction of Hs-AFP1 was performed by the addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 100 mm dithioerythritol, followed by incubation at 45 °C for 1 h. Reagents were removed on a disposable reversed phase C8 silica column (Bond Elut, 500 mg solid phase, Varian). The C8 silica column was subsequently rinsed with 6 ml of distilled water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The reduced peptide was eluted from the latter column with 5 ml of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Protein fractions (monitored by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm) were vacuum dried and redissolved in distilled water. As in previous studies on binding sites for glycopeptides (19Basse C.W. Fath A. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14724-14731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chitin fragments (20Baureithel K. Felix G. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17931-17938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have chosen to use sulfur-35 in the form of Boc-[35S]Met-NHS as a radioactive isotope to label two different morphogenic plant defensins, namely Rs-AFP2 and Hs-AFP1 from R. sativus and H. sanguinea seed, respectively. To test the effect of the labeling reaction on the antifungal activity of these plant defensins, nonradioactive Boc-Met-NHS was linked to the peptides, and the specific antifungal activity of the modified peptides was assayed in an antifungal activity assay. The antifungal activity against the fungus N. crassa of modified Rs-AFP2 was reduced by more than 4-fold compared with that of unmodified native Rs-AFP2, whereas modified and unmodified Hs-AFP1 had essentially the same activity, irrespective of whether the activity was tested in a potato dextrose growth medium with or without addition of 1 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl (TableI). In addition, modified and unmodified Hs-AFP1 had essentially the same antifungal potency against three other fungal species with different sensitivities to Hs-AFP1. Therefore, Hs-AFP1 was chosen for labeling with Boc-[35S]Met-NHS, and this radiolabeled derivative, hereafter called [35S]Hs-AFP1, was used in subsequent binding studies.Table IAntifungal activity of Hs-AFP1 and Hs-AFP1 modified with Boc-Met-NHS (Boc-Met-IIsAFP1) on pregerminated fungal sporesFungusGrowth medium1-aGrowth medium A is potato dextrose broth (12 g/liter, Difco) and growth medium B is potato dextrose broth (12 g/liter) including 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl.IC50(μg/ml)1-bConcentration required for 50% inhibition of fungal growth as defined under “Experimental Procedures.”Hs-AFP1Boc-Met-HsAFP1N. crassaA45N. crassaB88A. brassisicolaA77A. brassisicolaB1820B. cinereaA7565B. cinereaB>100>100F. culmorumA1210F. culmorumB25281-a Growth medium A is potato dextrose broth (12 g/liter, Difco) and growth medium B is potato dextrose broth (12 g/liter) including 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl.1-b Concentration required for 50% inhibition of fungal growth as defined under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab [35S]Hs-AFP1 was found to bind to both living N. crassa hyphae and microsomal membrane fractions derived from this fungus. To investigate whether this binding activity was specific, [35S]Hs-AFP1 was added to either N. crassa hyphae or microsomal membranes together with increasing concentrations of native unlabeled Hs-AFP1. Binding of [35S]Hs-AFP1 to either N. crassahyphae or microsomal membrane preparations could be competed by about 95 and 98% in the presence of 1 and 10 μm of excess unlabeled peptide, respectively (Fig.1). To assess further the specificity of binding of 35S-labeled Hs-AFP1, the ability of different antifungal peptides to compete with [35S]Hs-AFP1 was tested, both on N. crassahyphae and microsomal membranes. The antifungal peptides used in this experiment were Ah-AMP1, Dm-AMP1, and Ct-AMP1, isolated from seed of horse chestnut (A. hippocastanum), dahlia (D. merckii), and C. ternatea, respectively, which belong to the nonmorphogenic plant defensins (6Osborn R.W.

As a result of this amino acid substitution, Rs-AFP2(Y38G) is only weakly active against N. crassa in a low ionic strength medium and is totally inactive in the presence of 1 mmMgCl2 or 1 mm CaCl2, whereas Rs-AFP2 is equally active in the absence or the presence of 1 mm divalent cations (11De Samblanx G.W.

Binding of [35S]Hs-AFP1 to hyphae and microsomal membranes (Fig.2, A and B) could be competed to some extent by the plant defensins Rs-AFP2, Ah-AMP1, Dm-AMP1, and Ct-AMP1, but in all these cases, competition was weaker compared with competition by Hs-AFP1 itself. Competition of [35S]Hs-AFP1 binding by all plant defensins, except Hs-AFP1 itself, was stronger with hyphae than with microsomal membranes. Interestingly, no significant competition with [35S]Hs-AFP1 binding was observed for Rs-AFP2(Y38G), the inactive single amino acid variant of the plant defensin Rs-AFP2. In addition, none of four different cysteine-rich antifungal peptides (Mj-AMP1, Ac-AMP1, Ace-AMP1, and Ib-AMP4), each belonging to a class that is structurally unrelated to plant defensins (2Broekaert W.F.

It was also observed that binding of [35S]Hs-AFP1 to microsomal membranes, but not to hyphae, was stimulated by Mj-AMP1 and Ib-AMP4 at concentrations of 10 μm or above (Fig.2 B). It has previously been shown that plant defensins lose their antifungal activity upon reduction of their disulfide bridges (3Terras F.R.G. Schoofs H.M.E. De Bolle M.F.C. Van Leuven F. Rees S.B.

Reduced Hs-AFP1 at 40 μm was unable to compete with binding of [35S]Hs-AFP1 to N. crassa hyphae. Addition of 20 mm MgCl2 to the binding assay reduced binding of [35S]Hs-AFP1 to N. crassa hyphae by over 95% (results not shown). Association kinetics of binding of Hs-AFP1 to N. crassa hyphae and microsomal membranes was determined by incubation of [35S]Hs-AFP1 for increasing periods. Dissociation was initiated after 30 min of incubation by addition of an excess of unlabeled Hs-AFP1. Incubation of [35S]Hs-AFP1 with N. crassa hyphae and microsomal membranes resulted in rapid binding of the radioligand, and half-maximal binding occurred within 1 min (Fig.3, A and B). Addition of 10 μm unlabeled Hs-AFP1 30 min after addition of the radioligand resulted in rapid (but partial) dissociation of radioligand binding, indicating reversibility of [35S]Hs-"

Previous electrical measurements suggested that cations like quinine, quinidine, and cyanine 863, which have been classified as type 2 cations in the liver, are also transported by rOCT1, since they may induce inward currents in rOCT1 expressing Xenopus oocytes (Busch, A.

Tracer flux measurements with oocytes and with stably transfected human embryonic kidney cells showed that [3H]quinine and [3H]quinidine are not transported by rOCT1. The voltage dependence observed for the quinine- or quinidine-induced inward currents in rOCT1-expressing oocytes, and tracer efflux measurements indicate that the inward currents by type 2 cations are generated by the inhibition of electrogenic efflux of transported type 1 cations. Therefore, rOCT1 cannot contribute to transport of type 2 cations in the liver and the hepatic transporter for type 2 cations remains to be identified.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When TEA, choline, MPP, or dopamine was added to the bath of rOCT1 expressing oocytes, inward currents were induced, and it was concluded that the uptake of these cations is electrogenic. Electrical measurements were also performed with the more hydrophobic cations, quinine, quinidine, d-tubocurarine, and cyanine 863 (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In transport measurements with isolated rat hepatocytes, these cations had been previously classified as type 2 cations, and it had been postulated that these cations were translocated by a separate transport system to the more hydrophilic type 1 cations like TEA and choline (15Groothuis G.M.M. Meijer D.K.F. J. Hepatol. 1996; 24: 3-28PubMed Google Scholar, 16Elferink R.P.J.O. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Groothuis G.M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 215-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Since, in rOCT1 expressing oocytes, large inward currents were also induced by quinine, quinidine,d-tubocurarine, and cyanine 863, it was proposed that rOCT1 translocates type 1 and type 2 cations (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) to a similar extent. The present paper disproves this hypothesis. Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of rOCT1 cRNA per oocyte as described before (1Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H.

Tracer uptake and efflux experiments were performed as described earlier (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Initial efflux rates were estimated from monoexponential curves that were fitted to the data. For electrical measurements the oocytes were permanently superfused with fresh solution at room temperature (∼3 ml/min, 22–24 °C). For the determination of current-voltage relations, steady-state current was measured during the last 100 ms of 500-ms voltage pulses to different potentials in the absence and presence of the agonist. The averages of the currents before and after agonist application were subtracted from the currents during agonist application. HEK 293 cells were transfected and selected as described (3Busch A.E.

A stably transfected single clone was isolated and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin. Suspended cells were incubated 0, 1, 3, and 5 s at 37 °C in the presence of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.6 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4 (PBS) plus the radioactively labeled cations without or with 40 μmcyanine 863 (3Busch A.E.

The short term incubations with [3H]MPP showed linearity for only 1 s. [3H]Quinine (0.56 TBq/mmol) and [3H]quinidine (0.54 TBq/mmol) were obtained from Biotrend (Köln, Germany) and 1-[3H]methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (3.1 TBq/mmol) from E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. (Dreieich, Germany). Geneticin G418 was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, Germany). The other chemicals were obtained as described earlier (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S.

We determined the uptake of radioactively labeled quinine and quinidine after expression of rOCT1 in Xenopusoocytes and in HEK 293 cells. Fig. 1shows an experiment in which the time course of the cyanine 863-inhibitable uptake of [3H]MPP and [3H]quinine was measured in water-injected control oocytes and in rOCT1 cRNA-injected oocytes employing cation concentrations around their apparent K i values, as determined for inhibition of TEA uptake in rOCT1 cRNA-injected oocytes (1Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). After 1-h incubation of the rOCT1-injected oocytes with 14 μm [3H]MPP, we measured a cyanine-inhibitable uptake of 73.5 ± 3.1 pmol/oocyte, which showed substrate saturation (2Busch A.E. Quester S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and was trans-stimulated about 2-fold when the oocytes had been preincubated with 1 mm choline (data not shown). After 1-h incubation of rOCT1-injected oocytes with 0.3 μm [3H]quinine in the absence and presence of 36 μm cyanine 863, 1.3 ± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.1 pmol/oocyte were found associated with the oocytes, respectively. This small amount of cyanine-inhibitable quinine uptake did not increase with larger concentrations, but (because of increased unspecific uptake) was not detected with quinine concentrations larger than 3 μm. Since the cyanine-inhibitable uptake of 0.3 μm quinine was not stimulated by preincubation of the oocytes with 1 mm choline and was partially removed by extensive (30 min at 19 °C) washing of the oocytes (data not shown), it probably represents quinine binding to rOCT1, which might appear increased if endocytosis occurred during the 1-h incubation with 0.3 μm [3H]quinine. The initial uptake rates of 14 μm [3H]MPP, 0.3 μm [3H]quinine, and 2 μm[3H]quinidine were also compared in stably transfected and in nontransfected HEK 293 cells. TableI shows that no cyanine-inhibitable uptake of 0.3 μm [3H]quinine or 2 μm [3H]quinidine was detected, whereas a significant cyanine inhibitable uptake of 14 μm[3H]MPP was measured in the transfected cells. Also with 3 μm [3H]quinine or 20 μm[3H]quinidine no significant cyanine-inhibitable uptake could be observed (data not shown). The data show that rOCT1 does not translocate quinine and quinidine at a detectable rate. Trying to understand why quinine induces large inward currents (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) without being transported, we tested whether quinine and other type 2 cations may inhibit an rOCT1 mediated efflux of cations from the oocytes. Fig. 2 shows efflux experiments with [3H]MPP, which were performed with rOCT1-injected and water-injected oocytes (control). As reported earlier (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), it was found that rOCT1-induced MPP efflux is observed when no organic cations were present in the bath and is trans-stimulated by extracellular MPP. Fig. 2 also shows that rOCT1-mediated efflux of [3H]MPP is trans-inhibited by quinine, d-tubocurarine, and cyanine 863. Inhibition was also observed for quinidine (data not shown). The stimulatory trans-effect of MPP on the initial efflux rate and the inhibitory trans-effects of the type 2 cations were significant (p < 0.05, see legend of Fig. 2). This suggests that the transporter loaded with type 2 cations exhibits a much slower (if at all) reorientation to its inward conformation than the unloaded transporter, supporting the notion that rOCT1 does not significantly translocate type 2 cations.Table IAttempt to measure transport of quinine and quinidine after expression of rOCT1 in an eukaryotic cell lineTransport measurementUptake raterOCT1-transfectedNontransfectedpmol × mg protein−1 × s−1MPP without cyanine2.1 ± 0.40.01 ± 0.01MPP with cyanine0.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.01Quinine without cyanine0.01 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.01Quinine with cyanine0.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.02Quinidine without cyanine0.3 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.1Quinidine with cyanine0.4 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 a shows a typical current recording from an oocyte that had been preincubated for 18 h with 1 mm choline and was clamped at −50 mV. As reported earlier (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) quinine (10 and then 100 μm) induced a large inward current in these oocytes, which might suggest that quinine is transported. Surprisingly, the following application of choline led to a drastically decreased signal which recovered slowly. Fig. 3 b shows a current recording from the same oocyte, which was maintained at a holding potential of −100 mV. Whereas the choline-induced signal increased slightly at this more negative potential, the quinine-induced signal disappeared virtually completely, although it is obvious from the following decreased choline-induced signal that quinine has interacted with rOCT1. Next we tested the response to quinine on rOCT1-injected oocytes that were not preincubated with choline. By the application of quinine at concentrations that inhibited the choline-induced currents almost completely, only small and transient inward currents were induced at a holding potential of −50 mV. Fig. 3c shows a typical experiment in which 3 μm quinine and/or 5 mm choline were added to the bath. From the onset observed for quinine inhibition of the choline induced current, and from the slow recovery of the choline current after quinine removal, we estimated a k off for the dissociation (∼0.015 s−1) and a k on for association of quinine (∼3 × 104m−1 × s−1). This leads to a K 0.5 of ∼0.5 μm for quinine-induced inhibition of the choline current, which is in good agreement with earlier flux and electrical measurements (2Busch A.E. Quester S. Ulzheimer J.C. Waldegger S. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. Lang F. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32599-32604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Very similar results to quinine were obtained with the other type 2 cations quinidine, cyanine 863 and d-tubocurarine (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the difference current voltage dependence obtained by current measurements before, during, and after superfusion of rOCT1-expressing oocytes with saturating concentrations of choline or quinine. When the rOCT1-expressing oocytes without choline preincubation in Fig. 4 a were superfused with 5 mm choline, inward difference currents were obtained that increased with increasingly negative membrane potential, i.e. the current voltage relationship showed a positive slope, as expected for electrogenic transport of choline. After superfusion of these oocytes with 100 μm quinine, a much smaller difference current with negative slope and a reversal potential at ∼−70 mV was observed, contrary to what would be expected for electrogenic transport of quinine. Preincubating, however, rOCT1-expressing oocytes with 1 mm choline resulted in different current voltage relationships (Fig. 4 b). Here the currents induced by superfusion with choline were independent of the membrane potential, whereas the quinine-induced current voltage relationship showed a steep negative slope, as expected for quinine-induced inhibition of electrogenic choline efflux. The electrical data confirm our conclusion from the flux measurements that the type 2 cation quinine is not significantly transported by rOCT1, but is a potent inhibitor of rOCT1-mediated electrogenic influx and efflux of the type 1 cation choline. Tracer influx and efflux measurements performed in Xenopus oocytes and stably transfected eukaryotic cells showed that the type 1 cations TEA, choline,N 1-methylnicotinamide, MPP, and dopamine are transported by rOCT1, rOCT2, and hOCT2. Electrical measurements with voltage-clamped oocytes indicated that the cation transport is potential-dependent and electrogenic ((2, 3, 6, 14). 3P. Arndt, C. Volk, V. Gorboulev, G. Nagel, T. Friedrich, S. Gambaryan, and H. Koepsell, unpublished data. Since rOCT1 is localized in the basolateral membranes of rat hepatocytes, we wondered whether rOCT1 may mediate the two previously distinguished cation transport activities in isolated hepatocytes,i.e. the transport of small relatively hydrophilic type 1 cations like choline, and the transport of larger, more hydrophobic type 2 cations like quinine (17Mol W.E.M.

In an attempt to detect rOCT1-mediated transport of nonradioactively labeled type 2 cations, rOCT1 expressing Xenopus oocytes, preincubated with 1 mm choline and clamped at −50 mV, were superfused with type 2 cations and inward currents of similar magnitude to those obtained with TEA or choline were found (2Busch A.E.

The present study shows that these results could only be obtained in a limited voltage range (see Fig. 4). We now demonstrate that the type 2 cations quinine, quinidine, cyanine 863, and d-tubocurarine are inhibitors of cation transport by rOCT1 and are not significantly translocated themselves. We suggest that the quinine-induced current is generated by the inhibition of electrogenic choline efflux through rOCT1. In hepatocytes rOCT1 is responsible for electrogenic uptake of type 1 cations over the basolateral membrane, whereas type 2 cations are taken up by a different nonidentified transport system. In renal proximal tubules type 1 cations may be translocated over the basolateral membrane by OCT2 and in the rat also by rOCT1, 4U. Karbach, F. Meyer-Wentrup, and H. Koepsell, unpublished data. whereas no functional evidence for a type 2 cation transporter has been presented (14Koepsell H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 243-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our electrical measurements show that rOCT1 does not only mediate influx of type 1 cations into epithelial cells but may also mediate their electrogenic efflux. Further experiments with excised giant patches (20Hilgemann D.W. Pfluegers Arch. 1989; 415: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Nagel G. Möckel B. Büldt G. Bamberg E.

https://openalex.org/W1996543949,"We have isolated a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan from mouse brain by affinity chromatography with a fragment of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R (TN-R) that comprises the amino-terminal cysteine-rich stretch and the 4.5 epidermal growth factor-like repeats. The isolated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan has a molecular mass of 500–600 kDa and carries the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope. Treatment with chondroitinase ABC reveals a major band of approximately 400 kDa and two minor bands at 200 and 150 kDa. Immunoblot analysis relates the molecule to phosphacan but not to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans neurocan and versican. Binding of the phosphacan-related molecule to the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of TN-R is Ca2+-dependent. Co-localization of the molecule with TN-R in the retina and optic nerve by immunocytochemistry suggests a functional relationship between the two molecules in vivo. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons by the phosphacan-related molecule in vitro is neutralized by TN-R when coated as a uniform substrate. Furthermore, the phosphacan-related molecule neutralizes growth cone repulsion induced by TN-R coated as a sharp substrate boundary with or without prior treatment with chondroitinase ABC. These observations indicate that TN-R can interact with a phosphacan-related molecule and thereby modulate its inhibitory influence on neuritogenesis."

The sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases controls progression through the cell cycle (1Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).

The cyclosome, or anaphase-promoting complex (APC), 1The abbreviations used are: APC, anaphase-promoting complex; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase. is a highly conserved multisubunit protein complex that recently has been shown to catalyze the ubiquitination of cyclin B, a necessary step to trigger its degradation by the 26 S proteasome pathway during telophase (6King R.W.

Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). APC is required not only to exit M phase but also at an earlier stage to allow the initiation of anaphase. APC is activated at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and apparently catalyzes the ubiquitination of several non-cyclin substrates; inhibition of APC leads to metaphase arrest (8Holloway S.L. Glotzer M. King R.W. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 9Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P.

In budding yeast it was demonstrated that PDST1, an inhibitor of chromosome segregation, was a good substrate for APC-dependent ubiquitination (10Yamamoto A. Guacci V. Koshland D. J.

Destruction of this inhibitor is an obligatory step for anaphase to occur in yeast, and a similar requirement is likely in other organisms. Therefore, by targeting specific substrates for degradation at different stages of M phase, APC controls the progression and completion of mitosis (6King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar).

Indeed, in yeast it has been demonstrated that association between two APC subunits, CDC23 and CDC27, is dependent upon at least part of the TPR domain of each protein (17Lamb J.R. Michaud W.A. Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies in HeLa cells have shown that a portion of the cellular pool of CDC16 and CDC27 localizes to the spindle/centrosome throughout M phase, where it most likely acts as part of APC to catalyze the ubiquitination of diverse factors (9Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrates that some subunits of XenopusAPC (CDC16, CDC23, and CDC27) become phosphorylated in M phase. Moreover, it was shown that only the phosphorylated form of APC was able to catalyze the ubiquitination of B-type cyclins and that this activity was abolished by phosphatase treatment of M phase-purified APC in a reconstituted system (16Peters J.M. King R.W. Hoog C. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be discovered which kinases and phosphatases control these regulatory phosphorylations and dephosphorylations of APC. PP5 is a recently discovered okadaic acid-sensitive, serine/threonine phosphatase whose substrates and biological functions are unknown and which is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (24Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 25Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1996; 218: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The main structural distinction of PP5 compared with other serine/threonine phosphatases lies in the presence of a TPR domain, containing four repeats, located NH2-terminal to the catalytic domain (24Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,27Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have shown that this TPR domain of PP5 is in fact important as an interface for protein/protein interactions. A direct interaction has been characterized between this TPR domain and the kinase-like domain of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (25Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Additionally, a direct in vivo interaction between PP5 and the chaperone protein Hsp90 was shown to involve the TPR domain of PP5 (28Chen M.-S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M.-S. Owens-Grillo J.K. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16224-16230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies indicate that PP5 is part of a large heterocomplex involved in the maturing process of steroid receptors. The presence of PP5 in this complex, which also includes Hsp90, the small acidic protein p23, and TPR-containing immunophilins, suggests that PP5 may be intimately involved in protein folding. In an effort to determine whether PP5 may be involved in regulating the activity of APC, we have examined its physical interaction with two subunits of APC (CDC16 and CDC27) which are phosphorylated during M phase. We show that PP5 is in fact able to associate with CDC16 and CDC27 through their respective TPR domains. Furthermore, epitope-tagged PP5 can localize to the mitotic spindle where CDC16 and CDC27 have been shown to be present (9Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PP5 may be involved in the regulation of APC activity. All constructs were made using standard techniques. Each construct was sequenced to verify the correct frame as well as the proper sequence of any linker introduced during the cloning procedure. The two-hybrid plasmids (pBTM116, pVP16, and pLexA-lamin) were generous gifts from S. Hollenberg and J. A. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) (30Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 31Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To facilitate the construction of the multiple two-hybrid constructs used in this report, the polylinker region of the pBTM116 and the pVP16 plasmids was remodeled to make three different versions of pBTM116 or pVP16 (A, B, and C), differing in-frame at the BamHI site and containing an additional NotI site. The LexA-lamin fusion (human lamin C amino acids 66–230 in pBTM116) used as a negative control has been described elsewhere (30Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). PEX5 fused to VP16 was a generous gift from S. Subramani (University of California, San Diego) and was used as an unrelated TPR-containing protein control for the two-hybrid experiments. All CDC16 and CDC27 constructs were derived from the human full-length CDC16 and CDC27 cDNAs in pBluescript, pSTU65, and pSTU16, respectively, and were generous gifts from P. Hieter (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). A full-length mouse PP5 cDNA was isolated from a macrophage λ-Zap library (kindly provided by Dr. Chris Glass, University of California, San Diego), using a probe encoding part of the NH2-terminal TPR domain of PP5, and both strands of the longest clone were completely sequenced. The PP5 full-length cDNA subcloned in pBluescript SK (pMW0551/2 and 069) was used to generate all mouse PP5-derived constructs of this study. A version of mouse PP5 with a COOH-terminal VSV-G-tag (32Kreis T.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), designated PP5-tag, was engineered by ligating a pair of complementary oligonucleotides between a PstI site in the COOH terminus of PP5 and a BamHI in pMW0551/2 resulting in pMW059. These oligonucleotides reconstitute the COOH terminus of PP5 and extend it with the VSV-G-tag and a stop codon. The resulting PP5-tag was then subcloned into a pCDNA3 vector in the XbaI and EcoRI sites, creating pVO120. A nearly full-length cDNA encoding Xenopus PP5 was isolated from an oocyte cDNA library with a mouse PP5 probe (TPR domain only) using low stringency hybridization conditions. The longest Xenopus PP5 cDNA was fully sequenced on both strands. To make GST fusion constructs, the BamHI/EcoRI fragment of CDC27 (amino acids 295–823) was cut out from LexA-CDC27(295–823) and ligated into pGEX-KG to generate GST-CDC27(295–823). Similarly, the CDC27 BglII/EcoRI fragment (amino acids 537–823) was cloned into pGEX-3X to generate GST-CDC27(537–823). The two-hybrid interaction assays were done according to previously published protocols using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 (30Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 31Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As an initial step, each LexA fusion was tested against VP16 alone to determine whether it could activate the transcription of the reporter genes HIS3 and LACZ, in which case it was eliminated from further study. Similarly, each VP16 fusion was assayed with a LexA-lamin fusion control. Plasmids encoding a fusion between the DNA binding domain LexA and the construct of interest were cotransformed in the L40 strain with a plasmid encoding a fusion between the activation domain VP16 and a second protein of interest. After growth of the double transformants on selective media (−Trp, −Leu plates), several individual transformants were tested for their ability to activate the transcription of the two integrated reporter genes HIS3 and LACZ. An interaction was scored positive based on the ability to activate transcription of the HIS3 reporter gene, based on whether yeast colonies were able to grow on −His plates after 3–5 days at 30 °C. The ability to activate the LACZreporter was also checked by a filter assay as described (30Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). VSV-G-tagged PP5 (PP5-tag) from pVO120 (BamHI/ClaI) was inserted into SLP10 baculovirus vector, and recombinant full-length PP5-tag was expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus as described (33Blanc S. Cerutti M. Chaabihi H. Louis C. Devauchelle G. Hull R. Virology. 1993; 192: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To check for expression of PP5-tag, aliquots of PP5-tag Sf9 extracts and SLP10 Sf9 extracts (mock) were analyzed by immunoblotting using the P5D4 antibody. A band of 58 kDa corresponding to PP5-tag was detected in the PP5-tag baculovirus-infected cells but not in the mock-infected cells. These PP5-tag extracts were then used for in vitro binding assays. The synthesis of GST-CDC27(295–823) and GST-CDC27(537–823) in Y1090 cells was induced for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 18 ml of TEDG buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C, and washed once in binding buffer (8 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Beads were then incubated with 5 μl of unfractionated whole cell extracts of Sf9 cells expressing PP5-tag in 400 μl of binding buffer containing 1% milk. After 2 h of rotating at 4 °C, the binding reactions were washed three times in the same binding buffer with no milk. Beads were finally resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and the products of the binding reaction were resolved by 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose and blocking (in 5% milk, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.02% Tween 20), the membrane was immunoblotted with an anti-VSV-G-tag antibody (P5D4, 1/1,000 dilution), then with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1/3,000 dilution), and detected by ECL treatment (Amersham). The membrane was reprobed with anti-CDC27 antibody (9Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) (1/2,000 dilution) followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1/4,000 dilution) to check for the presence of the expected GST-CDC27 fusions. COS-1 cells were transfected as described (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate precipitation. After 20 h, cells were refed and grown an additional 20–24 h. Cells were fixed using fresh 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 m glycine, and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. Coverslips were incubated with the primary antibody (P5D4, 1/1,000 dilution), directed against the VSV-G-tag, then with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse antibody, 1/750 dilution). When double labeling was performed, cells previously treated as above were then incubated with rat anti-tubulin antibody (1/500 dilution) and Texas red anti-rat antibody (Biomeda Corp., 1/500 dilution). Coverslips were mounted on slides with 100 mmTris, pH 8.0, 90% glycerol, 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine, containing Hoechst dye 33342 (1 μg/ml) to detect DNA. PP5 is a serine/threonine phosphatase that contains an NH2-terminal TPR domain with four repeats (Fig.1 A). The sequence of human and rat PP5 has been reported elsewhere (24Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E.

Fig. 1 B presents an alignment of PP5 protein sequences, including human (24Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22586-22592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse, and Xenopus (this study; GenBank accession numbers AF018262 and AF018263, respectively). The high degree of homology observed among the PP5 sequences from four vertebrates demonstrates that this phosphatase is highly conserved, not only in the COOH-terminal phosphatase domain but also in the NH2-terminal TPR domain thought to be responsible for determining the specificity of interacting proteins. To investigate whether PP5 may interact with some TPR proteins belonging to APC, fusion proteins were constructed using the two-hybrid system vectors pBTM116 and pVP16. Fig.2 summarizes the constructs used in this study for PP5, CDC16, and CDC27. Each full-length or deletion construct was fused independently either to the LexA DNA binding domain (in pBTM116), or to the VP16 activation domain (in pVP16). Interactions were tested by cotransformation in the S. cerevisiae strain L40, containing the two reporter genes, HIS3 and LACZ, which are under the control of upstream LexA operating sequences. As shown in Fig. 3, full-length PP5(1–499) strongly interacts with CDC16(2–619), CDC27(2–823), and CDC27(237–823) fusions. The TPR domain alone, PP5(4–165), was sufficient for strong interaction with CDC16 and CDC27, demonstrating that the phosphatase domain of PP5 is not required for this association. In general, these interactions were observed regardless of whether the TPR domain of PP5 was assayed as a fusion with the VP16 activation domain or as a fusion with the LexA DNA binding domain (Fig.3 and Tables I and II). Other investigators recently demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation that CDC16 interacts with CDC27 in yeast (17Lamb J.R. Michaud W.A. Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We exploited this reported interaction as a positive control and demonstrated that human CDC16(2–619) interacts with human CDC27(2–823) (Fig. 3 and TableIII). Furthermore, deleting the three NH2-terminal TPR of CDC16 (CDC16(142–619)) did not affect its binding to CDC27(2–823) (Table III). In contrast, deleting the NH2-terminal 294 amino acids of CDC27 abrogates the interaction with CDC16(142–619), suggesting that the NH2-terminal region of CDC27 (containing a single TPR) is important for binding to CDC16.Table IPP5/CDC27 two-hybrid interactionsLexA fusionsVP16 fusionsInteractionL-PP5(4–165)V-CDC27(2–823)+L-PP5(4–165)V-CDC27(295–823)+L-PP5(4–165)V-CDC27(537–823)−L-PP5(4–165)V-CDC27(2–294)−L-PP5(4–165)V-CDC27(2–536)−L-PP5(4–165)V-CDC27(295–536)−L-PP5(1–499)V-CDC27(2–823)+L-PP5(1–499)V-CDC27(295–823)+L-PP5(1–499)V-CDC27(537–823)−L-PP5(1–499)V-CDC27(2–294)−L-PP5(1–499)V-CDC27(2–536)−L-CDC27(295–536)V-PP5(4–165)−L-CDC27(295–823)V-PP5(4–165)+L-CDC27(295–823)V-PP5(1–499)+ Open table in a new tab Table IIPP5/CDC16 two-hybrid interactionsLexA fusionsVP16 fusionsInteractionL-PP5(4–165)V-CDC16(2–619)−L-PP5(4–165)V-CDC16(142–619)+L-PP5(1–499)V-CDC16(2–619)−L-PP5(1–499)V-CDC16(142–619)+L-CDC16(2–619)V-PP5(4–165)+L-CDC16(2–619)V-PP5(1–499)+L-CDC16(142–619)V-PP5(1–165)+L-CDC16(142–619)V-PP5(1–499)+ Open table in a new tab Table IIICDC16/CDC27 two-hybrid interactionsLexA fusionsVP16 fusionsInteractionL-CDC16(2–619)V-CDC27(2–823)+L-CDC16(142–619)V-CDC27(2–823)+L-CDC16(142–619)V-CDC27(295–823)−L-CDC16(142–619)V-CDC27(537–823)−L-CDC16(142–619)V-CDC27(2–294)−L-CDC16(142–619)V-CDC27(2–536)−L-CDC16(2–619)V-CDC16(2–619)−L-CDC16(142–619)V-CDC16(142–619)−L-CDC27(295–823)V-CDC16(2–619)−L-CDC27(295–823)V-CDC27(2–823)−L-CDC27(295–823)V-CDC27(295–823)−L-CDC27(295–823)V-CDC27(537–823)−L-CDC27(295–823)V-CDC16(142–619)− Open table in a new tab To confirm the specificity of the PP5 interaction with CDC16 and CDC27, we examined the PP5 TPR domain for its ability to interact with another member of the TPR family, the peroxisomal receptor protein PEX5, which contains eight TPR (36McCollum D. Monosov E. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 37Dodt G. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). When assayed in the two-hybrid system as LexA fusion proteins, the TPR domain of PP5 was unable to interact with PEX5 fused to the VP16 activation domain (Fig. 3 and Table IV). Similarly, there was no interaction between different CDC16 or CDC27 LexA fusions and VP16-PEX5 (Fig. 3 and Table IV). These results suggest that PP5, CDC16, and CDC27 do not bind indiscriminately to all TPR-containing proteins and that the interactions of PP5 with the two subunits of APC examined here represent specific protein/protein interactions.Table IVControl two-hybrid interactionsLexA fusionsVP16 fusionsInteractionL-PP5(4–165)VP16−L-PP5(1–499)VP16−L-CDC27(295–823)VP16−L-CDC27(295–536)VP16−L-CDC16(2–619)VP16−L-LAMINVP16−L-LAMINV-PP5(4–165)−L-LAMINV-PP5(1–499)−L-LAMINV-CDC27(2–823)−L-LAMINV-CDC27(295–823)−L-LAMINV-CDC27(537–823)−L-LAMINV-CDC27(2–294)−L-LAMINV-CDC27(2–536)−L-LAMINV-CDC27(295–536)−L-LAMINV-CDC16(2–619)−L-LAMINV-CDC16(142–619)−L-LAMINV-PEX5−L-PP5(4–165)V-PEX5−L-PP5(1–499)V-PEX5−L-CDC27(295–823)V-PEX5−L-CDC27(295–536)V-PEX5−L-CDC16(2–619)V-PEX5−L-CDC16(142–619)V-PEX5− Open table in a new tab A series of constructs was made to delineate further the region of interaction between PP5 and CDC16 and CDC27. A deletion of the three NH2-terminal TPR of CDC16 (CDC16(142–619)) did not affect its interaction with PP5, indicating that this region is not required for binding (Table II). Similarly, we observed that deletion of the NH2-terminal 294 residues of CDC27 (CDC27(295–823)), which includes the first of 10 TPR, had no impact on its interaction with PP5 (Table I). However, further subdivision of the nine remaining TPR abolished any interaction of the CDC27 fusions (537–823, 2–294, 2–536, 295–536) with PP5, demonstrating that the integrity of at least part of the nine repeats present at the COOH terminus of CDC27 is important for binding with PP5 (Fig. 3 and Table I). This result also confirms that the interaction between CDC27 and PP5 is dependent on the presence of the TPR in each protein. This, together with the lack of interaction observed with PEX5, reinforces the conclusion that the TPR domain of PP5 does not bind nonspecifically to TPR-containing domains in general. To confirm our two-hybrid analysis, GST-fusion proteins of CDC27 and CDC16 were made and tested in a binding experiment with a VSV-G epitope-tagged derivative of PP5 expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. Immunoblot analysis of the binding reaction using an antiserum against the VSV-G-tag (32Kreis T.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) indicates that PP5 is able to interact with a GST-CDC27 fusion protein containing the nine COOH-terminal TPR of CDC27 (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) but not with GST alone (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Consistent with the two-hybrid analysis, there was no detectable binding of PP5 with a GST-CDC27 fusion protein containing only five COOH-terminal TPR (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). The membrane was reprobed with an anti-CDC27 antibody to confirm the presence of the GST-CDC27 fusion proteins in the binding assay (Fig. 4 B). These in vitro binding results confirm that PP5 binds to CDC27 in the same region defined by the two-hybrid experiment. However, we were unable to see significant binding of PP5-tag to GST-CDC16 fusion proteins, suggesting that the optimal binding conditions were different for CDC16 and CDC27 in this in vitro binding assay or, alternatively, that the interaction between PP5 and CDC16 requires an additional factor (data not shown). Colocalization immunofluorescence studies with tubulin have shown that CDC16 and CDC27 are present on the mitotic spindle apparatus from prophase to cytokinesis (9Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because PP5 can bind directly to these two subunits of APC, we wanted to determine whether PP5 can also localize to the spindle. Indeed, we observed significant PP5 localization to the spindle (Fig. 5 C) in mitotic cells. Mock-transfected control cells exhibited no staining of the mitotic apparatus (Fig. 5 F). Double label immunofluorescence with an anti-tubulin antibody confirmed that PP5 colocalized with the duplicated centrosomes in prophase (Fig. 5 A) and with some, if not all, of the fibers forming the spindle in prometaphase and metaphase cells (Fig. 5, B and C). However, the staining of PP5 was more diffuse than that of tubulin, suggesting similar but not identical localization (Fig. 5 C). In contrast to tubulin, there was no obvious localization of PP5 to the aster fibers (Fig. 5 C). Single label immunofluorescence confirmed PP5 staining of the mitotic spindle (Fig.6), ruling out the possibility that the observed colocalization with tubulin was caused by cross-reactivity between the secondary antibodies or bleed-through between the fluorescein and Texas red channels. In anaphase, no obvious staining of PP5 was observed on the spindle (Fig. 5 D), suggesting the dissociation of PP5 from the mitotic spindle at the completion of metaphase. Finally, clear midbody localization of PP5 was not detected during cytokinesis (Fig. 5 E), in contrast to what was observed for CDC16 and CDC27 (9Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Taken together, these immunofluorescence data show that PP5 localizes to the mitotic spindle, at least through metaphase.Figure 6Single label immunolocalization of PP5-tag.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the TPR domain of PP5 therefore appears to be responsible for its specificity in binding putative substrate proteins. We have examined the ability of PP5 to interact with two different subunits of APC, CDC16 and CDC27, both of which contain TPR. A combination of two-hybrid analysis and in vitro studies allows us to conclude that PP5 interacts with CDC16 and CDC27 through its NH2-terminal TPR domain. By using deletion constructs of the CDC16 and CDC27 proteins, we were able to delineate the site of interaction with PP5. We demonstrated that the TPR of CDC27 were required for binding with PP5. An in vitro binding assay between PP5 and GST-CDC27 further confirmed our two-hybrid analysis. Taken together, the binding data suggest that the TPR domain of PP5 is able to interact specifically with the TPR-containing COOH-terminal region of these two subunits of APC. Transfection of an epitope-tagged derivative of PP5 in COS-1 cells allowed us to detect PP5 localized to the mitotic spindle. Although Chen et al.(24Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) did not observe identical localization of endogenous PP5, this could be explained by the low abundance of PP5 or its inaccessibility to antibodies. Using the epitope-tagged derivatives described in this study, our immunolocalization data clearly suggest that PP5 localizes to the mitotic spindle and may thus play an important role in M phase. Because our binding data also demonstrate an interaction between PP5 and two TPR-containing subunits of APC which are associated with the spindle/centrosome throughout mitosis (9Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we conclude that the spindle localization of PP5 reflects a biologically significant function. CDC16 and CDC27, along with at least one other subunit of APC, CDC23, become phosphorylated at the metaphase/anaphase transition, and these regulatory phosphorylations have been shown to be necessary for the ubiquitination of B-type cyclins (16Peters J.M. King R.W. Hoog C. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible role of PP5 would be to maintain a dephosphorylated, inactivated state of APC just prior to anaphase. An okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase has indeed been shown to control the ubiquitination of B-type cyclins, possibly through APC dephosphorylation; however, the phosphatase responsible for this activity has not been identified (23Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During anaphase and telophase when APC is activated as part of a ubiquitin ligase complex, PP5 may not remain associated with APC. Indeed, we could not detect any obvious localization of PP5 on the spindle/centrosome from anaphase to cytokinesis, indicating that PP5 may dissociate from the mitotic apparatus at the metaphase/anaphase transition, at which time APC becomes fully activated and remains present on the spindle. Although it is unknown whether APC subunits are still phosphorylated in G1, APC remains active for a portion of G1 prior to inactivation of its ubiquitin ligase activity (39Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It would therefore be interesting to determine whether PP5 plays a role in this regulatory event. Despite numerous attempts, we were unable to observe an in vivo interaction between subunits of APC and PP5. Using extracts from interphase cells or from cells arrested in metaphase by taxol treatment, there was no detectable coimmunoprecipitation of transfected PP5-tag and endogenous CDC27 or CDC16. Similarly, Chen et al. (40Chen P.L. Ueng Y.C. Durfee T. Chen K.C. Yang-Feng T. Lee W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar) were unable to detect an in vivo interaction between CDC27 and unphosphorylated Rb, although they characterized this interaction thoroughly using a combination of in vitrobinding assays and two-hybrid interactions. This apparent lack of in vivo interaction, however, may be caused by the technical problem that APC, containing CDC16 and CDC27, is a very large multisubunit complex of more than 1,000 kDa, which may compromise efficient coimmunoprecipitation. In summary, our results demonstrate interactions between PP5 and both CDC16 and CDC27, together with a similar spindle localization for these proteins during M phase. Alternatively, the localization of PP5 on the spindle may reflect another role independent of the regulation of APC activity. For instance, many distinct kinases are involved in mitosis and exhibit spindle localization, and, conceivably, the role of PP5 may be to regulate one or more of these activities. Indeed, we have observed that PP5 is able to interact with cdc2 and mos, two kinases that exhibit spindle localization during mitosis (41Zhou R. Oskarsson M. Paules R.S. Schulz N. Cleveland D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1991; 251: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 42Zhou R. Daar I. Ferris D.K. White G. Paules R.S. Vande Woude G. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, the interaction between PP5 and subunits of APC may simply serve to anchor PP5 to the spindle, facilitating its interaction with such kinases or other unidentified targets.

A striking feature of the oligosaccharides of the LS174T-HM7 xenograft tumor mucin was a predominance of sulfated Lewis X determinants: HSO3-Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc. In addition to one previously known saccharide with one sulfated Lewis X determinant, the HM7 xenograft tumor mucin contained multiple novel structures containing one, two, or three sulfated Lewis X determinants. This determinant, known to act as a selectin ligand, has been found previously in minor saccharide components of human milk as well as mucins, but never before as a predominant structure in one mucin source.

Mucins are large glycoproteins containing serine- and/or threonine-rich domains with multiple O-linked glycans, and occur as soluble secreted and membrane-bound forms. As major components of the mucous coat, mucins are thought to have a mechanical protective role on mucosal surfaces. They may also have more specific activities, such as regulation of solute transport or providing attachment sites for commensal and pathogenic microbes, and in endothelial cells a mucin may form attachment sites for targeting of leukocytes (1Gum Jr., J.R.

Many epithelial cancers produce mucins. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies indicate that well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon and cell lines derived from them synthesize and secrete varying amounts of mucins (5Kurosaka A.

In animal models, human colon carcinoma cells with high mucin production were found to have more liver metastasizing activity than those with low mucin production (10Bresalier R.S. Niv Y. Byrd J.C.

When the high mucin variant colon cancer cells were pretreated with O-glycosylation inhibitor benzyl-α-N-acetylgalactosamine, marked reduction in liver metastasis was observed. Saccharide structures are frequently altered in cancer cells compared with the corresponding normal cell (11Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2405-2414PubMed Google Scholar, 12Feizi T. Nature. 1985; 314: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Numerous carbohydrate epitopes detected by monoclonal antibodies or lectins have been studied with the hope of finding specific tumor cell markers (13Kim Y.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 16G: 91-96Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Some have become useful in diagnostic procedures (14Kim Y.S. Gum J. Brockhausen I. Glycoconj.

However, only a few studies have characterized the carcinoma mucin saccharides at the chemical structural level (5Kurosaka A. Nakajima H. Funakoshi I. Matsuyama M. Nagayo T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11594-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Capon C. Laboisse C.L. Wieruszeski J.M. Maoret J.J. Augeron C. Fournet B. J. Biol.

Here we describe the structural analysis of saccharides from mucin produced by nude mouse xenografts of the human colon carcinoma LS174T-HM7: a subline of LS174T cells that produces more mucin (6Kuan S.-F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C.B. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5715-5724PubMed Google Scholar) and more metastasis than the parent cell line (10Bresalier R.S. Niv Y. Byrd J.C. Duh Q.Y. Toribara N.W.

Oncol. 1995; 59: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To our surprise, we found that this mucin had an abundance of an otherwise relatively unusual structural motif (the sulfated Lewis X determinant) that is not detected by the available lectins or monoclonal antibodies. LS174T-HM7 cells (6Kuan S.-F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C.B. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5715-5724PubMed Google Scholar) were grown as subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice (18Byrd J.C. Nardelli J. Siddiqui B. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6678-6685PubMed Google Scholar). Mucin was purified and quantitated essentially as described previously for mucin from xenografts of the parent LS174T cell line (18Byrd J.C. Nardelli J. Siddiqui B. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6678-6685PubMed Google Scholar). The colonic mucins were submitted to β-elimination under reductive conditions (0.1 m KOH, 1m KBH4) for 24 h at 45 °C (19Aminoff D. Gathmann W.D. McLean C.M. Yadomae T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by addition of ion exchange resin (Dowex 50Wx8, H+ form) until pH reached 5.0. After filtration, the filtrate was dried under vacuum and boric acid removed by repeated evaporation with methanol. The mixture of oligosaccharide alditols was purified further by size exclusion chromatography on a column of Bio-Gel P6 (2 × 85 cm, 400 mesh, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.5% acetic acid, and eluted at 15 ml/h at room temperature. The oligosaccharide fractions, detected by UV absorption at 206 nm and eluted at about 165 ml, were pooled for further fractionation and structural analysis. The purified oligosaccharide alditols were fractionated on quartenary amine-bonded silica (20Baenziger J.U. Natowicz M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using a 10-μm Micro-Pak-10 column (50 × 0.8 cm; Varian, Walnut Creek, CA) on a Spectra-Physics model 8700 liquid chromatograph (Spectra-Physics, San Jose, CA) equipped with a LDC variable wavelength detector (Spectro Monitor D, Milton Roy, Riviera Beach, FL) connected to a Spectra-Physics model 4100 computing integrator. The solvents and gradients are given in Fig. 1. Before further analysis, the acidic fractions, eluted with high salt, were desalted by size exclusion chromatography on a Bio-Gel P2 column (size of column, 200–400-mesh) using water as eluant at a flow rate of 8 ml/h. The neutral oligosaccharide fraction (FN) was dried, dissolved in 40 μl of initial solvent (acetonitrile-water, 85:15), and injected onto a 5-μm Spheri-5 column (250 × 46 mm, inner diameter; Brownlee Labs, Santa Clara, CA) equilibrated in initial solvent. The saccharides were eluted with a gradient of decreasing concentrations of acetonitrile in water (Fig.2). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Fractions FI, FII, and FIII obtained after anion exchange chromatography were desalted, dried, and dissolved in 200 μl of water, and then fractionated by HPAEC on Dionex HPLC system equipped with a model PAD2 pulsed amperometric detector (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The column was a Carbopac-PA-100 (4 × 250 mm) pellicular anion exchange column with a guard column (4 × 50 mm), and was eluted at 1 ml/min with 100 mm NaOH containing varying amounts of NaOAc (Fig. 3). Each fraction collected was immediately neutralized with 30% acetic acid and then desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 column. An aliquot of native mucin (50 μg) was hydrolyzed with 1 m HCl for 5 h at 100 °C (21Spencer B. Biochem J. 1960; 75: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the amount of released sulfate was measured by HPAEC as described by Lo-Guidice et al. (22Lo-Guidice J.M. Wieruszeski J.M. Lemoine J. Verbert A. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18794-18813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carbohydrate composition of the mucin and oligosaccharide alditol fractions were determined by gas chromatography on a silicone OV 101 capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm) after methanolysis (0.5 m HCl-methanol for 24 h at 80 °C), N-reacetylation, and trimethylsilylation as described by Kamerling et al.

Debray H. Fournet B. Spik G. Strecker G. Chaplin M.F. Kennedy J.F. Carbohydrate Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 143-204Google Scholar). Molecular weights of oligosaccharide alditols were measured on a MALDI-TOF instrument (Vision 2000, Finnegan-MAT) equipped with a 337-nm UV laser. The mass spectra were acquired in reflectron mode under 6 kV accelerating voltage and positive or negative ion detection. The sample was dissolved in water at about 100 pmol/μl. Two μl of sample solution was mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution: either 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (10 mg/ml in water-ethanol 80:20) for neutral or monoacidic fractions or 3-aminoquinolein (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile-water, 80:20) for the di- and triacidic fractions analyzed in negative ion mode. External calibration was done with angiotensin I (M r1296.7; Sigma). Prior to1H NMR spectroscopic analysis, the oligosaccharide-alditol fractions were exchanged twice with 2H2O at room temperature and pD = 6.5. After each exchange (1 h) the materials were lyophilized. Finally each sample was redissolved in 0.5 ml of 2H2O (99.96 atom % 2H, CEA, France). The samples were analyzed at 27 °C on a Bruker DMX-600 600-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (1H/13C/15N) self-shielded z-gradient probe head. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentanoate sodium salt, but were measured by reference to internal acetone (d = 2.225 ppm). The NMR spectra were interpreted by comparison to spectral data published for a large number O-linked glycans and other relevant saccharides. Overviews are given by Kamerling and Vliegenthart (25Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Berliner L.J. Reben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 10. Plenum Press, New York1992: 1-287Google Scholar) and in Sugabase. 2Sugabase is a Web site compiling published NMR data for saccharides, currently up to about 1994 (URL:http://www.boc.chem.ruu.nl/sugabase/sugabase.html). Specific pertinent references are given under “Results” and “Discussion.” Fraction FII-7 and FII-11 were first desulfated and defucosylated by incubation in 50 mm HCOOH for 2 h at 100 °C (27Kochetkov N.K. Derevitskaya V.A. Arbatsky N.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The resulting oligosaccharides were permethylated (28Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). Acid hydrolysis and identification of partially methylated acetylated methyl glycosides by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy was done as described by Fournet et al. (29Fournet B. Strecker G. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). LS174T-HM7 was grown as xenografts under the skin of nude mice. Mucin (22 mg) was isolated by a procedure that includes gel filtration followed by CsCl centrifugation and a final purification by gel filtration again (18Byrd J.C. Nardelli J. Siddiqui B. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6678-6685PubMed Google Scholar). The mucin contained 4 mg of protein and about 18 mg of carbohydrate (estimated from hexose content of 6.6 mg). The yield of oligosaccharide alditols obtained by base-borohydride treatment followed by ion exchange chromatography and desalting was 6.5 mg (about 40% of total saccharides). The carbohydrate and sulfate composition of the intact mucin and the oligosaccharide fractions are shown in Table I. The published (18Byrd J.C. Nardelli J. Siddiqui B. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6678-6685PubMed Google Scholar) sulfate content and carbohydrate composition of mucin from the parent LS174T cell line is included for comparison. It is evident that the LS174T-HM7 mucin has relatively more sulfate and less NeuAc. Moreover, the relatively larger amounts of Gal, GlcNAc, and Fuc suggests on average more complex saccharides in the HM7 mucin compared with the parent cell mucin.Table ISulfate content and carbohydrate composition of LS174T mucins and released saccharidesIntact mucin1-aMolar ratios with GalNAc taken as 1.Released saccharide fractions1-bMolar ratios with GalNAc-o taken as 1.LS174T1-cData for parent cell line as reported by Byrd et al.

The oligosaccharide alditols were initially fractionated by quartenary amine anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1) into one neutral (FN) and three acidic fractions (FI–III). Further fractionation of FN by HPLC on amino-bonded silica (Fig. 2) and FI–III by high pH anion exchange chromatography (Fig.3, a–c) revealed multiple components. Fractions were collected and subjected to combinations of compositional analysis (Table I and data not shown), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Tables Table II, Table III, Table IV; Fig. 4), and NMR spectroscopy (Tables V and VI).

Overall features strongly supported by composition, mass spectrometry, and NMR analysis, but assignments of partial terminal determinants to particular antennae are tentative. All the remaining structures were both fucosylated and sulfated. The NMR analysis (Tables V and VI) indicated that most Fuc residues were linked α1–3 to GlcNAc as in a Lewis X-determinant; the signal from Fuc H-1 was in the range of 5.09–5.14, Fuc H-5 in the range of 4.79–4.82, and Fuc CH3at 1.17–1.18 (30Vliegenthart J.F.G.

Trans. 1984; 12: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Less prominent signals from Fucα1–4 to GlcNAc, as in a Lewis a determinant, cannot be ruled out, but no other positions of Fuc were evident. The Fuc-CH3 signal from Fucα1–4GlcNAc (d = 1.17–1.18 ppm) would overlap with the Fucα1–3GlcNAc, and the H-5 signal (about 5.89 ppm) may be hidden in the downfield slope of the Fuc H-5 of Fucα1–3GlcNAc and/or the HDO peak. However, the Fuc H-1 signal of Fucα1–4GlcNAc (typically found at 5.00–5.05 ppm) should have been easily detected if present. Indeed, a small signal was detected at 5.03 ppm in some of the fractions (e.g. Fig. 6, arrowhead) but not in others (Figs. 7 and 8).Figure 7600-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of fraction FIII-8.

The resonances marked by an asterisk(*) stem from frequently occurring non-protein, non-carbohydrate contaminants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All sulfate, with one exception, was attached to the 3-position of Gal, as evidenced by a characteristic strong downfield shift of the signals from Gal H-3 and Gal H-4 to about 4.32 and 4.27 ppm, respectively (32Capon C. Leroy Y. Wieruszeski J.M. Ricart G. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was clear that most Galβ1–4GlcNAc residues would have to have both sulfate and Fuc attached, forming a sulfated Lewis X determinant, simply based on stoichiometric considerations. However, additional shifts in the NMR spectra due to cross-interaction of the sulfate and Fuc within this determinant (22Lo-Guidice J.M. Wieruszeski J.M. Lemoine J. Verbert A. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18794-18813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Capon C. Leroy Y. Wieruszeski J.M. Ricart G. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) gave further support for this conclusion. The signal from H-4 of the sulfated Gal is particularly diagnostic since it is a tall (small coupling constant) peak in a relatively uncrowded area of the spectrum. In the absence of Fuc on the nearby GlcNAc, this signal is found slightly above at 4.29 ppm, whereas, in the presence of Fuc, it is found slightly below 4.27 ppm. H-1 and H-3 of the sulfated Gal are also shifted downfield by about Δδ = 0.02 due to the nearby Fuc, and Fuc H-5 is shifted upfield by Δδ = −0.02 due to the nearby sulfate, but these shifts are sometimes hard to identify because of obscuring peaks and/or other influences on these signals. These effects suggest that sulfate and Fuc are attached to the Galβ1–4GlcNAc branch (32Capon C. Leroy Y. Wieruszeski J.M. Ricart G. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Eur. J.

In permeabilized Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae cells, the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme or the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex is rapidly activated by the exchange of the inactivated coenzyme or cyanocobalamin for free adenosylcobalamin in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (Honda, S., Toraya, T., and Fukui, S.

Permeabilized Escherichia coli cells co-expressing the diol dehydratase genes with two open reading frames in the 3′-flanking region were capable of reactivating glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase as well as activating the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex in situ in the presence of free adenosylcobalamin, ATP, and Mg2+. These open reading frames, designated as ddrA and ddrB genes, were identified as the genes of a putative reactivating factor for inactivated diol dehydratase. The genes encoded polypeptides consisting of 610 and 125 amino acid residues with predicted molecular weights of 64,266 and 13,620, respectively. Co-expression of the open reading frame in the 5′-flanking region was stimulatory but not obligatory for conferring the reactivating activity upon E. coli. Thus, the product of this gene was considered not an essential component of the reactivating factor.

The enzyme is inducibly formed by some genera of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella and Citrobacter, and other bacteria when they are grown anaerobically in a medium containing 1,2-propanediol (3Toraya T. Fukui S. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 233-262Google Scholar, 4Toraya T. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 217-254Google Scholar). The enzyme participates in the fermentation of this substrate (5Toraya T. Honda S. Fukui S. J.

When some of these bacteria are grown anaerobically on glycerol, glycerol dehydratase is induced and involved in producing an electron acceptor for the fermentation of glycerol via the dihydroxyacetone pathway (7Toraya T. Kuno S. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Forage R.G. Foster M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 413-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Forage R.G. Lin E.C.C. J.

Although Klebsiella oxytoca (formerly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aerobacter aerogenes) ATCC 8724 is defective in glycerol dehydratase (10Toraya T. Honda S. Kuno S. Fukui S. J.

Acta. 1979; 569: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is capable of fermenting glycerol. This is because a low level of diol dehydratase induced by glycerol substitutes for isofunctional glycerol dehydratase (2Toraya T. Shirakashi T. Kosuga T. Fukui S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Toraya T. Kuno S. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Toraya T. Fukui S. Eur. J.

Inactivation by glycerol is mechanism-based and involves irreversible cleavage of the Co-C bond of AdoCbl, forming 5′-deoxyadenosine and an alkylcobalamin-like species (3Toraya T. Fukui S. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 233-262Google Scholar, 14Bachovchin W.W. Eagar Jr., R.G. Moore K.W. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Irreversible inactivation of the enzyme is brought about by tight binding of the modified coenzyme (3Toraya T. Fukui S. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 233-262Google Scholar, 14Bachovchin W.W. Eagar Jr., R.G. Moore K.W. Richards J.H.

Such suicide inactivation seemed enigmatic, because glycerol is a growth substrate for K. oxytoca. This apparent inconsistency was solved by our finding that the glycerol-inactivated enzyme in permeabilized cells (in situ) of K. oxytocaundergoes rapid reactivation by exchange of the modified coenzyme for intact AdoCbl in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (or Mn2+) (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ushio K. Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The enzyme-CN-Cbl complex is also activated in situ under the same conditions. Such reactivation and activation are detectable only in situ but not in vitro. It remained unclear whether the reactivation is caused by a specific factor, although some factor(s) necessary for the in situ reactivation was indirectly suggested to be inducible by glycerol (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Crystalline AdoCbl was a gift from Eisai Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). CN-Cbl was obtained from Glaxo Research Laboratories (Greenford, UK). All other chemicals and the enzymes used for construction of plasmids were commercial products of the highest grade available and were used without further purification. The genes encoding reactivating factor were isolated from plasmid pUCDD11, which contains a 10.5-kb chromosomal DNA insert from K. oxytoca (19Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Sakaguchi M. Kishimoto Y. Wada Y.

When the culture reached an A 600 of approximately 0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for induction to a concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested in the late logarithmic phase. Permeabilized cells were prepared by treatment with 1% (v/v) toluene as described previously (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J.

The amount of aldehydic products formed by diol dehydratase reaction was determined by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone method (21Toraya T. Ushio K. Fukui S. Hogenkamp H.P.C. J. Biol.

The 6.8-kb HpaI-EcoRI fragment from pUCDD11 and the 0.15-kb BamHI-HpaI fragment from pUSI2E(DD) were ligated with pUSI2E previously linearized with BamHI and EcoRI to construct pUSI2E(DD5+). The 7.5-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pUCDD11 and the 0.24-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment from pUSI2E(1DD) were ligated with pUSI2E previously linearized with BamHI and EcoRI to construct pUSI2E(1DD5+). A 2.3-kb DNA segment of pSTV28 (Takara Shuzo Co.

The PCR product was digested with HindIII and AvaI and ligated with the 3.1-kb HindIII-AvaI fragment from pUSI2E(DD) to construct pCXV-I(DD). pCXV-I(DD) was subjected to HindIII digestion, followed by treatment with Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of four dNTPs, and digested with EcoRI. pUSI2 (25Shibui T.

The resulting 2.3-kb fragment from pCXV-I(DD) and the 0.6-kb fragment from pUSI2 were ligated with the 4.5-kb ApaI-EcoRI fragment from pUSI2E(DD) to construct pCXV(DD). A DNA segment encoding the N-terminal region of ORF5a was amplified by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase, 5′-primer AGCATATGACAAATTCGTCTGGAACGAAT (initiation codon GTG of ORF5a was replaced by underlined ATG), and 3′-primer ATAAATATTTCGCTGCTCGGCTTG (complimentary to the nucleotide sequence 0.1-kb downstream of the unique SalI site). The PCR product digested with NdeI and SalI and the 2.9-kb SalI-EcoRI fragment from pUSI2E(1DD5+) were ligated with the 4.4-kb NdeI-EcoRI fragment from pCXV(DD) to construct pCXV(5a+). pCXV(5b+) was constructed in a similar way, except that 5′-primer AGCATATGCGATATATAGCTGGCATTGAT (the initiation codon of ORF5b is underlined) was used for amplification of the DNA segment encoding the N-terminal region of ORF5b. A DNA segment encoding the C-terminal region of ORF5 was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 5′-primer TGCGTGGTGAAAGCGGACGAACTG (complimentary to the nucleotide sequence 0.2-kb upstream of the unique Csp45I site), and 3′-primer TCAGATCTTACCGTTCATGCGCAAACTCCTT (the termination codon of ORF5 is underlined). The PCR product digested with Csp45I and BglII and the 0.8-kb Csp45I-SalI fragment from pUCDD11 was ligated with the 5.4-kb BglII-SalI fragment from pCXV(5a+) to construct pCXV(5a). pCXV(5b) was constructed in a similar way, except that the 5.3-kb BglII-SalI fragment from pCXV(5b+) was used. A DNA segment encoding the region of ORF6 was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase, 5′-primer TGTGCATATGAACGGTAATCACAGCGCCCCG (the initiation codon of ORF6 is underlined), and 3′-primer ACAGATCTTATTCATCCTGCTGTTCTCCTGT (the termination codon of ORF6 is underlined). The PCR product was digested into two fragments by NdeI and BglII (the upstream 200-bp NdeI fragment and the downstream 180-bp NdeI-BglII fragment). The downstream 180-bp NdeI-BglII fragment was ligated with the 4.4-kb NdeI-BglII fragment from pCXV(DD) to construct pCXV(6ΔN). pCXV(6ΔN) was digested with NdeI and ligated with the upstream 200-bp NdeI fragment from the PCR product to construct pCXV(6). On the other hand, NdeI digest of pCXV(6ΔN) was ligated with the 2.0-kb NdeI fragment from pCXV(5b+) to construct pCXV(5b-6). pCXV(6) was digested with BglII and ligated with the 1.9-kb BamHI-BglII fragment from pCXV(5b) to construct pCXV(6/5b). pCXV, which does not carry insert DNA, was constructed by ligation of the 4.3-kb HindIII-AvaI fragment from pCXV(DD) with the 150-bp HindIII-AvaI fragment from pUSI2E. As illustrated in Fig. 1, plasmid pUCDD11 carries a 10.5-kb genomic DNA of K. oxytocacontaining the pdd genes encoding diol dehydratase (ORFs 2–4) and their flanking regions (19Tobimatsu T. Hara T.

There exist ORF1 and ORF5, etc., with unknown functions in the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, respectively. Recently, we found that that E. coli harboring plasmid pUCDD11 was capable of reactivating glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase in situ in the presence of free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+. We have previously reported such in situreactivation with K. oxytoca ATCC 8724 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 25955 (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was strongly suggested that some protein(s) encoded by gene(s) in the flanking regions of the pdd genes are responsible for the in situreactivation. To discover which flanking region of the diol dehydratase genes is essential for reactivation of glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase, we constructed two expression plasmids, pUSI2E(DD5+) and pUSI2E(1DD5+), which contain the 3′-flanking region from pUCDD11 in addition to the pdd genes and the pdd genes plus ORF1, respectively (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Co-expression of the genes of diol dehydratase and the flanking regions on a single expression vector in E. coli.

Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or diol dehydratase in vitro (2Toraya T. Shirakashi T. Kosuga T. Fukui S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Bachovchin W.W. Eagar Jr., R.G. Moore K.W. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, when ATP and Mg2+ were supplemented to the reaction mixture in addition to AdoCbl, an initial, rapid phase of glycerol dehydration was followed by a slower but almost constant rate of the dehydration. Furthermore, when ATP and Mg2+ were added to the mixture at 10 min after the reaction was initiated (at which time essentially all the diol dehydratase present in the reaction mixture had been inactivated by glycerol), the inactivated enzyme underwent rapid reactivation to give the same rate of dehydration as that with initially added ATP and Mg2+. These characteristics of the in situ reactivation in the recombinant E. coli cells agree well with those observed with K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae cells (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the in situ reactivation of the inactivated holoenzyme during dehydration of glycerol in the presence of AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+ was not observed with permeabilized E. coli cells carrying plasmid pUSI2E(DD) (Fig. 3 B). pUSI2E(DD) is an expression plasmid for the diol dehydratase genes that lacks the flanking regions of the pdd genes (19Tobimatsu T.

Therefore, it is highly suggested that certain protein(s) encoded by gene(s) in the 3′-flanking regions are essential for the in situreactivation of inactivated diol dehydratase. The capability of recombinant E. coli cells to activate the inactive enzyme-CN-Cbl complex in situ was also assayed using 1,2-propanediol as substrate. 1,2-Propanediol is a substrate that does not bring about significant suicide inactivation of the enzyme (1Lee Jr., H.A. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2367-2373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,2Toraya T. Shirakashi T. Kosuga T. Fukui S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Bachovchin W.W. Eagar Jr., R.G. Moore K.W. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been established before (18Ushio K. Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the in situactivation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex is due to the exchange of CN-Cbl for free AdoCbl in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (or Mn2+) and that these two capabilities are well correlated. As shown in Table I, nearly half of the diol dehydratase-CN-Cbl complex formed in E. coli carrying pUSI2E(DD5+) underwent activation with free AdoCbl in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ but not at all in the absence of ATP and Mg2+. In contrast, activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex in E. coli carrying pUSI2E(DD) or pUSI2E(1DD) did not take place under the same conditions. These results indicate that expression of gene(s) in the 3′-flanking region of the diol dehydratase genes is absolutely required for the in situ activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex. Therefore, it was confirmed to be reasonable to evaluate the capability of recombinant E. coli cells to reactivate the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme in situ by determining an extent of in situ activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex. Higher extent of activation was observed in E. coli carrying pUSI2E(1DD5+), which contains ORF1 in addition to the pdd genes and the 3′-flanking region. Therefore, expression of ORF1 is not essential but stimulatory for activation of the inactive enzyme-CN-Cbl complex.Table IIn situ activation of the diol dehydratase-CN-Cbl complex in E. coli co-expressing the genes of diol dehydratase and the flanking regions on a single expression vectorHost/plasmidExtent of activation1-aThe extent of in situ activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex was calculated on the basis of the amount of propionaldehyde formed between 5 and 10 min of incubation by permeabilized cells preincubated without CN-Cbl.With ATP/MgCl2Without ATP/MgCl2%JM109/pUSI2E(DD5+)390.0JM109/pUSI2E(DD)0.20.0JM109/pUSI2E(1DD5+)660.1JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)0.00.01-a The extent of in situ activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex was calculated on the basis of the amount of propionaldehyde formed between 5 and 10 min of incubation by permeabilized cells preincubated without CN-Cbl. Open table in a new tab Gene products in homogenates of the recombinant E. colistrains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition to the thick protein bands with M r of 60,000, 30,000, and 19,000, which correspond to the α, β, and γ subunits of diol dehydratase, respectively, relatively thick protein bands with M r of 30,000 and 28,000 were observed in the homogenates of E. coli carrying pUSI2E(1DD) and pUSI2E(1DD5+) in common. This result suggests the heterogeneity of the ORF1 product. When the concentration of polyacrylamide in the gel was lowered to 7.5%, a thin protein band with M r of 64,000 was detected in common in the homogenates of E. colicarrying pUSI2E(DD5+) and pUSI2E(1DD5+) (Fig. 2 C). Thus, this seemed to be one of the candidates for product(s) of genes in the 3′-flanking region. Because the 3′-flanking region of the pdd genes was essential for both in situreactivation of the inactivated holoenzyme and activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex, the region was subjected to nucleotide sequencing according to the strategy shown in Fig. 1. As summarized in Figs. 1 and 4, there existed two ORFs (ORF5 and ORF6) in the immediate downstream of the diol dehydratase genes in the same direction. The 3′-end of ORF5 overlapped the 5′-end of ORF6 by 8 nucleotides. Two possible initiation codons were found in ORF5: the GTG and ATG codons that were located at 41–43 and 206–208 nucleotides downstream of the termination codon of the pddC gene. For convenience, ORFs starting from these GTG and ATG codons are referred to as ORF5a and ORF5b, respectively. ORF5a, ORF5b, and ORF6 encode polypeptides consisting of 665, 610, and 125 amino acid residues with predicted molecular weights of 70,517, 64,266, and 13,620, respectively. Shine-Dalgarno sequences were found 8–11 bases upstream of the putative initiation codons. Two sets of inverted repeat sequences that may form hairpin structures exist immediately downstream of this GTG codon. For co-expression of ORFs in the 3′-flanking region with the pdd genes in E. coli, we constructed an expression vector, pCXV. This vector possesses the lacrepressor gene, a tac promoter, a ribosome binding site, the trpA transcriptional terminator, a replication origin of p15A, and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (Fig.5 A). The lacrepressor gene, the tac promoter, the ribosome binding site, and cloning sites of pCXV are common to those of pUSI2E. Because vector pUSI2E has a replication origin of pBR322 and the β-lactamase gene (Fig. 2 A) (19Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Sakaguchi M. Kishimoto Y. Wada Y. Isoda M. Sakai T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7142-7148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), pCXV and pUSI2E could be stably co-transformed to E. coli cells, and co-transformants were readily selected by resistance to both chloramphenicol and ampicillin. Copy numbers of plasmids containing replication origins of p15A and pBR322 are 10–12 and 15–20 copies/cell, respectively (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli JM109 carrying expression plasmid pCXV(DD), which contains the pdd genes downstream of the tac promoter of pCXV, produced an amount of diol dehydratase comparable with that produced by E. coli JM109 carrying pUSI2E(DD) (data not shown). To characterize the gene products of ORF5 and ORF6, we constructed seven expression plasmids derived from pCXV (Fig.5 A). E. coli JM109 was transformed with these plasmids, and homogenates of the recombinant E. coli strains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, B and C).E. coli harboring plasmids containing ORF5b produced a thick protein band with M r of 64,000. On the other hand, E. coli harboring plasmid carrying ORF5a produced two bands with M r of 71,000 and 64,000 (Fig.5 C). A thin protein band with M r of 64,000 was also observed in homogenates of E. coli harboring plasmids containing both the pdd genes and the 3′-flanking region (Fig. 2 C). These lines of evidence indicate that the real product of ORF5 is the M r 64,000 polypeptide, namely the product of ORF5b. Therefore, it was strongly suggested that the real initiation codon of ORF5 was the ATG but not the GTG. In the numbering in Fig. 4, the first nucleotide of this translational initiation codon (ATG) of ORF5b and the first amino acid of the ORF5b product are taken as 1. E. coli cells harboring expression plasmids containing ORF6 produced a M r 14,000 polypeptide, although the band of this product was not thick. The largest amount of the ORF6 product was obtained in E. coli harboring plasmid pCXV(6/5b) that contains ORF5b and ORF6 in the reverse order (Fig. 5 B). The M r 64,000 and 14,000 polypeptides partially purified were subjected to Edman sequencing. The N-terminal 10-amino acid sequences obtained agreed with those deduced from the nucleotide sequences of ORF5b and ORF6, respectively. E. coli JM109 carrying pUSI2E(DD) and pUSI2E (1DD), expression plasmids for the diol dehydratase genes, were co-transformed with any of the seven expression plasmids for ORF5 and/or ORF6 shown in Fig. 5 A. The capability of the recombinant E. coli strains to activate the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex in situ is summarized in TableII. In the presence of free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+, E. coli cells harboring plasmids containing both ORF5 and ORF6 together with the pdd genes showed a high level of activation of the diol dehydratase-CN-Cbl complex. The ability to activate the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex was not very pronounced with E. coli co-expressing ORF5 alone (pCXV(5a) and pCXV(5b)) and almost negligible with E. colico-expressing ORF6 alone (pCXV(6)) or co-expressing neither (pCXV). From these results, it can be concluded that both proteins encoded by ORF5 and ORF6 are essential for the in situ activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex and therefore for the in situreactivation of the glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase. We propose to call these proteins a “diol dehydratase-reactivating factor.” Because this factor is encoded by ORF5 and ORF6, these ORFs were designated the ddrA and ddrB genes, respectively. A higher extent of the in situ activation was observed when ORF1 was also co-expressed with the pdd genes, ORF5 and ORF6, although co-expression of ORF1 alone with the pddgenes did not confer the reactivating activity upon E. colicells. This indicates that the ORF1 product is not essential but stimulatory for the in situ activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex.Table IIIn situ activation of the diol dehydratase-CN-Cbl complex in E. coli co-expressing ORF5 and/or ORF6 with the diol dehydratase genes on two expression vectorsHost/plasmidsExtent of activation2-aCalculated as described in the footnote to Table I.With ATP/MgCl2Without ATP/MgCl2%JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV(5a+)580.0JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV(5b+)470.0JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV(5b-6)571.4JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV(6/5b)570.0JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV(5a)7.60.2JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV(5b)7.20.0JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV(6)0.60.2JM109/pUSI2E(DD)/pCXV0.50.0JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV(5a+)860.4JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV(5b+)890.0JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV(5b-6)660.2JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV(6/5b)740.2JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV(5a)100.0JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV(5b)7.10.0JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV(6)0.00.0JM109/pUSI2E(1DD)/pCXV1.00.02-a Calculated as described in the footnote to Table I.

The amino acid sequence of ORF5b was highly homologous to that of an ORF with an unknown function that is found immediately downstream of the glycerol dehydratase genes in the dharegulon of K. pneumoniae (Ref. 27Tobimatsu T.

The fact that these ORFs correspond to ORF5b rather than ORF5a also supports the above conclusion that the real initiation codon of ORF5 is ATG at positions 1–3 of ORF5b. An ORF6-related ORF was not found downstream of the glycerol dehydratase genes. As shown in Fig. 6 B, however, ORF6 showed substantial homology to another ORF with an unknown function in the dha regulon of K. pneumoniae(orf2b, GenBank™ accession number U30903) and C. freundii (orfX, GenBank™ accession number U09771) (identities are 30 and 23%, and similarities are 47 and 44%, respectively) as well as to the β subunits of diol dehydratase (19Tobimatsu T.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (identities are 25 and 20–21%, and similarities are 45 and 45%, respectively). These data suggest that the products of these ORFs are implicated in reactivation of the inactivated glycerol dehydratase. We have previously reported in situ reactivation of glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase and in situ activation of the enzyme-CN-Cbl complex in permeabilized K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae cells (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ushio K. Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although some factors required for the in situreactivation were suggested to be subject to induction by glycerol, isolation of the factor was impossible because the reactivating activity was not detected in vitro. In this study, we identified ORF5 and ORF6 as the genes (ddrA and ddrB genes) essential for the in situreactivation of glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase. Co-expression of both genes with the pdd genes conferred the diol dehydratase-reactivating activity on E. coli cells. The M r 64,000 and 14,000 polypeptides in homogenates of the recombinant E. coli cells were characterized as the products of the ddrA and ddrB genes, respectively. Preliminary analysis of the homogenates by two-dimensional PAGE indicated that two polypeptides comigrated in the native dimension (nondenaturing PAGE) (data not shown), suggesting that they form a complex in vivo. Thus, it is evident that the ddrA and ddrB proteins constitute the putative diol dehydratase-reactivating factor. The co-expression of ORF1 was stimulatory but not obligatory for conferring the reactivating activity on E. coli. Thus, it was concluded that the ORF1 product is not an essential component of the reactivating factor. The function of this polypeptide remains unclear at present. There are two possible initiation codons in ORF5: one is GTG at positions −165 to −163 and the other is ATG at positions 1 to 3 (Fig.4). ORF5a and ORF5b encode polypeptides with molecular weights of 70,517 and 64,266, respectively. The polypeptides with expected sizes were detected in homogenates of E. coli carrying pCXV(5a) and pCXV(5b), respectively. The M r 64,000 polypeptide was predominant in E. coli carrying pUSI2E(DD5+) and also produced in E. coli carrying pCXV(5a). These observations suggest that the ATG codon at positions 1–3 is used as the real initiation codon of ORF5. Because the pddC and the ddrA genes are separated by 205 bp including the two inverted repeats that may form hairpin structures, the ddrgenes and the pdd genes may be under separate control. Such reactivating factors reported in this paper may be present in other organisms, because some of the other AdoCbl-dependent enzymes also undergo similar suicide inactivation during catalysis. One of the supporting data for this idea has recently been reported by Roth and co-workers (30Walter D. Ailion M. Roth J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They demonstrated by a genetic study on Salmonella that many of pduG mutants defective in 1,2-propanediol degradation with added cyanocobalamin are corrected by exogenously supplied AdoCbl. It seems likely that the pduGprotein is related to the diol dehydratase-reactivating factor in Salmonella. Homology searches revealed that polypeptides homologous to the ddrA and ddrB proteins are encoded by two ORFs with unknown functions in the dharegulon of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii. Glycerol dehydratase, an isofunctional enzyme of diol dehydratase, also undergoes suicidal inactivation by glycerol during catalysis (15Schneider Z. Pawelkiewicz J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1966; 13: 311-328PubMed Google Scholar, 16Poznanskaya A.A. Yakusheva M.I. Yakovlev V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 484: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the in situ reactivation of glycerol-inactivated glycerol dehydratase in K. pneumoniaein the presence of free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+ (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems quite reasonable to assume that the proteins homologous to the ddr proteins serve as a reactivating factor for inactivated glycerol dehydratase.

Both proteins bound to GroEL with 1:1 stoichiometry and micromolar affinity at all temperatures tested. However, thermodynamic properties of their binding to GroEL are remarkably different from each other. While heat capacity changes (ΔCp) of rLA-GroEL binding showed large negative values, −4.19 kJ mol−1 K−1, that of denatured pepsin-GroEL binding was only −0.2 kJ mol−1K−1. These values strongly indicate that the hydrophobic interaction is a major force of rLA-GroEL binding but not so for denatured pepsin-GroEL binding. When salt was omitted from the solution, the affinity and ΔCp of the rLA-GroEL binding reaction were not significantly changed whereas denatured pepsin lost affinity to GroEL. Thus, in the non-native protein-GroEL binding reaction, thermodynamic properties, as well as the effect of salt, differ from protein to protein and hydrophobic interaction may not always be a major driving force.

Chaperonin GroEL from Escherichia coli is an abundant and indispensable protein that assists folding of other proteins in vitro and in vivo (1Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev.

As determined by x-ray crystallography, GroEL appears to be a hollow cylinder of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits, which are made of 7-fold rotationally symmetrical rings stacked back-to-back with a dyad symmetry (3Braig K.

Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3576) Google Scholar, 4Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). A wide range of proteins, unrelated in their primary sequences and native tertiary structures, can be a “substrate” for GroEL (5Horwich A.L. Low K.B. Fenton W.A. Hirshfield I.N. Furtak K. Cell. 1993; 74: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Since GroEL cannot interact with proteins in native state, there should exist structural features recognizable by GroEL that are commonly found in many proteins in the non-native, but not in the native, state. However, a search for any specific, definite structural features of substrate proteins responsible for GroEL binding, such as a certain secondary structure and a short peptide sequence motif, has been unsuccessful. Rather, based on the observations that two or more structurally different non-native states of the same protein can bind to GroEL (6Okazaki A. Ikura T. Nikaido K. Kuwajima K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt M. Bücheler U. Kaluza B. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the view has been postulated that the conformational state of a protein recognized by GroEL is not necessarily unique. According to this view, driven by hydrophobic interaction, GroEL recognizes and binds to hydrophobic clusters of substrate proteins which are exposed to accessible surface only when they are in non-native state.To assess the extent of hydrophobic interaction in the GroEL-substrate protein binding by experiment, calorimetric analysis of the binding reaction provides useful information. Especially, temperature dependence of the values of enthalpy change of the binding reaction, designated as heat capacity change (ΔCp), is thought to be a good marker to evaluate the contribution of hydrophobic interaction. Lin et al. (11Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported a large negative ΔCpvalue, indicative of strong hydrophobic interaction, for the binding of the unfolded mutant of subtilisin to GroEL, and they concluded that the binding of substrate protein to GroEL is determined by hydrophobic interaction. However, their report has been so far the sole report on calorimetric analysis of GroEL-substrate protein binding and more examples have to be analyzed before generalization of their conclusion.The present study was carried out to obtain the further insight in the thermodynamic aspect of the GroEL-substrate proteins interaction by isothermal calorimetric titration in the presence (0.2 mKCl) or absence of salt. We chose two kinds of non-native proteins, reduced α-lactalbumin (rLA) 1The abbreviations used are: rLA, α-lactalbumin from bovine whose four disulfide bonds are reduced; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: rLA, α-lactalbumin from bovine whose four disulfide bonds are reduced; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and denatured pepsin, as substrate proteins. α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) is a small Ca2+-binding protein (14,200 Da) present in mammalian milk and is one of the best characterized proteins in protein folding study (12Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). α-LA without bound Ca2+ (apo-α-LA) assumes the stable molten globule state at low salt concentration (13Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and rLA is known to be more unfolded than the molten globule state although it has some secondary structure as measured by CD spectra (6Okazaki A. Ikura T. Nikaido K. Kuwajima K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Hayer-Hartl M.K. Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Hartl F.-U. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3192-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Another substrate protein used in this study, pepsin, is a gastric aspartic proteinase (34,550 Da) with pH optimum for catalytic activity at pH < 2. Pepsin contains two conformationally homologous domains and mainly consists of β sheets at acidic pH (14Sielecki A.R. Fedorov A.A. Boodhoo A. Andreeva N.S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and when the pH is raised to above pH 7, it loses the activity with its conformation being denatured irreversibly (15Lin X. Loy J.A. Sussman F. Tang J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results of calorimetry show that hydrophobic interaction may not always be the major binding force in GroEL-substrate protein binding. In addition, it is also shown that the salt has a significant effect on the binding.DISCUSSIONForces of GroEL-protein binding are exerted at the GroEL-protein interfaces. In principle, titration calorimetry is reporting energy changes within the entire system rather than reflecting only the local interaction at the GroEL-protein interfaces. The observed energy changes can be considered to be the sum of energy changes derived from the local interaction at the binding sites and those from accompanying conformational changes in GroEL and the substrate protein. Titration calorimetry can provide information on thermodynamic properties of binding reaction itself only if the contribution of the latter fractions is little. Fortunately, by virtue of the recent achievement in structural studies of chaperonin, it seems to be really the case. Buckle et al. (24Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) determined crystal structure of mini-chaperonin (monomeric polypeptide-binding fragment corresponding to the apical domain of GroEL) with bound polypeptide. It is almost identical to the structure of mini-chaperonin without bound polypeptide that they determined previously (25Zahn R. Buckle A.M. Perrett S. Jonson C.M. Corrales F.J. Golbik R. Fersht A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15024-15029Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and to the structure of the apical domain of the intact GroEL (26Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Thus, the conformation within apical domain of GroEL is not changed significantly by the binding of substrate polypeptide. In addition, contrary to the large en bloc movement of apical domain of GroEL induced by GroES binding (26Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), substrate polypeptide can bind to GroEL without large domain movement (27Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of mini-chaperonin with bound polypeptide, seven substrate residues are bound in a relatively extended conformation (24Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This implies that each polypeptide-binding site of GroEL recognizes a short, flexible, extended polypeptide segment, and specific conformational change is not necessary for partially or fully unfolded proteins to bind GroEL. Taken together, it seems reasonable to assume that binding of polypeptide by itself neither induces large conformational change in GroEL nor in substrate protein and that energy changes observed in titration calorimetry are primarily caused from the interaction of GroEL-protein interfaces.Recently, the heat capacity change (ΔCp =dΔH/dT) of the binding reaction has been taken as a reliable thermodynamic parameter that reflects the contribution of hydrophobic interaction to the reaction; the large negative heat capacity change has been thought to be strong evidence for the role of hydrophobic interactions as the driving force for the binding (28Sturtevant J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 29Formisano S. Johnson M.L. Edelhoch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3340-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Spolar R.S. Ha J.-H. Record Jr., M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8382-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 31Ha J.-H. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We calculated ΔCp from temperature dependence of ΔH by least-squares fitting of ΔH-temperature plots (Fig. 5 D). The calculated ΔCp values were −4.19 kJ mol−1K−1 (rLA, +KCl), −3.12 kJ mol−1K−1 (rLA, −KCl), and −0.20 kJ mol−1K−1 (denatured pepsin, +KCl). Therefore, hydrophobic interaction plays a major role in the binding of rLA to GroEL irrespective of the presence of salt, but it is not the case for the binding reaction of denatured pepsin to GroEL. Lin et al. (11Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported calorimetric analysis of the binding of the unfolded mutant of subtilisin BPN to GroEL and obtained the value of ΔCp −3.6 kJ mol−1 K−1. Based on this large negative value, they concluded that the binding of substrate protein to GroEL was determined by hydrophobic interaction. According to the results reported here, this conclusion is valid for the rLA-GroEL binding but not for the denatured pepsin-GroEL binding, even though all three model proteins, a mutant BPN (11Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), rLA, and denatured pepsin have similar micromolar affinities (and hence similar ΔG values of the binding) to GroEL. Thus, the extent of contribution of hydrophobic interaction in the binding force appears to be different from one protein to another. In the crystal structure of mini-chaperonin with bound heptapeptide (GLVPRGS), binding force appears to be provided from two kinds of interactions: four hydrogen bonds between the main chain of the substrate peptide and the polar side chains of the binding site of GroEL, and hydrophobic interaction between leucine and valine residues of the substrate peptide and the nonpolar side chains of the binding site (24Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Combining the structural information with our results, it seems likely that GroEL-protein binding is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, and an additional, but yet indispensable, binding force is also provided from interactions between side chains of the polypeptide and GroEL. Depending on whether side chains of the bound polypeptide segment are polar or nonpolar, the substrate-binding site of GroEL can present either polar or nonpolar side chains as binding counterparts, and thus extent of hydrophobic interaction in the GroEL-protein binding reaction can be varied depending on substrate proteins. Chaperonin GroEL from Escherichia coli is an abundant and indispensable protein that assists folding of other proteins in vitro and in vivo (1Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3576) Google Scholar). As determined by x-ray crystallography, GroEL appears to be a hollow cylinder of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits, which are made of 7-fold rotationally symmetrical rings stacked back-to-back with a dyad symmetry (3Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar).

We calculated ΔCp from temperature dependence of ΔH by least-squares fitting of ΔH-temperature plots (Fig. 5 D). The calculated ΔCp values were −4.19 kJ mol−1K−1 (rLA, +KCl), −3.12 kJ mol−1K−1 (rLA, −KCl), and −0.20 kJ mol−1K−1 (denatured pepsin, +KCl). Therefore, hydrophobic interaction plays a major role in the binding of rLA to GroEL irrespective of the presence of salt, but it is not the case for the binding reaction of denatured pepsin to GroEL. Lin et al. (11Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported calorimetric analysis of the binding of the unfolded mutant of subtilisin BPN to GroEL and obtained the value of ΔCp −3.6 kJ mol−1 K−1. Based on this large negative value, they concluded that the binding of substrate protein to GroEL was determined by hydrophobic interaction. According to the results reported here, this conclusion is valid for the rLA-GroEL binding but not for the denatured pepsin-GroEL binding, even though all three model proteins, a mutant BPN (11Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), rLA, and denatured pepsin have similar micromolar affinities (and hence similar ΔG values of the binding) to GroEL. Thus, the extent of contribution of hydrophobic interaction in the binding force appears to be different from one protein to another. In the crystal structure of mini-chaperonin with bound heptapeptide (GLVPRGS), binding force appears to be provided from two kinds of interactions: four hydrogen bonds between the main chain of the substrate peptide and the polar side chains of the binding site of GroEL, and hydrophobic interaction between leucine and valine residues of the substrate peptide and the nonpolar side chains of the binding site (24Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Combining the structural information with our results, it seems likely that GroEL-protein binding is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, and an additional, but yet indispensable, binding force is also provided from interactions between side chains of the polypeptide and GroEL. Depending on whether side chains of the bound polypeptide segment are polar or nonpolar, the substrate-binding site of GroEL can present either polar or nonpolar side chains as binding counterparts, and thus extent of hydrophobic interaction in the GroEL-protein binding reaction can be varied depending on substrate proteins.

Intracellular proteolysis is the key step in antigen presentation events for protein antigens; hence, it is likely that increasing protein stability reduces the antigenicity of proteins. We prepared three hen egg white lysozyme derivatives possessing different stabilities by chemical modification to clarify the relationship between conformational stability and the antigenicity of the protein. One of the derivatives was conformationally unstabilized by removing one intramolecular disulfide bond, whereas the two others were stabilized by the addition of an intramolecular cross-link. The antigenicity of these derivatives was evaluated using hen egg white lysozyme-specific T-cell hybridoma cells and a B-lymphoma cell line, A20, as antigen-presenting cells. With an increase in conformational stability, the T-cell response decreased. However, the reduction was not derived from the inefficiency of internalization to A20 cells nor the alteration of antigenicity by chemical modifications. Moreover, from analyses of their susceptibility to proteolysis and the kinetics of presentation of the T-cell epitope, it was confirmed that increasing protein stability led to the depression of T-cell epitope generation by increasing resistance to proteolysis. These results have an important implication in devising a new strategy for manipulating T-cell response by the stability of protein antigen.

An antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell recognizes an antigen-derived peptide that is mounted on a major histocompatibility complex class II molecule on a cell surface of antigen-presenting cells, via its antigen receptor (1Schwartz R.H.

Prior to T-cell activation, however, antigen processing is necessary for a protein antigen to stimulate the specific T-cells; this processing consists of multiple steps of cellular events, i.e. internalization of proteins by antigen-presenting cells, reduction of the disulfide bond and unfolding of proteins, enzymatic digestion, and assembly of the generated peptides with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (3Harding C.V.

In this context, we can expect that depression of protein unfolding by increasing protein stability would reduce the antigenicity of proteins for T-cells.Several reports have demonstrated a relationship between increased antigenicity and the decreased stability of proteins (8Streicher H.Z.

However, the influence of protein stability on the antigenicity remains unknown. To address this issue, we prepared three derivatives of hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) 1The abbreviations used are: HEL, hen egg white lysozyme; IL-2, interleukin-2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TAP-Br, 3-(bromopropyl)trimethylammonium bromide; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; HGG, human gamma globulin. 1The abbreviations used are: HEL, hen egg white lysozyme; IL-2, interleukin-2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TAP-Br, 3-(bromopropyl)trimethylammonium bromide; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; HGG, human gamma globulin. possessing different conformational stabilities (see Table I). A three-disulfide derivative of HEL, S-carboxymethylated HEL at Cys6 and Cys127 (6,127CM-HEL), was produced by selective reduction of a disulfide bond Cys6-Cys127 in four original disulfide bridges (11Radford S.E. Woolfson D.N. Martin S.R. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The loss of a single disulfide bond was reported not to give major three-dimensional structural change (11Radford S.E. Woolfson D.N. Martin S.R. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Hill C.P. Johnston N.L. Cohen R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1992; 225: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HEL was stabilized by cross-linking between Lys1 and His15 with alkyl chain, 1–15CL-HEL (14Ueda T. Yamada H. Hirata M. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6316-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and by cross-linking between Glu35 and Trp108 through an ester bond, 35–108CL-HEL (15Imoto T. Hartdegen F.J. Rupley J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Johnson R.E. Adams P. Rupley J.A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These intramolecular bridges were shown not to cause structural constraint; therefore, they keep a similar native structure with enhancing protein stability (17Mizuno H. Ueda T. Yamada H. Imoto T. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 325-326Google Scholar, 18Beddell C.R. Blake C.C. Oatley S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using these derivatives, we evaluated the influence of the conformational stability of HEL on the steps of the antigen presentation pathway. We report that the increasing conformational stability of HEL resulted in reducing the antigenicity for HEL-specific T-cells. The results indicate that protein stability is an important factor in determining the dose of T-cell epitopes and consequently may determine the magnitude of T-cell response.Table IStability of HEL derivatives: melting temperature and conformational stabilityHEL derivativesΔT m1-aDifference in the melting temperature between native HEL and its derivative.ΔΔG 1-bConformational stability relative to native HEL.°Ckcal/mol6,127CM-HEL−241-cRadford et al.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe theory that the digestion of a small globular protein with a protease proceeds via the unfolded state rather than the folded state of the protein has been proposed by several investigators (5Matthyssens G.E. Simons G. Kanarek L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Pace C.N. Barrett A.J. Biochem.

Yagishita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 264-269Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The theory can be summarized by the following equation, N⇌D→PpeptideEquation 2 where N and D are the folded and the unfolded proteins, respectively, and P is the protease (7Imoto T. Yamada H. Ueda T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,30Imoto T. Fukuda K. Yagishita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 264-269Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Prior to antigen-specific T-cell activation, protein antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells and then degraded within intracellular acidic organelle by proteases, such as cathepsin B and D (31Roederer M. Bowser R. Murphy R.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Diment S. Leech M.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

The process of proteolysis is a limiting step in transmitting information of antigen to T-cells. Thus, the theory suggests that the stability of protein antigen may be a critical parameter in determining the rate of processing and also that by controlling antigen stability, the dose of antigenic peptides and the resulting T-cell response could be artificially manipulated. For this reason, the conformational stability of a protein antigen may be a critical factor in determining the immune response of lymphocytes against the foreign molecule. However, the precise role of the stability of antigens in T-cell activation has not been well defined, although its importance has been implied in several reports (8Streicher H.Z. Berkower I.J. Busch M. Gurd F.R. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6831-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Rouas N. Christophe S. Housseau F. Bellet D. Guillet J.G.

Immunol. 1996; 8: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).To examine the relationship between the conformational stability of antigens and the susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, three derivatives of HEL with different conformational stabilities (TableI) but with retained similar native conformation and unfolded HELs were prepared. As was indicated by the previous theory, the resistance of each HEL derivative to proteolysis was correlated with the stability. In accordance with the results, T-cell epitope generation of HEL was suppressed by increasing HEL stability, which resulted in reduced T-cell activation. We found a similar result when HEL-specific polyclonal T-cells were stimulated with these HEL derivatives, 2T. So, H.-O. Ito, T. Koga, S. Watanabe, T. Ueda, and T. Imoto, unpublished data. indicating that this result is not specific to the T-cell hybridoma used in this study.Rouas et al. reported that T-cell response for a subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin was dependent on the quaternary structure and that dissociation of the α/β subunit was required for the recognition (9Rouas N. Christophe S. Housseau F. Bellet D. Guillet J.G. Bidart J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 782-792PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Janssen et al. showed that a T-cell epitope of myelin basic protein inserted into the outer membrane protein PhoE of Escherichia coli was barely stimulative for the specific T-cell in the native trimeric form, whereas the denatured monomeric form was immunogenic and induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis (10Janssen R. Wauben M.H. Tommassen J. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These reports suggest the critical role of the quaternary structure of protein antigen in depressing the T-cell triggering response. The conformation of an oligomeric protein is generally stabilized by intermolecular interactions of the subunits (34Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5374-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Miller S. Lesk A.M. Janin J. Chothia C. Nature. 1987; 328: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and the previous two experiments suggest the role of intermolecular stabilization of a protein in depressing T-cell response. A favorable binding of a ligand to the folded state of the protein usually enhances the stability of the protein (36Kuroki R. Taniyama Y. Seko C. Nakamura H. Kikuchi M. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6903-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11703-11706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sorokin A. Lemmon M.A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stabilization by a ligand is expressed in the following equation, XN⇌XN⇌D→PpeptideEquation 3 where X is a ligand to bind to the folded state of the protein. Therefore, the theory regarding stabilizing a protein by intermolecular interaction may be explained to be different from the present theory where an equilibrium shifts from the unfolded state to the folded one by intramolecular interaction. Stabilization of proteins is generally achieved by introducing an additional cross-link either by chemical modification (14Ueda T. Yamada H. Hirata M. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6316-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Imoto T. Hartdegen F.J. Rupley J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Lin S.H. Konishi Y. Denton M.E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or by genetically introducing a disulfide bond (40Matsumura M. Signor G. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1989; 342: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 41Kanaya S. Katsuda C. Kimura S. Nakai T. Kitakuni E. Nakamura H. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Ikehara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6038-6044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the stability conferred by the cross-link can be largely related to the entropic destabilization of the unfolded state (42Poland D.C. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1965; 3: 373-399Google Scholar, 43Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strengthened conformational stability of 1–15CL-HEL and 35–108CL-HEL by the cross-link originates from this type of stabilization force. On the other hand, irreversible processes coupled with the unfolded state, such as protease digestions, can be effectively resisted by decreasing the unfolding rate as shown in the following equation, N⇌kfkuD→PpeptideEquation 4 where k u and k f are the unfolding and the folding rate constants, respectively (44Yamada H. Ueda T. Imoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 45Imoto T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of 35–108CL-HEL, this kind of stabilization force also has an effect on enhancing the stability (46Segawa S. Sugihara M. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 2489-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which may be involved in the higher resistance for proteolytic digestion and the most depressed T-cell-stimulating capacity. Alternatively, protein stabilization can be accomplished by strengthening favorable interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds (47Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 48Sali D. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1988; 335: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 49Alber T. Sun D.P. Wilson K. Wozniak J.A. Cook S.P. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1987; 330: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Also, conjugating the protein with a non-immunogenic polymer, polyethylene glycol, is effective in stabilizing proteins against proteolytic degradation, which resulted in the abortion of the T-cell-stimulating capacity of HEL (23So T. Ito H.-O. Koga T. Ueda T. Imoto T. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 49: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These genetic or protein engineering strategies are promising for regulating the generation of stimulatory peptides from the proteins.Some forms of chemical reactions are coupled with the unfolded state of proteins. The reactions causing irreversible denaturation are suggested to be the deamidation of asparagine residues, the hydrolysis of peptide bonds at aspartic acid residues, and the destruction of disulfide bonds (50Ahern T.J. Klibanov A.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 51Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3086-3091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of these chemical reactions in the unfolded state leads to the formation of irreversibly unfolded molecular species, which are highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Thus, the T-cell-triggering capacity of these irreversible forms may be greater than the native form, and these processes may increase the antigenicity of proteins. Indeed, we observed that native HEL stored in PBS solution at 4 °C for 1 month was more antigenic for T-cell hybridoma than the freshly purified one.2 Therefore, HEL derivatives used in this study were subjected to assays immediately after purification using cation exchange chromatography. Moreover, it has been demonstrated by Weigle and his colleagues that an aggregated form of human gamma globulin (HGG) is highly antigenic for T-cells (52Levich J.D. Parks D.E. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 873-878PubMed Google Scholar,53Levich J.D. Signorella A.P. Wittenberg G. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3675-3679PubMed Google Scholar), whereas an aqueous preparation of HGG (deaggregated HGG) that is ultracentrifuged to remove small amounts of aggregates is highly tolerogenic for T-cells, i.e. injection of adult mice with deaggregated HGG renders them immunologically unresponsive to a subsequent injection of the immunogenic HGG (54Chiller J.M. Habicht G.S. Weigle W.O. Science. 1971; 171: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 55Parks D.E. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1230-1236PubMed Google Scholar). According to the present theory, the difference in their immunological properties between the deaggregated HGG and the untreated one may be attributed to the amount of irreversibly unfolded HGG (aggregated HGG) in the solutions, which may be extremely sensitive to protease degradation in vivo, resulting in the generation of greater quantities of antigenic peptides for the T-cells.In conclusion, this article reports the first evidence to show the effect of the conformational stability of a protein antigen on T-cell-triggering response and the related mechanism. The finding that the production of the T-cell epitope can be controlled by the conformational stability of a protein antigen may have many ramifications for manipulating T-cell immunity. An antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell recognizes an antigen-derived peptide that is mounted on a major histocompatibility complex class II molecule on a cell surface of antigen-presenting cells, via its antigen receptor (1Schwartz R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1985; 3: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Buus S. Sette A. Colon S.M. Jenis D.M. Grey H.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conformation of protein antigens is unlikely to have any role in the step of T-cell recognition. Prior to T-cell activation, however, antigen processing is necessary for a protein antigen to stimulate the specific T-cells; this processing consists of multiple steps of cellular events, i.e. internalization of proteins by antigen-presenting cells, reduction of the disulfide bond and unfolding of proteins, enzymatic digestion, and assembly of the generated peptides with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (3Harding C.V. Unanue E.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,4Jensen P.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3347-3356PubMed Google Scholar). Proteases preferentially digest proteins in an unfolded state rather than those in a folded state (5Matthyssens G.E. Simons G. Kanarek L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Pace C.N. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Imoto T. Yamada H. Ueda T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); thus, the unfolding may be a crucial step for intracellular antigen processing. In this context, we can expect that depression of protein unfolding by increasing protein stability would reduce the antigenicity of proteins for T-cells. Several reports have demonstrated a relationship between increased antigenicity and the decreased stability of proteins (8Streicher H.Z. Berkower I.J. Busch M. Gurd F.R. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl.

However, the influence of protein stability on the antigenicity remains unknown. To address this issue, we prepared three derivatives of hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) 1The abbreviations used are: HEL, hen egg white lysozyme; IL-2, interleukin-2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TAP-Br, 3-(bromopropyl)trimethylammonium bromide; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; HGG, human gamma globulin. 1The abbreviations used are: HEL, hen egg white lysozyme; IL-2, interleukin-2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TAP-Br, 3-(bromopropyl)trimethylammonium bromide; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; HGG, human gamma globulin. possessing different conformational stabilities (see Table I). A three-disulfide derivative of HEL, S-carboxymethylated HEL at Cys6 and Cys127 (6,127CM-HEL), was produced by selective reduction of a disulfide bond Cys6-Cys127 in four original disulfide bridges (11Radford S.E. Woolfson D.N. Martin S.R. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The loss of a single disulfide bond was reported not to give major three-dimensional structural change (11Radford S.E. Woolfson D.N. Martin S.R. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Hill C.P. Johnston N.L. Cohen R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4136-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but to dramatically decrease the conformational stability (13Eyles S.J. Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HEL was stabilized by cross-linking between Lys1 and His15 with alkyl chain, 1–15CL-HEL (14Ueda T. Yamada H. Hirata M. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6316-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and by cross-linking between Glu35 and Trp108 through an ester bond, 35–108CL-HEL (15Imoto T. Hartdegen F.J. Rupley J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Johnson R.E. Adams P. Rupley J.A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These intramolecular bridges were shown not to cause structural constraint; therefore, they keep a similar native structure with enhancing protein stability (17Mizuno H. Ueda T. Yamada H. Imoto T. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 325-326Google Scholar, 18Beddell C.R. Blake C.C. Oatley S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using these derivatives, we evaluated the influence of the conformational stability of HEL on the steps of the antigen presentation pathway. We report that the increasing conformational stability of HEL resulted in reducing the antigenicity for HEL-specific T-cells. The results indicate that protein stability is an important factor in determining the dose of T-cell epitopes and consequently may determine the magnitude of T-cell response. DISCUSSIONThe theory that the digestion of a small globular protein with a protease proceeds via the unfolded state rather than the folded state of the protein has been proposed by several investigators (5Matthyssens G.E. Simons G. Kanarek L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Pace C.N. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Imoto T. Yamada H. Ueda T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Imoto T. Fukuda K. Yagishita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 264-269Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The theory can be summarized by the following equation, N⇌D→PpeptideEquation 2 where N and D are the folded and the unfolded proteins, respectively, and P is the protease (7Imoto T. Yamada H. Ueda T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,30Imoto T. Fukuda K. Yagishita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 264-269Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Prior to antigen-specific T-cell activation, protein antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells and then degraded within intracellular acidic organelle by proteases, such as cathepsin B and D (31Roederer M. Bowser R. Murphy R.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Diment S. Leech M.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schmid S.L. Fuchs R. Male P. Mellman I. Cell. 1988; 52: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The process of proteolysis is a limiting step in transmitting information of antigen to T-cells. Thus, the theory suggests that the stability of protein antigen may be a critical parameter in determining the rate of processing and also that by controlling antigen stability, the dose of antigenic peptides and the resulting T-cell response could be artificially manipulated. For this reason, the conformational stability of a protein antigen may be a critical factor in determining the immune response of lymphocytes against the foreign molecule. However, the precise role of the stability of antigens in T-cell activation has not been well defined, although its importance has been implied in several reports (8Streicher H.Z. Berkower I.J. Busch M. Gurd F.R. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6831-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Rouas N. Christophe S. Housseau F. Bellet D. Guillet J.G. Bidart J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 782-792PubMed Google Scholar, 10Janssen R. Wauben M.H. Tommassen J. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).To examine the relationship between the conformational stability of antigens and the susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, three derivatives of HEL with different conformational stabilities (TableI) but with retained similar native conformation and unfolded HELs were prepared. As was indicated by the previous theory, the resistance of each HEL derivative to proteolysis was correlated with the stability. In accordance with the results, T-cell epitope generation of HEL was suppressed by increasing HEL stability, which resulted in reduced T-cell activation. We found a similar result when HEL-specific polyclonal T-cells were stimulated with these HEL derivatives, 2T. So, H.-O. Ito, T. Koga, S. Watanabe, T. Ueda, and T. Imoto, unpublished data. indicating that this result is not specific to the T-cell hybridoma used in this study.Rouas et al. reported that T-cell response for a subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin was dependent on the quaternary structure and that dissociation of the α/β subunit was required for the recognition (9Rouas N. Christophe S. Housseau F. Bellet D. Guillet J.G. Bidart J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 782-792PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Janssen et al. showed that a T-cell epitope of myelin basic protein inserted into the outer membrane protein PhoE of Escherichia coli was barely stimulative for the specific T-cell in the native trimeric form, whereas the denatured monomeric form was immunogenic and induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis (10Janssen R. Wauben M.H. Tommassen J. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These reports suggest the critical role of the quaternary structure of protein antigen in depressing the T-cell triggering response. The conformation of an oligomeric protein is generally stabilized by intermolecular interactions of the subunits (34Beernink P.T. Tolan D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5374-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Miller S. Lesk A.M. Janin J. Chothia C. Nature. 1987; 328: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and the previous two experiments suggest the role of intermolecular stabilization of a protein in depressing T-cell response. A favorable binding of a ligand to the folded state of the protein usually enhances the stability of the protein (36Kuroki R. Taniyama Y. Seko C. Nakamura H. Kikuchi M. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6903-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11703-11706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sorokin A. Lemmon M.A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stabilization by a ligand is expressed in the following equation, XN⇌XN⇌D→PpeptideEquation 3 where X is a ligand to bind to the folded state of the protein. Therefore, the theory regarding stabilizing a protein by intermolecular interaction may be explained to be different from the present theory where an equilibrium shifts from the unfolded state to the folded one by intramolecular interaction. Stabilization of proteins is generally achieved by introducing an additional cross-link either by chemical modification (14Ueda T. Yamada H. Hirata M. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6316-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Imoto T. Hartdegen F.J. Rupley J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Lin S.H. Konishi Y. Denton M.E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or by genetically introducing a disulfide bond (40Matsumura M. Signor G. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1989; 342: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 41Kanaya S. Katsuda C. Kimura S. Nakai T. Kitakuni E. Nakamura H. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Ikehara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6038-6044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the stability conferred by the cross-link can be largely related to the entropic destabilization of the unfolded state (42Poland D.C. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1965; 3: 373-399Google Scholar, 43Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strengthened conformational stability of 1–15CL-HEL and 35–108CL-HEL by the cross-link originates from this type of stabilization force. On the other hand, irreversible processes coupled with the unfolded state, such as protease digestions, can be effectively resisted by decreasing the unfolding rate as shown in the following equation, N⇌kfkuD→PpeptideEquation 4 where k u and k f are the unfolding and the folding rate constants, respectively (44Yamada H. Ueda T. Imoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 45Imoto T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of 35–108CL-HEL, this kind of stabilization force also has an effect on enhancing the stability (46Segawa S. Sugihara M. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 2489-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which may be involved in the higher resistance for proteolytic digestion and the most depressed T-cell-stimulating capacity. Alternatively, protein stabilization can be accomplished by strengthening favorable interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds (47Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 48Sali D. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1988; 335: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 49Alber T. Sun D.P. Wilson K. Wozniak J.A. Cook S.P. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1987; 330: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Also, conjugating the protein with a non-immunogenic polymer, polyethylene glycol, is effective in stabilizing proteins against proteolytic degradation, which resulted in the abortion of the T-cell-stimulating capacity of HEL (23So T. Ito H.-O. Koga T. Ueda T. Imoto T. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 49: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These genetic or protein engineering strategies are promising for regulating the generation of stimulatory peptides from the proteins.Some forms of chemical reactions are coupled with the unfolded state of proteins. The reactions causing irreversible denaturation are suggested to be the deamidation of asparagine residues, the hydrolysis of peptide bonds at aspartic acid residues, and the destruction of disulfide bonds (50Ahern T.J. Klibanov A.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 51Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3086-3091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of these chemical reactions in the unfolded state leads to the formation of irreversibly unfolded molecular species, which are highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Thus, the T-cell-triggering capacity of these irreversible forms may be greater than the native form, and these processes may increase the antigenicity of proteins. Indeed, we observed that native HEL stored in PBS solution at 4 °C for 1 month was more antigenic for T-cell hybridoma than the freshly purified one.2 Therefore, HEL derivatives used in this study were subjected to assays immediately after purification using cation exchange chromatography. Moreover, it has been demonstrated by Weigle and his colleagues that an aggregated form of human gamma globulin (HGG) is highly antigenic for T-cells (52Levich J.D. Parks D.E. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 873-878PubMed Google Scholar,53Levich J.D. Signorella A.P. Wittenberg G. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3675-3679PubMed Google Scholar), whereas an aqueous preparation of HGG (deaggregated HGG) that is ultracentrifuged to remove small amounts of aggregates is highly tolerogenic for T-cells, i.e. injection of adult mice with deaggregated HGG renders them immunologically unresponsive to a subsequent injection of the immunogenic HGG (54Chiller J.M. Habicht G.S. Weigle W.O. Science. 1971; 171: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 55Parks D.E. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1230-1236PubMed Google Scholar). According to the present theory, the difference in their immunological properties between the deaggregated HGG and the untreated one may be attributed to the amount of irreversibly unfolded HGG (aggregated HGG) in the solutions, which may be extremely sensitive to protease degradation in vivo, resulting in the generation of greater quantities of antigenic peptides for the T-cells.In conclusion, this article reports the first evidence to show the effect of the conformational stability of a protein antigen on T-cell-triggering response and the related mechanism. The finding that the production of the T-cell epitope can be controlled by the conformational stability of a protein antigen may have many ramifications for manipulating T-cell immunity.

Incubation of p37 with phosphatidylcholine labeled in the fatty acyl side chains resulted in the production of multiple lipid products that were identified by thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry as diacylglycerol, free fatty acid, monoacylglycerol, and lysophosphatidylcholine. Lipid-metabolizing activities colocalized with p37-containing fractions throughout the chromatographic steps. p37 also metabolized phosphatidylethanolamine efficiently, but it had less activity toward phosphatidylinositol and little or no activity toward phosphatidylserine. The purified enzyme also metabolized triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol but was inactive toward sn-1,2-diacylglycerol. p37 was also expressed in insect cells as a poly-His fusion protein; cell lysates and partially purified proteins also generated products expected from phospholipase C and A activities. Thus, p37 is a broad specificity lipase with phospholipase C, phospholipase A, and triacylglycerol lipase activities. p37, the major protein of the extracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus, is involved in the biogenesis of the viral double membrane and in egress of virus from the cell. p37 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and was purified to homogeneity by silver staining using glutathione-agarose, Sephacryl S-200, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography.

Vaccinia virus is a member of the Poxviridae, a family of large, complex DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells (1Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Chanock R.M. Hirsh M.S.

The infectious virion may exist as an intracellular mature virion (IMV), 1The abbreviations used are: IMV, intracellular mature virus; IEV, intracellular enveloped virus; EEV, extracellular enveloped virus; TLC, thin layer chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FAB, fast atom bombardment. 1The abbreviations used are: IMV, intracellular mature virus; IEV, intracellular enveloped virus; EEV, extracellular enveloped virus; TLC, thin layer chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FAB, fast atom bombardment. intracellular enveloped virus (IEV), or an extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). Forms of the virus having an outer envelope (IEV and EEV) are more infective than the IMV form. The outer envelope of the EEV contains 10 EEV-specific viral proteins (3Payne L.G. J. Virol. 1978; 27: 28-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Payne L.G. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) including an abundant palmitoylated protein with a molecular mass of 37 kDa (p37) which is encoded by the virus. In infected cells, p37 becomes localized initially to the trans-Golgi network where it is associated with the cytosolic face of the organelle (5Schmelz M. Sodeik B. Ericsson M. Wolffe E.J. Shida H. Hiller G. Griffiths G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 130-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral egress first involves wrapping the IMV with Golgi-derived membrane to form the double membrane of the IEV. The outer layer subsequently fuses with the plasma membrane of the cell to release the EEV, which contains a single outer envelope membrane.p37 plays a role in membrane biogenesis and/or membrane fusion. Deletion of the gene encoding p37 results in the failure to form the outer envelope and a resulting inability to produce extracellular virus (6Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intact virus is also capable of cell-to-cell transmission, and this function is also lost in the p37-deficient virus (6Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, infected cells undergo fusion of their plasma membranes at low pH, and this fails to occur in the p37-deficient virus. These data imply a critical role for p37 in membrane biogenesis and/or processes requiring membrane fusion, but the mechanism for such a role is unclear. Early suggestions that p37 may provide a docking site for viral envelopment have received little experimental support (7Schmutz C. Rindisbacher L. Galmiche M. Wittek R. Virology. 1995; 213: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Ulaeto D. Grosenbach D. Hruby D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), so the function of p37 remains an open question.During the course of studies on phospholipase D, we and others (9Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; : 242-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have noted significant homology between a 17-amino acid region of p37 (residues 313–329) and a conserved region among phospholipases D, phosphatidylserine synthases, and cardiolipin synthases. This region, termed the HKD domain, is essential for the catalytic activity of phospholipase D (11Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The homology, together with the putative functions related to membrane biogenesis and fusion, prompted us to search for phospholipid-metabolizing activities of p37. Herein we demonstrate that the p37 viral protein has both phospholipase C and phospholipase A activities toward a variety of lipid substrates. We suggest that one or more of these activities are involved in the biological function of p37.DISCUSSIONThis study has identified broad specificity lipase activity associated with the vaccinia virus protein p37. The activities that have been demonstrated are summarized in Fig.9, which shows the metabolism of phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol. In this figure, p37 contains a phospholipase C as well as a phospholipase A activity (both PLA1 and PLA2) toward phosphatidylcholine. In addition to the four products produced by these activities (diacylglycerol, choline phosphate, lysophosphatidylcholine, and free fatty acid), p37 also produces monoacylglycerol. As shown in Fig. 9(dashed line), we presume that this derives from lysophosphatidylcholine by cleavage of the headgroup in a phospholipase C-like reaction. The other possible route to this product would be through hydrolysis of diacylglycerol. However, this reaction fails to occur in vitro, implicating the former mechanism of formation. Also shown in Fig. 9 is the metabolism of triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol plus fatty acid. This reaction fails to produce monoacylglycerol, consistent with the inability of p37 to metabolize diacylglycerol further. In addition to phosphatidylcholine, the phospholipase activities can utilize both phosphatidylethanolamine and (to a lesser extent) phosphatidylinositol, although the product distribution differs somewhat depending on the phospholipid used. We were unable to detect any evidence for a phospholipase D type activity.The occurrence of headgroup release and diacylglycerol generation in lysates from insect cells infected with baculovirus expressing p37-His6 confirms the phospholipase C activity of p37. This fusion protein was significantly more active than the p37-GST protein in catalyzing the phospholipase C reaction. The occurrence of increased monoacylglycerol in lysates from infected cells can be taken as evidence confirming a phospholipase A-like reaction. The inability to observe lysophosphatidylcholine using p37-His6 is consistent with the considerably higher phospholipase C activity of this version of the protein compared with p37-GST. We suggest (see Fig.9) that any lysophosphatidylcholine that is formed is cleaved rapidly to monoacylglycerol via a (lyso)phospholipase C activity. The product distribution seen with p37-His6 raises the distinct possibility that the quantitatively most important activity in vivo is phospholipase C acting on both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. It will be necessary to express the protein in mammalian cells in its native palmitoylated form to evaluate fully these activities in their native settings.The mechanism for this broad specificity lipase is unclear. There are features of p37 activity which are similar to those of hepatic and extrahepatic lipases, which are known to have broad substrate specificity for phospholipids, can also act on neutral lipids such as triacylglycerol, and do not require calcium (26Waite M. Vance D. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 211-236Google Scholar). However, we are not aware of a lipase of this type which catalyzes both phospholipase C and phospholipase A type activities (phosphodiesterase and acylesterase). It is possible that there are two distinct active sites on p37. This is consistent with the presence of duplication of three distinct regions within p37, which are suggestive of gene duplication 2J. D. Lambeth, unpublished results. (27Cao J.-X. Koop B. Upton C. Virus Res. 1997; 48: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Members of the phospholipase D family also contain these homologous duplicated regions, including the HKD region, which is found in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of phospholipase Ds. However, mutation of either HKD region results in complete loss of activity of PLD2 (11Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least for phospholipase D, both regions cooperate in forming the PLD active site.Motif 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The role of the catalytic activity in the in vivo function of p37 is currently unknown. The protein becomes incorporated into the cytosolic face of trans-Golgi membranes and might be involved in somehow redirecting Golgi membranes from their normal fates to the virus, where they participate in enveloping the virion in a double membrane. Virus that lacks p37 fails to mature to the enveloped stage, and infected cells fail to fuse with one another (6Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that p37 may function in processes involving membrane fusion. In this regard, it is interesting to note that diacylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, and free fatty acid have all been described as lipids that induce membrane fusion (29Siegel D.P. Banschbach J.

An important recent study with the yeast phospholipid transfer protein Sec14 (which had previously linked phospholipid metabolism to Golgi vesicle trafficking) implicated diacylglycerol as an essential component in vesicle-mediated transport from Golgi (34Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphatidic acid, which can be formed not only directly via phospholipase D but also secondarily from diacylglycerol by the action of cellular diacylglycerol kinase, has been implicated in the Arf-dependent recruitment of coatamer to budding Golgi to form transport vesicles (35Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Proof of the role for p37 lipase activities in viral envelopment and membrane biogenesis must await identification of the active site(s) and demonstration that crippling the activities correlated with a loss in viral envelopment and release. Such studies are currently under way.Other viruses may utilize similar mechanisms as part of their life cycles. Perez et al. (36Perez L. Irurzun A. Carrasco L. Virology. 1993; 194: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that during the infection of HeLa cells with Semliki forest virus, or baby hamster kidney cells with vesicular stomatitis virus, there is a significant increase in the release of choline phosphate and arachidonic acid into the culture medium, suggesting that both phospholipases C and A become activated during infection. To our knowledge, there are no similar data for poxvirus infections. Little is known about the molecular mechanism used by viruses to alter membrane structures. The specific viral components responsible for these modifications have not been identified, nor have their effects on cells been analyzed. Our data raise the possibility that p37 may be such a component in pox viruses.

Members of the phospholipase D family also contain these homologous duplicated regions, including the HKD region, which is found in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of phospholipase Ds. However, mutation of either HKD region results in complete loss of activity of PLD2 (11Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least for phospholipase D, both regions cooperate in forming the PLD active site. The role of the catalytic activity in the in vivo function of p37 is currently unknown. The protein becomes incorporated into the cytosolic face of trans-Golgi membranes and might be involved in somehow redirecting Golgi membranes from their normal fates to the virus, where they participate in enveloping the virion in a double membrane. Virus that lacks p37 fails to mature to the enveloped stage, and infected cells fail to fuse with one another (6Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that p37 may function in processes involving membrane fusion. In this regard, it is interesting to note that diacylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, and free fatty acid have all been described as lipids that induce membrane fusion (29Siegel D.P. Banschbach J.

An important recent study with the yeast phospholipid transfer protein Sec14 (which had previously linked phospholipid metabolism to Golgi vesicle trafficking) implicated diacylglycerol as an essential component in vesicle-mediated transport from Golgi (34Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphatidic acid, which can be formed not only directly via phospholipase D but also secondarily from diacylglycerol by the action of cellular diacylglycerol kinase, has been implicated in the Arf-dependent recruitment of coatamer to budding Golgi to form transport vesicles (35Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Proof of the role for p37 lipase activities in viral envelopment and membrane biogenesis must await identification of the active site(s) and demonstration that crippling the activities correlated with a loss in viral envelopment and release. Such studies are currently under way. Other viruses may utilize similar mechanisms as part of their life cycles. Perez et al. (36Perez L. Irurzun A. Carrasco L. Virology. 1993; 194: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that during the infection of HeLa cells with Semliki forest virus, or baby hamster kidney cells with vesicular stomatitis virus, there is a significant increase in the release of choline phosphate and arachidonic acid into the culture medium, suggesting that both phospholipases C and A become activated during infection. To our knowledge, there are no similar data for poxvirus infections. Little is known about the molecular mechanism used by viruses to alter membrane structures. The specific viral components responsible for these modifications have not been identified, nor have their effects on cells been analyzed. Our data raise the possibility that p37 may be such a component in pox viruses.

https://openalex.org/W1974346608,"In addition to its kinase activity, the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) of smooth muscle has an actin binding activity through which it can regulate the actin-myosin interaction of smooth muscle (Kohama, K., Okagaki, T., Hayakawa, K., Lin, Y., Ishikawa, R., Shimmen, T., and Inoue, A. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 184, 1204–1211). In this study, we have analyzed the actin binding activity of MLCK and related it to its amino acid sequence by producing native and recombinant fragments of MLCK. Parent MLCK exhibited both calcium ion (Ca2+) and calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-sensitive and Ca2+/CaM-insensitive binding to actin filaments. The native fragment, which consists of the Met1–Lys114 sequence (Kanoh, S., Ito, M., Niwa, E., Kawano, Y., and Hartshorne, D. J. (1993)Biochemistry 32, 8902–8907), and the recombinant NN fragment, which contains this 1–114 sequence, showed only Ca2+/CaM-sensitive binding. An inhibitory effect of the NN fragment on the actin-myosin interaction was observed by assaying in vitro motility and by measuring the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin. The recombinant NN/41 fragment, which is constructed without the Met1–Pro41 sequence of the NN fragment, lost both the actin binding activity and the inhibitory effect. We confirmed the importance of the 1–41 sequence by using a few synthetic peptides to compete against the NN fragment in binding to actin filaments. The experiments using recombinant fragments and synthetic peptides also revealed that the site for CaM-binding is the Pro26–Pro41 sequence. The site for the Ca2+/CaM-insensitive binding, which is shown to be localized between the Ca2+/CaM-sensitive site and the central kinase domain of MLCK, exerted no regulatory effects on the actin-myosin interaction. In addition to its kinase activity, the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) of smooth muscle has an actin binding activity through which it can regulate the actin-myosin interaction of smooth muscle (Kohama, K., Okagaki, T., Hayakawa, K., Lin, Y., Ishikawa, R., Shimmen, T., and Inoue, A. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 184, 1204–1211). In this study, we have analyzed the actin binding activity of MLCK and related it to its amino acid sequence by producing native and recombinant fragments of MLCK. Parent MLCK exhibited both calcium ion (Ca2+) and calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-sensitive and Ca2+/CaM-insensitive binding to actin filaments. The native fragment, which consists of the Met1–Lys114 sequence (Kanoh, S., Ito, M., Niwa, E., Kawano, Y., and Hartshorne, D. J.

The site for the Ca2+/CaM-insensitive binding, which is shown to be localized between the Ca2+/CaM-sensitive site and the central kinase domain of MLCK, exerted no regulatory effects on the actin-myosin interaction. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) 1The abbreviations used are: MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; CaM, calmodulin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NTCB fragment, chicken gizzard MLCK fragment produced by the cleavage with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid; NN fragment, expressed fragment (amino acids 1–337 of bovine MLCK); NC fragment, expressed fragment (amino acids 319–721 of bovine stomach MLCK); NN/25 fragment, expressed fragment (amino acid 26–337 of bovine stomach MLCK); NN/41 fragment, expressed fragment (amino acid 42–337 bovine stomach MLCK). has an important regulatory role in smooth muscle contraction (see Ref. 1Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review). MLCK phosphorylates the 20-kDa light chain of smooth muscle myosin together with calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ ions (Ca2+/CaM), thereby activating the myosin, which can then interact with actin filaments to induce contraction. In addition to this kinase activity, MLCK can act as an actin-binding protein; MLCK is present in association with the sarcomeric I-band (2Guerriero Jr., V. Rowley D.R. Mean A.R. Cell. 1981; 27: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and it binds to actin filaments with a high affinity (3Dabrowska R. Hinkins S. Walsh M.P. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. J. Biol.

We have shown that MLCK can inhibit the ATP-dependent interaction between actin and myosin by binding to actin filaments. This inhibition can be relieved by Ca2+/CaM, as was demonstrated by avoiding the complication derived from its kinase activity (6Kohama K. Okagaki T. Hayakawa K. Lin Y. Ishikawa R. Shimmen T. Inoue A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1204-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Ye L.-H. Hayakawa K. Lin Y. Okagaki T. Fujita K. Kohama K. J. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although the demonstration was limited to in vitro only. Such an inhibition, however, is not peculiar to MLCK. Caldesmon (see Ref. 9Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a review) and calponin (10Takahashi K. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13284-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are known to inhibit the actin-myosin interaction by binding to actin, an inhibition that is relieved by Ca2+/CaM. Twenty years ago, Hartshorne et al. (11Hartshorne D.J. Abrams L. Aksoy M. Dabrowska R. Driska S. Sharkey E. Stephens N.L. The Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1977: 513-532Google Scholar) obtained an inhibitory fraction from chicken gizzard in a preliminary form. The activity of the 130-kDa component of their fraction relates to the actin-binding property of MLCK. By measuring the content of MLCK, caldesmon, and calponin in the myofibril of smooth muscle (12Ye L.-H. Hayakawa K. Okagaki T. Kohama K. Nakano T. Hartshorne D.J. Regulation of the Contractile Cycle in Smooth Muscle. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1995: 159-173Crossref Google Scholar), we have shown previously how the actin-binding property of MLCK participates in regulating smooth muscle contraction. The relationship between the structure of MLCK and the function of the kinase activity in phosphorylating the myosin light chain and how Ca2+/CaM modulates the activity has been well established (see Ref. 13Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 362-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar for a review). However, there has been little study of the structure-function relationship of the actin binding activity except for the purification of an actin-binding fragment from MLCK (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated which sequence of MLCK is responsible for the actin binding activity, which sequence inhibits the actin-myosin interaction, and which sequence binds CaM to relieve the inhibition. Our approach has been to cleave MLCK to prepare native fragments containing the actin binding activity (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), to design MLCK cDNA to express the recombinant fragments of actin binding activity in Escherichia coli, and then to analyze them biochemically. A few peptides have been synthesized to confirm these analyses. We have shown that: (i) MLCK has two actin-binding sites on the N-terminal side away from the central kinase domain, (ii) the binding site responsible for the inhibitory effect is at the Met1–Pro41 sequence, and (iii) CaM interacts with MLCK at the Pro26–Pro41 sequence. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. The purity of proteins was routinely monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (see below) so that they were >95% pure. The purified proteins, except actin and myosin (see below), were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C until they were used. All columns (see below) were incorporated into a high performance liquid chromatography system (model L-6200; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). MLCK was prepared by the method of Adelstein and Klee (15Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification (16Hayakawa K. Okagaki T. Higashi-Fujime S. Kohama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In short, MLCK was extracted from the smooth muscle of chicken gizzard and was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. After fractionation, MLCK was purified using column chromatography in DEAE-Toyopearl 650M columns and subsequently in SP-Toyopearl 650M (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) columns; this MLCK was used in all experiments unless otherwise specified. We also purified MLCK from bovine stomach smooth muscle by a modification (6Kohama K. Okagaki T. Hayakawa K. Lin Y. Ishikawa R. Shimmen T. Inoue A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1204-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) of the method of Kuwayama et al. (17Kuwayama H. Suzuki M. Koga R. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and used this for a few experiments, in which it is specified as bovine stomach MLCK. MLCK was cleaved by 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid (NTCB) complex at a Cys site, and an actin-binding fragment was purified as described by Kanoh et al. (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fragment consisted of the Met1–Lys114 sequence (14Kanoh S. Ito M. Niwa E. Kawano Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8902-8907Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Olson N.J. Pearson R.B. Needleman D.S. Hurwitz M.Y. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and is referred to as the NTCB fragment. Skeletal muscle actin was purified from an acetone powder of chicken breast muscle (19Matsumura F. Lin J.J.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and used as actin filaments after polymerization. The concentrations of actin filaments were expressed in terms of monomericactin. Myosin was purified from chicken gizzard as described by Nakamura and Nonomura (20Nakamura S. Nonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), who modified the method of Ebashi (21Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 79: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) to remove phosphatase activities. The myosin was phosphorylated by incubation with MLCK in the presence of Ca2+/CaM for 10 min at 25 °C as described by Okagaki et al. (22Okagaki T. Higashi-Fujime S. Ishikawa R. Takano-Ohmuro H. Kohama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 108: 858-866Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and used as myosin in our experiments. CaM from bovine brain, glucose oxidase, and catalase were purchased from Sigma. For the expression of recombinant MLCK fragments, the pET system (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Series of cDNA fragments (see Fig. 6for their topology) encoding various domains of bovine stomach MLCK (23Kobayashi H. Inoue A. Mikawa T. Kuwayama H. Hotta Y. Masaki T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified fragments were subcloned into a pET21 vector and verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant MLCK fragment was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3). The cells were grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5–0.6 in 2 liters of Luria broth medium containing ampicillin (50 μg ml−1) and then were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. All of the fragments were soluble in low salt. Therefore, cells expressing the fragments were collected by centrifugation, and then were suspended in 40 ml of a solution of 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The resulting supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The fragments were purified from the fraction by column chromatography using a combination of DEAE-Toyopearl 650M and CM-Toyopearl 650M columns (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). When any minor contaminants were found in SDS-PAGE, they were removed by gel filtration with Superose 12HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The MLCK fragments were: NN-, NC-NN/25, and NN/41 fragments, which were composed of Met1–Lys337, Pro319–Val721, Pro26–Lys337, and Lys42–Lys337 of bovine stomach MLCK (23Kobayashi H. Inoue A. Mikawa T. Kuwayama H. Hotta Y. Masaki T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), respectively. The amino acid sequences of these fragments were confirmed by sequencing about 7 residues from their N termini using an Applied Biosystems model 477A analyzer. Peptides of the MLCK sequences (18Olson N.J. Pearson R.B. Needleman D.S. Hurwitz M.Y. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) of Met1–Pro41, Lys42–Ala80, Met1–Gly25, Ser787–Ser815, Ala796–Ser834, and Pro26–Pro41 were synthesized using a MilliGen 9050 peptide synthesizer and then purified according to the manufacturer's instructions for Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl) chemistry. The sequences of the peptides were routine ly confirmed by amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 477A analyzer. Actin filaments at a concentration of 12 μm were mixed with specified amounts of MLCK, its fragments, and/or CaM in 50 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm Ca2+ unless otherwise specified in the figure legends. The mixture was incubated for 0.5 h at 25 °C. The mixture after incubation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman Airfuge at 25 °C. The amount of MLCK both in the supernatants and the pellets was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometry as described above, and then the amount of MLCK bound to actin filaments was calculated (24Ishikawa R. Okagaki T. Higashi-Fujime S. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21784-21790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay for the binding activity of the fragments of MLCK was done in the same way. The results were analyzed on Scatchard plots. The binding interaction between CaM and MLCK or its fragments was also measured by surface plasmon resonance with the IAsys Cubette System (Fissons, Cambridge, United Kingdom). CaM was immobilized to the cubette of carboxymethylated dextran matrix via N-hydroxysuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's protocol. MLCK and its recombinant fragments, after dissolving in 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mm Ca2+ or 0.1 mm EGTA, were added to the cubette. Then the resultant resonance at 25 °C was recorded. In some experiments, the binding of MLCK or its fragments was monitored in the presence of various concentrations of synthetic peptides. The effect of MLCK and its fragments on the ATP-dependent interaction between actin and myosin was analyzed by means of an in vitro motility assay on a myosin-coated surface (see Ref. 25Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 379-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar for the method), as modified for smooth muscle myosin by Okagaki et al. (22Okagaki T. Higashi-Fujime S. Ishikawa R. Takano-Ohmuro H. Kohama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 108: 858-866Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In short, 3 nm actin filaments labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were mounted on a coverslip coated with myosin together with various concentrations of MLCK in 50 mm KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EGTA. To see the effect of Ca2+/CaM, EGTA was replaced by 0.1 mmCa2+ and CaM at the same molar concentration as MLCK. Glucose oxidase (0.2 mg ml−1, Sigma), catalase (0.04 mg ml−1, Sigma), and glucose (4.5 mg ml−1) were added to the above solution to prevent photobleaching of rhodamine. The movement of actin filaments was recorded under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a videocamera and a recorder. The average velocity was measured using an image analyzer (Image Sigma III, Nippon Avionics, Tokyo, Japan). The effect of recombinant MLCK fragments on the actin-myosin interaction was also examined by measuring ATP hydrolyzed at 25 °C for 10 min with 0.05 μm phosphorylated myosin in the presence of various concentrations of MLCK and its fragments under the conditions of 2 μm actin filaments, 0.5 mmATP, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) unless otherwise specified. The liberated phosphate was quantified in duplicate or triplicate by the malachite green method of Kodama et al. (26Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We ensured that the rate of ATP hydrolysis was constant and that the specific activity of the ATPase did not differ from our previously reported values. Therefore, we expressed the activity as a normalized ATPase activity (27Lin Y. Ishikawa R. Okagaki T. Ye L.-H. Kohama K. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 29: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) with a slight modification (24Ishikawa R. Okagaki T. Higashi-Fujime S. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21784-21790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so that we could check the purity (>95%) of MLCK and its fragments. Protein concentrations were determined using the methods of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) and Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The molecular masses used for calculating concentrations (m) of proteins and peptides were obtained from their amino acid sequences as follows: myosin, 440 kDa; actin, 41.8 kDa; CaM, 16.7 kDa; MLCK, 107.5 kDa; bovine stomach MLCK, 128.8 kDa; NTCB fragment, 12.4 kDa; NN fragment, 35.3 kDa; NC fragment, 44.4 kDa; NN/41 fragment, 30.7 kDa; NN/25 fragment, 33.3 kDa; 787–815 peptide, 3.4 kDa; 796–834 peptide, 4.1 kDa; 1–25 peptide, 3.0 kDa; 26–41 peptide, 1.7 kDa; 1–41 peptide, 4.8 kDa; 42–80 peptide, 4.0 kDa. Homology of the specified amino acid sequences of MLCK with the sequences of other proteins was examined using MacDNASIS Pro 020–00 (Hitachi Software Engineering, San Bruno, CA) to search the GenBank/NBRF-PIR/SWISS-PROT data bases. Isoelectric points of the synthetic peptides were calculated according to Skoog and Wichman (31Skoog B. Wichman A. Trends Anal. Chem. 1986; 5: 82-83Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We designed a fragment so that it consisted of Met1–Lys337 of bovine stomach MLCK (see Fig. 6for its topology in MLCK), and subjected this NN fragment to an actin-binding assay. As shown in Fig.1 a by open circles, the amount of the NN fragment bound to actin filaments increased with increasing concentration of the NN fragment. The K a of the binding of the NN fragment to actin filaments was 3.72 ± 0.20 × 105m−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 3). The binding was abolished totally by Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 1 b, open circles). Thus, we deduce that the 1–337 sequence contains a site for Ca2+/CaM-sensitive actin binding. Previously, we investigated the importance of the sequence between Lys42 and Ala80 to the inhibitory effect of MLCK by searching for a part of MLCK that is homologous to the actin-binding domain of caldesmon (6Kohama K. Okagaki T. Hayakawa K. Lin Y. Ishikawa R. Shimmen T. Inoue A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1204-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We synthesized a peptide consisting of Lys42–Ala80 of MLCK and used it to compete against the actin binding activity of the NN fragment. However, as shown in Fig. 1 c by the open circles, the binding was not at all affected. We obtained another peptide, this time of the Met1–Pro41 sequence, and found its inhibitory effect on the actin binding of the NN fragment as shown by the filled circles in Fig. 1 c. Thus, the sequence responsible for the binding of the NN fragment to actin filaments,i.e. the Ca2+/CaM-sensitive site of MLCK, must be located at the N terminus of the MLCK molecule. We divided peptide Met1–Pro41 into peptide Met1–Gly25 and peptide Phe26–Pro41. Both of them failed to inhibit the actin binding (open and filled triangles in Fig. 1 c), suggesting that there is a critical region for actin binding within the 1–41 residues. To confirm this idea by another method, we produced the NN/41 fragment, which is devoid of the Met1–Pro41 sequence of MLCK, and the NN/25 fragment which is devoid of the Met1–Gly25 sequence of MLCK (see Fig. 6 for their topology in MLCK), and then assayed for their actin binding activity. As shown by filled triangles in Fig.1 a, the binding of the NN/41 fragment to actin filaments remained at a basal level. Although the NN/25 fragment definitely bound to actin filament with K a = 1.01 ± 0.53 × 105m−1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 3), the affinity was much lower than that of the NN fragment. The length of the Pro26–Pro41 sequence when added to the NN/41 fragment (i.e. the NN/25 fragment) is probably too short to endow it with an actin-binding ability as high as that of the NN fragment, confirming the importance of the 1–41 sequence as an actin-binding site. We also produced the NC fragment, which comprises the Pro319–Val721 sequence of bovine stomach MLCK (see Fig. 6 for its topology in MLCK). We assayed the NC fragment for its actin-binding ability. As shown in Fig. 1 a by filled circles, it shows a definite actin binding activity with a K a = 1.83 ± 0.47 × 105m−1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 3). We used CaM in the presence of Ca2+ to compete against the actin binding of the NC fragment, but failed to observe any effect of Ca2+/CaM (see Fig. 1 b,filled circles). Considering the Ca2+/CaM-sensitive, actin binding activity of the NN fragment, parent MLCK would be expected to bind to actin filaments in both Ca2+/CaM-sensitive and insensitive ways, which will be shown later and discussed (see Fig. 8 a). We immobilized CaM on an IAsys cubette surface, and allowed MLCK to interact with the surface. In the presence of Ca2+, the surface plasmon resonance of IAsys increased with the increase in the concentration of MLCK. However, in the presence of EGTA, the increase is only slight (data not shown). Such a difference indicates that the IAsys system could be reliably used to detect binding activity of MLCK and its fragments to CaM. As shown in Fig. 2 a by open (MLCK) and filled (bovine stomach MLCK)circles, the difference in the resonance between Ca2+ and EGTA at the specified concentrations was readily increased at low concentrations of both MLCKs and approached saturation at their higher concentrations. This Ca2+-dependent change in the resonance of the NN fragment shown in Fig. 2 a by filled squares is quite different from that of parent MLCK; it increased gradually. However, it was never saturated, indicating the low affinity of the fragments for CaM. We assayed the NN/41 fragment with IAsys using the same surface of the cubette. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the Ca2+-dependent changes in the resonance were not detected with this fragment (filled triangles), indicating that the CaM-binding site is not located in the C-terminal portion away from Lys42. The failure to detect these changes suggests that the site is probably within the sequence of Met1–Pro41, and so we allowed the Met1–Pro41 peptide to compete against the CaM binding activity of the NN fragment. As shown by the trianglesin Fig. 2 b, the Ca2+-dependent changes in the resonance of the NN fragment reduced with the increase in the concentration of the peptide. The molecular mass of the peptide itself was too low to produce a resonance (data not shown), so the reduction in the resonance is an indication of the binding of the 1–41 sequence of MLCK to CaM. The NC fragment was also constructed to include a Ca2+/CaM-insensitive, actin-binding site, which was confirmed by the actin-binding assay (see Fig. 1). Accordingly, the NC fragment did not cause any Ca2+-dependent change in the resonance (Fig. 2 a, open triangles). To identify the position of the CaM-binding site in the 1–41 sequence, we synthesized peptides of Met1–Gly25 and Pro26–Pro41. Because of their low molecular mass, their interaction with CaM could not be detected directly by resonance (data not shown). Therefore, their interaction with CaM was detected by observing the interaction of the NN fragment with the CaM-coated surface of an IAsys cubette in the presence of various concentrations of the peptides (Fig. 2 b). The peptide that competed with the NN fragment was Pro26–Pro41. We also tested the NN/25 fragment for CaM-binding ability. As shown by asterisks in Fig. 2 a, its binding ability is comparable to that of the NN fragment. Taken together with the competing abilities of the peptides, we conclude that the boundary of the CaM-binding sequence of MLCK is at Pro26. As shown in Fig.3 a by filled circles, the motility of actin filaments on a myosin-coated glass surface was inhibited with the increase in the concentration of the NN fragment. Half-maximal inhibition was observed in the presence of 41.1 ± 5.5 nm (mean ± S.E., n = 3) of the NN fragment. The inhibition was relieved by Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3 a, open circles). Actin-activated ATPase activities of myosin (Fig. 3 b, filled circles) were reduced with the increase in the concentration of the NN fragment. Half-maximal inhibition was observed in the presence of 0.276 ± 0.028 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 3). Ca2+/CaM effectively relieved the inhibition; the inhibition caused by 1 μm NN fragment was abolished by an 8–10-fold molar excess of CaM over the NN fragment (Fig.3 c, filled circles). It must be noted that the concentration required for inhibiting the activity half-maximally was about 6.7-fold higher than the concentration required for inhibiting the motility. Such a discrepancy has been noted by Sato et al. (8Sato M. Ye L.-H. Kohama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) by using aortic MLCK. The difference in the concentrations of actin filaments used for the motility and ATPase assays may be one possible explanation. The regulatory activity of the NN/41 fragment was also tested both with motility and ATPase assays. As expected from the absence of actin binding activity (Fig. 1 a), we failed to find any effect, irrespective of the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig.3, a–c, squares). Taking the absence of the actin binding activity of the NN/41 fragment (Fig. 1 a) into consideration, the absence of any effect indicates that Met1–Pro41 is the sequence of MLCK that is responsible for the inhibition of myosin through actin binding activity. The NN/25 fragment, which showed a weak actin binding activity (Fig. 1 a), failed to inhibit the effect in the motility and ATPase assays (Fig. 3, a and b,asterisks), suggesting that the residues on both N- and C-terminal sides of Gly25 are required for inhibiting the actin-myosin interaction. The NC fragment, on the other hand, bound to actin filaments in a Ca2+/CaM-insensitive manner (Fig. 1 b). As shown in Fig. 3 (a and b) by triangles, the NC fragment did not exert any regulatory activity as monitored both by the motility and ATPase assays. The absence of activity was confirmed in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+/CaM (Fig.3 c, triangles). Thus, we conclude that the Ca2+/CaM-insensitive binding site of MLCK has no regulatory activity. We allowed parent MLCK to bind to actin filaments in a similar way to its recombinant fragments. In the presence of 1 mm EGTA, MLCK bound to actin filaments at its high affinity site at 0.15 ± 0.02 mol/mol actin (mean ± S.E., n = 3) with an affinity constant K a = 2.16 ± 0.65 × 106m−1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 3). At its low affinity site, MLCK bound to actin filaments with a K a = 4.67 ± 0.17 × 105m−1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 3). In the presence of 1 mmCa2+ and CaM at an 8-fold molar excess over MLCK, binding of MLCK to the actin filaments had only a single K a of 3.1 × 105m−1. Because this value is closer to the K a of the low affinity site, we conclude that the actin binding at the high affinity site is Ca2+/CaM-sensitive. As we describe below (see Fig. 8 a), the Ca2+/CaM-insensitive binding is confirmed by the persistence of actin binding activity in MLCK when the concentration of"

We report that the protochordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis expresses a homologous set of shorter and longer TnI isoforms in body wall muscle and heart, respectively. The heart-specific segment of the ascidian longer TnI isoform shares several sequence features with vertebrate cardiac TnI but lacks the protein kinase A phosphorylation sites implicated in sympatho-adrenal control of cardiac function. In contrast with vertebrates, the ascidian longer and shorter TnI isoforms are produced from a single gene by tissue-specific alternative RNA splicing; remarkably, the molecular mechanism of TnI isoform generation has been entirely reworked during ascidian/vertebrate evolution. Because alternative splicing is the more probable chordate ancestral condition, the long/cardiac versus short/somatic muscle pattern of TnI isoforms likely existed before the occurrence of the gene duplication events that created the vertebrate TnI gene family. Thus, gene duplication was apparently not the primary engine of isoform diversity in this aspect of TnI gene family evolution; rather, it simply provided an alternative (transcriptional) means of maintaining a previously established system of isoform diversity and tissue specificity based on alternative RNA splicing.

We report studies of ascidian TnI isoforms that show a marked overall parallel with vertebrates; a 182-residue TnI similar to vertebrate skeletal muscle TnI isoforms is expressed in ascidian body wall muscle, and a longer TnI isoform with a near N-terminal insertion resembling that of vertebrate TnIcardiac but lacking the PKA phosphorylation sites is expressed in the heart. However, whereas vertebrates produce the long (heart) and short (somatic muscle) TnI isoforms from specialized genes, we found that ascidians produce both isoforms from a single gene by a tissue-specific alternative splicing mechanism. Thus, the molecular mechanism generating TnI isoform diversity has been entirely reworked in one of these organismal lineages while maintaining intact the structural relationships between the isoforms and their tissue-specific expression patterns. We present a likely scenario for these evolutionary events and consider the functional implications of the similarities and differences between ascidian and vertebrate heart TnI isoforms."

Epoxide carboxylase, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction, was resolved from the soluble fraction of cell-free extracts into four protein components that are obligately required for functional reconstitution of epoxide carboxylase activity. One of these components, component II, has previously been purified and characterized as an NADPH:disulfide oxidoreductase. In the present study, the three additional epoxide carboxylase components have been purified to homogeneity and characterized. These component proteins are as follows: component I, a homohexameric protein consisting of 41.7-kDa subunits; component III, a dimeric protein consisting of 26.0- and 26.2-kDa polypeptides; and component IV, a dimeric protein consisting of a single 25.4-kDa polypeptide. Component I contained 5 mol of tightly bound zinc per mol of protein. Component I was specifically inactivated by methylepoxypropane, a time-dependent irreversible inactivator of epoxide carboxylase activity, suggesting that this component plays an integral role in epoxide binding and activation. No metals or organic cofactors were detected for components III and IV. The molecular weights, N-terminal sequences, and amino acid compositions of the purified epoxide carboxylase components were determined and found to correlate with open reading frames within and adjacent to a cloned fragment of DNA that complements Xanthobacter Py2 mutants defective in epoxide degradation. Using the purified epoxide carboxylase system, epoxide carboxylation was found to be stoichiometrically coupled to the transhydrogenation of pyridine nucleotide cofactors according to the following equation: epoxypropane + CO2 + NADPH + NAD+ → acetoacetate + H+ + NADP+ + NADH.

Xanthobacter strain Py2 is one of several bacteria capable of growth with short chain aliphatic alkenes as carbon and energy sources (1Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. Harder W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 235-264Crossref Google Scholar). The first step in alkene metabolism involves an oxidative insertion of an oxygen atom into the olefin bond in a reaction that is catalyzed by an inducible (2Ensign S.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 61-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), multiprotein (3Small F.J. Ensign S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24913-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) alkene monooxygenase as shown for the substrate propylene and product epoxypropane in Equation 1. (Eq. 1) Epoxides formed in this manner are further metabolized via a novel ring opening and carboxylation reaction that requires CO2as a cosubstrate and forms a β-keto acid as product as shown in Equation 2 (4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Small F.J. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (Eq. 2) Aliphatic epoxides such as epoxypropane have toxic, mutagenic, and potential carcinogenic properties (6Wade D.R. Airy S.C. Sinsheimer J.E. Mutat. Res. 1978; 58: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and their metabolism in bacteria and mammalian systems has been the focus of considerable research in recent years. Epoxide carboxylation as described for Xanthobacter Py2 represents the most recently discovered biological epoxide transformation reaction, the others involving conjugation to glutathione, hydration to dihydrodiols (7Thomas H. Timms C.W. Oesch F. Ruckpaul K. Rein H. Principles, Mechanisms and Biological Consequences of Induction. 2. Taylor & Francis Ltd., New York1990: 280-337Google Scholar), or isomerization to an aldehyde (8Hartmans S. Smits J.P. van der Werf M.J. Volkering F. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 2850-2855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies of the epoxide-carboxylating enzyme, designated an epoxide carboxylase, indicate that it has cofactor requirements, molecular properties, and a catalytic mechanism as unique as the epoxide carboxylation reaction itself. With respect to cofactor requirements, in vitro epoxide carboxylation requires a source of reductant (DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase pair(s). other dithiols, or NADPH) and an oxidant (NAD+) (4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Weijers C.A.G.M. Jongejan H. Franssen M.C.R. de Groot A. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 42: 775-781Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These cofactor requirements are unprecedented for all other carboxylases that have been characterized. The requirement of oxidant and reductant is intriguing since there is no net redox chemistry involved in epoxide carboxylation. In the course of epoxide carboxylation, there is an apparent transhydrogenation reaction wherein the reductant becomes oxidized and NAD+ becomes reduced, although this has not to date been unequivocally demonstrated. With respect to molecular properties, epoxide carboxylase appears to function as a multiprotein complex (10Chion C.K.N.C.K. Leak D.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation of Xanthobacter cell extracts by anion-exchange chromatography resolved epoxide carboxylase into three fractions, designated fractions I, II, and III based on their order of elution, that could be recombined with restoration of activity (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active component of one of these fractions was purified to homogeneity on the basis of its ability to complement the other two fractions in restoring epoxide carboxylase activity (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein, designated component II since it was purified from fraction II from the initial separation, was characterized as a dimeric flavoprotein consisting of identical 57-kDa subunits (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate study, this flavoprotein was shown to possess NADPH:disulfide oxidoreductase activity, suggesting that it is involved in the oxidation of the reductant necessary for epoxide carboxylation (12Swaving J. Debont J.A.M. Westphal A. Dekok A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6644-6646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the specificity of the flavoprotein, NADPH rather than a cellular dithiol was proposed to serve as the physiological reductant for epoxide carboxylation (12Swaving J. Debont J.A.M. Westphal A. Dekok A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6644-6646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to catalytic mechanism, it has been proposed that redox active thiols are involved in epoxide ring opening and the further transformations that form product (9Weijers C.A.G.M. Jongejan H. Franssen M.C.R. de Groot A. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 42: 775-781Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This proposal is strengthened by the recent identification of component II as an NADPH:disulfide oxidoreductase (12Swaving J. Debont J.A.M. Westphal A. Dekok A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6644-6646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the absence of CO2, epoxide carboxylase catalyzes the isomerization of aliphatic epoxides to form ketones at rates comparable to those observed for carboxylation (4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Weijers C.A.G.M. Jongejan H. Franssen M.C.R. de Groot A. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 42: 775-781Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 3. (Eq. 3) Apparently, epoxide to ketone isomerization is a fortuitous reaction of no physiological significance (13Sluis M.K. Small F.J. Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4020-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that isomerization occurs is, however, significant, since it demonstrates that a reaction intermediate is generated that can alternatively undergo carboxylation to form a β-keto acid or protonation to form a ketone. Epoxide to ketone isomerization has not been observed in any other biological system. The studies summarized above have revealed new transformations of an important class of xenobiotic compounds and the central role of a new type of multicomponent carboxylase in these processes. There are a number of fundamental questions that remain unanswered regarding this system, including how many separable proteins comprise the epoxide carboxylase system and what role(s) the individual components play in catalysis. It is apparent that the resolution of these questions will require the purification of each component protein. Accordingly, in this paper we report the purification to homogeneity and biochemical characterization of three proteins, designated components I, III, and IV, that, when recombined with purified component II, restore epoxide carboxylase activity. By using the purified components we demonstrate that 1 mol of NADPH is oxidized and 1 mol of NAD+ is reduced for each substrate molecule carboxylated. Epoxide carboxylase is thus a four-component enzyme system coupling the transhydrogenation of pyridine nucleotides to the carboxylation of aliphatic epoxides. Xanthobacter strain Py2 was grown in 15-liter semicontinuous cultures in a Microferm fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) with propylene as a carbon source as described previously (4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at an A 600 between 2.5 and 4.0 by tangential flow filtration with a Pellicon system (Millipore Corp.) and stored at −80 °C. For purifications of epoxide carboxylase components I and III, frozen cell paste (100–200 g) was thawed and resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2)), 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 10 mg of DNase I. For the purification of component IV, frozen cell paste (100 g) was thawed and resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer as above except that 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) was used in place of MOPS. The cell suspension was passed two times through a French pressure cell at 110,000 kPa, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 139,700 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. All buffers (MOPS and Tris-HCl) used in the preparation of cell-free extracts and in column chromatography procedures were first passed over a Bio-Rad Chelex-100 (5.0 × 10 cm) column to remove trace metals. Clarified cell-free extract was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A) at a linear flow rate of 49 cm/h. After loading, the column was washed with 150 ml of buffer A. The column was developed with a 1200-ml linear gradient of 0 to 300 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing component III activity were pooled and adjusted to 1.0 m(NH4)2SO4 and applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 16/10 phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 1.0 m(NH4)2SO4 at a linear flow rate of 60 cm/h. The column was developed using a reverse step gradient of buffer A containing 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 m(NH4)2SO4, respectively. Fractions containing component III activity were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) containing 10% glycerol (buffer B) for 16 h at 4 °C. The protein was then applied to a Dyematrex Red A (Amicon) column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer B at a linear flow rate of 60 cm/h. After washing the column with 120 ml of buffer B, component III was eluted with 20 ml of buffer A containing 10 mmNAD+. Fractions containing component III were then dialyzed against 1 liter of Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) containing 10% glycerol (buffer C) for 16 h, concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM30), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. One hundred ml of DEAE-resolved component I, prepared as described previously (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was diluted 4-fold with buffer C and applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column in buffer C at 45 cm/h. The column was then washed with 150 ml of buffer C and developed with an 800-ml linear gradient from 0 to 250 mm NaCl in buffer C. Component IA was recovered in the flow-through, wash, and low salt (<100 mm NaCl) fractions. Component IB was recovered in the fractions eluting between 140 and 160 mm NaCl. Each component was concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM30) and stored at −80 °C. Clarified cell-free extract was heat-treated in 100-ml aliquots by incubation for 3 min in a 65 °C water bath, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 17,500 × g. The supernatant was applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer C at 45 cm/h. The column was washed with 150 ml of buffer C and developed with a 1200-ml linear gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in buffer C. Fractions containing component I activity were pooled, adjusted to 1.7 m (NH4)2SO4, and applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/15 phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer C containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was then washed with 150 ml of 1.0 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer C and developed with a 400-ml reverse gradient of buffer C containing 1.0 mto 0 mm (NH4)2SO4. Fractions containing component I were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM30) to a volume of approximately 4 ml. The sample was then applied to a Pharmacia HiPrep 26/100 Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated in buffer C containing 200 mm NaCl at a linear flow rate of 11.3 cm/h. Fractions containing epoxide carboxylase component I were pooled and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Clarified cell-free extract was heat-treated in 100-ml aliquots by incubation for 3 min in a 65 °C water bath, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 17,500 × g. The supernatant was applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column that was connected in tandem to a hydroxyapatite column (1.4 × 10 cm) at a linear flow rate of 34 cm/h. Both columns had previously been equilibrated with buffer C. Component IV did not bind to either column under these conditions and was collected in the flow-through fractions. The fractions containing component IV activity were pooled, adjusted to 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4, and applied to a Pharmacia HiLoad 16/10 phenyl-Sepharose column that was equilibrated in buffer C containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4 at 60 cm/h. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer C containing 1.0 m(NH4)2SO4 and developed by applying a 200-ml reverse gradient of buffer C containing 1.0 m to 0 mm (NH4)2SO4. Fractions with component IV activity were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B. The sample was then applied to a column of Reactive Green 19 (1.4 × 10 cm), equilibrated in buffer B at a linear flow rate of 78 cm/h. The column was developed by applying a 200-ml linear gradient of buffer B to buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM30) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Epoxide carboxylase activity was measured by monitoring the time-dependent depletion of epoxypropane by gas chromatography as described previously (4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in sealed vials (9 ml) containing a source of enzyme (cell-free extract, column fractions, or purified components) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), containing 10% glycerol using reagents and reaction conditions described previously (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified epoxide carboxylase component II and methylepoxypropane-treated cell-free extract were prepared as described previously (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetoacetate was quantified by removing liquid samples from assay vials and analyzing by gas chromatography as described previously (4Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epoxide carboxylase activity was assayed as described above except that dithiothreitol was replaced with NADPH (5 mm); the concentration of NAD+ was increased to 5 mm; the NAD+-regenerating system was not included, and EDTA (1 mm) was added. Assays were made anoxic by repeated evacuation and flushing with argon on a vacuum manifold, and a sodium dithionite-saturated filter trap was included in the vials. NADH formation and NADPH oxidation were monitored by removing 10-μl liquid samples from assay vials, diluting 50-fold with water, and analyzing by high pressure liquid chromatography. NADH and NADPH were separated with a Supelcosil LC-18 (25 cm × 4.6 mm) column using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 100 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 10% methanol. Elution of nucleotides was monitored at 340 nm. Assays were performed in 2-ml (1-cm path length) anaerobic quartz cuvettes that had been modified by fusing a serum bottle-style quartz top (7 × 13 mm at mouth), allowing the cuvettes to be sealed with a red rubber serum vial stopper. Stoppered cuvettes containing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2)), NAD+ (2 mm), DTT (5 mm), and epoxide carboxylase components in a total volume of 1 ml were made anoxic by repeated cycles of evacuation and flushing with argon on a vacuum manifold. Sodium bicarbonate and CO2 (75 mm total) were added, and assays were initiated by the addition of epoxypropane (1 μmol). NADH formation was monitored by following the time-dependent increase in absorbance at 340 nm in a Shimadzu model UV 160U spectrophotometer containing a thermostated cell holder at 30 °C. Native molecular weights were estimated by gel filtration chromatography using a Pharmacia Superose 12 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) containing 200 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated using pyruvate kinase (237 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.3 kDa). Polypeptide molecular weights were also determined using electrospray mass spectrometry performed by the Utah State University Biotechnology Center. SDS-PAGE (12% T, 2.7% C running gel) was performed following the Laemmli procedure (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Electrophoresed proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The apparent molecular masses of polypeptides based on SDS-PAGE migration were determined by comparison with R f values of standard proteins. Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed by the Protein/Nucleic Acid Shared Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Utah State University Biotechnology Center. Multielemental metal analysis was performed on an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer at the Utah State University Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified biuret assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (15Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of epoxide carboxylase component II was routinely determined by using its reported extinction coefficient (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, the epoxide carboxylase of Xanthobacter strain Py2 was shown to be a multicomponent enzyme system composed of at least three separable proteins (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation of cell-free extracts by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography resolved epoxide carboxylase activity into three fractions, designated components I, II, and III based on their order of elution, that were obligately required for reconstitution of epoxide carboxylase activity (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Component II was purified to homogeneity on the basis of its ability to complement components I and III in restoring epoxide carboxylase activity (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar strategies have now been applied to component I and III fractions with the goal of purifying each of the required components of the epoxide carboxylase system. No epoxide carboxylase activity could be recovered in any single fraction after further fractionation of component I by Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography, suggesting that component I is either unstable, has a dissociable cofactor, or separates into more than one component upon further fractionation. In contrast, reasonable recoveries of activity could be obtained upon further chromatographic fractionation of DEAE-Sepharose-resolved component III. Therefore, the purification of component III was pursued on the basis of its ability to complement DEAE-Sepharose-resolved component I and purified component II in restoring epoxide carboxylase activity. Component III was purified using an activity assay in which DEAE-Sepharose-resolved component I and purified component II were present at saturating levels so that component III was rate-limiting in the assays. A summary of the three-step protocol used for the purification of component III is presented in TableI. Component III was purified 96.4-fold with a 33.6% overall recovery and exhibited a specific activity of 241 milliunits per mg of protein. As shown in Fig.1, the purification resulted in the enrichment of two proteins that migrated on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular weights of 29,100 and 30,200. Purified component III was chromatographed over additional columns (e.g. S-100 gel filtration, hydroxyapatite, Reactive Green) with no change in the relative intensities of the two bands. The inclusion of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and benzamidine) in the lysis buffers and chromatography buffers had no effect on the doublet pattern seen for component III on denaturing gels.Table IPurification of epoxide carboxylase component III from Xanthobacter strain Py2Purification stepTotal proteinVolumeTotal activity1-aAssays contained 4.6 mg of DEAE-Sepharose-resolved component I, 1.5 mg of purified component II, and a limiting amount of the component III fraction.

Open table in a new tab The staining intensities of the two polypeptides on SDS-PAGE gave relative ratios of 1.5 to 1.0 for the larger and smaller molecular weight bands, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis also revealed the presence of two polypeptides in component III preparations and provided more accurate molecular mass estimates of 26,124 Da and 26,025 Da for these proteins. Gel filtration chromatography provided a molecular weight estimate of 64,774 for the native protein, indicating that component III is a dimer composed of two subunits. No metals or organic cofactors were detected in component III preparations. As mentioned above, further fractionation of DEAE-Sepharose-resolved component I by a Q-Sepharose chromatography salt gradient resulted in loss of component I activity. To determine whether two or more additional components had been resolved by this fractionation, various combinations of fractions from the Q-Sepharose step were recombined with purified components II and III and assayed for epoxide carboxylase activity. As shown in Table II, the simultaneous, but not separate, addition of two Q-Sepharose fractions restored epoxide carboxylase activity.

Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of DEAE-resolved component I, but not that of DEAE-resolved components II or III, to methylepoxypropane-inactivated cell extracts restored epoxide carboxylase activity (11Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions IA or IB from above were added to methylepoxypropane-treated cell-free extract to determine whether one or both of these fractions could restore epoxide carboxylase activity in a fashion similar to DEAE-resolved component I. The addition of fraction IB alone, but not that of fraction IA, restored activity in methylepoxypropane-treated cell extract with rates comparable to that of DEAE-resolved component I (Table II). The protein component identified in this fraction was labeled epoxide carboxylase component I to be consistent with its prior assignment as the component that is believed to contain the epoxide binding and activation sites. The protein component in fraction IA was labeled epoxide carboxylase component IV as the fourth identified epoxide carboxylase component. The ability of component I to restore activity by its addition to methylepoxypropane-treated extracts allowed a convenient and discriminating assay for this epoxide carboxylase component; therefore, component I was purified on this basis. A saturating amount of methylepoxypropane-treated extract was used in activity assays so that the relative activity of component I was rate-limiting. A summary of the four-step protocol used for the purification of component I is shown in Table III. Component I was purified 26.2-fold with a 48% recovery and exhibited a specific activity of 55 milliunits per mg of protein. As shown in Fig.2, the purification resulted in the enrichment of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 41.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometry provided a more accurate molecular mass estimate of 41.7 kDa for purified component I. The molecular mass of compone"

Cognate and noncognate complexes were easily distinguished due to a large mass difference between the two tRNAs. Both homodimeric synthetases gave MS spectra indicating intact desorption of dimers.

Translation of the genetic code is the defining characteristic of living systems. The first and most critical step in translation is the highly specific attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs which is catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (1Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2Delarue M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Söll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 251-292Google Scholar). The synthetases vary in size and subunit composition and can be divided into two classes of 10 enzymes each based on conserved sequences (4Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) and structural motifs of the active site region (5Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). These features of individual synthetases are highly conserved in evolution (6Härtlein M. Cusack S. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To perform its demanding task, each of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases has to discriminate among a collection of tRNAs present in the cell. Molecules of tRNA share a nearly invariant L-shaped tertiary structure which is necessary in the later steps of translation. As indicated by crystal structures of several synthetase·tRNA pairs, members of each synthetase class interact with two different regions of the L-shaped tRNA molecules (7Cavarelli J. Moras D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The formation of both cognate and non-cognate synthetase·tRNA complexes has been observed by a variety of experimental techniques such as nitrocellulose filter binding, fluorescence quenching, equilibrium partition, neutron scattering and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, footprinting, stopped-flow etc. (8Zaccai G.

Cognate tRNAs, however, form a more stable complex with the synthetase and are strongly preferred in aminoacylation. Crystal structures of several cognate synthetase·tRNA complexes recently led to progress in understanding specific recognition between macromolecules (15Cusack S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The specificity of aminoacylation in vivo is controlled by competition for the substrates (16Sherman J.M. Rogers M.J. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2847-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, misacylation may occur even in vivo when the ratio between the synthetase and tRNA concentrations is disturbed by overexpression (17Rogers M.J. Söll D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 185-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As a novel approach to gain further insight into the formation and stability of synthetase·tRNA complexes, we have performed a MALDI-MS 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; TyrRS, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase; SerRS, seryl-tRNA synthetase; ATT, 6-aza-2-thiothymine. study of the complexes formed by yeast TyrRS and SerRS with their cognate and noncognate tRNAs. The two yeast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are representatives of class I and class II synthetases, respectively. Their amino acid sequences based on gene structures are known (18Chow C.M.

Biol. 1993; 234: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Both yeast enzymes are homodimeric. Based on a gel-shift analysis, yeast TyrRS binds one cognate tRNA molecule per dimer (11Rubelj I. Weygand-Đurašević I. Kućan Ž. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The preferred type of yeast SerRS·tRNASer complex is probably two tRNAs per synthetase (22Rigler R. Cronvall E. Hirsch R. Pachmann U. Zachau H.G. FEBS Lett. 1971; 11: 320-323Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Pachmann U. Zachau H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 975-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this paper we provide further evidence regarding the stoichiometry of these complexes. The mass difference between tRNATyr and tRNASer is over 2 kDa due to the long variable arm in tRNASer. This facilitates a ready MS differentiation between cognate and noncognate pairs. Recently, MALDI-MS has been successfully applied to the detection of a number of intact noncovalent complexes, such as protein quaternary structures (24Rosinke B. Strupat K. Hillenkamp F.

Chem. 1995; 67: 4542-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has also been proven a general method for the analysis of a variety of noncovalent structures. In particular, the specific noncovalent complex of transcription factor, PU.1 DNA-binding domain with a 17-base pairs double-stranded DNA fragment, has been analyzed, providing an example for the study of a biologically relevant protein-nucleic acid complex (31Cheng X. Morin P.E. Harms A.C. Bruce J.E. Ben-David Y. Smith R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our present study extends the application of mass spectrometry, in general, and MALDI-MS, in particular, to studies of biologically relevant protein-nucleic acid complexes with masses exceeding 105 Da. High specificity of the recorded interactions between 40–50 kDa-protein and 25–27-kDa nucleic acid constituents is demonstrated. Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was prepared from commercial yeast by a modification (32Plohl M. Kućan Ž. Biochimie. 1988; 70: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) of published purification steps (33Kućan Ž. Chambers R.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Seryl-tRNA synthetase was purified from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae overproducing strain by a two-step chromatographic procedure on FPLC MonoQ and MonoS columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (34Weygand-Đurašević I. Lenhard B. Filipic S. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For MALDI-MS experiments, both enzymes were transferred to 0.5 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol using Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon). Glycerol was then added to a final concentration of 10% and the enzymes were kept at −80 °C. tRNATyr and tRNASer were prepared from yeast tRNA fractions enriched in tyrosine and serine acceptors, kindly supplied by Professor G. Dirheimer (Strasbourg, France). tRNATyr was purified by repeated chromatography of tyrosylated and detyrosylated tRNA on a benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column (35Maxwell I.H. Wimmer E. Tener G.M. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purified tRNATyr accepted at least 1.4 nmol of tyrosine/A 260 unit, determined in an aminoacylation assay described elsewhere (11Rubelj I. Weygand-Đurašević I. Kućan Ž. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To isolate tRNASer acceptors, the tRNA was serylated using pure seryl-tRNA synthetase, derivatized by naphthoxyacetylation (36Suzuki T. Ueda T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and purified by chromatography on a benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column (37Andachi Y. Yamao F. Muto A. Osawa S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The aliquots from the chromatography fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea. The fractions containing derivatized tRNASer, showing the lowest mobility on the gel, were pooled and deacylated. Purified tRNASer accepted at least 1.2 nmol of serine/A 260 unit of tRNA. Aminoacylation assays were performed as described elsewhere (34Weygand-Đurašević I. Lenhard B. Filipic S. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both tRNAs were extensively dialyzed against water and kept at −20 °C. Appropriate amounts of tRNASer or tRNATyr, as required for individual experiments, were kept at 55 °C for 2 min in 12.5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, and slowly cooled to 25 °C, thus assuring proper renaturation and conformational integrity before complex formation. Enzyme solutions were added and the mixtures incubated for 5 min at 25 °C, followed by cooling on ice and addition of glycerol in 12.5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, to a final glycerol concentration of 6%. Gel retardation electrophoresis was routinely performed on aliquots of all samples subjected to mass spectrometric measurements. 100 × 70 × 0.75 mm3 gels were prepared using acrylamide/bisacrylamide (40:1) and 5% glycerol in 12.5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.3. Samples in 6% glycerol were loaded on previously cooled gels and electophoresis was run at 4 °C for 4 h at 5 mA and 50 V using 12.5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.3, as the running buffer. The gels were stained with silver (38Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were acquired on a prototype Vision 2000 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ThermoBioAnalysis, Hemel, Hempstead, United Kingdom) modified in our laboratory. It was operated in linear mode with an acceleration potential of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. All spectra shown were acquired in positive ion mode. Ions were desorbed by irradiation with a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 5 ns; Spektrum GmbH, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany). The equivalent flight path length was 1.95 m. The base pressure was 10−4 Pa. Ions were detected with a discrete dynode secondary electron multiplier (R 2362, Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching, FRG) equipped with a conversion dynode for efficient detection of high mass ions. The total impact energy of the ions on the conversion dynode was 39 keV. The preamplified output signal of the secondary electron multiplier was digitized at up to 100 MHz by a transient recorder (LeCroy 9450, LeCroy, Chestnut Ridge, NY) and then transferred to a personal computer equipped with custom-made software (ULISSES, [email protected], Bonn, FRG). Up to 65 single shot spectra were averaged for the spectra shown. The MALDI matrix used was 6-aza-2-thiothymine (Sigma). Diammonium citrate (Sigma) or ammonium acetate (Merck) were added to the ATT matrix solution. ATT was dissolved to a concentration of 40 mm in 10 mmdiammonium citrate or in 12.5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 (25Glocker M.O. Bauer S.J. Kast J. Volz J. Przybylski M. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Lecchi P. Pannell L.K. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 972-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fresh matrix solutions were prepared daily. The analyte concentration was typically 1.7 μm SerRS or TyrRS and 6.4 μm tRNA. 1 μl of ATT solution and 0.5 μl of analyte solution were mixed on the target and dried in a stream of cold air until small ATT crystals started to form in the glycerol-containing droplet. Thereupon, 1 μl of ATT solution was added to the remaining droplet and the water partly evaporated. Before allowing the preparation to dry down completely, another 1 μl of ATT solution was added. The resulting preparation appeared like an ATT standard preparation with larger matrix crystals protruding from the rim, except that the whole sample was covered by a thin glycerol film, as revealed by optical microscopy. To facilitate the analysis of synthetase/tRNA mixtures by MALDI-MS, particular care had to be taken to choose buffer conditions that do not interfere with matrix crystallization. Formation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase·tRNA complexes in vitro was generally assumed to require conditions suitable for aminoacylation of tRNA,i.e. the presence of both K+ and Mg2+ ions. The presence of alkali and earth alkali cations is well known to adversely affect matrix crystallization and decrease resolution by extensive cation adduct formation, especially in the case of oligonucleotides (39Nordhoff E. Kirpekar F. Roepstorff P. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1996; 15: 67-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 40Gruić-Sovulj I. Lüdemann H.-C. Hillenkamp F. Weygand-Đurašević I. Kućan Ž. Peter-Katalinić J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1859-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, we elaborated conditions for complex formation in volatile salt solutions known to be compatible with MALDI, e.g. ammonium salts which have been described as buffers and MALDI-matrix additives by several authors (25Glocker M.O. Bauer S.J. Kast J. Volz J. Przybylski M. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Lecchi P. Pannell L.K. J. Am. Soc.

Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1591-1596Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our final choice was 12.5 mm ammonium acetate in ultra-pure water, pH 7. The result of an electrophoretic analysis of complex formation under such conditions is shown in Fig.1. Both SerRS and TyrRS formed complexes of similar electrophoretic mobility with their cognate tRNAs, in agreement with the α2·tRNA composition (lanes b, d, e, and g). Additionally, TyrRS formed a slower moving noncognate complex with tRNASer (lane f). In analogy with the previously detected TyrRS·tRNAPhe complex (11Rubelj I. Weygand-Đurašević I. Kućan Ž. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) we ascribe this to an (α2)2·tRNA structure. SerRS and the noncognate tRNATyr formed a complex with the mobility corresponding to α2·tRNA composition (lane c). All bands obtained are poorly resolved as compared with those obtained under standard conditions (11Rubelj I. Weygand-Đurašević I. Kućan Ž. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but, nevertheless, they demonstrate that synthetase·tRNA complexes can be formed in ammonium acetate solution. The successful analysis of noncovalently bound compounds by MALDI-MS requires that the complex be transferred from the liquid to the solid phase, and incorporated into the matrix crystal. Upon interaction with the laser pulse, intact complexes must survive the transition from the solid state to the gas phase and be stable in the gas phase on a time scale of some 10−4 s for detection. Effects known to substantially contribute to noncovalent interactions include hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions as well as electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. All of these interactions must be assumed to be substantially influenced by the dramatically changing “solvent” environment during both the crystallization and desorption processes. At any rate, great care has to be taken not to misinterpret or overinterpret the observed signals. For example, it is well known that reactions in the gas phase of the expanding desorption plume may lead to unspecific aggregation of simultaneously desorbed molecular species present in the sample (43Hillenkamp F. Standing K.G. New Methods for the Study of Molecular Aggregates. Kluwer Academic Publications, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar). Characteristically, the signal intensity of these oligomers generated in the gas phase decreases exponentially with an increasing number of constituents as it is rationalized by a lower probability for multiple collisions. In most cases, the stoichiometry of the molecular aggregate giving rise to a given peak can be unambiguously determined from the mass value alone. For a discrimination between the gas phase aggregation and species present as an aggregate in the solid and desorbed as such, it is necessary to also take into account the peak intensity ratios in the spectra. In the following analysis, the peaks observed will be described and special emphasis will be placed on how conclusions concerning their origin can be drawn from the intensity ratios. The expressions “native” and “intact” used to describe the desorption of a noncovalently bound aggregates do not imply a specific conformation. In fact, all that can be deduced from MALDI mass spectra is the stoichiometry of such aggregates. Actual conformations during crystallization of the matrix and/or the desorption/ionization step need not to be close to the biologically active conformation in cells. However, we will report results that clearly prove that the mass spectra show complex formation as directed by specific molecular recognition in solution. Prior to the analysis of complexes, the masses of the synthetase subunits and the tRNAs (40Gruić-Sovulj I. Lüdemann H.-C. Hillenkamp F. Weygand-Đurašević I. Kućan Ž. Peter-Katalinić J.

Open table in a new tab Deviations from the sequence-based mass values are observed for each synthetase and will be subject to future investigation. Subsequently, all spectra of mixtures were calibrated internally with the mass values as given in Table I. The spectrum of TyrRS is shown in Fig.2 a (see figure captions for details). The peak at m/z = 85 kDa of the singly charged TyrRS dimer is the base peak of the spectrum. The second prominent peak corresponds to the single α+ subunit, which coincides with the m/z value of the doubly charged TyrRS dimer. Another ion signal at an m/z = 170 kDa corresponds stoichiometrically to the m/z value of (4α)+. Its peak area is bigger than that of the peak at m/z = 127 kDa, corresponding to (3α)+. The peak intensity ratio for this kind of spectrum indicates intact desorption of the TyrRS dimer, as the dimer peak is the base peak and the peak corresponding to 4 α-subunits is higher than that corresponding to 3 α-subunits. If the homoligomeric signals of α-subunits originated from unspecific gas phase association only, their intensity would decrease exponentially with an increasing number of constituents. However, minor contribution of the latter effect cannot be excluded. This peak intensity ratio was only observed for the first laser shot at a given sample location. From the second shot on, the monomer was the base peak of the spectrum with the peak intensity decreasing with increasing mass. This behavior was previously observed for a variety of protein quaternary structures (24Rosinke B. Strupat K. Hillenkamp F. Rosenbusch J. Dencher N. Krüger U. Galla H.-J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 1462-1468Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26Cohen L.R.H. Strupat K. Hillenkamp F. J. Am. Soc.

Kluwer Academic Publications, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar). To demonstrate the ability to detect synthetase·tRNA complexes by MALDI-MS a sample of TyrRS was mixed in a vial with an excess of tRNATyr (see “Materials and Methods”) prior to deposition on the target and addition of the matrix (Fig.2 b). In the mass spectrum the two most prominent peaks could be assigned to tRNATyr and the protein α1-subunit (cf. Table I). An additional peak at m/z = 50650 corresponds to the m/z value of 2 tRNATyr molecules which, in all likelihood, reflects an unspecific gas phase aggregation. The protein dimer signal is not present in this spectrum. Instead, two signals at m/z = 110,078 Da and m/z = 135,541 Da have appeared, corresponding to a stoichiometry of 2 α-subunits of TyrRS plus one and plus two tRNATyr molecules, respectively. They indicate intact desorption of the synthetase·tRNA complex. If the signal had been due to unspecific gas phase association the intensity ratios could not be explained satisfactorily because of the missing peak of the TyrRS dimer. The presence of the signal corresponding to the α2·tRNATyr complex (while no intact TyrRS dimer is detected) gives rise to assumptions that either the complex is more stable than the protein dimer under the preparation and desorption conditions chosen or that under the high molar excess of tRNA practically all the dimeric enzyme in solution was used for the formation of the complex. The peak labeled α1·tRNATyr could arise from 1:1 association in the gas phase or in solution, or it could be attributed to a doubly charged, intactly desorbed α2·tRNA2Tyr aggregate. The latter signal could originate from either an unspecific gas phase association of tRNATyr to an intactly desorbed α2·tRNATyr complex or from an intactly desorbed α2·tRNA2Tyr complex. For the protein-nucleic acid complexes no dependence of peak intensity ratio on the number of shots on a given sample location was observed (apart from signal depletion after too many shots). This will be further discussed under “Discussion.” The spectra of analogous experiments performed with SerRS and tRNASer are shown In Fig. 3. Spectrum a represents a mass spectrum of the enzyme as a native dimer (base peak). Essentially the same peak intensity distribution as in the TyrRS case is observed because the protein dimer ion is the most abundant. SerRS, mixed with an excess of tRNASer, gave the spectrum shown in Fig. 3 b. In addition to the native SerRS dimer peak, a signal attributed to α2·tRNASer (m/z = 136,144 Da) was also observed. Another weak and poorly resolved signal at m/z = 162,590 Da could not unequivocally be attributed to either the m/z value of 3 α-subunits of SerRS or an α2·tRNA2Ser complex. The same holds true for a signal at m/z 64 ≅ 82 kDa, where the signal to noise ratio and resolution of the signal did not allow assignment to either 3 tRNASer or α1·tRNASer. In contrast to the TyrRS case, the protein dimer ion signal intensity is comparable to that of the α2·tRNASer signal. The peak intensity distribution of the spectrum indicates that the signals denoted α2 and α2·tRNASer reflect species desorbed intactly rather than gas phase aggregates since the intensity of each peak is higher than that for the 3 tRNASer/α1·tRNASer peak. In the case of SerRS, the “first shot behavior” described above was also observed while it was not for its α2·tRNASer complex. Experiments for Figs. 2 and 3 were carried out with either ammonium acetate or diammonium citrate as additives to the ATT solution, with essentially equal results. The typical mass resolution obtained for protein dimer signals and α2·tRNA complexes was m/dm = 30 (full width at half-maximum). To investigate the specificity of binding between tRNA and the synthetases, the correlation between spectral appearance and the concentrations in solution, as well as to discriminate against gas phase phenomena, further experiments were performed. In addition to the usual synthetase/tRNA ratios (Figs.4 a and 5 a,cf. also Figs. 2 b and 3 b), mass spectra of mixtures with an excess of the enzyme over cognate tRNA were acquired (Figs. 4 b and 5 b). In these spectra the ratio of the protein dimer peak intensity to the α2·tRNA complex peak intensity increases. Peaks corresponding to the α-subunit, tRNA, and α1·tRNA are present. In the SerRS case, peaks at ≈163 and ≈220 kDa corresponding to 3 and 4 α-subunits of the protein (Fig.5 b) were also observed. The peak intensity ratio of the latter two indicates gas phase association of two intactly desorbed SerRS dimers. The formation of (α2)2·tRNA complexes (11Rubelj I. Weygand-Đurašević I. Kućan Ž.

Of equal physiological importance to the specificity of this enzyme for its protein substrates is its ability to be turned on and off in response to cellular signals. There are two known physiological inhibitors of cAPK, the regulatory subunits (RI and RII) and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The cooperative binding of cAMP to the inactive tetrameric holoenzyme, (R2C2), causes the complex to dissociate, releasing two active catalytic subunits (C) and a dimeric regulatory subunit saturated with four molecules of cAMP (R2cAMP4). PKIs interact only with the free C subunit and carry, in addition to a cAPK inhibition site, a nuclear export signal that shuttles the complex actively out of the nucleus (2Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar).The R subunits and PKIs inhibit C by a common mechanism. Both contain an inhibitory consensus sequence, RRXS/TΨ, that is shared by most substrates and inhibitors of cAPK, where the phosphorylation (P) site is either Ser, Thr, or Ala, X is any amino acid, and Ψ, at the P + 1 site, is a hydrophobic residue. In RI and PKI, the P site is an Ala, whereas in RII, this site is a phosphorylatable Ser (3Titani K. Sasagawa T. Ericsson L.H. Kumar S. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4193-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Scott J.D. Fischer E.H. Takio K. Demaille J.G. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This consensus site sequence binds competitively to the active site cleft and is similar for both R and PKI. However, this interaction is not sufficient to achieve high affinity binding. Binding to C is bipartite. Both R and PKI require an additional interaction site.As indicated in Fig. 1, the C subunit contains two distinct additional surfaces on the large lobe that are important for recognition of PKI and R. One surface, referred to here as peripheral recognition site 1 (PRS1), is essential for high affinity binding of PKI, and another is required for high affinity binding of R. The interactions that account for the high affinity of C and PKI are well defined in the crystal structure of C containing the 20 amino acid inhibitor peptide, IP20, derived from residues 5–24 of PKI (6Knighton D.R.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar) as well as mutation of Arg-133, located near the PRS1 surface on C (10Wen W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8423-8430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all abolished high affinity binding of PKI. The realization that mutation of Arg-133 did not interfere with binding of RI indicated that other surfaces were important. In the absence of a crystal structure, many approaches have been used to map the surface that is important for R binding and at the same time to identify the regions of R that are essential for tight binding to C.The surface on the C subunit that is important for high affinity binding of R is referred to here as peripheral recognition site 2, PRS2 (Fig. 1). This surface is dominated by the essential phosphorylation site, Thr-197, located on the activation loop. The importance of this phosphorylation site for regulation was originally identified in yeast (11Levin L.R. Kuret J. Johnson K.E. Powers S. Cameron S. Michaeli T. Wigler M. Zoller M.J. Science. 1988; 240: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Levin L.R. Zoller M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The PRS2 surface is quite basic, and several of these basic residues, identified originally by charge to Ala scanning mutagenesis in the yeast C homolog, TPK1, specifically Lys-213 and Lys-217, are important for R/C interaction (13Gibbs C.S. Knighton D.R. Sowadski J.M. Taylor S.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4806-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2Gibson, R. M., Buechler, Y. J., and Taylor, S. S. (1997) Protein Sci. 6, 1825–1834. 2Gibson, R. M., Buechler, Y. J., and Taylor, S. S. (1997) Protein Sci. 6, 1825–1834. H87Q, W196R, T197A, and L198K/S were also identified using an in vivo genetic screen in human JEG-3 cells as mutations that disrupted regulation of C by RI and RII but not PKI (15Orellana S.A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6843-6846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of either His-87 or Thr-197, in recombinantly expressed C, subsequently confirmed the importance of these residues for holoenzyme formation (17Cox S. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16203-16209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Cox S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22614-22622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These amino acids thus define a basic surface with a node at the center comprised of Thr-197, His-87, and Trp-196. Thr-197, as discussed previously, is linked through hydrogen bonds to the active site and is important for assembly of the active conformation of this loop (19Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Grant B. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 21Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). His-87, on the other hand, located at the beginning of the C-helix in many protein kinases in the small lobe, interacts directly with Thr(P)-197 only in the closed conformation of the C subunit (22Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Trp-196 is fully exposed on the surface.To understand further the importance of the PRS2 surface, and, in particular, Trp-196, this exposed tryptophan was replaced with Arg and Ala in recombinantly expressed murine Cα. The Ala mutation was designed to remove the hydrophobic character of Trp-196 without introducing a positive charge. Mutation of the site corresponding to Trp-196 in TPK1, Tyr-240, to Ala also disrupted R/C interaction in yeast (13Gibbs C.S. Knighton D.R. Sowadski J.M. Taylor S.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4806-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant C subunits were characterized for their kinetic properties and their ability to associate with PKI, RI, and RII. In addition, the W196R mutant C subunit was paired with mutant forms of RI, containing deletions as well as defects in their cAMP binding properties. These mutant pairs highlight the conformational flexibility of the R subunits and the important role this plays in the formation of the inhibited holoenzyme complex.DISCUSSIONThe activation loop at the edge of the cleft interface on the large lobe of the catalytic subunit is an important segment for all protein kinases. As seen in Fig. 1, many parts of the molecule communicate with this surface. His-87 from the small lobe, Arg-165 preceding the catalytic loop, and Lys-189 in β-strand 9 all contact the inward facing phosphate on Thr-197. In contrast, the residues that flank Thr-197 contribute directly to substrate/inhibitor binding. Leu-198 is a determinant for the P + 1 site, whereas Trp-196, as shown here, is a critical part of the surface that recognizes the R subunit.In many protein kinases this activation loop is only transiently assembled into its active conformation as a consequence of phosphorylation by a heterologous protein kinase (21Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In cAPK, however, this segment is assembled during the initial processing of the enzyme into a fully active protein phosphorylated on both Thr-197 and Ser-338 (41Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation is then controlled through the binding and release of the regulatory subunit. The crystal structures of the C subunit reveal open and closed conformations, and the environment of this node at the edge of the cleft is certainly influenced by this movement with His-87 from the small lobe making contact only in the closed conformation (22Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, these are relatively subtle conformational changes. Furthermore, the ledge of the large lobe on which substrates and inhibitors dock does not change as a consequence of substrate or inhibitor binding (42Narayana N. Cox S. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Structure. 1997; 5: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is therefore a stable docking surface (43Narayana N. Cox S. Taylor S.S. Xuong N.-H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4438-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).In contrast to C, there is much evidence to suggest that major conformational changes take place in the R subunit upon holoenzyme formation. As illustrated schematically in Fig.7, the R subunit exists in two distinct physiological states. Either it is bound to cAMP (the B-form) or it is in a complex with the catalytic subunit in the holoenzyme, R2C2 (H-form) (44Dostmann W.R.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Considerable kinetic, biophysical, and mutational data indicate that there is tightly coupled communication between the two domains that correlates with the cooperative binding and release of cAMP. We know, for example, that only site B is exposed in the holoenzyme; whereas cAMP binding site A is masked (45Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 46Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Binding of cAMP to site B leads to a conformational change that “opens up” site A. It is the binding of cAMP to site A that then leads to the dissociation of C (26Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 2934-2942Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The evidence presented here indicates that this is also the surface where Trp-196 interacts. cAMP and C, via the Trp-196 surface, both compete for the A domain of the R subunit.Figure 7The H- and B-forms of the regulatory subunit. The two major conformations that the R subunits assume in the presence (B) and absence (H) of cAMP are shown schematically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The only crystallographic structure of R that has been solved to date is that of the monomeric RI deletion mutant (Δ1–91)RI (47Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The first 20 amino acids of (Δ1–91)RI, containing the autoinhibitory region, were not resolved in the structure, indicating that this region is disordered. In the full-length free R subunit, this segment is highly sensitive to proteolytic cleavage (48Potter R.L. Stafford P.H. Taylor S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is probably flexible in the free R subunit. Both cAMP binding sites are saturated in this structure. Proteolytic and deletion mutational analysis of R demonstrated that neither the N terminus nor the B domain is required for high affinity binding to C (28Ringheim G.E. Saraswat L.D. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18247-18252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Weldon S.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4203-4209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the region that contributes to high affinity binding to C is localized between the inhibitory consensus site and the end of the A domain. Several acidic sites within this region were protected by the C subunit from chemical modification by the water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide·HCl, and were shown subsequently to be important for binding to the basic surface of C which surrounds the PRS2 node formed by Trp-196, His-87, and Thr-197 (50Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16343-16350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, an electrostatic interaction between Lys-213 on C and Glu-143 on RI was also identified.2As shown in Fig. 8, the structure of the deletion mutant,(Δ1–91)rRI, reveals the orientation of the two cAMP binding domains as well as the molecular features of the cAMP binding sites. The structure also predicts that significant conformational changes would occur when cAMP is released. The extensive hydrogen bonding network surrounding the cAMP, for example, including the short helix between β-strands 6 and 7, will not exist in the absence of the nucleotide. When cAMP is removed, this network will be destroyed. However, when stripped of cAMP in vitro, the R subunit is much less stable, and the surface that docks to C can be readily accessed by both rC(WT) and rC(W196R) (34Le-n D.A. Dostmann W.R.G. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3035-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the deletion mutant, however, where the B domain is no longer present, rC(W196R) can no longer form a stable complex. The cAMP binding site of the A domain is shielded in the full-length R subunit. Furthermore, the B domain is tightly associated, primarily through hydrophobic interactions, with the C-helix of the A domain. Thus, the B domain through its modulation of the C-helix controls access to cAMP binding site A. This is also consistent with recent deletion analysis of the A domain that shows the C terminus of the C-helix, residues 245–260 in domain A, is not essential for either cAMP binding or binding to C. When the B domain is absent, it is likely that the C-helix of domain A collapses onto the β-barrel, similar to the conformation it assumes in both the B domain and in the catabolite gene activation protein (CAP) (47Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 51Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The best evidence for this comes from affinity labeling with 8-N3-cAMP. In the wild-type R subunit, Trp-260 is labeled by 8-N3-cAMP bound to site A (52Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3478-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 53Bubis J. Saraswat L.D. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1570-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the deletion mutant, rRI(Δ260–379), however, Tyr-244 is labeled instead (14Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5997-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 8, labeling of Tyr-244, which is far from the cAMP binding pocket in full-length RI, requires this movement. In this conformation, where the normal signaling from the B domain is gone and Tyr-244 is close to cAMP, rC(W196R) cannot form an inhibited complex because the site that binds to C is shielded.Figure 8Crystallographic model of the type Iα regulatory subunit of cAPK.

Based on 1) the altered kinetic behavior of rC(W196R) in the presence of stripped rRI(R333K), 2) the subnanomolar affinity of this complex measured by surface plasmon resonance, and 3) the fact that this active complex could be isolated by gel filtration, the partial inhibition of rC(W196R) in the presence of the various mutant forms of RI summarized in Table IVis most likely due to the formation of a complex that has undergone an initial docking event but cannot undergo the subsequent conformational switch that leads to complete inhibition, a step that correlates with occupancy of the active site cleft by the inhibitor segment (Fig.9). Whether the initial docking in wild-type C is through the inhibitor site at the cleft interface or through the PRS2 surface, in the final inhibited complex, both sites are filled and there must be a conformational change in R to enable both sites to be occupied simultaneously. Neither the initial docking nor this conformational switch can take place for rC(W196R) when cAMP is present. This is true for wild-type RI as well as for the mutant RI subunit. rC(W196R) can, however, form a stable complex with rRI(R333K), where cAMP binding site B is defective, once cAMP has been removed from site A. With this mutant, docking occurs via the PRS2 surface in the absence of cAMP; however, the switch mechanism that allows the inhibitor site to occupy the active site cleft is defective. The R subunit cannot change conformation so that the inhibitor recognition site is occupied. Thus, a stable complex is formed, whereby the active site cleft is empty and capable of turning over substrates, albeit with less catalytic efficiency. The electrostatic interaction between Glu-143 and Lys-213 as well as the inability of the B deletion mutants to bind to rC(W196R) are consistent with this interpretation. The K d values for wild-type C and RI as well as for the two mutants, rC(W196R) and rRI(R333K), also indicate that the interaction with the PRS2 site provides most of the affinity for the interaction between RI and C.Table IVInhibition of mutant RI-subunits with rC(W196R)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Figure 9Model for the formation of partially inhibited holoenzyme complex. In the formation of wild-type holoenzyme, an initial docking event is followed by a conformational change that triggers the release of cAMP. This process requires both the inhibitor recognition site (IRS) and the PRS2 surface on C. When rC(W196R) was paired with cAMP-free rRI(R333K), a stable complex formed, but it was unable to undergo the final conformational switch (inset). This complex was partially active.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To understand fully the interactions between the regulatory and catalytic subunits of cAPK at a molecular level, a high resolution crystallographic model of the tetrameric holoenzyme complex is required. Crystallographic models of mutant holoenzyme complexes such as that formed between rRI(R333K) and rC(W196R) will test the model shown in Fig. 9, which may represent an intermediate in the holoenzyme-forming pathway.

Of equal physiological importance to the specificity of this enzyme for its protein substrates is its ability to be turned on and off in response to cellular signals. There are two known physiological inhibitors of cAPK, the regulatory subunits (RI and RII) and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The cooperative binding of cAMP to the inactive tetrameric holoenzyme, (R2C2), causes the complex to dissociate, releasing two active catalytic subunits (C) and a dimeric regulatory subunit saturated with four molecules of cAMP (R2cAMP4). PKIs interact only with the free C subunit and carry, in addition to a cAPK inhibition site, a nuclear export signal that shuttles the complex actively out of the nucleus (2Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The R subunits and PKIs inhibit C by a common mechanism. Both contain an inhibitory consensus sequence, RRXS/TΨ, that is shared by most substrates and inhibitors of cAPK, where the phosphorylation (P) site is either Ser, Thr, or Ala, X is any amino acid, and Ψ, at the P + 1 site, is a hydrophobic residue. In RI and PKI, the P site is an Ala, whereas in RII, this site is a phosphorylatable Ser (3Titani K. Sasagawa T. Ericsson L.H. Kumar S. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A.

This consensus site sequence binds competitively to the active site cleft and is similar for both R and PKI. However, this interaction is not sufficient to achieve high affinity binding. Binding to C is bipartite. Both R and PKI require an additional interaction site. As indicated in Fig. 1, the C subunit contains two distinct additional surfaces on the large lobe that are important for recognition of PKI and R. One surface, referred to here as peripheral recognition site 1 (PRS1), is essential for high affinity binding of PKI, and another is required for high affinity binding of R. The interactions that account for the high affinity of C and PKI are well defined in the crystal structure of C containing the 20 amino acid inhibitor peptide, IP20, derived from residues 5–24 of PKI (6Knighton D.R.

The enzymatic properties of recombinant soluble Fuc-TVII were then examined. Its enzyme activity was highest at pH 7.5, and the presence of 25 mm Mn2+ was required for full activity. Fuc-TVII exhibits an acceptor specificity restricted to α2,3-sialylated type 2 oligosaccharides, and the apparentK m values for α2,3-sialyl lacto-N-neotetraose and GDP-fucose were 3.08 mmand 16.4 μm, respectively. The inhibitory effects of various nucleotides on the activity of Fuc-TVII reflected its donor specificity for the nucleotide portion of GDP. Fuc-TVII was demonstrated to be useful for the synthesis of a sialyl Lewis x hexasaccharide from lacto-N-neotetraose in combination with an α2,3-sialyltransferase, ST3Gal IV. Polyethylene glycols enhanced the thermal stability of Fuc-TVII, leading to increased formation of the reaction product."

The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: TIMP-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1; rTIMP-1, recombinant TIMP-1 expressed in a recombinant vaccinia virus system; APMA, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate; FIB-CL, human fibroblast-type collagenase; HEp2, human epidermoid carcinoma cell line; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ECM, extracellular matrix. are a family of inhibitors which specifically block the proteolytic activity of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These two families of proteins are thought to play a significant role in tissue remodeling, a complex process that is necessary for a variety of normal biological functions from embryonic development and growth to wound healing. Tissue remodeling is a tightly regulated process under normal conditions that is characterized by the breakdown and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The degradation of the ECM can be accomplished to a large extent by the MMPs, which are able to cleave most of the components of the ECM (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Due to their specificity for the MMPs, the TIMPs are thought to play a major role in the regulation of the remodeling process. Treatment of cells in vitro by a number of agents including growth factors (2Colige A.C. Lambert C.A. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to differentially regulate expression of the various MMPs and inhibitors, indicating the complexity of the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in tissue degradation. Upon stimulation, cells secrete the proenzyme forms of the MMPs which must be activated before ECM degradation can occur (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). This activation process serves as another step in controlling the proteolytic degradation of the ECM. The TIMPs have been shown to function both as inhibitors of active metalloproteinases and as inhibitors of the activation process itself.

Currently, cDNAs that encode four members of the TIMP family (TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4) have been cloned (13Carmichael D.F. Sommer A. Thompson R.C. Anderson D.C. Smith C.G. Welgus H.G. Stricklin G.P.

These inhibitors show a high degree of sequence homology at the amino acid level with the most highly conserved regions including the amino-terminal region and the 12 cysteines present in each molecule. The disulfide bonding pattern has been determined for TIMP-1 (18Williamson R.A. Marston F.A.O. Angal S. Koklitis P. Panico M. Morris H.R. Carne A.F. Smith B.J. Harris T.J.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (Fig.1) and is probably similar in all TIMPs, due to the high degree of conservation of the cysteines. TIMP-1 is resistant to extremes of temperature and pH (13Carmichael D.F. Sommer A. Thompson R.C. Anderson D.C. Smith C.G. Welgus H.G. Stricklin G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2407-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This structural stability may be due in part to the six disulfide bonds within the molecule. To investigate structure-function relationships, a number of mutants were made in which the cysteines in TIMP-1 were replaced with serines. Although there was a significant loss of inhibitory activity in some of the mutants, circular dichroism and trypsin susceptibility experiments indicated that the structural integrity of the mutant molecules had not been significantly changed. The effects of each of these mutations has been studied with regard to their ability to complex with and inhibit FIB-CL or M r 72,000 gelatinase. The cDNA clone for TIMP-1 was a gift of Dr. David Carmichael (Synergen, Boulder, CO). The signal sequence was not present in the original cDNA, but was obtained from the published sequence of TIMP-1 (19Adachi E. Hayashi T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1986; 14: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The complete signal sequence for TIMP-1 was added for export of the protein by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-oligonucleotide that contained a unique BamHI cleavage site (underlined) upstream of the start codon (double underlined) and the coding sequence for the signal peptide. The downstream oligonucleotide to be used for amplification also included a BamHI cleavage site: 2721 (upstream oligonucleotide, sense strand), 5′-GTTCAGGATCCACCATGGCCCCCTTTGAGCCCCTGGCTTCTGGCATCCTGTTGTTGCTGTGGCTGATAGCCCCCAGCAGGGCCTGCACCTGTGT-3′; 2612 (downstream oligonucleotide, antisense strand), 5′-TAGGTGGATCCACTCCGGGCAGGATTCAGGCT-3′. The amplified DNA was ligated into the BamHI site of the vaccinia virus vector pTF7.5 (20Confer D.L. Eaton J.W. Science. 1982; 217: 948-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) between the bacteriophage T7 promoter and terminator sequences. The TIMP-1 open reading frame and the T7 promoter and terminator sequences were flanked on both the left and right ends by vaccinia virus thymidine kinase gene sequences (TKL and TKR) to allow for homologous recombination into the wild-type virus. The nucleotide sequence of the resulting plasmid, pT-TIMP-1, was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and by double-stranded DNA sequencing (21Mierendorf R.C. Pfeffer D.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the oligonucleotides listed below (the mutated amino acid codon is underlined): 4976, 5′-GCCCCCAGCAGGGCCTCCACCTGTGTCCCAC-3′ (C1S); 4978, 5′-GCCATGGAGAGTGTCTCCGGATACTTCCACAGG-3′ (C70S); 3988, 5′-CAGGGCCTGCACCTCCGTCCCACCCCAC-3′ (C3S); 3991, 5′-GCACATCACTACCTCCAGTTTCGTGGCT-3′ (C99S); 4977, 5′-CCACAGACGGCCTTCTCCAATTCCGACCTCGTC-3′ (C13S); 6097, 5′-CCTACACTGTTGGCTCCGAGGAATGCACAG-3′ (C124S); 6098, 5′-GTTGGCTGTGAGGAATCCACAGTGTTTCCC-3′ (C127S); 6096, 5′-TGTTTATCCATCCCCTCCAAACTGCAGAGT-3′ (C137S); 6133, 5′-TACACTGTTGGCTGTCAGCAGTGCACAGTGTTTC-3′ (CEEC → CQQC); 6134, 5′-TACACTGTTGGCTGTGACGACTGCACAGTGTTTC-3′ (CEEC → CDDC). Bacteria carrying plasmids containing each mutated gene were detected by colony hybridization (26$$Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled mutagenic oligonucleotide as a probe. The sequences of the isolated mutants were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the double-stranded DNA (21Mierendorf R.C. Pfeffer D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Kraft R. Tardiff J. Krauter K.S. Leinwand L.A. BioTechnology. 1988; 6: 544-546Google Scholar). Each mutant was cloned into the BamHI site of the vaccinia virus vector vTF7.5 (27Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar), which contains the flanking sequences of the thymidine kinase gene as well as the bacteriophage T7 promoter. The thymidine kinase flanking regions allow for homologous recombination of the TIMP-1 DNA into the virus genome, effectively replacing the viral thymidine kinase gene resulting in recombinant virus with a TK− phenotype. TIMP-1 mutants containing two cysteine to serine changes (C1S in combination with C70S and C3S in combination with C99S) were created by digestion of each mutant with the restriction endonuclease NcoI. The 270-base pair insert containing either the C1S or the C3S mutation was band purified onto DEAE paper (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) and ligated into the 4900-base pair vector containing either the C70S or C99S mutation. The presence of both mutations in the resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing of the double-stranded plasmid DNA. Confluent 35-mm2 plates of human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp2) cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were infected with wild-type vaccinia virus in 0.5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (“Opti-MEM,” Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After 2 h, an additional 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM was added to the infected cells followed by 0.1 ml of a mixture containing 5 μg of pT-TIMP-1 plasmid combined with 0.025 ml of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were collected 18 h after infection and a viral lysate was prepared by sonication in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Dilutions of this viral lysate were used to infect human thymidine kinase minus (TK− 143, ATCC) cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT) and 25 μg/ml 5-bromodeoxyuridine. HeLa S3 cells (ATCC) were co-infected with TK− viruses and recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3, which expresses T7 RNA polymerase (27Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar), to test for TIMP-1 production. Media from these co-infections were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of TIMP-1. Recombinant viruses that expressed TIMP-1 were plaque purified a second time, prior to expansion of the virus stock in HEp2 cells. One liter of HeLa S3 cells grown in spinner culture to a density of 106 cells/ml were co-infected with recombinant virus containing wild-type or mutated rTIMP-1 genes and with vTF7.3 in serum-free medium (multiplicity of infection 7 for each virus). The medium was collected after 24 h and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Dialyzed media were cleared by centrifugation (30,000 × g; 30 min) and then passed over a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0.0–1.0m) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing TIMP-1 as identified by Western analysis were combined and adjusted to pH 4.0 before application to a C4 reverse phase column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The column was eluted with a 30–50% gradient of acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Most TIMP-1 mutants, as with wild-type, eluted from the column at 38% acetonitrile. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12.5 or 13% gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Samples for Western analysis were transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY) after SDS-PAGE. The filters were blocked with 1% non-fat powdered milk and then developed with polyclonal anti-TIMP-1 antibody (polyclonal antibody 2315) (29Bodden M.K. Harber G.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. Windsor L.J.

Birkedal-Hansen H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6751-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) was used as the secondary antibody and the blot was developed with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Bethesda, MD). In some cases the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). rTIMP-1 and TIMP-1 mutants were incubated with 10 μg/ml trypsin for 2 h at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm ZnCl2. At time points 0, 30, 60, and 120 min, an aliquot of the digest was removed and added to soybean trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and 1 mm, respectively). After 5 min, 10 mm dithiothreitol and Laemmli reducing sample buffer were added. To study trypsin effects on fully denatured and reduced rTIMP-1, rTIMP-1 was reduced and alkylated prior to exposure to trypsin. For reduction and alkylation, rTIMP-1 was boiled in 10 mmdithiothreitol for 10 min followed by addition of 100 mmiodoacetamide. This solution was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 10 mm iodoacetamide for 6 h. The sample was then treated with trypsin as described above and sample dye added. Samples were resolved on 13% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by Western analysis using polyclonal antibody 2315 (29Bodden M.K. Harber G.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C.M. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18943-18952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural analysis of wild-type and mutant TIMP-1 molecules was performed using circular dichroism. Fractions of purified TIMP-1 or TIMP-1 mutants, following reverse phase chromatography, were dried down in a SpeedVac (Savant, Farmingdale, NY) and resuspended in deionized water (dH2O) containing 0.05% Brij-35. Spectra were recorded with an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) on solutions of TIMP-1 and TIMP-1 mutants in a 0.01-cm cell. The spectra were measured every 0.5 nm with a 1-s averaging per point and a 2-nm bandwidth. Five scans per sample were signal-averaged and baseline corrected for by subtracting a spectrum for buffer alone obtained in an identical manner. The data were analyzed with the computer program PROSEC, which is based on Yang's (39Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) method for secondary structure analysis. Complex formation was examined using a modification of the technique of DeClerck et al. (30DeClerck Y.A. Yean T.D. Lu H.S. Ting J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3893-3899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (31Windsor L.J. Bodden M.K. Birkedal-Hansen B. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26201-26207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native FIB-CL was purified from conditioned medium of human gingival fibroblast cells by immunoaffinity chromatography (32Birkedal-Hansen B. Moore W.G.I. Taylor R.E. Bhown A.S. Birkedal-Hansen H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6751-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using a commercial protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) in which the OD595 of known quantities of bovine serum albumin were used as a standard. FIB-CL (40 μg/ml) was activated with 1 mm APMA for 90 min at 37 °C and then mixed with 40 μg/ml rTIMP-1 or mutants in a total volume of 100 μl and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Following addition of dithiothreitol (final concentration 10 mm) and modified Laemmli reducing sample buffer containing only a final concentration of 0.1% SDS, the samples were loaded without boiling and resolved on two companion 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Complexes were visualized by Western analysis using a combination of monoclonal anti-FIB-CL antibodies (III12 and VI3) (32Birkedal-Hansen B. Moore W.G.I. Taylor R.E. Bhown A.S. Birkedal-Hansen H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6751-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two native substrate assays were used for analysis of TIMP-1 inhibitory activity. The fibrillar collagen assay described by Birkedal-Hansen (33Birkedal-Hansen H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 140-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was used to determine the ability of the mutants to inhibit FIB-CL. FIB-CL was activated by incubation with 1 mm APMA for 90 min at 37 °C. Ninety-six well microtiter plates containing 30 μg of reconstituted3H-labeled type I collagen fibrils were incubated at 35 °C in the presence of APMA-activated FIB-CL (final concentration 1 μg/ml) and serial dilutions of rTIMP-1 and mutants in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 μmZnCl2. Collagenase activity was measured by the release of radioactivity from the gel. Addition of active TIMP-1 results in the inhibition of FIB-CL and could be determined by a decrease in the amount of radioactivity released. TIMP-1 inhibition of M r 72,000 gelatinase was analyzed by an assay modified from Lyons et al. (34Lyons J.G. Birkedal-Hansen B. Moore W.G.I. O'Grady R.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1450-1456Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which uses Xenobind 96-well plates (Xenopore, Saddlebrook, NJ) coated with [3H]gelatin (collagen denatured by heating to 57 °C for 20 min). The Xenobind plates allow for the covalent attachment of gelatin, which can be released by cleavage of the gelatin by gelatinase. The M r 72,000 gelatinase (TIMP-free) was purified by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography in a procedure (29Bodden M.K. Harber G.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C.M. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18943-18952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified from Hibbs et al. (35Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2493-2500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M r72,000 gelatinase was activated using 1 mm APMA for 30 min at 37 °C. The activated enzyme was incubated (final concentration 20 ng/ml) in the presence of varying amounts of purified TIMP-1 or mutants in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 μmZnCl2 for 3 h at 37 °C. The inhibitory ability of the mutant TIMPs or rTIMP-1 was measured by a decrease in the amount of radioactivity released in the presence of rTIMP-1 or TIMP-1 mutants as compared with M r 72,000 gelatinase alone. Kinetic analysis was carried out using the coumarinyl peptide derivative MCA-P-L-G-L-Dpa-A-R (36Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA). The peptide (2.5 μm) and inhibitor (3–150 nm) were combined in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 μmZnCl2 at 25 °C. APMA-activated FIB-CL (3 nm) was added and emergence of fluorescence was monitored using a SLM AMINCO SPF-500C Spectrofluorometer (excitation wavelength 328 nm; emission wavelength 393 nm). Time course data were taken as described previously (43Taylor K.B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C.M. Bodden M.K. Engler J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23938-23945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) for enzyme alone as well as for enzyme with at least six concentrations of inhibitor. The data were fit to the differential equations derived for various models with a computer program (Scientist, Micromath, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) that performed optimization of the fit and numeric integration of the equations simultaneously (43Taylor K.B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C.M. Bodden M.K. Engler J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23938-23945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Estimates were produced for the model selection criterion. The model selection criterion, calculated by the computer program (37MicroMath Scientific Software Scientist Handbook. MicroMath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City1993: 207-208Google Scholar), is a modification of the Akaike information criterion (38Akaike H. Math. Sci. 1976; 14: 5-9Google Scholar) and is proportional to the goodness of fit of the model. It is the natural logarithm of the sum of the residuals, normalized for the magnitude of the data and adjusted for the number of unknown parameters in the model. Wild-type and mutant TIMP-1 were expressed using a vaccinia virus system and purified from the media of infected HeLa cells. Both single and paired cysteines were mutated to serine throughout the TIMP-1 molecule (Fig. 1). A replacement mutant at Cys137 was chosen to serve as a negative control, since previous work had shown that deletion of the TIMP-1 molecule at amino acid 127 (Cys127 → stop) retains most of the inhibitory capacity of wild-type TIMP-1 2N. C. M. Caterina, unpublished data. (40Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Therefore, residues beyond amino acid 127 seem to be relatively less important for inhibitory activity. Single replacement mutants of Cys1, Cys70, Cys99, and Cys137 with serine all yielded sufficient quantities of secreted protein for purification. In addition, double replacement mutants were constructed in which both partners in a particular sulfhydryl bridge were replaced; in this way, the possibility of aberrant formation of sulfhydryl bridges might be avoided. The mutation of C3S resulted in insufficient levels of protein for purification. However, a double mutate of C3S and C99S was produced and secreted at wild-type levels and could be purified. Following purification, 2 μg of each mutant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig.2). The region surrounding the disulfide bonds of Cys13-Cys124 appears to be very important. Attempts to replace the cysteines at position 13, 124, or 127 resulted in proteins which could be made transiently inside infected cells, but for which a virus recombinant that expressed the mutant protein in culture medium could not be isolated. A truncation mutant in which Cys124 was replaced with a stop codon for translation failed to give any protein even in transient expression assays, although a similar truncation mutant at Cys127 does make functional protein (40Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).2 These results suggested the potential importance of the region between Cys124 and Cys127. Accordingly, two other mutations within this region were made: a mutation in which the CEEC residues were replaced with CQQC and a mutation in which CEEC was replaced with CDDC. Interestingly, the CQQC mutant could be expressed and purified in the same manner as wild-type, whereas the CDDC mutation failed to show any protein expression even in transient assays. The observation that most mutants in this region have severe defects that apparently preclude expression and/or secretion of protein suggests that alterations of these residues may have profound effects on protein structure, sensitivity to cellular proteinases, and/or perhaps also on function"

We have isolated lipoyltransferase I (LipTI) and II (LipTII) from bovine liver (Fujiwara, K., Okamura-Ikeda, K., and Motokawa, Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16605–16609). N-terminal amino acid sequences of LipTI and LipTII were identical except that LipTI had an additional Asn residue on the N terminus. We cloned LipTII cDNA from a bovine liver cDNA library. The cDNA insert contained a 1119-base pair open reading frame encoding a precursor peptide of 373 amino acids including a mitochondrial targeting signal of 26 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein is 39,137 Da. The predicted amino acid sequence showed 35% identity with that of Escherichia coli lipoate-protein ligase A. Northern and Southern blot analyses showed a single band, and a single species of mRNA for lipoyltransferase was found by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Recombinant LipTII was expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The K m app values of the recombinant enzyme for lipoyl-AMP and apoH-protein were comparable with those of native LipTII. An antibody raised against recombinant enzyme cross-reacted with LipTI and LipTII in a similar manner. The results suggest that LipTI and LipTII are derived from the same translated product but processed differently. Lipoyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the lipoyl group from lipoyl-AMP to the specific lysine residue of the lipoate-dependent enzymes. We have isolated lipoyltransferase I (LipTI) and II (LipTII) from bovine liver (Fujiwara, K., Okamura-Ikeda, K., and Motokawa, Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16605–16609).

Lipoic acid is a prosthetic group of H-proteins of the glycine cleavage system and the acyltransferase components of the pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, and branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (1Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8836-8841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Lipoate attaches to the ε-amino group of the specific lysine residue of the proteins via an amide linkage. Lipoylated proteins use this prosthetic group as a carrier of intermediates and reducing equivalents during enzymic reactions. The covalent attachment of lipoic acid occurs in two distinct steps as follows. lipoic acid+ATP→lipoyl­AMP+PPilipoyl­AMP+apoprotein→holoprotein+AMPReactions 1 and 2 In mammals, Reaction 1 is catalyzed by lipoate-activating enzyme (5Tsunoda J.N. Yasunobu K.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 118: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Reaction 2 is catalyzed by lipoyl-AMP:N ε-lysine lipoyltransferase (lipoyltransferase) (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have isolated two isoforms of lipoyltransferase, lipoyltransferase I (LipTI) 1The abbreviations used are: LipTI, lipoyltransferase I; LipTII, lipoyltransferase II; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: LipTI, lipoyltransferase I; LipTII, lipoyltransferase II; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s). and II (LipTII), from bovine liver mitochondria employing apoH-protein as an acceptor of lipoic acid. We have purified LipTII to homogeneity, but homogeneous LipTI has not been obtained yet. Although the isoforms were separated by the chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column, they showed similar molecular mass (about 40 kDa), catalytic properties, and behavior on column chromatographies except on hydroxylapatite. They also catalyze the transfer of lipoyl group from lipoyl-AMP to apolipoyl domains of acyltransferase components of the pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, and branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (7Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12932-12936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, lipoate-protein ligase of Escherichia coli catalyzes both Reactions 1 and 2 (8Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the structure and function of LipTII and its relationship to LipTI, we isolated and sequenced cDNA encoding bovine liver LipTII and expressed the protein in E. coli. Deduced amino acid sequence of LipTII contained the N-terminal amino acid sequence of LipTI determined by Edman degradation. An antibody raised against the recombinant protein cross-reacted with LipTI and LipTII in a similar manner. Only one mRNA species was obtained from bovine live by RT-PCR reaction. The evidence reported here suggests the possibility that LipTI and LipTII are derived from the same translated product but processed differently. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan), or Takara Shuzo (Shiga, Japan). Oligonucleotides, SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, RNase H, RNase T1, and Glass Max cartridge were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Placental RNase inhibitor was from Promega. Lysylendopeptidase and p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Lipoyl-AMP and lipoyltransferase from bovine liver were prepared as described previously (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA manipulations were accomplished by standard techniques (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides encoding for two different regions of LipTII were used for screening. Probe 1 (5′-AA(T/C)GA(T/C)GT(T/C/A/G)TA(T/C)CA(T/C)AA-3′) encoded for residues 13–18, and probe 2 (5′-CAT(A/G)TG(A/G)TC(A/G)TG(A/T/G)ATCCA-3′) encoded for residues 24–29 (see Fig. 1 B). They were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and used to screen a λgt10 bovine liver cDNA library (CLONTECH). The hybridization and washing of Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham) were carried out as described previously except that the final washings were carried out at 41 and 44 °C with probe 1 and probe 2, respectively (10Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17463-17467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insert cDNA prepared from a positive clone was subcloned into pTZ18U and fully sequenced in both orientations employing a 373A DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). Bovine genomic DNA (3 μg) isolated from blood leukocytes (11Herrmann B.G. Frischauf A.-M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRV,HindIII, KpnI, PstI, or SacI. DNA fragments were resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel, treated with 0.25 m HCl for 20 min, and transferred to Hybond N+ under alkaline condition. The membranes were hybridized with a 1.1-kilobase pair SphI/HincII cDNA fragment (see Fig. 1 A) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham). Hybridization and the final washing with 0.1 × SSPE/0.1% SDS (1 × SSPE = 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 60 °C for 5 min were carried out according to the protocol provided by Amersham. Total RNA was prepared from bovine liver using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the total RNA employing Message Maker Reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde/agarose gel with 0.24–9.5-kilobase RNA ladder markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transferred to Hybond N+ (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Conditions of hybridization with the 32P-labeled SphI/HincII cDNA fragment and washing of the membrane were as described (10Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17463-17467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR reaction was performed to isolate a variant cDNA for lipoyltransferase employing poly(A)+RNA prepared as above. A mixture of 500 ng of poly(A)+ RNA and 2.5 pmol of gene-specific reverse primer, 5′-CATCAAAACTGTCAACATTAAG-3′ (nucleotides 1247–1226; see Fig.1 B), in 15 μl was heated at 70 °C for 10 min and then cooled on ice. First strand cDNA was synthesized at 44 °C for 50 min in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing the above mixture of poly(A)+ RNA and reverse primer, 200 μmdNTPs, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 58 units placental RNase inhibitor, and 200 units SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The reaction was terminated by heating at 70 °C for 15 min, and RNase H and RNase T1 were added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The product was purified with Glass Max cartridge according to a protocol provided by the manufacturer. The PCR reaction mixture contained (in a total volume of 50 μl) a fifth of the first strand product, 40 pmol forward primer, 5′-ATTCTAGAAACACAGTTAAAAGTGGACTC-3′ (XbaI site (underlined) then nucleotides 165–185 (see Fig.1 B)), 40 pmol reverse primer, 5′-AATCTAGAATTAAGAAATTTACTTGGAATCA-3′ (XbaI site (underlined) then nucleotides 1228–1209 (see Fig. 1 B)), 250 μm dNTPs, 2.5 units TaKaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase, and LA PCR buffer (Takara Shuzo) containing 2 mm MgCl2. PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 51 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. After agarose gel electrophoresis, an amplified fragment was isolated with QIAEX (QIAGEN), digested with XbaI, and cloned into pTZ18U. For expression of the recombinant mature form of LipTII (designated LipT(T)) an SphI/XbaI cDNA fragment encoding the full-length mature LipTII was subcloned into phagemid vector pTZ19U. Creation of an NdeI site adjacent to the codon for the N-terminal Thr residue of the mature protein and a BamHI site 53 bases downstream from the stop codon was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel et al. (12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad kit. Antisense primer 1 (5′-TCCACTTTTAACTGT CATATG AAAGCCAGCTGCT-3′; nucleotides 182–149 (see Fig. 1 B); the NdeI site is underlined, and modified bases are shown in boldface letters) and antisense primer 2 (5′-TTTAAAAATGCACTGGATCCATTTTAATTTTCTCA-3′; nucleotides 1280–1246; the BamHI site is underlined and modified bases are shown in boldface letters) were employed, respectively. NdeI and BamHI sites originally present in the coding region of LipTII cDNA (see Fig.1 A) were deleted simultaneously with antisense primer 3 (5′-CCTTCTAAATTCATGTGGTCGTGTATCCAGTCTTCTAC-3′; nucleotides 266–228; modified bases are shown in boldface letters) without altering the amino acid sequences. The NdeI/BamHI fragment was isolated from the mutant phagemid and ligated to the expression plasmid pET-3a (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) digested with NdeI and BamHI. The nucleotide sequence of the resultant expression vector, pLipT(T), was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression vector for LipT(N), which has an additional Asn residue at the N-terminal end of LipT(T), was constructed using antisense primers 2, 3, and 4 (5′-ACTTTTAACTGTGTT CATATG GCCAGCTGCTGG-3′; nucleotides 179–147; the NdeI site is underlined and modified bases are shown in boldface letters) as described for the construction of pLipT(T). The resulting plasmid was designated pLipT(N). pLipT(T) and pLipT(N) were introduced separately into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 400 ml of LB medium (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 30 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression was induced by the addition of 25 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at the start of the culture. After incubation at 30 °C for 22 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C unless indicated. The cell pellet was frozen and thawed in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and sonicated twice for 1 min with a duty cycle of 50% (Branson Sonifier 250). The inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant fraction at 105,000 × g for 1 h. LipT(T) was purified from the extract by the chromatography on hydroxylapatite (2.5 × 6 cm), DEAE-Sepharose (1 × 3 cm), and apoH-protein-Sepharose affinity columns (3 ml) as described for the purification of lipoyltransferase from bovine liver (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity and steady state kinetic constants were determined as described previously (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of lipoyltransferase activity is defined as that catalyzing the formation of 1 nmol of lipoylated H-protein/min. Purified LipT(T) (0.2 mg) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and subcutaneously injected into a rabbit. 2 and 4 weeks later, boosters containing 0.15 mg of LipT(T) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were injected. The blood sample was taken 10 days after the second booster injection. IgG fraction was obtained by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 40% saturation. 10 ng of LipT(T), LipTI, and LipTII were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore), and incubated with anti-LipT(T) antibody diluted 2000-fold with 0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl. The antigens were located with ProtoBlot AP system (Promega) as described (2Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was carried out in a mixture of 14-μl phosphate-buffered saline containing the indicated amount of IgG and 21.6 or 24.1 ng of LipTI or LipTII, respectively. The amount of protein was kept constant by the addition of bovine serum albumin. The control experiment was carried out with nonimmune IgG. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, the supernatant fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and a quarter of each supernatant fraction was employed for the assay of lipoyltransferase activity. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of LipTI, LipTII, and lysylpeptides were determined using an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer and a Hewlet Packard G100A protein sequencer. The lysylpeptides were obtained by digestion of carboxymethylated LipTII with lysylendopeptidase and separation of the peptides by high performance liquid chromatography on an ODS column as described previously (2Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE were carried out as described (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of LipTII and amino acid sequences of several lysylpeptides derived from LipTII were examined (Fig. 1 B). To isolate cDNA encoding LipTII, two degenerated oligonucleotide probes were synthesized based on the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of LipTII. Approximately 2.4 × 106 independent clones in a λgt10 bovine liver cDNA library were screened, and only one positive clone that hybridized with both probes was obtained. It may reflect a low abundance mRNA of lipoyltransferase as expected from the yield of the purified enzyme (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insert cDNA of the clone is 1326-bp long and consists of an 89-bp 5′-untranslated region, a 1119-bp open reading frame, and a 118-bp 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The sequence AGCATGC surrounding the first inflame ATG codon is in good agreement with the optimum translation initiation sequence (ACCATGG) described by Kozak (16Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encodes a 373-amino acid protein. The predicted amino acid sequence completely matches the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified LipTII and amino acid sequences of lysylpeptides (Fig. 1 B). Thus, a mitochondrial targeting signal of 26 amino acids is predicted. The predicted size of the mature protein (347 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 39,137 Da) is in good agreement with the size previously determined by SDS-PAGE (40 kDa) (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A putative polyadenylation signal, ATTAAA, is located 20 bp upstream from the poly(A) tail. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of LipTI was determined to be NTVKSGLILQSISNDVYHNL-. This sequence was identical to the residues −1 to 19 of LipTII (Fig.1 B), suggesting that LipTI and LipTII are produced from the same translated product by alternative processing in mitochondria. Protein sequence similarity between LipTII and known proteins was analyzed by searching the data library of the DNA Data Bank of Japan using the FASTA program (version 3.0). LipTII showed 35, 32, and 28% identity with E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A (8Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yeast hypothetical protein (accession number, Swiss-Prot P47051), and Mycoplasma genitalium probable lipoate-protein ligase A (P47512), respectively (Fig. 2). In particular, amino acids 8–86 of LipTII shares high homology with residues 6–85 of E. coli enzyme (59% identity), suggesting that the N-terminal domain of these proteins may be responsible for the lipoate-transferring activity. In contrast, the C-terminal part of these proteins is less homologous. Presumably, the C-terminal half of E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A may be involved in the lipoate activating activity that bovine lipoyltransferase lacks. Because LipTI and LipTII share the identical amino acid sequence around the N-terminal region, Southern blot analysis was carried out to examine whether more than one gene encoding lipoyltransferase was present employing the LipTII cDNA as a probe. A single band was detected in each enzyme digest (Fig. 3 A). The result suggests the presence of a single copy gene encoding lipoyltransferase. A Northern blot that contains size fractionated bovine liver poly(A)+ RNA was probed with the 32P-labeled SphI/HincII cDNA fragment. A single mRNA species of about 1.5 kilobases long was detected (Fig. 3 B). The size of the message corresponds to that of the cloned cDNA. Although Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a single mRNA species for lipoyltransferase, a possibility exists that the mRNA includes a variant for LipTI with minor differences at the internal region of the sequence produced by alternative splicing. To examine the possibility, RT-PCR was utilized with primers that were synthesized based on the findings that LipTI has an N-terminal amino acid sequence identical with that of LipTII and a molecular mass similar to LipTII. If mRNA for LipTI co-exists, two kinds of cDNA should be isolated with identical ratio by the cloning of the RT-PCR products, because the levels of LipTI and LipTII in bovine liver are nearly equal (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products showed only a single band of about 1100 bp on agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs from 24 independent clones were identical to that of LipTII (Fig. 1 B), except that a few of them showed a single base replacement at a different site caused by misreading by polymerase in the PCR reaction. The result suggests that LipTI and LipTII are products from a single mRNA species. LipT(T) was expressed in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The induction of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring pLipT(T) with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside resulted in high level expression of a 40-kDa protein (Fig.4 A). Although most of the expressed protein was sequestered in inclusion bodies, the supernatant fraction obtained from the cell extracts exhibited about 100-fold higher lipoyltransferase activity (5.97 units/mg protein) than that from control cells harboring pET-3a (0.04 unit/mg protein). The protein from inclusion bodies solubilized with 6 m urea had a low lipoyltransferase activity. Attempts to recover fully active LipT(T) from the inclusion bodies through the use of urea, followed by dialysis for 2 days during which urea was incrementally diluted, were unsuccessful. We purified LipT(T) from the supernatant fraction to homogeneity by the successive chromatographies on hydroxylapatite, DEAE-Sepharose, and apoH-protein-Sepharose affinity columns (Fig.4 B). Table I summarizes a typical purification of LipT(T) from a 400-ml culture. LipT(T) emerged from the hydroxylapatite column at about 230 mm phosphate, nearly the same concentration at which LipTII was eluted from the column (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of LipT(T) showed that the initiation Met residue was cleaved off by an E. colimethionyl-aminopeptidase in agreement with the rule for the methionine removal from protein in E. coli (17Hirel P.-H. Schmitter J.-M. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Steady state kinetic studies were carried out by varying the concentration of one substrate while keeping the concentration of the other substrate constant. The K m app values for lipoyl-AMP and apoH-protein of LipT(T) were comparable with those of LipTII, but the V maxapp value was more than 3-fold that of LipTII (Table II). The difference may be due in part to the inactivation of LipTII during the purification because the purification of LipTII required another two steps of column chromatography (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LipT(T) could not lipoylate apoH-protein with lipoate plus MgATP, confirming the previous observation that bovine lipoyltransferase has no ability to activate lipoate to lipoyl-AMP (6Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPurification of recombinant lipoyltransferase II (LipT(T))StepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Extract227.6944.64.2100Hydroxylapatite6.33738.7116.778DEAE-Sepharose2.95570.9193.560ApoH-protein-Sepharose2.33533.1228.856 Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic constants of lipoyltransferaseLipoyltransferaseKm app for lipoyl-AMPKm app for apoH-proteinV maxappμmμmunits/mg proteinLipT(T)90.24557LipTII110.23148 Open table in a new tab We attempted to express and purify a protein that has an additional Asn residue on the N terminus of LipT(T). The protein designated LipT(N) was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Again the substantial amounts of LipT(N) were segregated in inclusion bodies. The cell extract showed a lipoylation activity of 5.31 units/mg protein comparable with that of LipT(T). LipT(N) was eluted at about 190 mm phosphate from a hydroxylapatite column. The behavior was quite similar to that of LipTI. However, most of the LipT(N) protein passed through the column of DEAE-Sepharose in a condition where LipTI and LipTII activities can be retained on the column. Amino acid sequence analysis of the partially purified LipT(N) revealed that the protein has an initiation Met residue on the N terminus. To further elucidate the relationship between LipTI and LipTII, we raised an antibody against the purified LipT(T) and examined the reactivity of LipTI and LipTII with the antibody. Western blotting (Fig.5 A) showed that both LipTI and LipTII were equally recognized by anti-LipT(T) antibody. An immunoprecipitation experiment showed similar inactivation curves of the activities of LipTI and LipTII with the increase of the amount of antibody (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that LipTI and LipTII are structurally related proteins. This report describes the cloning of the full-length cDNA for bovine lipoyltransferase II. The cDNA contained a 1119-bp open reading frame encoding a peptide of 373 amino acids. The protein consists of a mitochondrial targeting signal of 26 amino acids and a mature protein of 347 amino acids. The mitochondrial targeting signal showed characteristic properties such as a high content of basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues, an absence of acidic residues, and amphiphilicity (18Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This confirms the localization of lipoyltransferase in mitochondria as concluded previously from the distribution of the activity and translocation experiments of H-protein (2Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cloning of LipTII has not resulted in very high levels of expressed soluble enzyme because the majority of recombinant LipTII (LipT(T)) is produced as inclusion bodies, it has facilitated the isolation and purification of the enzyme to homogeneity in an active form in quantities sufficient for the characterization of the enzyme. LipT(T) expressed in E. coli showed similar properties as compared with the native enzyme but a higher V maxapp value. LipT(T) was unable to activate lipoic acid in agreement with the previous observation with the native enzyme. Thus it is confirmed that bovine lipoyltransferase catalyzes only lipoate transfer from lipoyl-AMP to apoproteins. Comparison of the primary sequence of LipTII and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A, which catalyzes both the activation of lipoic acid and the transfer of lipoate, revealed a strong homology in N-terminal region, suggesting that the active site for the transfer of lipoate to proteins is located within the N-terminal half of these proteins. E. coli biotin-protein ligase (BirA) and human holocarboxylase synthetase catalyze the attachment of biotin to biotin-dependent enzymes by two-step reactions similar to the lipoylation reaction. The enzymes contain the sequence GXGXXG predicted as a consensus sequence associated with ATP binding (19Howard P.K. Shaw J. Otsuka A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20León-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1994; 8: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inspection of amino acid sequence of bovine LipTII revealed no similar sequence as expected, because LipTII catalyzes no ATP-dependent activation of lipoic acid. An intriguing finding was that a stretch of the predicted amino acid sequence of LipTII (amino acids −1 to 19, Fig. 1 B) completely matched the N-terminal amino acid sequence of LipTI. Although the internal amino acid sequence of LipTI has not been examined, it seems likely that LipTI and LipTII are derived from the same translated product. Several pieces of evidence favor this possibility: (i) The behaviors of LipT(T) and LipT(N) on a hydroxylapatite column were similar to that of native LipTII and LipTI, respectively. (ii) LipTI and LipTII were equally recognized by anti-LipT(T) antibody. (iii) Southern blot analysis suggested that bovine lipoyltransferase appears to be encoded by a single copy gene. (iv) Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of a single transcript of 1.5 kilobases. (v) A specific mRNA for LipTI could not be detected by RT-PCR analysis. We cloned and expressed a cDNA encoding mammalian lipoyltransferase for the first time. Purification of lipoyltransferase from animal liver is laborious because of the low content of the enzyme. Here we present a simple purification method to obtain milligram quantities of recombinant bovine lipoyltransferase II. The recombinant enzyme showed the same properties as the native enzyme. The availability of cDNA clone coding for lipoyltransferase should facilitate studies of structural and functional aspects of this enzyme.

Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of IFN-α and IFN-β on NOS-2 activity. These types of interferons did not aid LPS in the production of nitrite, but markedly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the nitrite release due to LPS/IFN-γ. Analysis by Western and Northern blots showed that RPE cells co-stimulated with IFN-α or IFN-β with LPS/IFN-γ accumulated lower levels of NOS-2 protein and mRNA than in the presence of LPS/IFN-γ alone. The presence of IFN-α or IFN-β did not accelerate mRNA degradation, implying that these interferons did not affect NOS-2 mRNA stability, but more probably NOS-2 gene expression. Furthermore, IFN-γ binding studies demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of IFN-α and IFN-β is not caused by a blocking of IFN-γ receptors. Analysis of NF-κB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that LPS/IFN-γ-induced NF-κB binding was not changed by the presence of IFN-α. However, similar experiments revealed that the activation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) by LPS/IFN-γ was decreased by IFN-α. This phenomenon could be due to the decline of IRF-1 mRNA and the up-regulation of IRF-2 mRNA, an IRF-1 repressor, by IFN-α. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of IFN-α and -β on NOS-2 induction could be partially explained by their effect on the induction of the IRFs, which were involved in NOS-2 gene transcription.

The role of sustained NO production by the inducible NOS (NOS-2) is well described in murine macrophages, where NO is responsible for their cytostatic and cytolytic activities toward invading organisms (2Nathan C.

On the other hand, NO generated by NOS-2 is also involved in some pathophysiological states, generally related to local and systemic inflammation (2Nathan C. Xie Q.

In rat and bovine RPE cells, NOS-2 mRNA activity is induced only by cooperation between IFN-γ and LPS and can be potentiated in the rat by the addition of TNF-α (15Liversidge J. Grabowski P. Ralston S. Benjamin N. Forrester J.V. Immunolgy. 1994; 83: 404-409PubMed Google Scholar).

Several lines of evidence indicate that in murine macrophages all three species of interferon, IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ, are able to aid LPS in the release of nitrite (16Ding A.H. Nathan C.F.

However, only IFN-γ induced NO release alone, and the combination of LPS with IFN-γ was the more potent for NOS-2 induction (16Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J.

Immonen I. Cantell K. Vaheri A. Ophthalmic Res. 1993; 26: 1-7Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Kishi H. Mishima H.K. Yamashita U. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), could regulate the production of NO in bovine RPE cells. Our results indicate that, instead of enhancing LPS-induced NOS-2, IFN-α and IFN-β markedly inhibit NO production stimulated by the LPS/IFN-γ combination in bovine RPE cells. We have found that the inhibitory effect of IFNs on NOS-2 activity could be correlated with a decrease of NOS-2 protein and mRNA accumulation. This phenomenon is not due to a competition of IFN-α and IFN-β for IFN-γ receptors. In addition, there was no inhibition of the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Analysis of the effects of IFN-α on the induction of the two transcription factors, IRF-1 and IRF-2, revealed that IFN-α inhibits the LPS/IFN-γ-induced IRF-1 mRNA accumulation and increased IRF-2 mRNA accumulation in RPE cells.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we demonstrate that type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) can suppress the LPS/IFN-γ-dependent expression of NOS activity in bovine RPE cells as assessed by nitrite accumulation in the culture medium. Measurements of l-citrulline synthesis by cytoplasmic extracts further support the conclusion that levels of NOS activity are largely decreased. This loss of activity reflected the absence of NOS protein in the IFN-α- and IFN-β-treated RPE cells, as revealed by Western blot. Finally, the marked inhibition by IFN-α and IFN-β of the LPS/IFN-γ-induced increase in NOS mRNA suggests that IFN-α and IFN-β affect the regulation of the inducible form of NOS at the mRNA level. The detected levels correlated with the levels of NOS protein activity. Experiments with actinomycin D revealed that hIFN-α and hIFN-β do not decrease the half-life of NOS-2 mRNA in RPE cells stimulated with LPS/IFN-γ, demonstrating that the decreased expression of NOS-2 observed after hIFN-α or hIFN-β treatment is not attributable to decreased mRNA stability. Therefore, inhibition of the transcription rate of the NOS-2 gene seems to be the most likely mechanism involved. The negative regulation of NO synthase induction was previously reported (2Nathan C. Xie Q. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar) for different cytokines and growth factors, such as interleukin-4 and -10, fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor β (2Nathan C.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in which IFN-α and IFN-β were generally considered to be activators of NOS induction. Indeed, exogenous addition of IFN-α or IFN-β on murine peritoneal macrophages could induce nitrite release (16Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang X. Alley E.W. Russell S.W. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 33-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and blockade of endogenous IFN-α or IFN-β production could reduce LPS- or IFN-γ-induced NOS-2 mRNA accumulation in macrophages (33Fujihara M. Ito N. Pace J.L. Watanabe Y. Russell S.W. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12773-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Zhou A. Chen Z. Rummage J.A. Jiang H. Kolosov M. Kolosova I. Stewart C.A. Leu R.W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments not reported herein, we have tested the ability of IFN-α to regulate the nitrite release in peritoneal macrophages from thioglycollate-treated mice. We have found that IFN-α is unable to potentiate nitrite release due to LPS or IFN-γ and had no effect on LPS/IFN-γ-induced nitrite release, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of IFN-α on NOS-2 induction in RPE cells is specific from the species and/or from the cell type. However, this phenomenon is not exclusive to RPE cells since recent reports demonstrated the ability of IFN-α and IFN-β to largely reduce the IFN-γ-mediated nitrite release in rat peritoneal macrophages (35Deguchi F. Inaba K. Muramatsu S. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 45: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in human thyrocytes (36Kasai K. Hattori Y. Nakanishi N. Manaka K. Banba N. Motohashi S. Shimoda S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4261-4270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rat macrophages this decrease of nitrite production was due to a down-regulation of NOS-2 mRNA (37Deguchi F. Sakuta H. Uno K. Inaba K. Muramatsu S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as in bovine RPE cells.Concerning the molecular mechanism which operates for the suppressive action of NOS-2 by IFN-α and -β, we have postulated that they may interrupt some steps in the signaling pathway by which LPS/IFN-γ induces NOS-2 gene expression. First, on the basis of our binding experiments the inhibition of NOS induction by type I IFNs was not due to a competition between IFN-α or IFN-β with IFN-γ at the receptor level. We have also looked for the activation of two transcription factors, NF-κB and IRF-1, involved in NOS-2 induction (28Xie Q. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 29Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 30Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). We demonstrated, by EMSA, that IFN-α did not inhibit LPS/IFN-γ-induced NF-κB activation, indicating that the inhibitory effect of this compound on LPS/IFN-γ-induced NOS-2 appeared to be independent of NF-κB activation. The down-regulation of NF-κB activity by other compounds could be an inhibitory regulatory pathway for NOS induction in RPE cells, as it has been recently reported for the inhibition of NOS-2 induction by the glucocorticoids in human alveolar epithelium A549/8 cells (38Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. Ihrig-Biedert I. Förstermann U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar).NF-κB is not the only regulatory factor of NOS-2 gene expression, but could function in concert with several other transcription factors, such as IRF-1 (29Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 30Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). We demonstrated in this study that treatment of RPE cells with IFN-γ alone or with IFN-γ plus LPS resulted in an increase of IRF-1 mRNA and in an appearance of a prominent IRF-1-specific DNA-protein complex, which were clearly inhibited in the presence of IFN-α. Interestingly, a similar result has been reported by Politis et al. (39Politis A.D. Ozato K. Coligan J.E. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2270-2278PubMed Google Scholar) with another member of interferon-induced transcription factor, the interferon consensus sequence binding protein. They demonstrated that IFN-α could suppress the IFN-γ-induced interferon consensus sequence binding protein mRNA accumulation in peritoneal macrophages. Besides these interferon-induced transcription factors, there is another transcription factor, termed IRF-2, that is structurally similar to IRF-1, but that represses the effect of IRF-1 (31Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 40Vaughan P.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that IRF-2 mRNA is differentially regulated by the IFNs, since IFN-γ largely decreased its accumulation, while IFN-α significantly increased it. Furthermore, IFN-α is able to prevent the IFN-γ- and the LPS/IFN-γ-induced IRF-2 mRNA decrease. These results with IRFs demonstrated that inducers of NOS-2 (LPS/IFN-γ) increased IRF-1 and decreased IRF-2 mRNA, while the inhibitor of NOS-2 induction (IFN-α) decreased IRF-1 and increased IRF-2 mRNA. A very similar regulation of IRF-1 has been recently reported in murine macrophages by NOS inducers and inhibitors (41Le Page C. Sanceau J. Drapier J. Wietzerbin J. Immunology. 1996; 89: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Hecker M. Preiss C. Klemm P. Busse R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 2178-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It would be consistent to propose that IFN-α, by increasing IRF-2 mRNA and decreasing IRF-1 mRNA accumulation, could favor the neosynthesis of the repressor IRF-2, which is more stable than IRF-1 (43Watanabe N. Sakakibara J. Hovanesssian A.G. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4421-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As previously suggested, IRF-1 and IRF-2 could compete for the specific ISRE sequence (31Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 40Vaughan P.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Then, the accumulation of IRF-2 and diminution of IRF-1 could favor the interaction of IRF-2 with the NOS-2 gene promoter in place of IRF-1 and could suppress the activation of NOS-2 gene by IRF-1, after IFN-α treatment. It has been recently reported that closed tyrosine kinases and transcription factors in the JAK/STAT pathway could be involved in the transduction of the IFNs signals, leading to the transcription of early response genes (reviewed in Darnell et al. (44Darnell Jr, J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar)). There are at least two distinct sets of genes that can be stimulated in response to IFNs: those containing GAS elements, which bind STAT-1 homodimeres, and those containing ISRE sequences, which bind STAT1 homodimeres or STAT1/STAT2 heterodimeres coupled to p48 (ISGF3γ), respectively, named STAT1-p48 complex and ISGF3 (45Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). IFN-α activates both STAT1 and STAT2 by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, while IFN-γ phosphorylated tyrosines only on STAT1, leading to a difference in complex assembly that results in a functional difference in gene expression (45Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this context Li et al. (46Bhat G.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) recently reported that activation of IRF-1 transcription in response to IFN could be modulated by the level of p48. It is conceivable that IFN-α and -β might counteract the initial phase of the IFN-γ signaling cascade in bovine RPE cells, possibly by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation process and/or by a competition between the different STAT complexes (44Darnell Jr, J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar, 45Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Reux I. Hauw J.J. Fillet A.M. Courtois Y. Goureau O. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 166: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the sustained NO release by NOS-2 may cause retinal cell damage as we previously observed in the case of retinal light damage (48Goureau O. Jeanny J. Becquet F. Hartmann M. Courtois Y. Neuroreport. 1993; 5: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or during endotoxin-induced uveitis (27Goureau O. Bellot J. Thillaye B. Courtois Y. de Kozak Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6518-6523PubMed Google Scholar). Type I IFNs are produced by various cell types in the early phase of viral or bacterial infection. Thus, the production of IFN-α and -β during viral infection could decrease the potential antiviral NO activity (49Karupiah G. Xie Q.W. Buller R.M. Nathan C. Duarte C. Mac-Micking J.D. Science. 1993; 261: 1145-1148Crossref Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and might weaken the antiviral defense in the retina. This could represent a mechanism by which the virus protects itself against a large release of NO. This hypothesis is in agreement with recent results in macrophages (50Kreil T.R. Eibl M.M. Virology. 1995; 214: 174-178Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), in which the viral infection alters the induction of NOS-2, by increasing the synthesis of endogenous IFN-α and -β. However, we cannot exclude that actions of IFN-α and -β on RPE cells might also prevent NO-mediated tissue damage induced by LPS and IFN-γ in addition to an important role in the regulation of immune response in the retina.

The role of sustained NO production by the inducible NOS (NOS-2) is well described in murine macrophages, where NO is responsible for their cytostatic and cytolytic activities toward invading organisms (2Nathan C.

On the other hand, NO generated by NOS-2 is also involved in some pathophysiological states, generally related to local and systemic inflammation (2Nathan C. Xie Q.

https://openalex.org/W2005064691,"Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) plays an important role in signal transduction through mammalian T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors and Fc receptors. The ITAM has been found only in vertebrate immunocytes. Ascidians are intriguing invertebrates from the viewpoint of the evolution of immune systems because they are considered to be ancestors of the vertebrates. We have previously shown that the monoclonal antibody A74 inhibits cellular defense reactions of the ascidian. In the present studies, we found that the A74 antigen protein has two ITAMs and several motifs that are proposed to function in signal transduction. The A74 protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with other proteins in the initial stages of cellular defense reactions. The ITAMs of the A74 protein are tyrosine-phosphorylated by a c-Src kinase in vitro. The A74 protein provides a key to the understanding of the origin of vertebrate immune systems."

Three-dimensional crystal structures of staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 and C3 bound to the extracellular portion of the β-chain (Vβ8.2Jβ2.1Cβ1) of the mouse 14.3.d TCR were also recently reported (10Fields B.A. Malchiodi E.L.

Three-dimensional high resolution structures can also be derived from NMR-based approaches (11Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 12Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The NMR structures have the potential advantage of being obtained in solution and can provide insights into conformational flexibility and structural dynamics (13Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 14Lane A.N. Lefèvre J.F Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 596-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the NMR approach is mostly limited to proteins with molecular masses less than ∼30 kDa that can be uniformly enriched with 13C and 15N isotopes and remain soluble at high submillimolar concentrations (12Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar), deuteration in concert with13C,15N multidimensional NMR techniques can push this limit to higher molecular masses (15Sattler M. Fesik S.W. Structure. 1996; 4: 1245-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because of their limited size (∼30 kDa), single chain (sc) TCR molecules in which the Vα- and Vβ-chains are connected by a flexible polypeptide linker (reviewed in Ref. 16Fremont D.H. Rees W.A. Kozono H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) might be amenable to NMR structure determination, and various scTCR constructions have been produced previously using Escherichia coli expression systems (reviewed in Ref. 16Fremont D.H. Rees W.A. Kozono H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite this, the conformational integrity and ligand binding characteristics of these proteins have not been well established (Ref.17Hilyard K.L. Reyburn H. Chung S. Bell J.I. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, and for review see Ref. 16Fremont D.H. Rees W.A. Kozono H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We recently reported ligand binding properties of a soluble, heterodimeric murine αβ TCR derived from the D10 T-cell clone (Vα2, Vβ8.2) of the AKR (H-2k) mouse and expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells (18Khandekar S.S. Brauer P.P. Naylor J.W. Chang H.-C. Kern P. Newcomb J.R. LeClair K.P. Stump H.S. Bettencourt B.M. Kawasaki E Banerji J. Profy A. Jones B. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor (19Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindqvist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 20Malmqvist M. Curr. Biol. 1993; 5: 282-286Google Scholar), we showed that this protein binds both Vβ8.2-specific bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) and a soluble, heterodimeric MHC class II I-Ak-conalbumin peptide (residues 134–146) complex with a low micromolar affinity (18Khandekar S.S. Brauer P.P. Naylor J.W. Chang H.-C. Kern P. Newcomb J.R. LeClair K.P. Stump H.S. Bettencourt B.M. Kawasaki E Banerji J. Profy A. Jones B. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To define further the structural requirements for D10 TCR binding, and to obtain material suitable for NMR structural studies, we produced a soluble D10 scTCR molecule using an E. coli expression system. Purified and refolded protein bound to SEC2 and I-Ak-conalbumin peptide complex with thermodynamic and kinetic binding constants similar to those measured previously for the insect cell-derived, heterodimeric D10 TCR (18Khandekar S.S.

Immunol. 1997; 34: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that neither the TCR constant domains nor potential N- or O-linked carbohydrate moieties are necessary for ligand binding. In addition, based on circular dichroism and one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, purified D10 scTCR appears to be suitable for structural studies by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. NMR studies on the D10 scTCR may be helpful in assessing the flexibility of its various CDR regions and may provide further insight into whether the scTCR undergoes conformational changes as a result of its interactions with superantigens and class II MHC-peptide complex.

Bettencourt B.M. Kawasaki E Banerji J. Profy A. Jones B. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-derived soluble, heterodimeric human MHC class II HLA-DR1 loaded with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide (residues 306–318) was prepared as described (27Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 68: 465-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Purified superantigens staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2), and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were purchased from Toxin Technology, Inc. (Sarasota, FL). The purity of these proteins was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE prior to use. Plasmids pFRSV-SRaD10α GPI TCR and pFRSV-SRbD10β GPI TCR, encoding D10 α- and β-chain variable domain genes, respectively, were gifts from Dr. Al Bothwell. These two cDNA plasmids were used as templates from which sequences encoding D10 TCR α- and β-chain variable domains were generated, using PCR. Using appropriate oligonucleotide primers, the α-chain gene was engineered to encode NarI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, as well as two stop codons at the 3′-end. The β-chain gene was engineered to encode NcoI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The amplified genes were then ligated into plasmid p3xG“b3” using the 5′- and 3′-restriction sites, to generate plasmid p6/530. A flexible linker (the 3xG-linker, amino acid sequence GSGGGGSGGGGSGGSGA) was engineered into the plasmid between the α- and β-chain genes, resulting in a gene encoding D10 scTCR in the order β-linker-α (Fig. 1). The 5′-end of the scTCR gene was then modified, using PCR and standard molecular biology techniques, to encode an EcoRI restriction site, followed by a thrombin cleavage site encoding amino acids LVPRG (28Engel I. Ottenhoff M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 256: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This modified D10 scTCR gene was inserted between the EcoRI and SalI sites within the polylinker of the MBP fusion protein expression vector pPR998 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The resulting plasmid encoded a MBP-D10 scTCR fusion protein. The tether sequence, between the 3′-end of the malE gene (encoding MBP) and the 5′-end of the D10 TCR gene, was then deleted for the factor Xa cleavage site present in plasmid pPR998, leaving the thrombin cleavage site previously engineered at the 5′-end of the D10 TCR gene. The resulting plasmid encoded a MBP-D10 scTCR fusion protein with a 10-amino acid tether (NSSSLVPRGS). Using oligonucleotide primers to generate DNA of the correct sequence by the PCR, the linker between TCR α- and β-chain genes was then modified by the addition of the FLAGG sequence (IBI, New Haven, CT), encoding amino acids DYKDDDDK. The resulting 27-amino acid linker sequence was GSDYKDDDDKRSGGGGSGGGGSGGSGA. Also, to minimize potential covalent aggregation, the codon for an unpaired cysteine residue in the Jα-region was changed to encode a serine residue. Finally, to aid in protein purification, a sequence encoding six histidine residues was added to the 3′-end of the MBP-D10 scTCR gene. This resulted in the final MBP-D10 scTCR fusion protein expression vector, p4/219. A schematic of the resulting MBP-D10 scTCR fusion protein construct is shown in Fig. 1 A, and the amino acid sequence of D10 scTCR is shown in Fig. 1 B. It was subsequently discovered that the fifth codon of the β-chain gene of the D10 scTCR construct was mutated to encode a threonine rather than a serine residue (Fig.1 B). The mutation presumably occurred as a result of an error by Taq polymerase during a PCR procedure. The mutation appears to be benign, as the purified and refolded D10 scTCR protein was found to be in a native-like conformation (see below). BL21 cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) transformed with vector p4/219 were grown in a 5-liter bioreactor (B. Braun Biotech, Allentown, PA) at 27 °C in 4 × YT medium (3.2% bactotryptone, 2% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing 2.0% glycerol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A 600 = 15 (late log phase). Cells were harvested 3 h after induction, with a yield of 60 g wet cell paste per liter of culture. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride-HCl at 10 ml/g cells wet weight. Resuspended cells were lysed by passage through a microfluidizer (model M110T, Microfluidics Corporation, Newton, MA) at 15,000 p.s.i. Lysis supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μ Pellicon filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and used for subsequent purification. All purification steps, with the exception of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal affinity chromatography, were performed at 4 °C. Lysis supernatant was applied to a cross-linked amylose column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The column was then washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2m NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Purified fusion protein was next denatured with 6 m GdnHCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 m NaCl and 10% glycerol (buffer A), and applied to a Ni-NTA metal affinity column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) at a flow-rate of 3.7 ml/min. After washing the column with 2 column volumes of buffer A, a refolding gradient was initiated and maintained at a flow rate of 3.7 ml/min using fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). A 240-min linear gradient was formed from 100% buffer A to 100% buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m GdnHCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.5m NaCl. After washing the column with 1 column volume of buffer B, the bound material was eluted with buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted MBP-D10 scTCR fusion protein was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on an immobilized 3D3 column, which specifically recognizes a D10 TCR conformational epitope (18Khandekar S.S.

Finally, monomeric MBP-D10 scTCR was isolated by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200PG 26/60 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). To obtain D10 scTCR, purified fusion protein was first digested with thrombin (Calbiochem) at 40:1 (w/w) for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 mmCaCl2 and 0.02% sodium azide. The digested sample was next applied to the Ni-NTA column, and D10 scTCR containing the hexahistidine tag was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 250 mm imidazole. Purified D10 scTCR was dialyzed into 20 mm MES (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.02% sodium azide and stored at 4 °C. For NMR experiments (see below), purified protein was concentrated to 3 mg/ml using Centriprep-10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 1.7 and 1.2m−1 cm−1 for MBP-D10 scTCR and D10 scTCR, respectively. Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems (Perkin-Elmer) model 421 amino acid analysis system. To test the solubility characteristic of D10 scTCR, a small amount of purified protein was concentrated using Centricon 10 concentrator. D10 scTCR remained soluble at concentrations up to 1 mm. SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-682Crossref Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) and isoelectric focusing (31Khandekar S.S. Bettencourt B.M. Kelley K.C. Recny M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) analyses were performed essentially as described. N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses were performed on the proteins blotted on ProBlott membranes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described (32Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of purified D10 scTCR under nondenaturing conditions was determined by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75HR (Pharmacia) or TSK G2000 (Tosohaas, Philadelphia, PA) columns equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 200 mm sodium sulfate and 10% glycerol. The columns were calibrated with the following molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad): thyroglobulin (66 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1 kDa). A 50-μg (2.5 mg/ml) sample of purified D10 scTCR was injected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Molecular weight of D10 scTCR was also determined by electrospray-mass spectrometry using a VG Biotech Bio-Q instrument with a quadruple mass analyzer (M-Scan Inc., West Chester, PA). CD analysis was performed on purified D10 scTCR (0.15 mg/ml in 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a CD instrument model 62 DS (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) using a 2-mm path length cell. Data were collected using a time constant of 1 s at every 0.2 nm and with a 1 nm constant spectral bandwidth at 25 °C. The CD data were analyzed for secondary structure prediction by an algorithm Prosec V3.1 provided by the manufacturer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). One-dimensional NMR experiments were carried on purified D10 scTCR (∼80 μm in 95% (v/v) H2O/D2O and 20 mm deuterated acetate (pH 4.5)) at 25 and 37 °C on a Varian UNITYplus750 MHz spectrometer with a 1H resonance frequency of 750.079 MHz. The spectral width was 23,995 Hz, and the carrier was placed on the H2O resonance which was suppressed by low power presaturation during the recycle delay (1.3 s). 8,192 complex points were obtained, and 1,024 transients were collected for signal averaging. Data processing was carried out using Felix software (Biosym Technologies, San Diego). The residual water signal was removed by the time domain convolution technique. Data were multiplied with a π/2 shifted squared sine bell apodization function and zero-filled to 16,384 points prior to Fourier transformation.1H chemical shifts were referenced relative to the water resonance, calibrated in turn at 4.755 and 4.631 ppm at 25 and 37 °C, respectively, on an external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid standard. Binding studies were performed using a commercial biosensor instrument (BIAcoreTM, Pharmacia BioSensor, Uppsala, Sweden). All proteins used in these experiments were purified by size exclusion chromatography. Immobilizations were carried out in 10 mmsodium acetate at pH 5.5 for D10 scTCR or at pH 4.0 for superantigens using the Amine Coupling Kit (Pharmacia BioSensor, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (18Khandekar S.S.

HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) was injected over the sensor chip at 5 μl/min, and 20-μl analyte samples diluted (∼25-fold) in HBS buffer were injected. Where required, the biosensor surface was regenerated with 5–10 mm HCl. All binding experiments were conducted at 25 °C. The SPR signal was recorded as resonance units (RU) versus time and plotted as a “sensorgram.” For kinetic rate analyses, binding studies were performed on ligands immobilized at multiple densities. The data, generated at least in triplicate, were analyzed using the non-linear curve-fitting software package (BIAevaluation 2.1, Pharmacia Biosensor) that also allows the parameters to be extracted from a single run (18Khandekar S.S.

To determine the apparent association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants, the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams were fitted on single site models, A + B = AB and AB = A + B, respectively. The apparent dissociation constant (K D) was determined from the ratio of k off /k on. The construct used to produce recombinant D10 scTCR is shown schematically in Fig.1 A. The TCR Vβ and Vα domains were connected by a 27-residue flexible peptide linker (Fig.1 B), and the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) was fused to the N terminus of the Vβ domain via a linker containing a thrombin cleavage site. In addition, six histidine residues were added to the C terminus to allow binding to a Ni-NTA affinity chromatography column. The expressed protein was purified under nonreducing conditions to preserve the disulfide bonds formed in vivo. A similar approach was utilized to refold an E. coli-expressed single chain antibody (37Pantoliano M.W. Bird R.E. Johnson S. Asel E.D. Dodd S.W. Wood J.F. Hardman K.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10117-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Monomeric MBP-D10 scTCR fusion protein was purified from E. coli lysis supernatants using a combination of amylose, Ni-NTA, and mAb 3D3 affinity chromatography steps. Purified fusion protein was then subjected to Superdex 200PG size exclusion chromatography to remove the small amounts of aggregates. Purity of the 70-kDa fusion protein was monitored after each step by SDS-PAGE performed under reducing (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4) and nonreducing (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8) conditions. The N-terminal sequence determined for the purified product (KIEEGKLVI) was as expected for the correctly processed maltose-binding protein (38Guan C.D. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Thrombin digestion of size exclusion chromatography, purified monomeric fusion protein resulted in efficient cleavage (Fig. 2 B). Cleavage of the aggregated fusion protein isolated following size exclusion chromatography, by contrast, was inefficient and resulted in significant precipitation (not shown). Thrombin-cleaved D10 scTCR was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography carried out under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 2 B). The overall yield of purified D10 scTCR was 0.7–1.0 mg/liter of E. coli"

Recently, strong binding between these two proteins has been reported (Graceffa, P., Adam, L. P., and Morgan, K. G. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 30336–30339). Results in this paper fail to confirm their data and are consistent with the concept of independent functions for calponin and caldesmon.To examine the ability of duck gizzard caldesmon to interact with calponin, three caldesmon derivatives, each containing a different sulfhydryl-specific reporter probe (6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphtalene,N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide, and N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphtylo)ethylenediamine) attached to a single cysteine located in the C-terminal domain, were synthesized. Addition of calponin to labeled caldesmon at both low and physiological salt concentrations did not induce any changes in fluorescence intensity or maximum shift. Under the same conditions, calmodulin and tropomyosin (known to bind to the C terminus of caldesmon) produced substantial changes in these spectral parameters. Gel filtration of an equimolar caldesmon-calponin mixture on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose-12 column revealed two base-line-separated peaks, the first containing only caldesmon and the second only calponin, thus confirming the lack of any interaction between these two proteins. Also, the addition of calponin did not change the fluorescence parameters of labeled caldesmon in complexes with F-actin and F-actin-tropomyosin.

The primary mechanism for smooth muscle regulation, necessary to initiate contraction, involves phosphorylation of the 20-kDa myosin light chains by a specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (for reviews see Refs. 1Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 2Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. Trends Biochem.

Rev. 1996; 76: 967-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). It is postulated that the specific thin filament-associated proteins caldesmon and calponin take part in the secondary mechanism of regulation, probably during the relaxation phase. This view is supported by in vitro experiments showing that both of these proteins inhibit actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin, mobility of actin filaments over immobilized myosin in motility assay, and skinned muscle contraction. This inhibition can be reversed by Ca2+/calmodulin, or other Ca2+-binding proteins (like S100 or caltropin), and by phosphorylation with protein kinase C or casein kinase II (Refs. 3Horowitz A.

Studies by Makuch et al. (7Makuch R. Birukov K. Shirinsky V. Da˛browska R. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) revealed that calponin and caldesmon compete for the binding sites on actin filament, calponin being more effective at displacing caldesmon than vice versa. Similar results were obtained in the Chalovich laboratory (8Lu F.W.M. Freedman M.V. Chalovich J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11864-11871Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This suggested that calponin and caldesmon do not form a mutual complex on actin and reside on different populations of thin filaments in vivo. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy confirmed this suggestion showing that, whereas caldesmon is present exclusively in the contractile domain, calponin is primarily, although not exclusively, located in the cytoskeletal domain of chicken gizzard muscle (9North A.J. Gimona M. Cross R.A. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 437-444PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mabuchi K. Li Y. Tao T. Wang C-L.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This result implied that calponin and caldesmon are segregated in different thin filaments, as postulated earlier (11Lehman W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) on the basis of immunoprecipitation by anti-caldesmon and anti-filamin antibodies of the two different subsets of thin filaments. In view of these works, the results showing a strong, specific interaction of calponin and caldesmon (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were unexpected. Moreover, a very weak association of these two proteins was earlier reported and was considered to be too weak to affect the function of each of the two proteins (13Vancompernolle K. Gimona M. Herzog M. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These controversial results (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) sparked our interest in resolving the problem. Caldesmon was prepared from duck gizzards according to the method of Bretscher (14Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications (15Czuryło E.A. Emelyanenko V.I. Permyakov E.A. Da˛browska R. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 40: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Calponin was purified from chicken gizzard by the procedure of Takahashi (16Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Chicken gizzard tropomyosin was obtained as described earlier by Da˛browska et al. (17Da˛browska R. Nowak E. Drabikowski W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 65B: 75-83Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was isolated from acetone-dried muscle powder and purified as described by Spudich and Watt (18Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin was isolated from bovine brain by the method of Gopalakrishna and Anderson (19Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Labeling of caldesmon cysteine with acrylodan 1The abbreviations used are: acrylodan, 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene; pyrenyl,N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide; AEDANS,N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphtylo)ethylenediamine; DTT, dithiotreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. (Molecular Probes) was carried out as described by Graceffa et al. (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) at a probe to caldesmon molar ratio of 5. The degree of labeling determined using the acrylodan molar extinction coefficient of 1.29 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 360 nm (20Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was 0.70–0.90 mol of acrylodan/mol of caldesmon. Labeling of caldesmon with pyrenyl (Molecular Probes) was carried out according to Kouyama and Mihashi (21Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) at a probe to caldesmon molar ratio of 4.5. The degree of labeling determined using the pyrenyl molar extinction coefficient of 2.2 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 344 nm was 0.57–0.63 mol of pyrenyl/mol of caldesmon. Labeling of caldesmon with AEDANS (Sigma) was performed as described in Tawada et al. (22Tawada K. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) at a probe to caldesmon molar ratio of 7.5. The degree of labeling determined using the AEDANS molar extinction coefficient of 0.61 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 337 nm (23Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) was 0.50–0.65 mol of AEDANS/mol of caldesmon. Each labeling procedure was repeated twice for different caldesmon preparations. Labeling reactions were stopped by the addition of an excess of DTT and followed by an exhaustive prolonged dialysis with fluorescence control of the dialysate (80%) mixture with ethanol (20%) for the presence of the DTT derivative of each dye. The actomyosin ATPase activity assay (7Makuch R. Birukov K. Shirinsky V. Da˛browska R. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was used to control whether the described treatment of labeled caldesmon samples did not meaningfully change their inhibitory properties. The caldesmon-induced inhibition of actin-tropomyosin activated Mg2+-ATPase of myosin was 80% (± 3%), and the labeling procedure did not decrease it by more than 5%. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog-2 photon-counting fluorimeter at a temperature of 20 °C and caldesmon concentration of 1 mmin 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2(buffer T) and either 50 or 150 mm NaCl. The spectra were corrected for solvent and, if needed, for dilution. FPLC experiments were performed on a Superose-12 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). A caldesmon/calponin 1:1 (mol/mol) mixture was applied on the column in buffer T containing either 50 or 150 mm NaCl and eluted isocratically with the loading buffer. Peak fractions were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The resulting pellets were dissolved in 50 ml of 6 m urea and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The quality of the protein samples at all steps of the various procedures was monitored electrophoretically. SDS-PAGE was carried out on polyacrylamide minislab gels using the discontinuous Tris-glycine buffer system of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by measuring UV absorbance using the following absorption coefficients and molecular mass values: caldesmon,A 2781% = 4.0 (25Czuryło E.A. Venyaminov S.Yu. Da˛browska R. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), 87 kDa; calponin, A 2751% = 11.3 (26Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 32.3 kDa; calmodulin,A 2771% = 2.0 (27Wolff D.J. Poirier P.G. Bröstrom C.O. Bröstrom M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4108-4117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 16.75 kDa; tropomyosin, A 2781% = 1.9 (28Lehrer S.S. Batteridge D.R. Graceffa P. Wong S. Seidel J.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), 68 kDa; and G-actin,A 2901% = 6.3, 42 kDa (29Houk W.T. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Duck gizzard caldesmon is a single thiol protein; its Cys residue is located in the C-terminal part of the molecule at a position corresponding to 580 in the amino acid sequence of chicken gizzard caldesmon (30Vorotnikov A.V. Gusev N.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since the C-terminal sequences of avian isoforms of caldesmon are similar (31Collins J.H. Leszyk J. Mornet D. Audemard E. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1991; 4: 29-32PubMed Google Scholar), and the site of the interaction between caldesmon and calponin was ascribed to just its C-terminal domain (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), duck gizzard caldesmon appeared to be convenient for fluorescent studies after modification with sulfhydyl-specific reporter probes. As shown in Fig. 1, the fluorescence spectrum of acrylodan-duck gizzard caldesmon adduct has a very broad peak with a maximum at 517 nm. This means that the acrylodan label is located in a polar environment (20Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence maximum does not alter upon a change of excitation wavelength from 360 to 390 nm. Our spectra were blue shifted by 5 nm as compared with those reported for acrylodan-labeled porcine stomach caldesmon (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). According to our observations, the DTT derivative of acrylodan could only be removed after an extensive and prolonged dialysis possibly because it fits into the molten globules located at both ends of the caldesmon molecule (32Czuryło E.A. Hellweg T. Eimer W. Da˛browska R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 835-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An insufficient volume of dialysis buffer may be an explanation why Graceffa et al. (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) obtained a labeling ratio of up to 1.1 for porcine stomach caldesmon which is unexpected for a single thiol protein, as discussed in (20Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of calponin to acrylodan-labeled caldesmon (at a 1:1 molar ratio) did not affect its fluorescence spectrum at 50 and 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 1). Under the same conditions, calmodulin, a protein with a similar hydrophobicity as calponin, induced marked changes in fluorescence spectra parameters (intensity and maximum blue shift) of acrylodan-labeled caldesmon. It is also noteworthy that the calponin to caldesmon binding constant of 9.5 × 107m−1 reported by Graceffa et al.(12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is of the same range as we observed earlier for the calmodulin-caldesmon complex (15Czuryło E.A. Emelyanenko V.I. Permyakov E.A. Da˛browska R. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 40: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Significant changes in acrylodan-labeled caldesmon were also evoked by tropomyosin (data not shown) though its binding constant to caldesmon is 2 orders of magnitude lower (15Czuryło E.A. Emelyanenko V.I. Permyakov E.A. Da˛browska R. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 40: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) than that reported for the calponin-caldesmon complex (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The shape of the fluorescence spectra of AEDANS-labeled caldesmon is very similar to that presented in Fig. 1. In this case, we also did not observe any effect of calponin on the caldesmon spectra (data not shown). The shape of the fluorescence spectrum of pyrenyl-labeled duck gizzard caldesmon (Fig. 2) differs from the fluorescence spectrum of pyrenyl-protein adducts often presented in the literature (e.g. chicken gizzard isoform of caldesmon labeled at both thiol groups (33Crosbie R.H. Chalovich J.M. Reisler E. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) or pyrenyl-labeled F-actin (21Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar)). The extremely polar (charged) surface of the C-terminal domain of the caldesmon molecule results in spectra looking like that for pyrenyl-G-actin (21Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Pyrenyl-labeled caldesmon spectra also do not demonstrate relevant changes in the presence of calponin, while upon addition of calmodulin or tropomyosin (not shown), the fluorescence intensity in both low and physiological salt undergoes substantial changes. Partially dialysed sample of pyrenyl-labeled caldesmon resulted in fluorescence changes similar to those observed by Graceffa et al. (12Graceffa P. Adam L.P. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30336-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) upon addition of calponin. The fluorescence studies indicate that calponin does not induce any conformational changes in the spatial vicinity of the probe attachment to the caldesmon molecule and points to a lack of an interaction between calponin and this part of caldesmon. To prove our findings, we have performed additional experiments with molecular sieves. An equimolar mixture of duck gizzard caldesmon and calponin in various salt solutions was loaded onto an FPLC Superose-12 column and eluted with the loading buffer. The results are presented in Fig.3. In both low and physiological salt concentrations, we have obtained two separated protein peaks, the first containing caldesmon and the second calponin. We did not observe the formation of a caldesmon complex with calponin. This confirms our fluorescence data and extends the conclusion about the lack of an interaction with the entire caldesmon molecule. In earlier work on calponin, Vancompernolle et al. (13Vancompernolle K. Gimona M. Herzog M. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that caldesmon bound to a calponin affinity column at 5 mm KCl was eluted at 70 mm KCl. However, calponin is known as a protein extremely sensitive to ionic strength and even able to aggregate at low ionic strength. In our FPLC experiments performed at 20 mm NaCl, calponin was retarded on the column and eluted only after an extensive wash with buffer containing 200 mm NaCl (data not shown). Therefore, one may infer that in the experiment described by Vancompernolle et al. (13Vancompernolle K. Gimona M. Herzog M. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), caldesmon was possibly bound to a partially unfolded immobilized calponin and was released when the ionic strength became high enough to restore the native conformation of the immobilized protein. The fluorescence spectra of acrylodan-labeled caldesmon complexed with F-actin show a 27-nm blue shift and an almost 150% increase in the quantum yield in 50 mm NaCl as well as a 17-nm blue shift and almost double the quantum yield in 150 mm NaCl when compared with the spectra of acrylodan-labeled caldesmon alone under the same conditions (Table I). These dramatic changes did not depend practically on the molar ratio of the proteins in the range studied. They might be caused by the acrylodan label transfer from a strongly polar (the surface of caldesmon molten globules) to a strongly hydrophobic (F-actin interior) environment. Binding of tropomyosin to this complex results in a further small (1–3 nm) blue shift and a very small increase in the quantum yield (see Table I). These small changes of the fluorescence parameters may be due to the structural changes in F-actin induced by the binding of tropomyosin and/or direct interaction of tropomyosin with caldesmon when bound to F-actin. Calponin binding to F-actin-caldesmon or F-actin-caldesmon-tropomyosin complexes causes a small (1–2 nm) red shift and a negligible decrease in the quantum yield. The largest decrease (10%) in the quantum yield was observed in the case of calponin binding to the F-actin-caldesmon complex (7:1 molar ratio) in 50 mm NaCl (see Table I). Conceivably this decrease might reflect the structural changes induced in F-actin by calponin binding; higher ionic strength or binding of tropomyosin reduces it by half. The structural changes in F-actin induced by calponin binding are rather local because they are ineffective when the quantity of F-actin in solution is doubled.Table IThe fluorescence parameters of acrylodan-labeled duck gizzard caldesmon in complex with F-actin, tropomyosin, and calponinSample composition50 mm NaCl150 mm NaClλ maxQ relλ maxQ relCaD5170.415170.56CaD + Ac (1:7)4901.005001.00CaD + Ac + TM (1:7:1)4891.014931.06CaD + Ac + TM + CaP (1:7:1:1)4900.954981.01CaD + Ac + TM + CaP (1:7:1:2)4900.934990.93CaD + Ac + CaP (1:7:1)4930.905030.94CaD + Ac + CaP + TM (1:7:1:1)4901.025010.97CaD + Ac + CaP + TM (1:7:1:2)4881.024991.06CaD + Ac (1:14)4891.004991.00CaD + Ac + TM (1:14:1:)4881.014981.01CaD + Ac + TM + CaP (1:14:1:1)4891.004990.95CaD + Ac + TM + CaP (1:14:1:2)4891.004990.93CaD + Ac + CaP (1:14:1)4901.005000.95CaD + Ac + CaP + TM (1:14:1:1)4891.014980.93CaD + Ac + CaP + TM (1:14:1:2)4881.024970.96 Open table in a new tab Taken together, the results presented above empower us to give a negative answer to the question “Does calponin interact with caldesmon?” In agreement with our findings, Drs. Graceffa, Adam, and Morgan have communicated to us that they have further verified a lack of strong interaction between caldesmon and calponin by analytical ultracentrifugation in collaboration with Dr. Walter Stafford."
