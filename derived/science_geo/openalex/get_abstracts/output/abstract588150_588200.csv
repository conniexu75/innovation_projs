https://openalex.org/W2620760558,"Data imbalance is frequently encountered in biomedical applications. Resampling techniques can be used in binary classification to tackle this issue. However such solutions are not desired when the number of samples in the small class is limited. Moreover the use of inadequate performance metrics, such as accuracy, lead to poor generalization results because the classifiers tend to predict the largest size class. One of the good approaches to deal with this issue is to optimize performance metrics that are designed to handle data imbalance. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is widely used in Bioinformatics as a performance metric. We are interested in developing a new classifier based on the MCC metric to handle imbalanced data. We derive an optimal Bayes classifier for the MCC metric using an approach based on Frechet derivative. We show that the proposed algorithm has the nice theoretical property of consistency. Using simulated data, we verify the correctness of our optimality result by searching in the space of all possible binary classifiers. The proposed classifier is evaluated on 64 datasets from a wide range data imbalance. We compare both classification performance and CPU efficiency for three classifiers: 1) the proposed algorithm (MCC-classifier), the Bayes classifier with a default threshold (MCC-base) and imbalanced SVM (SVM-imba). The experimental evaluation shows that MCC-classifier has a close performance to SVM-imba while being simpler and more efficient."

Recent studies have leveraged nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to detect NMR signals from samples of just a few cubic nanometers, but with low resolution. Aslam et al. optimized this technique to achieve a resolution of 1 part per million—sufficient to distinguish among alkyl, vinyl, and aryl protons in solution (see the Perspective by Bar-Gill and Retzker). They also demonstrated solid-state implementation and fluorine detection. Science , this issue p. 67 ; see also p. 38"

How the virus damages brain development in the fetus is enigmatic. Chavali et al. found that in congenital microcephaly, mutations in a neural precursor protein, Musashi-1 (MSI1), impede RNA binding to neural stem cell targets, resulting in abnormal brain development (see the Perspective by Griffin). MSI1 also binds ZIKV RNA to amplify viral replication in cells. This interaction could put a pregnant woman at risk of giving birth to a microcephalic child. Furthermore, MSI1 is expressed at high levels in the mouse testis, which may explain the sexual transmission of this virus. Science , this issue p. 83 ; see also p. 33"

This is the first quantitative ethnobotanical study from the area comprising popularity level of medicinal plant species intendedby using relative popularity level (RPL) and rank order priority (ROP) indices.Ethnobotanical data were collected by interviewing 166 local informants and 35 traditional health practioners (THPs) from different localities of Hafizabad district. Demographic features of informants; life form, part used, methods of preparation, modes of application and ethnomedicinal uses were documented. Ethnobotanical data were analyzed using quantitative tools, i.e. Relative frequency citation (RFC), use value (UV), informant consensus factor (ICF) fidelity level (FL), RPL and ROP indices. A total of 85 species belonging to 71 genera and 34 families were documented along with ethnomedicinal uses. Solanum surattense, Withania somnifera, Cyperus rotundus, Solanum nigrum and Melia azedarach were the most utilized medicinal plant species with highest used value. The reported ailments were classified into 11 disease categories based on ICF values and highest number of plant species was reported to treat dermatological and gastrointestinal disorders. Withania somnifera and Ranunculus sceleratus with maximum FL (100%), were used against gastrointestinal and urinary disorders, respectively. The RPL and ROP values were calculated to recognize the folk medicinal plant wealth; six out of 32 plant species (19%) were found popular, based on citation by more than half of the maximum number of informant viz. 26. Consequently, the ROP value for these species was more than 75. The comparative assessment with reported literature revealed 15% resemblance and 6% variation to previous data;however79% uses of the reported species were recorded for the first time. The diversity of medicinal plant species and associated traditional knowledge is significant in primary health care system. Medicinal plant species with high RPL values should be screened for comprehensive phytochemical and pharmacological studies. This could be useful in novel drug discovery and to validate the ethomendicinal knowledge."

https://openalex.org/W2609411945,"As it is getting increasingly difficult to achieve gains in the density and power efficiency of microelectronic computing devices because of lithographic techniques reaching fundamental physical limits, new approaches are required to maximize the benefits of distributed sensors, micro-robots or smart materials. Biologically-inspired devices, such as artificial neural networks, can process information with a high level of parallelism to efficiently solve difficult problems, even when implemented using conventional microelectronic technologies. We describe a mechanical device, which operates in a manner similar to artificial neural networks, to solve efficiently two difficult benchmark problems (computing the parity of a bit stream, and classifying spoken words). The device consists in a network of masses coupled by linear springs and attached to a substrate by non-linear springs, thus forming a network of anharmonic oscillators. As the masses can directly couple to forces applied on the device, this approach combines sensing and computing functions in a single power-efficient device with compact dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W2620763986,"The objective of this study was to assess the impact of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) across prevalent chronic conditions, individually and comorbid, in school-aged children in the Netherlands. 5301 children aged 4-11 years from the Dutch Health Interview Survey were included. Parents completed questionnaires regarding child and parental characteristics. HRQOL of children was measured using the Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 28 (CHQ-PF28). Independent-t tests were used to assess differences in the mean scores of the CHQ-PF28 summary scales and profile scales between children with a prevalent chronic condition (excluding or including children with multiple chronic conditions) and children without a chronic condition. Cohen's effect sizes (d) were calculated to assess the clinical significance of difference. The mean age of children was 7.55 (SD 2.30) years; 50.0% were boys. In children without any chronic condition, the mean score of physical summary scale (PhS) was 58.53 (SD 4.28) and mean score of the psychosocial summary scale (PsS) was 53.86 (SD 5.87). Generally, PhS and/or PsS scores in children with only one condition were lower (p<0.05) than for children without chronic conditions. When children with multiple conditions were included, mean scores of CHQ-PF28 summary and profile scales were generally lower than when they were excluded. The present study shows important information regarding the impact of prevalent chronic conditions on HRQOL in a representative population-based sample of school-aged children in the Netherlands. The information could be used for developing a more holistic approach to patient care and a surveillance framework for health promotion."

An imbalance of these microorganisms is associated with disease, however, the causal relationship between skin microbiota and disease remains unknown. To describe the cutaneous bacterial microbiota of cats and determine whether bacterial dysbiosis occurs on the skin of allergic cats, the skin surfaces on various regions of 11 healthy cats and 10 allergic cats were sampled.Genomic DNA was extracted from skin swabs and sequenced using primers that target the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA. The bacterial sequences from healthy cats revealed that there are differences in species diversity and richness between body sites and different epithelial surfaces. Bacterial communities preferred body site niches in the healthy cats, however, the bacterial communities on allergic cat skin tended to be more unique to the individual cat. Overall, the number of bacterial species was not significantly different between the two health status groups, however, the abundances of these bacterial species were different between healthy and allergic skin. Staphylococcus, in addition to other taxa, was more abundant on allergic skin.This study reveals that there are more bacterial species inhabiting the skin of cats than previously thought and provide some evidence of an association between dysbiosis and skin disease."
https://openalex.org/W2620611956,"Polymicrobial sepsis in mice causes myocardial dysfunction after generation of the complement anaphylatoxin, complement component 5a (C5a). C5a interacts with its receptors on cardiomyocytes (CMs), resulting in redox imbalance and cardiac dysfunction that can be functionally measured and quantitated using Doppler echocardiography. In this report we have evaluated activation of MAPKs and Akt in CMs exposed to C5a in vitro and after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in vivo In both cases, C5a in vitro caused activation (phosphorylation) of MAPKs and Akt in CMs, which required availability of both C5a receptors. Using immunofluorescence technology, activation of MAPKs and Akt occurred in left ventricular (LV) CMs, requiring both C5a receptors, C5aR1 and -2. Use of a water-soluble p38 inhibitor curtailed activation in vivo of MAPKs and Akt in LV CMs as well as the appearance of cytokines and histones in plasma from CLP mice. When mouse macrophages were exposed in vitro to LPS, activation of MAPKs and Akt also occurred. The copresence of the p38 inhibitor blocked these activation responses. Finally, the presence of the p38 inhibitor in CLP mice reduced the development of cardiac dysfunction. These data suggest that polymicrobial sepsis causes cardiac dysfunction that appears to be linked to activation of MAPKs and Akt in heart.-Fattahi, F., Kalbitz, M., Malan, E.

https://openalex.org/W2620644250,"Dengue disease is still a major health problem in Indonesia. Surabaya, the second largest city in the country, is endemic for dengue. We report here on dengue disease in Surabaya, investigating the clinical manifestations, the distribution of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, and the relationships between clinical manifestations and the genetic characteristics of DENV. A total of 148 patients suspected of having dengue were recruited during February-August 2012. One hundred one (68%) of them were children, and 47 (32%) were adults. Dengue fever (DF) and Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were equally manifested in all of the patients. We performed DENV serotyping on all of the samples using real-time RT-PCR. Of 148, 79 (53%) samples were detected as DENV positive, with DENV-1 as the predominant serotype (73%), followed by DENV-2 (8%), DENV-4 (8%), and DENV-3 (6%), while 5% were mixed infections. Based on the Envelope gene sequences, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 24 isolates to genotype the DENV circulating in Surabaya in 2012, and the analysis revealed that DENV-1 consisted of Genotypes I and IV, DENV-2 was of the Cosmopolitan genotype, the DENV-3 viruses were of Genotype I, and DENV-4 was detected as Genotype II. We correlated the infecting DENV serotypes with clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters; however, no significant correlations were found. Amino acid analysis of Envelope protein did not find any unique mutations related to disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2621120683,"Peptides containing the asparagine-glycine-arginine (NGR) motif are recognized by CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor isoforms that are selectively overexpressed in tumor neovasculature. Spontaneous decomposition of NGR peptides can result in isoAsp derivatives, which are recognized by RGD-binding integrins that are essential for tumor metastasis. Peptides binding to CD13 and RGD-binding integrins provide tumor-homing, which can be exploited for dual targeted delivery of anticancer drugs. We synthesized small cyclic NGR peptide–daunomycin conjugates using NGR peptides of varying stability (c[KNGRE]-NH2, Ac-c[CNGRC]-NH2 and the thioether bond containing c[CH2-CO-NGRC]-NH2, c[CH2-CO-KNGRC]-NH2). The cytotoxic effect of the novel cyclic NGR peptide-Dau conjugates were examined in vitro on CD13 positive HT-1080 (human fibrosarcoma) and CD13 negative HT-29 (human colon adenocarcinoma) cell lines. Our results confirm the influence of structure on the antitumor activity and dual acting properties of the conjugates. Attachment of the drug through an enzyme-labile spacer to the C-terminus of cyclic NGR peptide resulted in higher antitumor activity on both CD13 positive and negative cells as compared to the branching versions."
https://openalex.org/W2620846476,"Introduction The HIV epidemic is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. However, limited information exists on its impact on women and infant’s health since the introduction of antiretroviral drugs in this region, where health resources are often scarce. Methods The effect of HIV infection on maternal health, birth outcomes and infant health was analysed in two contemporary cohorts of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected pregnant women from southern Mozambique. Pregnant women attending the first antenatal care visit were followed until one month after delivery. Antiretroviral therapy was administered based on CD4+T cell count and clinical stage. Maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as pregnancy outcomes were assessed by mother’s HIV status. Results A total of 1183 HIV-uninfected and 561 HIV-infected pregnant women were enrolled. HIV-infected women were more likely to have anaemia both at the first antenatal care visit and at delivery than HIV-uninfected women (71.5% versus 54.8% and 49.4% versus 40.6%, respectively, p<0.001). Incidence of hospital admissions during pregnancy was increased among HIV-infected women (RR, 2.04, [95%CI, 1.45; 2.86]; p<0.001). At delivery, 21% of HIV-infected women reported being on antiretroviral therapy, and 70% having received antiretroviral drugs for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. The risk of stillbirths was doubled in HIV-infected women (RR, 2.16 [95%CI 1.17; 3.96], p = 0.013). Foetal anaemia was also increased among infants born to HIV-infected women (10.6% versus 7.3%, p = 0.022). No differences were found in mean birth weight, malaria, prematurity and maternal and neonatal deaths between groups. Conclusions HIV infection continues to be associated with significant maternal morbidity and poor neonatal health outcomes. Efforts should urgently be made to identify the barriers that impede improvements on the devastating effects of HIV in African women and their infants.

https://openalex.org/W2620937979,"This study investigates the presence of dynamical patterns of interpersonal coordination in extended deceptive conversations across multimodal channels of behavior. Using a novel ""devil's advocate"" paradigm, we experimentally elicited deception and truth across topics in which conversational partners either agreed or disagreed, and where one partner was surreptitiously asked to argue an opinion opposite of what he or she really believed. We focus on interpersonal coordination as an emergent behavioral signal that captures interdependencies between conversational partners, both as the coupling of head movements over the span of milliseconds, measured via a windowed lagged cross correlation (WLCC) technique, and more global temporal dependencies across speech rate, using cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA). Moreover, we considered how interpersonal coordination might be shaped by strategic, adaptive conversational goals associated with deception. We found that deceptive conversations displayed more structured speech rate and higher head movement coordination, the latter with a peak in deceptive disagreement conversations. Together the results allow us to posit an adaptive account, whereby interpersonal coordination is not beholden to any single functional explanation, but can strategically adapt to diverse conversational demands."

Although in patient fibroblasts cblJ deficiency phenotypically mimics cblF, including loss of Cbl transport out of the lysosome, somatic complementation assays and the inability of overexpressed LMBD1 to rescue cobalamin cofactor synthesis in cblJ cells firmly establish them as separate disorders. Only four patients have been described in detail thus far with cblJ deficiency. The first two described patients presented within the first weeks of life with feeding difficulties, hypotonia, respiratory distress (patient 1), and an atrial septal defect (patient 2) among many further symptoms (4.Coelho D.

Lysosomal targeting is in line with previous identification of colocalization between ABCD4, LMBD1, and LAMP1, a classical lysosomal marker (4.Coelho D. Kim J.C. Miousse I.R. Fung S. du Moulin M.

LMBD1-dependent targeting of ABCD4 along with the cellular and biochemical mimicry of ABCD4 and LMBD1 dysfunction suggests they interact, a possibility partially supported by surface plasmon resonance of purified proteins in vitro (33.Deme J.C. Hancock M.A. Xia X. Shintre C.A. Plesa M. Kim J.C. Carpenter E.P. Rosenblatt D.S. Coulton J.W. Purification and interaction analyses of two human lysosomal vitamin B12 transporters: LMBD1 and ABCD4.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we report a new patient, the fifth with cblJ deficiency who presented with mild disease due to a truncating and a missense mutation in the ABCD4 gene. The unusual ability of overexpressed LMBD1 to correct the cellular phenotype in fibroblasts in this patient prompted us to further investigate the cellular location and interaction of these partner proteins. Using a live cell fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, we provide experimental evidence of the LMBD1–ABCD4 interaction in human fibroblasts and highlight the crucial importance of this interaction and its disturbance by patient mutations or mutations that disrupt ATPase activity of ABCD4. We further confirm the lysosomal localization of LMBD1 and targeting of ABCD4 to the lysosome in the presence of LMBD1, which is prevented when the ability of ABCD4 to bind LMBD1 is broken. These data suggest an intimate relationship between ABCD4 and LMBD1 and describe how ABCD4 mutations affect the interaction with LMBD1, impair lysosomal targeting, and ultimately ABCD4 function. The first child of non-consanguineous parents was born at full term after an uneventful pregnancy. Neonatal screening suggested methylmalonic aciduria, with increased propionyl-carnitine. At 7 days of age he presented with hypotonia and poor feeding. Methylmalonic acid in the urine was 403 mmol/mol of creatinine, and plasma total homocysteine was 88.6 μmol/liter. These clinical and biochemical findings are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency or disturbed B12 metabolism, although the clinical symptoms are unspecific at this age. From the first week of life the patient received 1 mg of vitamin B12 every 2 days and a protein-restricted diet. Eight days after the start of therapy methylmalonic acid levels decreased to 77 mmol/mol creatinine (reference <3). A followup neurological examination was normal. The patient was lost to followup between the ages of 2 and 10 years. During this period, vitamin B12 (1 mg/d) per os was regularly taken. His visit at the age of 10 years was motivated by a deterioration of vision (6/10 and 1/10). Eye investigations showed a retinal dystrophy and a loss of the scotopic reaction at the electroretinogram. Neurophysiologic evaluation (electromyography, conduction velocity, evoked potential) suggested a peripheral neuropathy and a slight involvement of the pyramidal tract. Retinopathy as well as peripheral neuropathy and involvement of the spinal tract are common in early onset cblC deficiency and other defects of methylcobalamin synthesis (such as cblD, cblE, or cblG), whereas in nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency retinopathy is rarely found. Brain and spine MRI were normal. He also presented with regular pain and weakness of the lower limbs as well as hypopigmentation of the hair. Increased total homocysteine, urinary methyl malonate, macrocytosis, and albuminuria were present at that time (Table 1). Treatment was intensified: folic acid was added and hydroxocobalamin was given daily by intramuscular injections during the first week, then three times per week, and finally once a week. The biochemical tests improved progressively and normalized after 4 months.Table 1Normalization of clinical parameters after intense vitamin B12 treatmentsParameterFirst visit at the age of 10 years4 months laterTotal homocysteine (μmol/liter)578.4Methylmalonic acid (mmol/mol creatinine)642Vitamin B12 (ng/liter)560>2000MCV of RBC (fl)9887Methionine (μmol/liter)17 (N)30 (N)Albuminuria (mg/g creatinine)9417 Open table in a new tab Cobalamin uptake and coenzyme synthesis (CCS) assay of cultured primary fibroblasts of the patient showed elevated uptake of radioactive cyanocobalamin compared with controls but severely decreased production of the cofactor forms AdoCbl and MeCbl (supplemental Table S2), suggesting either cblF or cblJ deficiency. Molecular genetic investigation revealed no mutations in LMBRD1, the gene responsible for the cblF defect, whereas a 2-base-pair deletion resulting in a frameshift (c.1667_1668delAG, p.Glu556Glyfs*27) was found in trans with a 1-base-pair substitution, resulting in a missense mutation (c.1295G>A p.Arg432Gln) in ABCD4, the gene responsible for the cblJ complementation group. The missense mutation is predicted to be “deleterious” by SWIFT and “probably damaging” by PolyPhen and has been identified in only 1 out of 121,412 alleles in the EXaC database (exac.broadinstitute.org) 5Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

To further evaluate intracellular deficiency in cblF and cblJ patient fibroblasts, we attempted cellular cobalamin cofactor synthesis rescue using overexpression of wild type (WT) untagged versions of either LMBD1 or ABCD4 using the pTracer-CMV2 vector (Fig. 1A). Immortalized fibroblasts from cblJ01 and cblJ02 have rescued production of AdoCbl and MeCbl in the presence of overexpression of ABCD4 but not LMBD1. A representative immortalized cblF cell line was partially rescued by ABCD4 but has much greater production of both AdoCbl and MeCbl after LMBD1 overexpression, consistent with previous results (4.Coelho D.

By contrast, synthesis of both cofactor forms was equally rescued by overexpression of either ABCD4 or LMBD1 in immortalized cblJ05 fibroblasts. The combination of cofactor synthesis rescue by either LMBD1 or ABCD4 overexpression in the cblJ05 fibroblasts with the almost identical clinical and biochemical presentation of cblF and cblJ patients (4.Coelho D.

To test this hypothesis, we generated plasmids consisting of LMBD1-tagged C-terminally with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and ABCD4-tagged C-terminally with far-red fluorescent protein (fRFP).

Hormone loss also increases central adiposity, which promotes AD development. One strategy to improve health outcomes in postmenopausal women is estrogen-based hormone therapy (HT), though its efficacy is controversial. The window of opportunity hypothesis posits that HT is beneficial only if initiated near the onset of menopause. Here, we tested this hypothesis by assessing the efficacy of HT against diet-induced obesity and AD-related pathology in female 3xTg-AD mice at early versus late middle-age. HT protected against obesity and reduced β-amyloid burden only at early middle-age. One mechanism that contributes to AD pathogenesis is microglial activation, which is increased by obesity and reduced by estrogens. In parallel to its effects on β-amyloid accumulation, we observed that HT reduced morphological evidence of microglial activation in early but not late middle-age. These findings suggest that HT may be effective during human perimenopause in reducing indices of obesity and AD-related pathology, a conclusion consistent with the window of opportunity hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2621223949,"Chronic inflammation may contribute to insulin resistance via molecular cross-talk between pathways for pro-inflammatory and insulin signaling. Interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) mediates pro-inflammatory signaling via IL-1 receptor/Toll-like receptors, which may contribute to insulin resistance, but this hypothesis is untested. Here, we used male Irak1 null (k/o) mice to investigate the metabolic role of IRAK-1. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and k/o mice had comparable body weights on low-fat and high-fat diets (LFD and HFD, respectively). After 12 weeks on LFD (but not HFD), k/o mice (versus WT) had substantially improved glucose tolerance (assessed by the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT)). As assessed with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp technique, insulin sensitivity was 30% higher in the Irak1 k/o mice on chow diet, but the Irak1 deletion did not affect IPGTT outcomes in mice on HFD, suggesting that the deletion did not overcome the impact of obesity on glucose tolerance. Moreover, insulin-stimulated glucose-disposal rates were higher in the k/o mice, but we detected no significant difference in hepatic glucose production rates (± insulin infusion). Positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle, but not liver, in Irak1 k/o mice in vivo. Moreover, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt was higher in muscle, but not in liver, from Irak1 k/o mice ex vivo. In conclusion, Irak1 deletion improved muscle insulin sensitivity, with the effect being most apparent in LFD mice."
https://openalex.org/W2620594484,"Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder and a major cause of anovulatory sterility in women at reproductive age. Most patients with polycystic ovary syndrome have hyperandrogenism, caused by excess androgen synthesis. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is an essential regulator of embryonic development and organ formation, and recent studies have also shown that BMP4 may be involved in female steroidogenesis process. However, the effect of BMP4 on hyperandrogenism remains unknown. Here, using a female mouse model of hyperandrogenism, we found that ovarian BMP4 levels were significantly decreased in hyperandrogenism. Elevated androgens inhibited BMP4 expression via activation of androgen receptors. Moreover, BMP4 treatment suppressed androgen synthesis in theca cells and promoted estrogen production in granulosa cells by regulating the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, including CYP11A, HSD3B2, CYP17A1, and CYP19A1. Consistently, knockdown of BMP4 augmented androgen levels and inhibited estrogen levels. Mechanistically, Smad signaling rather than the p38 MAPK pathway regulated androgen and estrogen formation, thereby mediating the effect of BMP4. Of note, BMP4-transgenic mice were protected against hyperandrogenism. Our observations clarify a vital role of BMP4 in controlling sex hormone levels and offer new insights into intervention for managing hyperandrogenism by targeting the BMP4-Smad signaling pathway.

Generally, PCOS is mainly characterized by two of the following three criteria: oligo-ovulation or non-ovulation, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary appearance on ultrasonography. Its global prevalence is estimated to be between 6 and 10% and even up to 21%, depending on the diagnostic criteria and geographic location (3.Palomba S. La Sala G.B.

Hyperandrogenism is a key feature of PCOS and contributes to the clinical phenotype of PCOS patients, including menstrual and ovulatory dysfunction, hirsutism, and acne (4.Deplewski D.

Androgen excess: investigations and management.Best. Pract. Res. Clin. Obstet. Gynaecol. 2016; 37: 98-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This condition is characterized by elevated serum level of androgens such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), primarily due to excess androgens production. In females, androgens are synthesized de novo from cholesterol in the ovarian theca cells (TCs) and the adrenal cortex. The ovarian TCs are stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) or insulin, which in turn activates a series of steroidogenic enzymes, including cytochrome P450scc (encoded by CYP11A), Δ5-isomerase-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3βHSD2, encoded by HSD3B2), and P450c17 (encoded by CYP17A1), thereby catalyzing the synthesis of androgens including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (6.Luque-Ramírez M.

The newly synthesized androgens then in part diffuse from TCs to granulosa cells (GCs), where they are aromatized by cytochrome P450arom (encoded by CYP19A1) to produce estrogens such as estrone and estradiol (6.Luque-Ramírez M.

Therefore, genetic mutation or aberrant expression of these genes may be highly related to pathogenesis of hyperandrogenism and PCOS (9.Shohat-Tal A. Sen A. Barad D.H. Kushnir V. Gleicher N.

Thus, to investigate the steroidogenesis process and the regulation of steroidogenic enzymes it is necessary to understand the molecular basis underlying hyperandrogenism and PCOS development.

Biol. 2016; 8: a021899Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is well established that BMP4 plays a vital role in embryonic development and organ formation (13.Wu M. Chen G. Li Y.P. TGF-β and BMP signaling in osteoblast, skeletal development, and bone formation, homeostasis, and disease.Bone Res. 2016; 4: 16009Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). BMP4, like other BMP family members, elicits its effects through two distinct serine–threonine kinase transmembrane receptors, type I and type II receptors (12.Katagiri T. Watabe T. Bone morphogenetic proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a021899Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14.Bragdon B. Moseychuk O. Saldanha S. King D. Julian J. Nohe A. Bone morphogenetic proteins: a critical review.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Once binding with BMP4, type I receptors are activated and in turn transduce intracellular signals via mothers against dpp (Smad) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In the former case, activated BMP type I receptors phosphorylate receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) at their carboxyl-terminal SSXS motifs, including Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, which are BMP-specific R-Smads. The phosphorylated and activated R-Smad proteins form complexes with common partner Smad (coSmad); that is, Smad4, the BMP-specific coSmad. Smad complexes containing one Smad4 and two R-Smads move into the nucleus and associate with various transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors, then bind to regulatory elements of target genes to regulate their transcription (12.Katagiri T. Watabe T. Bone morphogenetic proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a021899Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14.Bragdon B. Moseychuk O. Saldanha S. King D. Julian J. Nohe A. Bone morphogenetic proteins: a critical review.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In addition to Smad, p38 MAPK mediates BMP4 function in such physiological processes as cell differentiation and organ development. Upon phosphorylation by type I receptors, TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) recruits TAK1-binding protein 1 and initiates the phosphorylation cascade with MAPK kinase kinase (MKK) and p38 MAPK. Phosphorylated/activated p38 MAPK then activates the expression of BMP target genes (12.Katagiri T. Watabe T. Bone morphogenetic proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a021899Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14.Bragdon B. Moseychuk O. Saldanha S. King D. Julian J. Nohe A. Bone morphogenetic proteins: a critical review.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We previously reported that BMP4 was required for commitment from pluripotent stem cells to the adipocyte lineage (15.Huang H. Song T.J. Li X. Hu L. He Q. Liu M. Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. BMP signaling pathway is required for commitment of C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells to the adipocyte lineage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12670-12675Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 16.Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Adipogenesis: from stem cell to adipocyte.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 715-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and that BMP4 could improve systemic insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis (17.Qian S.W. Tang Y. Li X. Liu Y. Zhang Y.Y. Huang H.Y. Xue R.D. Yu H.Y. Guo L. Gao H.D. Liu Y. Sun X. Li Y.M. Jia W.P. Tang Q.Q. BMP4-mediated brown fat-like changes in white adipose tissue alter glucose and energy homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E798-E807Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The effect of BMP4 on metabolic improvement indicated its potential role in regulating PCOS and hyperandrogenism, as increasing evidence showed that hyperandrogenism was highly related with metabolic disorders (18.Moran L.J. Norman R.J. Teede H.J. Metabolic risk in PCOS: phenotype and adiposity impact.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 26: 136-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that BMPs promoted primordial follicle development (19.Nilsson E.E. Skinner M.K. Bone morphogenetic protein-4 acts as an ovarian follicle survival factor and promotes primordial follicle development.Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and might be involved in ovarian steroidogenesis process in vitro (20.Glister C. Richards S.L. Knight P.G. Bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-4, -6, and -7 potently suppress basal and luteinizing hormone-induced androgen production by bovine theca interna cells in primary culture: could ovarian hyperandrogenic dysfunction be caused by a defect in thecal BMP signaling?.Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1883-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21.Dooley C.A. Attia G.R. Rainey W.E. Moore D.R. Carr B.R. Bone morphogenetic protein inhibits ovarian androgen production.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of BMP4 on androgen production is still controversial, and the underlying molecular mechanism needs further clarification. In the current study we investigated the effect of BMP4 on coordination between androgen and estrogen synthesis and shed light on the mechanism underlying the regulation of steroidogenic enzymes by BMP4. Our results emphasized the essential role of the BMP4-Smad signaling pathway in the regulation of hyperandrogenism development. To clarify the expression of BMP4 on hyperandrogenism pathogenesis, we established PCOS mice model by consecutively injecting mice with DHEA for 20 days. Abnormal estrous cycles (Fig. 1A), dropsical ovary and uterus (Fig. 1B), increased cystic follicles (Fig. 1C), and elevated serum testosterone (Fig. 1D) were found in DHEA-treated mice, indicating that PCOS model was successfully developed. We, therefore, detected BMP4 expression in ovaries, finding out that both mRNA and protein levels of BMP4 were significantly decreased in hyperandrogenism ovaries compared with control (Fig. 1, E–F). In addition to BMP4, we found that part of the BMP family members was down-regulated in hyperandrogenism ovaries, including BMP5, BMP6, BMP8b, BMP11, BMP12, and BMP15 (supplemental Fig. 1A), suggesting that BMP signaling might be impaired in hyperandrogenism. We also detected the expression of BMP antagonists and found that mRNA levels of Noggin, Chordin, Follistatin, and Gremlin were not affected in the hyperandrogenism condition (supplemental Fig. 1B). To identify the cell types that contributed to the down-regulated BMP4 expression, we isolated ovarian TCs and GCs. Consistent with previous report (22.Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of the bone morphogenetic protein family in rat ovary cell types during the estrous cycle.Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), BMP4 was mainly expressed in TCs (Fig. 2A). We then treated TCs and GCs with testosterone and DHEA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays showed that both testosterone and DHEA induction could repress BMP4 expression in TCs and GCs (Fig. 2, B and C). As several androgen response elements were found in BMP4 promoter (data not shown), we then sought to confirm whether androgens regulated BMP4 promoter activity. To this end, we conducted reporter assays by inserting the BMP4 promoter to the upstream of the luciferase gene. We observed that BMP4 promoter activity was significantly inhibited by testosterone and DHEA treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Based on the notion that androgens function through AR activation (23.Davey R.A. Grossmann M. Androgen receptor structure, function, and biology: from bench to bedside.Clin. Biochem. Rev. 2016; 37: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar), we therefore determined whether AR regulated BMP4 expression. We found that a deficiency of AR significantly reversed the down-regulated BMP4 expression caused by testosterone (Fig. 2E) and that AR could significantly attenuate BMP4 promoter activity (Fig. 2F). We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in TCs and GCs. ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that AR could bind to BMP4 promoter upon testosterone treatment (Fig. 2G). These results collectively illustrated that BMP4 was down-regulated by androgens through AR. It is well established that androgens were mainly synthesized in ovarian TCs, and estrogens were produced in GCs (9.Shohat-Tal A. Sen A. Barad D.H. Kushnir V. Gleicher N. Genetics of androgen metabolism in women with infertility and hypoandrogenism.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2015; 11: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We, therefore, isolated TCs and GCs and treated them with BMP4 and found that total testosterone from TC supernatant was significantly decreased by BMP4 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas estrogen level from GC supernatant was elevated (Fig. 3A). Then we detected expression of several steroidogenic enzymes, including CYP11A, HSD3B2, and CYP17A1, which were responsible for androgens synthesis in TCs, as well as CYP19A1, which was critical for estrogen formation in GCs (Fig. 3B). We found that mRNA levels of enzymes for androgen production in TCs, especially CYP17A1, was significantly suppressed by BMP4 treatment and that CYP19A1 in GCs was dramatically promoted by BMP4 (Fig. 3C). However, expression of SF1, a known transcription factor of CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 (24.Li D. Urs A.N. Allegood J. Leon A. Merrill Jr, A.H. Sewer M.B. Cyclic AMP-stimulated interaction between steroidogenic factor 1 and diacylglycerol kinase θ facilitates induction of CYP17.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6669-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was not affected by BMP4 (Fig. 3C). Consistently, CYP17A1 protein levels in TC were decreased, and CYP19A1 protein levels in GCs were increased by BMP4 (Fig. 3D). We then investigated the effect of Noggin on steroidogenic enzymes expression, which is a well known antagonist for BMP4 (25.Groppe J. Greenwald J. Wiater E. Rodriguez-Leon J. Economides A.N. Kwiatkowski W. Affolter M. Vale W.W. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Choe S. Structural basis of BMP signalling inhibition by the cystine knot protein Noggin.Nature. 2002; 420: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We found that Noggin significantly reversed the altered steroidogenic genes expression caused by BMP4 in both TCs and GCs (Fig. 3E). In brief, Noggin augmented expression of CYP11A, HSD3B2, and CYP17A1 in TCs and repressed expression of CYP19A1 in GCs. We then disrupted BMP4 expression by adenovirus and measured androgen and estrogen production. We found that knockdown of BMP4 promoted androgen synthesis in TCs and inhibited estrogen in GCs (Fig. 4A). Consistently, knockdown of BMP4 augmented CYP11A, HSD3B2, and CYP17A1 expression in TCs but repressed CYP19A1 expression in GCs (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data suggested that BMP4 inhibited androgens synthesis in ovarian TCs and promoted estrogens production in GCs. BMP4 binds to two distinct type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors, which activates Smad and p38 MAPK signaling pathway, thereby regulating cellular processes (12.Katagiri T. Watabe T. Bone morphogenetic proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a021899Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14.Bragdon B. Moseychuk O. Saldanha S. King D. Julian J. Nohe A. Bone morphogenetic proteins: a critical review.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We found that ovarian TCs and GCs mainly expressed type I receptor Bmpr1a and the type II receptors Bmpr2 and Acvr2a, indicating that these cells might be the direct target of BMP4 (Fig. 5A). Additionally, Western blot analyses showed that BMP4 activated both the Smad and p38 MAPK pathways in TCs and GCs, as indicated by increased phosphorylated (p)-Smad1/5/8 and p-p38 MAPK (Fig. 5B). The data above implied that both Smad and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were activated by BMP4 in TCs and GCs. To explore which pathway mediated BMP4's effect, we respectively disrupted Smad4 and p38 MAPK expression by using two sets of siRNA. Smad4 is BMP4-specific coSmad, which is required for Smad complex formation to regulate target genes (12.Katagiri T. Watabe T. Bone morphogenetic proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a021899Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14.Bragdon B. Moseychuk O. Saldanha S. King D. Julian J. Nohe A. Bone morphogenetic proteins: a critical review.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Hence, Smad signaling could be disrupted upon Smad4 deficiency. We found that knockdown of Smad4 by siSmad4-1 and siSmad4-2 increased total testosterone levels secreted by TCs and decreased estrogen levels from GCs even under the condition of BMP4 treatment (Fig. 6A). In contrast, knockdown of p38 MAPK had little effect on androgen and estrogen levels and even slightly increased estrogen levels in GCs (Fig. 6A). We then detected the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and found that Smad4 deficiency could reverse BMP4-induced expression changes of these enzymes. Briefly, a deficiency of Smad4 promoted CYP11A, HSD3B2, and CYP17A1 expression in TCs and inhibited CYP19A1 in GCs, whereas disruption of p38 MAPK could hardly affect these (Fig. 6, B and C). Collectively, these results suggested that the Smad pathway, instead of p38 MAPK, mediated BMP4 function in regulating androgens and estrogens synthesis. The results above indicated that BMP4 regulated CYP17A1 expression through the Smad signaling pathway, which motivated the hypothesis that Smad protein directly modulated promoter activity of CYP17A1. To test the possibility, we transfected CYP17A1 promoter into 293T cells with Smad1 or Smad4, and a reporter assay was then performed finding that both Smad1 and Smad4 repressed CYP17A1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). We further carried out reporter assay in TCs, with the same results (Fig. 6E). These results together indicated that Smads could regulate CYP17A1 expression. We then sought to demonstrate the effect of BMP4 in vivo. Because the adipose tissue is the main source of BMP4, we generated adipocyte-specific BMP4-transgenic (BMP4-TG) mice. As DHEA treatment might conceal the possible changes of androgen levels caused by BMP4, we established the PCOS model on BMP4-TG mice by injecting insulin and hCG for 3 weeks as described (Fig. 7A), which was a well acknowledged method to generate endogenous hyperandrogenism (26.Li H. Chen Y. Yan L.Y. Qiao J. Increased expression of P450scc and CYP17 in development of endogenous hyperandrogenism in a rat model of PCOS.Endocrine. 2013; 43: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). No significant weight changes were observed between BMP4-TG and WT mice (Fig. 7B). Intriguingly, WT mice developed abnormal estrous cycles upon induction, whereas BMP4-TG mice underwent normal estrous cycles (Fig. 7C). Of note, the serum testosterone of BMP4-TG mice was significantly lower than WT mice (Fig. 7D), whereas no significant difference was found in estrogen levels (Fig. 7D). Consistently, decreased CYP17A1 levels and increased CYP19A1 levels were observed in the ovaries of BMP4-TG mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 7E). These results together suggested that BMP4 inhibited hyperandrogenism development, which validated the results in vitro. In the current study, we found that BMP4 was down-regulated by high levels of androgens. BMP4 treatment inhibited androgen synthesis in ovarian TCs and promoted estrogen production in GCs. The molecular mechanism is that BMP4 activated the Smad-signaling pathway, which in turn inhibited expression of CYP17A1. Based on these findings, we proposed a model in which BMP4 plays a role in controlling hyperandrogenism development by regulating androgens synthesis (Fig. 8). Normally, BMP4 coordinated the androgen and estrogen synthesis in the ovary through Smad pathway. Under androgen excess, ovarian BMP4 expression was suppressed by activated AR. The negative regulation of androgen synthesis was then relieved as a consequence of down-regulated BMP4; therefore, androgen production was further increased, and the hyperandrogenism eventually developed (Fig. 8). The negative feedback loop between BMP4 and androgen synthesis was critical for hyperandrogenism occurrence. In addition to endocrine dysfunction, hyperandrogenism and PCOS are closely related to metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (18.Moran L.J. Norman R.J. Teede H.J. Metabolic risk in PCOS: phenotype and adiposity impact.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 26: 136-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is estimated that among PCOS patients, 50–75% develop overweight or diabetes, and ∼70% manifest insulin resistance (27.Sirmans S.M. Pate K.A. Epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of polycystic ovary syndrome.Clin. Epidemiol. 2013; 6: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of insulin resistance, insulin secretion is compensatorily augmented and contributes to hyperinsulinemia. High levels of insulin associates synergistically with LH and activates P450c17, in turn promoting production and release of androgens (27.Sirmans S.M. Pate K.A. Epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of polycystic ovary syndrome.Clin. Epidemiol. 2013; 6: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in the occurrence of PCOS is supported by observations that improving insulin sensitivity through weight loss or drug therapy such as metformin treatment ameliorates the metabolic, hyperandrogenic, and reproductive features of PCOS (28.Diaz R. Reproductive endocrinology: benefits of metformin in PCOS.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2011; 7: 437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that BMP4 improved systemic insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis (17.Qian S.W. Tang Y. Li X. Liu Y. Zhang Y.Y. Huang H.Y. Xue R.D. Yu H.Y. Guo L. Gao H.D. Liu Y. Sun X. Li Y.M. Jia W.P. Tang Q.Q. BMP4-mediated brown fat-like changes in white adipose tissue alter glucose and energy homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E798-E807Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In combination with our current finding that BMP4 prevented the body from hyperandrogenism, it emphasizes the conception that hyperandrogenism is highly related with energy metabolism. Therefore, to identify the essential regulator for the coordination between metabolic conditions and hyperandrogenism may not only clarify the mechanisms underlying PCOS pathogenesis but also provide new strategies for PCOS treatment. Regulation of BMP4 expression has seldom been studied so far. We found for the first time that testosterone and DHEA inhibited BMP4 expression through suppressing its promoter activity. It is well acknowledged that androgens exert their genomic effects via interaction with the AR (23.Davey R.A. Grossmann M. Androgen receptor structure, function, and biology: from bench to bedside.Clin. Biochem. Rev. 2016; 37: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). AR is a ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factor and belongs to the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family. In the absence of androgens, AR associates with chaperone proteins and keeps cytoplasmic (29.Matsumoto T. Sakari M. Okada M. Yokoyama A. Takahashi S. Kouzmenko A. Kato S. The androgen receptor in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2013; 75: 201-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Upon binding with the ligands, AR dissociates itself from chaperone proteins, exposes the nuclear localization signal domain, and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to androgen response elements and regulates target gene transcription (29.Matsumoto T. Sakari M. Okada M. Yokoyama A. Takahashi S. Kouzmenko A. Kato S. The androgen receptor in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2013; 75: 201-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we found that AR bound to BMP4 promoter and inhibited BMP4 promoter activity, thereby repressing its expression. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. It is reported that the transcriptional activity of AR is modulated by specific co-activator or co-repressor (30.van de Wijngaart D.J. Dubbink H.J. van Royen M.E. Trapman J. Jenster G. Androgen receptor coregulators: recruitment via the coactivator binding groove.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2012; 352: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The best-studied AR corepressors so far are nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) (31.Perissi V. Jepsen K. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Deconstructing repression: evolving models of co-repressor action.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). AR could directly bind with NCoR and SMRT (32.Hodgson M.C. Astapova I. Cheng S. Lee L.J. Verhoeven M.C. Choi E. Balk S.P. Hollenberg A.N. The androgen receptor recruits nuclear receptor CoRepressor (N-CoR) in the presence of mifepristone via its N and C termini revealing a novel molecular mechanism for androgen receptor antagonists.J.

https://openalex.org/W2621014297,"Purpose The goal of this study was to characterise adverse drug events (ADE), including both adverse drug reaction (ADR) and accidental poisoning by drugs (AP), considering age, gender, length of stay (LOS), number of deaths and year, during the period 2004–2013. Additionally distributions of the ten’s most frequent ADR and AP were characterized, considering age-group and gender. Methods A retrospective descriptive nationwide study was conducted, based on the hospital discharges database in Portugal from 2004 to 2013, using ICD-9. Events were identified based on the following codes: from E930 to E949.9 and from E850 to E858.9. Results A total of 9 320 076 patients were discharged within this period, with 133 688 patients (1.46%) having at least one ADE, 4% of them related with AP. The mean age of these patients was 63.79 years (SD 21.31), 54.50% were female and the mean LOS was 14.05 days (SD 22.19). Patient with AP had a mean age of 41.06 years (SD 34.05), 54.70% were female and LOS was 7.15 days (SD 19.42). We have identified 10.691 deaths that represent 8.00% from the total of patients with an ADE. The patients above 65 years were more affected by ADR and children below 18 were more affected by AP. Conclusion In the last decade an increasing trend of ADR were observed and an AP pattern relatively stable. Elderly people and children were the age groups most affected. Antibiotics (in ADR) and benzodiazepine-based tranquilizers (in AP) were the major problems. This is a huge, increasing and challenging problem. Further research, using individual and contextual risk factors should be developed to understand spatiotemporal variability, promoting tailored interventions, within and across countries."

We conducted this retrospective study to determine the clinicopathologic significance of the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis in human gastric cancer.The correlations between the clinicopathological features of 270 primary gastric carcinomas and CXCL1 in cancer cells and CXCR2 in stromal cells were analyzed in immunohistochemical studies. The effect of gastric cancer cells on the expression of CXCR2 in BM-MCs was examined using diffuse-type gastric cancer cell lines in vitro.The expression of CXCL1 in cancer cells was correlated with T invasion (T2-T4), lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, peritoneal cytology, peritoneal metastasis and CXCR2 expression in stromal cells. The expression of CXCR2 in stromal cells was correlated with macroscopic type-4 cancers, histological type, T invasion (T2-T4), lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, infiltration, peritoneal cytology, peritoneal metastasis and CD271 expression in stromal cells. The overall survival of patients with CXCL1 and CXCR2-positive cancer was poorer than that of the patients with negative cancer. Both CXCL1 expression in cancer cells and CXCR2 expression in stromal cells were independent prognostic factors for gastric cancer patients.The expressions of CXCL1 in cancer cells and CXCR2 in stromal cells are useful prognostic factors for gastric cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2621052720,"Postoperative adhesions are pathological attachments that develop between abdominopelvic structures following surgery. Considered unavoidable and ubiquitous, postoperative adhesions lead to bowel obstructions, infertility, pain, and reoperations. As such, they represent a substantial health care challenge. Despite over a century of research, no preventive treatment exists. We hypothesized that postoperative adhesions develop from a lack of movement of the abdominopelvic organs in the immediate postoperative period while rendered immobile by surgery and opiates, and tested whether manual therapy would prevent their development. In a modified rat cecal abrasion model, rats were allocated to receive treatment with manual therapy or not, and their resulting adhesions were quantified. We also characterized macrophage phenotype. In separate experiments we tested the safety of the treatment on a strictureplasty model, and also the efficacy of the treatment following adhesiolysis. We show that the treatment led to reduced frequency and size of cohesive adhesions, but not other types of adhesions, such as those involving intraperitoneal fatty structures. This effect was associated with a delay in the appearance of trophic macrophages. The treatment did not inhibit healing or induce undesirable complications following strictureplasty. Our results support that that maintained movements of damaged structures in the immediate postoperative period has potential to act as an effective preventive for attenuating cohesive postoperative adhesion development. Our findings lay the groundwork for further research, including mechanical and pharmacologic approaches to maintain movements during healing."
https://openalex.org/W2621129237,"Big data have contributed to deepen our understanding in regards to many human systems, particularly human mobility patterns and the structure and functioning of transportation systems. Resonating the recent call for 'open big data,' big data from various sources on a range of scales have become increasingly accessible to the public. However, open big data relevant to travelers within public transit tools remain scarce, hindering any further in-depth study on human mobility patterns. Here, we explore ticketing-website derived data that are publically available but have been largely neglected. We demonstrate the power, potential and limitations of this open big data, using the Chinese high-speed rail (HSR) system as an example. Using an application programming interface, we automatically collected the data on the remaining tickets (RTD) for scheduled trains at the last second before departure in order to retrieve information on unused transit capacity, occupancy rate of trains, and passenger flux at stations. We show that this information is highly useful in characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of traveling behaviors on the Chinese HSR, such as weekend traveling behavior, imbalanced commuting behavior, and station functionality. Our work facilitates the understanding of human traveling patterns along the Chinese HSR, and the functionality of the largest HSR system in the world. We expect our work to attract attention regarding this unique open big data source for the study of analogous transportation systems."
https://openalex.org/W2621247544,"Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important epigenetic coregulators. It has been thought that HDACs associate with corepressor complexes and repress gene transcription; however, in this study, we have found that PU.1-a key master regulator for hematopoietic self-renewal and lineage specification-requires HDAC activity for gene activation. Deregulated PU.1 gene expression is linked to dysregulated hematopoiesis and the development of leukemia. In this study, we used erythroid differentiation as a model to analyze how the PU.1 gene is regulated. We found that active HDAC1 is directly recruited to active PU.1 promoter in progenitor cells, whereas acetylated HDAC1, which is inactive, is on the silenced PU.1 promoter in differentiated erythroid cells. We then studied the mechanism of HDAC1-mediated activation. We discovered that HDAC1 activates PU.1 gene transcription via deacetylation of TATA-binding protein-associated factor 9 (TAF9), a component in the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. Treatment with HDAC inhibitor results in an increase in TAF9 acetylation. Acetylated TAF9 does not bind to the PU.1 gene promoter and subsequently leads to the disassociation of the TFIID complex and transcription repression. Thus, these results demonstrate a key role for HDAC1 in PU.1 gene transcription and, more importantly, uncover a novel mechanism of TFIID recruitment and gene activation.-Jian, W., Yan, B., Huang, S., Qiu, Y.

As test system we utilized human OX1 and OX2 orexin receptor-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells as well as control CHO-K1 and neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells. Gq-coupling was assessed by measurement of intracellular Ca2+ and phospholipase C activity, and the coupling to Gi and Gs by adenylyl cyclase inhibition and stimulation, respectively. At concentrations above 1 μM, strong Ca2+ and low phospholipase C responses to Yan 7874 were observed in both OX1- and OX2-expressing cells. However, a major fraction of the response was not mediated by orexin receptors, as determined utilizing the non-selective orexin receptor antagonist N-biphenyl-2-yl-1-{[(1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetyl}-L-prolinamide (TCS 1102) as well as control CHO-K1 cells. Yan 7874 did not produce any specific adenylyl cyclase response. Some experiments suggested an effect on cell viability by Yan 7874, and we thus analyzed this. Within a few hours of exposure, Yan 7874 markedly changed cell morphology (shrunken, rich in vacuoles), reduced growth, promoted cell detachment, and induced necrotic cell death. The effect was equal in cells expressing orexin receptors or not. Thus, Yan 7874 is a weak partial agonist of orexin receptors. It also displays strong off-target effects in the same concentration range, culminating in necrotic cell demise. This makes Yan 7874 unsuitable as orexin receptor agonist."

Here, we show that copper is essential for spore germination in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Germinating spores develop a single germ tube that emerges from the outer spore wall in a process called outgrowth. Under low-copper conditions, the copper transporters Ctr4 and Ctr5 are maximally expressed at the onset of outgrowth. In the case of Ctr6, its expression is broader, taking place before and during outgrowth. Spores lacking Ctr4, Ctr5, and the copper sensor Cuf1 exhibit complete germination arrest at outgrowth. In contrast, ctr6 deletion only partially interferes with formation of outgrowing spores. At outgrowth, Ctr4-GFP and Ctr5-Cherry first co-localize at the spore contour, followed by re-location to a middle peripheral spore region. Subsequently, they move away from the spore body to occupy the periphery of the nascent cell. After breaking of spore dormancy, Ctr6 localizes to the vacuole membranes that are enriched in the spore body relative to the germ tube. Using a copper-binding tracker, results showed that labile copper is preferentially localized to the spore body. Further analysis showed that Ctr4 and Ctr6 are required for copper-dependent activation of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) during spore germination. This activation is critical because the loss of SOD1 activity blocked spore germination at outgrowth. Taken together, these results indicate that cell-surface copper transporters and SOD1 are required for completion of the spore germination program.

https://openalex.org/W2621056020,"Purpose Pneumothoraces are the most frequently occurring complications of CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic pulmonary biopsies (PTPB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of pre-diagnostic lung emphysema on the incidence and extent of pneumothoraces and to establish a risk stratification for the evaluation of the pre-procedure complication probability. Material and methods CT-guided PTPB of 100 pre-selected patients (mean age 67.1±12.8 years) were retrospectively enrolled from a single center database of 235 PTPB performed between 2012–2014. Patients were grouped according to pneumothorax appearance directly after PTPB (group I: without pneumothorax, n = 50; group II: with pneumothorax, n = 50). Group II was further divided according to post-interventional treatment (group IIa: chest tube placement, n = 24; group IIb: conservative therapy, n = 26). For each patient pre-diagnostic percentage of emphysema was quantified using CT density analysis. Emphysema stages were compared between groups using bivariate analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results Emphysema percentage was significantly associated with the occurrence of post-interventional pneumothorax (p = 0.006). Adjusted for potential confounders (age, gender, lesion size and length of interventional pathway) the study yielded an OR of 1.07 (p = 0.042). Absolute risk of pneumothorax increased from 43.4% at an emphysema rate of 5% to 73.8% at 25%. No differences could be seen in patients with pneumothorax between percentage of emphysema and mode of therapy (p = 0.721). Conclusion The rate of lung emphysema is proportionally related to the incidence of pneumothorax after CT-guided PTPB and allows pre-interventional risk stratification. There is no association between stage of emphysema and post-interventional requirement of chest tube placement."
https://openalex.org/W2621081609,"Perceptual expertise is notoriously specific and bound by familiarity; generalizing to novel or unfamiliar images, objects, identities, and categories often comes at some cost to performance. In forensic and security settings, however, examiners are faced with the task of discriminating unfamiliar images of unfamiliar objects within their general domain of expertise (e.g., fingerprints, faces, or firearms). The job of a fingerprint expert, for instance, is to decide whether two unfamiliar fingerprint images were left by the same unfamiliar finger (e.g., Smith’s left thumb), or two different unfamiliar fingers (e.g., Smith and Jones’s left thumb). Little is known about the limits of this kind of perceptual expertise. Here, we examine fingerprint experts’ and novices’ ability to distinguish fingerprints compared to inverted faces in two different tasks. Inverted face images serve as an ideal comparison because they vary naturally between and within identities, as do fingerprints, and people tend to be less accurate or more novice-like at distinguishing faces when they are presented in an inverted or unfamiliar orientation. In Experiment 1, fingerprint experts outperformed novices in locating categorical fingerprint outliers (i.e., a loop pattern in an array of whorls), but not inverted face outliers (i.e., an inverted male face in an array of inverted female faces). In Experiment 2, fingerprint experts were more accurate than novices at discriminating matching and mismatching fingerprints that were presented very briefly, but not so for inverted faces. Our data show that perceptual expertise with fingerprints can be flexible to changing task demands, but there can also be abrupt limits: fingerprint expertise did not generalize to an unfamiliar class of stimuli. We interpret these findings as evidence that perceptual expertise with unfamiliar objects is highly constrained by one’s experience."
https://openalex.org/W2621071077,"Cruciate ligament rupture (CR) and associated osteoarthritis (OA) is a common condition in dogs. Dogs frequently develop a second contralateral CR. This study tested the hypothesis that the degree of stifle synovitis and cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) matrix damage in dogs with CR is correlated with non-invasive diagnostic tests, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 29 client-owned dogs with an unstable stifle due to complete CR and stable contralateral stifle with partial CR. We evaluated correlation of stifle synovitis and CrCL fiber damage with diagnostic tests including bilateral stifle radiographs, 3.0 Tesla MR imaging, and bilateral stifle arthroscopy. Histologic grading and immunohistochemical staining for CD3+ T lymphocytes, TRAP+ activated macrophages and Factor VIII+ blood vessels in bilateral stifle synovial biopsies were also performed. Serum and synovial fluid concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), and synovial total nucleated cell count were determined. Synovitis was increased in complete CR stifles relative to partial CR stifles (P<0.0001), although total nucleated cell count in synovial fluid was increased in partial CR stifles (P<0.01). In partial CR stifles, we found that 3D Fast Spin Echo Cube CrCL signal intensity was correlated with histologic synovitis (SR = 0.50, P<0.01) and that radiographic OA was correlated with CrCL fiber damage assessed arthroscopically (SR = 0.61, P<0.001). Taken together, results of this study show that clinical diagnostic tests predict severity of stifle synovitis and cruciate ligament matrix damage in stable partial CR stifles. These data support use of client-owned dogs with unilateral complete CR and contralateral partial CR as a clinical trial model for investigation of disease-modifying therapy for partial CR."
https://openalex.org/W2620659966,"Objective Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A) disease is the most common inherited neuropathy that lacks of therapy and of molecular markers to assess disease severity. Herein, we have pursued the identification of potential biomarkers in plasma samples and skin biopsies that could define the phenotype of CMT1A patients at mild (Mi), moderate (Mo) and severe (Se) stages of disease as assessed by the CMT neuropathy score to contribute to the understanding of CMT pathophysiology and eventually inform of the severity of the disease. Methods We have used: (i) a high-throughput untargeted metabolomic approach of plasma samples in a cohort of 42 CMT1A patients and 15 healthy controls (CRL) using ultrahigh liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and (ii) reverse phase protein microarrays to quantitate the expression of some proteins of energy metabolism and of the antioxidant response in skin biopsies of a cohort of 70 CMT1A patients and 13 healthy controls. Results The metabolomic approach identified 194 metabolites with significant differences among the four groups (Mi, Mo, Se, CRL) of samples. A multivariate Linear Discriminant Analysis model using 12 metabolites afforded the correct classification of the samples. These metabolites indicate an increase in protein catabolism and the mobilization of membrane lipids involved in signaling inflammation with severity of CMT1A. A concurrent depletion of leucine, which is required for the biogenesis of the muscle, is also observed in the patients. Protein expression in skin biopsies indicates early loss of mitochondrial and antioxidant proteins in patients’ biopsies. Conclusion The findings indicate that CMT1A disease is associated with a metabolic state resembling inflammation and sarcopenia suggesting that it might represent a potential target to prevent the nerve and muscle wasting phenotype in these patients. The observed changes in metabolites could be useful as potential biomarkers of CMT1A disease after appropriate validation in future longitudinal studies."
https://openalex.org/W2621070147,"We hypothesized that meteorological conditions on the onset day and conditions on the former days may play important roles in the modulation of physical conditions. Associations of meteorological factors and their changes in former days with stroke onset are of interest. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study to evaluate the frequency of stroke events and their interaction with meteorological conditions and their daily changes. Acute stroke patients (n = 3935, 73.5±12.4 years, 1610 females) who were admitted to 7 stroke hospitals in three restricted areas were enrolled in this study. Poisson regression models involving time-lag variables was used to compare daily rates of stroke events with mean thermo-hydrological index (THI), atmospheric pressure, and their daily changes. We divided onset days into quintiles based on the THI, atmospheric pressure, and their daily changes for the last 7 days. The frequencies of ischemic stroke significantly increased when THI varied either cooler or warmer from a previous day (extremely cooler, risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.34; extremely warmer, RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.31; r2 = 0.001 for the best regression, p = 0.001). Intracerebral hemorrhage frequencies significantly decreased on high-THI days (extremely high, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95; r2 = 0.013 for the best regression, p<0.001) and increased in high atmospheric pressure days (high, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.65; r2 = 0.009 for the best regression, p<0.001). Additionally, even after adjusting for the THI on the onset day and its changes for the other days, intracerebral hemorrhage increased when THI got extremely cooler in 4 days prior (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.71, r2 = 0.006 for the best regression, p<0.001). Various meteorological conditions may exhibit influences on stroke onset. And, when temperature cooled, there may be a possibility to show delayed influence on the frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage 4 days later."
https://openalex.org/W2621170054,"Unlike other agonists that cause transient endothelial cell (EC) response, the products of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) oxidation that contain cyclopenthenone groups, which recapitulate prostaglandin-like structure, cause sustained enhancement of the pulmonary EC barrier. The mechanisms that drive the sustained effects by oxidized PAPC (OxPAPC) remain unexplored. On the basis of the structural similarity of isoprostanoid moieties that are present in full-length oxygenated PAPC species, we used an inhibitory approach to perform the screening of prostanoid receptors as potential candidates that mediate OxPAPC effects. Results show that only prostaglandin E receptor-4 (EP4) was involved and mediated the sustained phase of the barrier-enhancing effects of OxPAPC that are associated with the activation of Rac GTPase and its cytoskeletal targets. EC incubation with OxPAPC also induced EP4 mRNA expression in pulmonary ECs and lung tissue. EP4 knockdown using gene-specific small interfering RNA did not affect the rapid phase of OxPAPC-induced EC barrier enhancement or the protective effects against thrombin-induced EC permeability, but abolished the advanced barrier enhancement phase and suppressed the protective effects of OxPAPC against more sustained EC barrier dysfunction and cell inflammatory response caused by TNF-α. Endothelial-specific knockout of the EP4 receptor in mice attenuated the protective effect of intravenous OxPAPC administration in the model of acute lung injury caused by intratracheal injection of LPS. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for prostaglandin receptor EP4 in the mediation of barrier-enhancing and anti-inflammatory effects caused by oxidized phospholipids.—Oskolkova, O., Gawlak, G., Tian, Y., Ke, Y., Sarich, N., Son, S., Andreasson, K., Bochkov, V.

We localized Fstl1 transcript in lung smooth muscle cells and identified Fstl1 as essential regulator of lung smooth muscle formation. Deletion of Fstl1 in mice led to postnatal death as a result of respiratory failure due to multiple defects in lung development. Analysis of the mutant phenotype showed impaired airway smooth muscle (SM) manifested as smaller SM line in trachea and discontinued SM surrounding bronchi, which were associated with decreased transcriptional factors myocardin/serum response factor (SRF) and impaired differentiation of SM cells. Fstl1 knockout mice also displayed abnormal vasculature SM manifested as hyperplasia SM in pulmonary artery.

https://openalex.org/W2620917922,"Ranking enables coaches, sporting authorities, and pundits to determine the relative performance of individual athletes and teams in comparison to their peers. While ranking is relatively straightforward in sports that employ traditional leagues, it is more difficult in sports where competition is fragmented (e.g. athletics, boxing, etc.), with not all competitors competing against each other. In such situations, complex points systems are often employed to rank athletes. However, these systems have the inherent weakness that they frequently rely on subjective assessments in order to gauge the calibre of the competitors involved. Here we show how two Internet derived algorithms, the PageRank (PR) and user preference (UP) algorithms, when utilised with a simple 'who beat who' matrix, can be used to accurately rank track athletes, avoiding the need for subjective assessment. We applied the PR and UP algorithms to the 2015 IAAF Diamond League men's 100m competition and compared their performance with the Keener, Colley and Massey ranking algorithms. The top five places computed by the PR and UP algorithms, and the Diamond League '2016' points system were all identical, with the Kendall's tau distance between the PR standings and '2016' points system standings being just 15, indicating that only 5.9% of pairs differed in their order between these two lists. By comparison, the UP and '2016' standings displayed a less strong relationship, with a tau distance of 95, indicating that 37.6% of the pairs differed in their order. When compared with the standings produced using the Keener, Colley and Massey algorithms, the PR standings appeared to be closest to the Keener standings (tau distance = 67, 26.5% pair order disagreement), whereas the UP standings were more similar to the Colley and Massey standings, with the tau distances between these ranking lists being only 48 (19.0% pair order disagreement) and 59 (23.3% pair order disagreement) respectively. In particular, the UP algorithm ranked 'one-off' victors more highly than the PR algorithm, suggesting that the UP algorithm captures alternative characteristics to the PR algorithm, which may more suitable for predicting future performance in say knockout tournaments, rather than for use in competitions such as the Diamond League. As such, these Internet derived algorithms appear to have considerable potential for objectively assessing the relative performance of track athletes, without the need for complicated points equivalence tables. Importantly, because both algorithms utilise a 'who beat who' model, they automatically adjust for the strength of the competition, thus avoiding the need for subjective decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2621316790,"Land quality, a key economic capital supporting local development, is affected by biophysical and anthropogenic factors. Taken as a relevant attribute of economic systems, land quality has shaped the territorial organization of any given region influencing localization of agriculture, industry and settlements. In regions with long-established human-landscape interactions, such as the Mediterranean basin, land quality has determined social disparities and polarization in the use of land, reflecting the action of geographical gradients based on elevation and population density. The present study investigates latent relationships within a large set of indicators profiling local communities and land quality on a fine-grained resolution scale in Italy with the aim to assess the potential impact of land quality on the regional socioeconomic structure. The importance of land quality gradients in the socioeconomic configuration of urban and rural regions was verified analyzing the distribution of 149 socioeconomic and environmental indicators organized in 5 themes and 17 research dimensions. Agriculture, income, education and labour market variables discriminate areas with high land quality from areas with low land quality. While differential land quality in peri-urban areas may reflect conflicts between competing actors, moderate (or low) quality of land in rural districts is associated with depopulation, land abandonment, subsidence agriculture, unemployment and low educational levels. We conclude that the socioeconomic profile of local communities has been influenced by land quality in a different way along urban-rural gradients. Policies integrating environmental and socioeconomic measures are required to consider land quality as a pivotal target for sustainable development. Regional planning will benefit from an in-depth understanding of place-specific relationships between local communities and the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2620801289,"One of the most important factors in successful upper limb prostheses is the socket design. Sockets must be individually fabricated to arrive at a geometry that suits the user’s morphology and appropriately distributes the pressures associated with prosthetic use across the residual limb. In higher levels of amputation, such as transhumeral, this challenge is amplified as prosthetic weight and the physical demands placed on the residual limb are heightened. Yet, in the upper limb, socket fabrication is largely driven by heuristic practices. An analytical understanding of the interactions between the socket and residual limb is absent in literature. This work describes techniques, adapted from lower limb prosthetic research, to empirically characterize the pressure distribution occurring between the residual limb and well-fit transhumeral prosthetic sockets. A case series analyzing the result of four participants with transhumeral amputation is presented. A Tekscan VersaTek pressure measurement system and FaroArm Edge coordinate measurement machine were employed to capture socket-residual limb interface pressures and geometrically register these values to the anatomy of participants. Participants performed two static poses with their prosthesis under two separate loading conditions. Surface pressure maps were constructed from the data, highlighting pressure distribution patterns, anatomical locations bearing maximum pressure, and the relative pressure magnitudes. Pressure distribution patterns demonstrated unique characteristics across the four participants that could be traced to individual socket design considerations. This work presents a technique that implements commercially available tools to quantitatively characterize upper limb socket-residual limb interactions. This is a fundamental first step toward improved socket designs developed through informed, analytically-based design tools."

The magnetic fields produced by undersea electric power cables that carry electricity from hydrokinetic energy sources to shore-based power stations may produce similar local distortions in the earth’s main field. Concerns exist that animals migrating along the continental shelves might orient to the magnetic field from the cables, and move either inshore or offshore away from their normal path. We have studied the effect of the Trans Bay Cable (TBC), an 85-km long, high voltage, direct current (DC) transmission line leading underwater from Pittsburg, CA to San Francisco, CA, on fishes migrating through the San Francisco Estuary. These included Chinook salmon smolts (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that migrate downstream through the San Francisco Estuary to the Pacific Ocean and adult green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), which migrate upstream from the ocean through the estuary to their spawning habitat in the upper Sacramento River and return to the ocean after spawning occurs. Based on a detailed gradiometer survey, we found that the distortions in the earth’s main field produced by bridges across the estuary were much greater than those from the Trans Bay Cable. The former anomalies exceeded the latter by an order of magnitude or more. Significant numbers of tagged Chinook salmon smolts migrated past bridges, which produced strong magnetic anomalies, to the Golden Gate Bridge, where they were recorded by dual arrays of acoustic tag-detecting monitors moored in lines across the mouth of the bay. In addition, adult green sturgeon successfully swam upstream and downstream through the estuary on the way to and from their spawning grounds. Hence, the large anomalies produced by the bridges do not appear to present a strong barrier to the natural seasonal movement patterns of salmonid smolts and adult green sturgeon."

The societal costs (healthcare costs, patient and family costs, and costs for loss of productivity), fatigue severity, quality of life, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured over a follow-up period of one year. The main outcome of the cost-effectiveness analysis was fatigue measured by the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS). The main outcome of the cost-utility analysis was the QALY based on the EuroQol-5D-3L utilities. Sensitivity analyses were performed, and uncertainty was calculated using the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and cost-effectiveness planes.The data of 109 patients (57 MRT and 52 CBT) were analyzed. MRT was significantly more effective in reducing fatigue at 52 weeks. The mean difference in QALY between the treatments was not significant (0.09, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.19). The total societal costs were significantly higher for patients allocated to MRT (a difference of €5,389, 95% CI: 2,488 to 8,091). MRT has a high probability of being the most cost effective, using fatigue as the primary outcome. The ICER is €856 per unit of the CIS fatigue subscale. The results of the cost-utility analysis, using the QALY, indicate that the CBT had a higher likelihood of being more cost-effective.The probability of being more cost-effective is higher for MRT when using fatigue as primary outcome variable. Using QALY as the primary outcome, CBT has the highest probability of being more cost-effective.ISRCTN77567702."

Afterward, mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk [CD + HFD (CH) and RD + HFD (RH)] with or without 5% Tau supplementation after weaning on their drinking water [CH + Tau (CHT) and RH + Tau (RHT)]. The HFD increased insulin secretion through mitochondrial metabolism in CH and RH. Tau prevented all those alterations in CHT only. The expression of the taurine transporter (Tau-T), as well as Tau content in pancreatic islets, was increased in CH but had no effect on RH. Protein malnutrition programs β cells and impairs Tau-induced restoration of mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis. This may be associated with modulation of the expression of Tau-T in pancreatic islets, which may be responsible for the absence of effect of Tau in protein-malnourished obese mice.-Branco, R. C.

https://openalex.org/W2621207178,"The neurodegenerative disease glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Glaucoma is characterized by progressive visual field loss caused by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. Both surgical glaucoma treatments and medications are available, however, they only halt glaucoma progression and are unable to reverse damage. Furthermore, many patients do not respond well to treatments. It is therefore important to better understand the mechanisms involved in glaucoma pathogenesis. Patients with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) offer important insight into glaucoma progression. ARS patients are at 50% risk of developing early onset glaucoma and respond poorly to treatments, even when surgical treatments are combined with medications. Mutations in the transcription factor FOXC1 cause ARS. Alterations in FOXC1 levels cause ocular malformations and disrupt stress response in ocular tissues, thereby contributing to glaucoma progression. In this study, using biochemical and molecular techniques, we show that FOXC1 regulates the expression of RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2 and SNAP25, three genes with central roles in both exocytosis and endocytosis, responsible for extracellular trafficking. FOXC1 positively regulates RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2, while either increase or decrease in FOXC1 levels beyond its normal range results in decreased SNAP25. In addition, we found that FOXC1 regulation of RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2 and SNAP25 affects secretion of Myocilin (MYOC), a protein associated with juvenile onset glaucoma and steroid-induced glaucoma. The present work reveals that FOXC1 is an important regulator of exocytosis and establishes a new link between FOXC1 and MYOC-associated glaucoma."

In addition, the SNARE-mediated secretory pathway can deliver diverse defense products to infection sites during exocytosis-associated immune responses in plants. In this study, a novel gene (CkSNAP33) encoding a synaptosomal-associated protein was isolated from Cynanchum komarovii and characterized. CkSNAP33 contains Qb- and Qc-SNARE domains in the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively, and shares high sequence identity with AtSNAP33 from Arabidopsis. CkSNAP33 expression was induced by H2O2, salicylic acid (SA), Verticillium dahliae, and wounding. Arabidopsis lines overexpressing CkSNAP33 had longer primary roots and larger seedlings than the wild type (WT). Transgenic Arabidopsis lines showed significantly enhanced resistance to V. dahliae, and displayed reductions in disease index and fungal biomass, and also showed elevated expression of PR1 and PR5. The leaves of transgenic plants infected with V. dahliae showed strong callose deposition and cell death that hindered the penetration and spread of the fungus at the infection site. Taken together, these results suggest that CkSNAP33 is involved in the defense response against V. dahliae and enhanced disease resistance in Arabidopsis."

Principal threats are the destruction of its seed deposits by human activities and reduced germination rates due to the decreasing occurrence of precipitation events. To enable population genetic and phylogeographic analyses in this species we performed paired-end shotgun sequencing (2x100 bp) of genomic DNA on the Illumina HiSeq platform and identified microsatellite (SSR) loci in the resulting sequences. From 29 million quality-filtered read pairs we obtained 549,174 contigs (average length 614 bp; N50 = 904). Searching for SSRs revealed 10,336 loci with microsatellite motifs. Initially, we designed primers for 96 loci, which were tested for PCR amplification on three C. longiscapa individuals. Successfully amplifying loci were further tested on eight individuals to screen for length variation in the resulting amplicons, and the alleles were exemplarily sequenced to infer the basis for the observed length variation. Finally we arrived at 26 validated SSR loci for population studies in C. longiscapa, which resulted in 146 bi-allelic SSR markers in our test sample of eight individuals.

Drosophilids are known as DNMT2-only species and the DNA methylation phenomenon is a not elucidated case yet, as well as the ontogenetic and physiologic importance of DNMT2 for this species group. In addition, more recently study showed that methylation in the genome in Drosophila melanogaster is independent in relation to DNMT2.

We examined the twenty-six DNMT2 models generated by molecular modelling and five crystallographic structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using different approaches. Our results showed that despite sequence and structural similarity between species close related, we found outstanding differences when they are analyzed in the context of surface distribution of electrostatic properties. The differences found in the electrostatic potentials may be linked with different affinities and processivity of DNMT2 for its different substrates (DNA, RNA or tRNA) and even for interactions with other proteins involved in the epigenetic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2620984033,"Transplant tourism has increased rapidly in the past two decades, accounting for about 10% of world organ transplants. However it is ethically controversial and discouraged by professional guidelines. We conducted this study to investigate the outcomes and trends of overseas kidney and liver transplantation in Taiwan to provide a sound basis for ethical reflection.The Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database was used to identify 2381 domestic and 2518 overseas kidney transplant (KT) recipients from 1998 to 2009 and 1758 domestic and 540 overseas liver transplantation (LT) recipients from 1999 to 2009. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risks of mortality and graft failure. The numbers of overseas transplantation increased after 2000, reached a peak in 2005 and decreased after 2007. Compared to their domestic counterparts, the overseas KT recipients were older, male predominant, with shorter pre-op dialysis period and more comorbidities. Similarly, the overseas LT recipients were older, male predominant and had more hepatocellular carcinoma cases. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival rates were 96.9%, 91.7% and 83.0% respectively for domestic KT and 95.8%, 87.8% and 73.1% for overseas KT (p<0.001). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival rates were 89.2%, 79.5%, 75.2% for domestic LT and 79.8%, 54.7%, 49.9% for overseas LT (p<0.001).The poorer outcomes of the overseas groups may be due to more older patients, more comorbidities (KT), or more hepatocellular carcinoma recurrences (LT). After domestic reform and international ethical challenges, the numbers of organ tourism decreased but the practice still persisted surreptitiously. Compulsory registration policies for overseas transplantation with international conventions to sanction organ trafficking and transplant tourism should be considered to stop these controversial practices."
https://openalex.org/W2620557370,"Accurate accounts of both living and fossil mammal communities are critical for creating biodiversity inventories and understanding patterns of changing species diversity through time. We combined data from from14 new fossil localities with literature accounts and museum records to document the bat biodiversity of Haiti through time. We also report an assemblage of late-Holocene (1600–600 Cal BP) bat fossils from a montane cave (Trouing Jean Paul, ~1825m) in southern Haiti. The nearly 3000 chiropteran fossils from Trouing Jean Paul represent 15 species of bats including nine species endemic to the Caribbean islands. The fossil bat assemblage from Trouing Jean Paul is dominated by species still found on Hispaniola (15 of 15 species), much as with the fossil bird assemblage from the same locality (22 of 23 species). Thus, both groups of volant vertebrates demonstrate long-term resilience, at least at high elevations, to the past 16 centuries of human presence on the island."
https://openalex.org/W2620928562,"Current theory proposes that sex can increase genetic variation and produce high fitness genotypes if genetic associations between alleles at different loci are non-random. In case beneficial and deleterious alleles at different loci are in linkage disequilibrium, sex may i) recombine beneficial alleles of different loci, ii) liberate beneficial alleles from genetic backgrounds of low fitness, or iii) recombine deleterious mutations for more effective elimination. In our study, we found that the first mechanism dominated the initial phase of adaptive evolution in Brachionus calyciflorus rotifers during a natural selection experiment. We used populations that had been locally adapted to two environments previously, creating a linkage disequilibrium between beneficial and deleterious alleles at different loci in a combined environment. We observed the highest fitness increase when several beneficial alleles of different loci could be recombined, while the other mechanisms were ineffective. Our study thus provides evidence for the hypothesis that sex can speed up adaptation by recombination between beneficial alleles of different loci, in particular during early stages of adaptive evolution in our system. We also suggest that the benefits of sex might change over time and state of adaptive progress."
https://openalex.org/W2620601333,"Renal dysfunction frequently occurs during the periods preceding and following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and in many cases, renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required. Information regarding the duration of RRT and the rate of kidney function recovery after OLT is crucial for transplant program management. We evaluated a sample of 155 stable patients undergoing post-intensive care hemodialysis (HD) from a patient population of 908 adults who underwent OLT. We investigated the average time to renal function recovery (duration of RRT required) and determined the risk factors for remaining on dialysis > 90 days after OLT. Log-rank tests were used for univariate analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with the risk of remaining on HD. The results of our analysis showed that of the 155 patients, 28% had pre-OLT diabetes mellitus, 21% had pre-OLT hypertension, and 40% had viral hepatitis. Among the patients, the median MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score was 27 (interquartile range [IQR] 22-35). When they were listed for liver transplantation, 32% of the patients had serum creatinine (Scr) levels > 1.5 mg/dL or were on HD, and 50% had serum creatinine (Scr) levels > 1.5 mg/dL or were on HD at the time of OLT. Of the transplanted patients, 25% underwent pre-OLT intermittent HD, and 14% and 41% underwent continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) pre-OLT and post-OLT, respectively. At 90 days post-OLT, 118 (76%) patients had been taken off dialysis, and 16 (10%) patients had died while undergoing HD. The median recovery time of these post-OLT patients was 33 (IQR 27–39) days. In the multivariate analysis, fulminant hepatic failure as the cause of liver disease (p<0.001), the absence of pre-OLT hypertension (p = 0.016), a lower intraoperative fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion volume (p = 0.019) and not undergoing pre-OLT intermittent HD (p = 0.032) were associated with performing RRT for less than 90 days. Therefore, a high proportion of OLT patients showed improved renal function after OLT, and those who were diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure, had no pre-OLT hypertension, received a lower transfused volume of intraoperative FFP and did not undergo pre-OLT intermittent HD had a higher probability of recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2620817687,"Previous reports have shown that the early postnatal environment has the ability to modify the obesity phenotype of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. To determine whether this early postnatal environment affects hypothalamic signaling systems involved in energy balance, OLETF pups and lean Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) pups were cross-fostered to same or opposite strain Dams (designated as LdLp: LETO pups with LETO dams; LdOp: OLETF pups with LETO dams; OdLp: LETO pups with OLETF dams; and OdOp: OLETF pups with OLETF dams). Hypothalamic gene expression was examined at postnatal day 23 (PND 23) and PND 90 as OdOp rats started to gain more body weight at PND 23 and developed obesity at PND 90 relative to lean control LdLp rats. On PND 23, neuropeptide Y (Npy) gene expression was significantly increased in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) in both LdOp and OdOp pups compared to LdLp pups. Maternal environment did not affect DMH Npy expression in LETO weanlings. On PND 90, maternal environment during the cross-fostering period had a major effect on DMH Npy expression. Levels were significantly increased in both OdOp and OdLp rats relative to those in LdOp rats and LdLp controls. Reduced expression of Npy in the DMH of LdOp rats was consistent with their reduction of body weight compared to OdOp rats. In contrast to DMH Npy, gene expression for Npy and proopiomelanocortin in the arcuate nucleus appeared to appropriately respond to alterations in body weight and plasma leptin levels. Levels of oxytocin gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus were lower in offspring raised by LETO dams apparently responding to the higher DMH NPY levels. Together, our results demonstrate effects of both genotype and early postnatal environment on obesity of OLETF rats and further suggest an important role of DMH NPY in the development of obesity of OLETF rats."
https://openalex.org/W2621125503,"Arthropods are the most diverse taxonomic group of terrestrial eukaryotes and are sensitive to physical alterations in their environment such as those caused by forestry. With their enormous diversity and physical omnipresence, arthropods could be powerful indicators of the effects of disturbance following forestry. When arthropods have been used to measure the effects of disturbance, the total diversity of some groups is often found to increase following forestry. However, these findings are frequently derived using a coarse taxonomic grain (family or order) to accommodate for various taxonomic impediments (including cryptic diversity and poorly resourced taxonomists). Our intent with this work was to determine the diversity of arthropods in and around Algonquin Park, and how this diversity was influenced by disturbance (in this case, forestry within the past 25 years). We used DNA barcode-derived diversity estimates (Barcode Index Number (BIN) richness) to avoid taxonomic impediments and as a source of genetic information with which we could conduct phylogenetic estimates of diversity (PD). Diversity patterns elucidated with PD are often, but not always congruent with taxonomic estimates-and departures from these expectations can help clarify disturbance effects that are hidden from richness studies alone. We found that BIN richness and PD were greater in disturbed (forested) areas, however when we controlled for the expected relationship between PD and BIN richness, we found that cut sites contained less PD than expected and that this diversity was more phylogenetically clustered than would be predicted by taxonomic richness. While disturbance may cause an evident increase in diversity, this diversity may not reflect the full evolutionary history of the assemblage within that area and thus a subtle effect of disturbance can be found decades following forestry."

https://openalex.org/W2620570717,"The present experiment was designed to determine whether classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC) can be established by using electrical microstimulation of the hippocampus as a conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with an air-puff unconditioned stimulus (US). We intended to examine whether EBC transfer could occur when a CS was shifted between microstimulation of the hippocampus as a CS (Hip-CS) and tone as a CS (tone-CS) and to compare the difference in transfer effectiveness between delay EBC (dEBC) and trace EBC (tEBC). Eight groups of guinea pigs, including 4 experimental groups and 4 control groups, were included in the study. First, the experimental groups received either a Hip-CS or a tone-CS paired with a US; then, these groups were exposed to a shifted CS (tone-CS or Hip-CS) paired with the US. The control groups received the corresponding Hip-CS or tone-CS, which was, however, pseudo-paired with the US. The control groups were then shifted to the tone-CS (or Hip-CS) paired with the US. The results show that EBC can be successfully established when using microstimulation of the hippocampus as a CS paired with an air-puff US, and that the acquisition rates of EBC are higher in the experimental groups than in the control groups after switching from the Hip-CS to the tone-CS or vice versa, indicating the occurrence of learning transfer between EBC established with the Hip-CS and tone-CS. The present study also demonstrated that the EBC re-acquisition rates were remarkably higher in dEBC than in tEBC with both types of transfer, which suggests that the saving effect was more evident in dEBC than tEBC. These results significantly expand our knowledge of EBC transfer as well as the functional neural circuit underlying EBC transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2621074526,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is known to be strongly associated with obesity, visceral fat, metabolic syndrome (MS), lifestyle, and lifestyle-related diseases in both males and females. However, the prevalence of NAFLD, MS, and clinical backgrounds is different between males and females.We conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the differing influence of lifestyle-related factors and visceral fat on fatty liver (FL) with elevation of liver enzymes between males and females with MS.We enrolled 42,134 persons who underwent a regular health check-up, and after excluding subjects who fulfilled excluding criteria, the remaining subjects were 2,110 persons with MS. We examined the differing influence of lifestyle-related factors and visceral fat on FL with elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (ALT elevation was defined as ALT level of ≥31 IU/l in the present study).The odds rations for FL with ALT elevation were as follows: WC, 1.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36-2.46); dyslipidemia, 1.89 (95% CI 1.34-2.68); hemoglobin A1c, 1.36 (95% CI 1.00-1.85); visceral fat type MS (V-type MS), 5.78 (95% CI 4.29-7.80); and light drinker, 0.56 (95% CI 0.41-0.78) in males with MS and BMI, 2.18 (95% CI 1.43-3.33); WC, 1.85 (95% CI 1.27-2.70); diastolic blood pressure, 1.69 (95% CI 1.16-2.45); triglyceride, 2.22 (95% CI 1.56-3.17); impaired glucose tolerance, 1.66 (95% CI 1.11-2.47); and V-type MS, 3.83 (95% CI 2.57-5.70) in females with MS. The prevalence of FL with ALT elevation and ALT was significantly higher in V-type MS than in the subcutaneous fat type MS in both males and females with MS (P < 0.001).Although V-type MS and WC is a common significant predictor of an increased prevalence of FL with ALT elevation in both males and females with MS, gender, lifestyle-related factors, and MS type in individuals with MS should be considered for the development of FL with ALT elevation."
