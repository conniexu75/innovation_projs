https://openalex.org/W2026372077,Mice were treated with subclinical doses of lead nitrate for 30 days. Lead-treated mice showed greater susceptibility to challenge with Salmonella typhimurium than controls which received no lead. This result confirms the hypothesis that treatment with lead reduces the resistance of mice to bacterial infection.
https://openalex.org/W1499306991,"Abstract Cobaltous ion, at concentrations as low as 10 µm, inhibits the energy-dependent transport of magnesium ion into cells of Escherichia coli. Co++ also substitutes for Mg++ in the medium in promoting the energy-dependent efflux of cellular Mg++. Cells accumulate Co++ in a reaction which is dependent upon metabolic energy. The maximum rate and extent of Co++ uptake are similar to those for Mg++, although the apparent affinity for Co++ is only about one-tenth that for Mg++. Mg++ at concentrations as low as 10 µm inhibits the uptake of Co++. Although intracellular Mg++ exchanges readily with external Mg++, Co++ within cells does not easily exchange with either Mg++ or Co++ in the medium. The physiological responses of E. coli to Co++ and Mg++ in the medium reflect the antagonistic effect of each ion on the uptake of the other. Exposure to a low level of Co++ in the medium, in the absence of Mg++, kills cells, but Mg++ protects against this lethal effect of Co++. Other conditions which prevent Co++ uptake, such as low temperature, or deprivation of an energy source, also reduce the lethality of exposure to Co++. A mutant selected for its relative resistance to Co++ in the medium had a decreased capacity to transport both Co++ and Mg++. It appears likely that Co++ is transported into cells of E. coli by the same system responsible for Mg++ transport. This transport, however, requires a much higher concentration of Co++ than is normally found in growth media, and the transport system described here may not be responsible for the uptake of Co++ present in very low concentrations during normal growth."

https://openalex.org/W1972895248,"A much higher yield of DNA single-strand breaks was obtained in the DNA polymerase-deficient mutant Escherichia coli K-12 pol A1 after a given dose of x-rays than had been found before in Escherichia coli. The increased yield of single-strand breaks was due to the absence of a rapid repair system, which had not been described in Escherichia coli K-12. This absence probably accounts for the x-ray sensitivity of the pol A1 mutant. The rapid repair system can be reversibly inhibited in pol+ cells."

https://openalex.org/W1872504890,"Abstract The third and fourth enzymes of the pathway of histidine degradation in Salmonella typhimurium are induced by histidine and repressed by glucose. An improved assay for the third enzyme, 4-imidazolone-5-propionate amidohydrolase, was developed and some properties of this enzyme were studied. Mutants with decreased stability of this enzyme have been isolated. Their lesions are unlinked by transduction to the cluster containing the genes for the histidine-degrading enzymes. Mutants lacking 4-imidazolone-5-propionate amidohydrolase or the fourth enzyme, N-formimino-l-glutamate formiminohydrolase, have also been isolated. Their lesions are located in two closely linked genes near the cluster of genes controlling the synthesis of the first two enzymes of the pathway (histidase and urocanase). Mutations leading to increased levels of the third and fourth enzymes are located to one side of this pair of genes. The following observations suggest that these two clusters form separate units of expression. (a) While the two enzyme activities within each pair are coordinately controlled upon induction or catabolite repression, there is no apparent coordination between the pairs. (b) Mutations affecting the level of enzymes from 1 pair of genes and located to one side of them have no effect on the level of enzymes from the other pair. (c) A gene controlling the inducibility of all four enzymes is located between the two clusters. It is suggested that the units of expression correspond to two operons controlled by a single regulatory gene located between them."
https://openalex.org/W1567720522,"Ribosomes isolated from highly purified rat, cow, pig, or rabbit liver mitochondria occur predominantly as 55 to 56 S particles under conditions that stabilize 70 S Escherichia coli monosomes. These ribosomes are of mitochondrial origin since they incorporate 3H-leucine when mitochondria are incubated in vitro, under conditions in which extramitochondrial ribosomes are inactive. They are actively involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis, since puromycin strips 55 S ribosomes of their nascent peptide chains while inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis. Dissociation studies show that the 55 S ribosome is a mitochondrial monosome, composed of a 28 S small subunit and a 39 S subunit. These mammalian 55 S mitochondrial ribosomes are the smallest monosomes known, and they differ in several respects from extramitochondrial ribosomes, and even from the mitochondrial ribosomes of Neurospora, yeast, and Tetrahymena. They appear to constitute a unique class of miniature ribosomes of the prokaryotic type that are peculiar to animal mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1526887346,"Abstract The uptake of iron by cells of Escherichia coli involves at least three components. One component is chelators of iron which are excreted into the medium by iron-deficient cells. One function of these dihydroxybenzoylserine-containing compounds is to increase the availability of transportable ferric ion to the cells by solubilization of hydroxypolymers of iron. Another component is a tonB-associated step which is characterized by a high affinity of the cells for ferric ion. Point and deletion mutants of the tonB locus are resistant to phage T1, unable to grow normally on iron-deficient medium, and transport ferric ion with a Km 10-fold higher than for wild type cells. Also involved in the uptake of iron is an energy-dependent component which can be demonstrated by treatment of wild type or tonB- cells with azide (30 mm) and iodoacetamide (1 mm). The energy poisons decrease the Vmax of iron accumulation by approximately 10-fold, but they do not alter the apparent Km."

https://openalex.org/W1554892563,"A new phospholipid, isolated from extracts of Salmonella typhimurium, has been identified as 3-sn-phosphatidyl-1'-[3'-acyl]-sn-glycerol, or acyl phosphatidylglycerol (acyl-PG). The compound, whose analysis gave the ratios 3:2:1 for ester-glycerol-phosphorus, comprises 2% of the phospholipid of this organism, along with phosphatidylethanolamine (83%), phosphatidylglycerol (11%), and cardiolipin (4%). The designated configurations are inferred from enzymatic analyses showing that the two glycerols of the molecule are of opposite configuration with respect to their attachments to the central phosphate, as in phosphatidylglycerol. Acetolysis of acyl-PG gave equal amounts of diacylglycerol monoacetate and monoacylglycerol diacetate. The location of the third acyl group on the α position of the monoacylglycerol was determined from nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and from comparative rates of triphenylmethylation, and general conditions were determined for the detection of primary hydroxyls in lipids by use of the latter method. The fatty acids of acyl-PG resemble in composition those of the total lipids of the organism. However, the fatty acids of the monoesterified glycerol moiety are much more saturated than those of the diacylglycerol part of the same compound or those of the total lipid. These results are consistent with the observation that fatty acids on the α position of glycerol are generally more saturated than those on the β position in phospholipids, and provide direct support for the conclusion that the substance is not an artifact of chemical transacylation. In vivo incorporation of acetate-14C by S. typhimurium failed to reveal any rapid labeling or chase of label in any of the fatty acids of acyl-PG. When the bacteria entered the stationary phase of growth, the mole percentage of this lipid declined to zero, while that of phosphatidylethanolamine increased, apparently because of a time differential in the cessation of biosynthesis of the two compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1484777769,"Abstract We have constructed an F factor bearing the genes (hut) responsible for the synthesis of the histidine-degrading enzymes in Salmonella typhimurium. This was accomplished by transducing the genes from the chromosome onto an F factor from Escherichia coli bearing the gal-bio region, which brackets the hut genes but does not include them. Recovery of this nonhomologous transduction was made possible by deleting the homologous hut region from the chromosome. Studies of the control of enzyme synthesis in heterozygous merodiploids showed that the hut region is composed of two operons. One operon includes the structural genes for histidase and urocanase, the first two enzymes of the pathway, and a promoter-operator complex controlling their expression in cis. The second operon includes the structural genes for 4-imidazolone-5-propionate amidohydrolase and N-formimino-l-glutamate formiminohydrolase, the last two enzymes of the pathway, and a promoter gene controlling their expression in cis. Located between these two operons is a regulatory gene, whose product presumably represses both operons in trans. The target site of catabolite repression of histidase and urocanase is the promoter of their operon, as is the case in the lac operon of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1505996337,Abstract Some mutants of bacteriophage T4 selected for their inability to replicate in the presence of hydroxyurea are defective in the degradation of host DNA. Nine such mutants which all map in the same locus (the denA locus) were all deficient in the induction of T4 endonuclease II. We conclude that this enzyme is involved in the breakdown of cellular DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1582548351,"Abstract An Escherichia coli mutant, DF2000, accumulates up to 0.06 m glucose 6-phosphate when supplied glucose. This extremely large concentration of intracellular glucose 6-phosphate does not serve to induce the active transport of this ester. However, if the medium is then supplemented with only 5 x 10-4 m glucose 6-phosphate the transport system is induced. Thus, it appears that exogenous glucose 6-phosphate acts as an inducer but the endogenously formed ester is unable to do so. The ester accumulated by glucose-treated cells was isolated and purified. It proved to be an effective inducer of glucose 6-phosphate transport. The transport system for glucose 6-phosphate allows this ester to accumulate until the intracellular concentration is 20-fold greater than the concentration in the medium. When glucose-treated cells containing 0.06 m glucose 6-phosphate are induced for transport with 5 x 10-4 m ester the initial concentration ratio is 120:1. Consequently, glucose 6-phosphate exits from the newly induced cells until a concentration ratio of 20:1 is established. Accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate by cells of the mutant given glucose results in growth stasis. This toxic effect is reduced or prevented by inducing levels of glucose 6-phosphate in the medium."

https://openalex.org/W1501503704,"Abstract 2-Deoxy-d-glucose was taken up by Escherichia coli and was recovered from cell extracts largely as a material that behaved chromatographically as 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate. With 14C-labeled deoxyglucose, it was observed that radioactivity was taken up by the cell and partially released after 1 hour. No induction of transport for glucose 6-phosphate was observed on treatment of cells with 2-deoxyglucose, in spite of the apparent accumulation of intracellular 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate. By contrast, extracellular 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate, in low concentration, was an effective inducer of the hexose phosphate transport system. 2-Deoxyglucose inhibited growth of E. coli and also caused temporary growth stasis when glycerol or succinate was the carbon source. Cells growing in the presence of gluconate or pyruvate resisted these effects of 2-deoxyglucose. When glucose-grown cells were forced to adapt to glycerol or succinate as carbon source in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose, the lag period was prolonged for as long as several days. Often this was followed by rapid growth caused by spontaneous appearance of a mutant strain. The mutant was isolated and found to be resistant to growth inhibition by deoxyglucose."

https://openalex.org/W1556459905,"Abstract This report describes the properties of a purified Escherichia coli protein synthetic system which accurately translates the initial codons of the bacteriophage f2 maturation, coat, and RNA synthetase cistrons. In order to assay cistron recognition easily and to accumulate specific intermediates in the translation of a natural message, we have restricted in vitro synthesis to the formation of the initial formyldipeptides corresponding to the three f2 cistrons. This is accomplished by preventing the initial, G factor-requiring translocation reaction through the use of small amounts of monospecific anti-G factor antibody or the antibiotic fusidic acid. The reaction requires initiation-competent ribosomes which are depleted of elongation factors by repeated washings in low ionic strength buffer. Initiation in this system is quite specific. The initial f2 coat dipeptide, N-formylmethionylalanine, is readily converted into the expected coat tripeptide, N-formylmethionylalanylserine, if translocation is permitted. In addition, synthesis of the initial f2 RNA synthetase dipeptide, N-formylmethionylserine, is specifically repressed in the presence of f2 coat protein, indicating that this purified system is sensitive to translational control."
https://openalex.org/W1580511013,"Abstract 14C- and 18O-labeled carbamyl phosphates have been used to study primary kinetic isotope effects in the reaction catalyzed by the catalytic subunit of the aspartate transcarbamylase of Escherichia coli. A novel aspect of the methodology is the use of 14C as a tracer to determine the isotope effect caused by 18O alone, without the need for analysis by mass spectrometry. At optimum concentrations of carbamyl phosphate and l-aspartate and at pH 7.8 (near the pH optimum of the enzyme), the effect of 14C at the carbonyl carbon or 18O at the anhydride oxygen of carbamyl phosphate is very small. One possible explanation, but not the only one, is that kinetic steps in which the bonds to these atoms change are not important in determining the observed rate. Such an interpretation is consistent with a rate-determining conformational change of the enzyme at the pH optimum. At pH 10, where the activity of the enzyme is low, the rate with 14C-labeled carbamyl phosphate is about 95% of the rate with the 12C compound. On the other hand, no substantial effect is seen for 18O in the anhydride position. Taken together, these observations indicate that a step in which the bonding to the carbon atom changes and the bonding to the anhydride oxygen does not change becomes important in the observed rate at pH 10. Such a process might be the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The solvent deuterium isotope effect in D2O has also been studied, at optimum concentrations of the substrates. The maximum velocity is essentially the same in D2O and in H2O. Thus, proton transfer does not seem to be involved in a ratedetermining step in the aspartate transcarbamylase reaction. The pH activity profile of the enzyme is shifted up by about 0.8 pH unit in D2O, an effect which can be accounted for approximately quantitatively by the expected change in the pKa of the amino group of l-aspartate."

https://openalex.org/W2089411926,"TESTS of teratogenicity using tissue culture, laboratory rodents or primates may not yield results applicable to man1. Different species and even strains differ in their response to teratogens. In mice, the percentage induction of cleft palate after administration of corticoids varies from strain to strain2; in rats, the effect cannot be found at all3–5. The relative influences of maternal metabolism on the one hand, and of specificity of the morphogenetic processes in the embryo on the other, remain unknown. The development of a test for the teratogenic effect of drugs depends on the solution of this problem: strict species specificity of the embryonic morphogenetic mechanisms would absolutely preclude extrapolation from laboratory animals to humans."

https://openalex.org/W1547002999,"Abstract The mechanism of inhibition of anthranilate synthase by NH2OH and CH3-NHOH was investigated. The inhibition of anthranilate synthase by NH2OH is accompanied by the formation of γ-glutamylhydroxamate. Apart from inhibiting the over-all reaction, i.e. formation of anthranilate from chorismate and glutamine, NH2OH also inhibits the glutaminase activity exhibited by anthranilate synthase in the absence of Mg++. Chorismate exerts a positive cooperative effect on the glutaminase activity. CH3-NHOH, the methyl derivative of NH2OH, is a more potent inhibitor than NH2OH but the mechanism of its inhibition is different. CH3-NHOH deprives the enzymatic reaction of chorismate by cleaving it to form an adduct with the enolpyruvyl moiety of chorismate. The evidence obtained suggests that the structure of this adduct is α-carboxy-α,N-dimethylnitrone. The formation of the adduct is dependent only on the presence of chorismate and anthranilate synthase. CH3-NHOH does not form a derivative with glutamine, nor does it inhibit the glutaminase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1486671368,"Abstract Two tRNAval species (tRNA1val and tRNA2val) were separated by fractionation of Escherichia coli tRNA on a benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column. One of these species (tRNA1val) was further purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and was approximately 70% pure. Both tRNA1val and tRNA2val preparations were free from cross-contamination. The coding properties of the tRNAval species were studied with poly r(G-U-U), poly r(G-U-A), and poly r(G-U) messengers; the cell-free amino acid-incorporating systems used in these studies were obtained from either E. coli or from rabbit reticulocytes. The results are as follows. (a) In both the systems studied, tRNA1val transferred valine in response to poly r(G-U-U), poly r(G-U-A), and poly r(G-U); the transfer in response to poly r(G-U-U) required relatively higher Mg++ concentrations. (b) tRNA2val transferred valine preferentially in response to poly r(G-U-U). However, during prolonged incubation in the E. coli system and especially at higher Mg++ concentrations, significant transfer of valine from tRNA2val was also observed in response to poly r(G-U-A) and poly r(G-U). Such transfer was very low in the reticulocyte system. (c) Addition of ethanol to the E. coli system inhibited the transfer activities of tRNA1val in response to poly r(G-U-U), poly r(G-U-A), and poly r(G-U) and of tRNA2val in response to poly r(G-U-U), while markedly stimulating the transfer activities of tRNA2val in response to poly r(G-U-A) and poly r(G-U)."
