https://openalex.org/W1978873013,"Sexual selection may explain why secondary sexual traits of males are so strongly developed in some species that they seem maladaptive. Female mate choice appears to favor the evolution of conspicuous color patterns in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from Trinidad, but color patterns vary strikingly among populations. According to most theory, correlated evolution of female mating preferences and preferred male traits within populations could promote this kind of divergence between populations. But mating preferences could also constrain the evolution of male traits. In some guppy populations, females discriminate among males based on variation in the extent of orange pigment in male color patterns, and populations differ significantly in the degree of female preferences for orange area. In a comparison of seven populations, the degree of female preference based on orange is correlated with the population average orange area. Thus male traits and female preferences appear to be evolving in parallel."
https://openalex.org/W2001086881,"Copper K-edge x-ray absorption data indicate that an axial oxygen-centered lattice instability accompanying the 93 K superconducting transition in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is of a pseudo-(anti)ferroelectric type, in that it appears to involve the softening of a double potential well into a structure in which the difference between the two copper-oxygen distances and the barrier height have both decreased. This softer structure is present only at temperatures within a fluctuation region around the transition. A similar process involving the analogous axial oxygen atom also accompanies the superconducting transition in T1Ba(2)Ca(3)Cu(4)O(11), where the superconducting transition temperature T(c) is ~120 K. The mean square relative displacement of this oxygen atom in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) is also specifically affected by a reduction in the oxygen content and by the substitution of cobalt for copper, providing further evidence for the sensitivity of the displacement to additional factors that also influence the superconductivity. On the basis of the implied coupling of this ionic motion to the superconductivity, a scenario for high-temperature superconductivity is presented in which both phonon and electronic (charge transfer) channels are synergistically involved."
https://openalex.org/W2055100856,"The Mojave block of southern California has undergone significant late Cenozoic north-south contraction. This previously unappreciated deformation may account for part of the discrepancy between neotectonic and plate-tectonic estimates of Pacific-North American plate motion, and for part of the Big Bend in the San Andreas fault. In the eastern Mojave block, contraction is superimposed on early Miocene crustal extension. In the western Mojave block, contractional folds and reverse faults have been mistaken for extensional structures. The three-dimensional complexity of the contractional structures may mean that rigid-block tectonic models of the region based primarily on paleomagnetic data are unreliable."
