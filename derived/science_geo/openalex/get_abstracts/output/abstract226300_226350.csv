https://openalex.org/W1556516863,"the objective of the present work was to provide a means for separating and indentifying phosphate esters involved in glycolysis in higher plants. Paper chromatography of phosphate esters has been employed by several workers, most notably Benson et al. (1) and Hanes and Isherwood (2). Benson's procedures were not primarily designed for identification of phosphate esters and gave low Rr values for the phosphate compounds of particular interest to us. The unidimensional methods of Hanes and Isherwood do not result in adequate resolution of the complex mixtures such as are obtained from our plant materials. 

The present procedure is based on two-dimensional chromatography with successive development in an acid and in a basic solvent. The solvents finally selected gave the best over-all resolution of the intermediates involved in plant glycolysis. Undoubtedly the resolution of certain pairs of compounds may be improved by suitable modifications. We have in addition made certain improvements in the procedure for locating the chromatographed materials."

https://openalex.org/W1595951127,"A characteristic sigmoidal dose-response curve is usually obtained for n-glutamic acid in microbiological assays. When small amounts of n-glutamine are added to the basal medium, the response to glutamic acid is markedly enhanced at the lower concentrations (1). Archibald reviewed the known physiological r8les of glutamine in plants, animals, and microorganisms (â€˜2). In an addendum to the latter review, numerous references were given to reports showing growth-stimulating effects of glutamine on various strains of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Subsequently, important progress was made in the knowledge of the mechanism of glutamine synthesis (3, 4) and of the participation of glutamine in amide exchange reactions in bacteria (5,6) j plants (7)) and animals (8)) and in transamination in animal tissues (9). However, little is known of the importance of these reactions in growth processes. The purpose of the present investigation is to extend such knowledge by a study of the influence of glutamine on the utilization for growth of the optical isomers of glutamic acid and of a-ketoglutarate by Lactobacillus arabinosus 17-5."
