https://openalex.org/W1990245077,"We present experimental scattering data at microwave frequencies on a structured metamaterial that exhibits a frequency band where the effective index of refraction (n) is negative. The material consists of a two-dimensional array of repeated unit cells of copper strips and split ring resonators on interlocking strips of standard circuit board material. By measuring the scattering angle of the transmitted beam through a prism fabricated from this material, we determine the effective n, appropriate to Snell's law. These experiments directly confirm the predictions of Maxwell's equations that n is given by the negative square root of epsilon.mu for the frequencies where both the permittivity (epsilon) and the permeability (mu) are negative. Configurations of geometrical optical designs are now possible that could not be realized by positive index materials."
https://openalex.org/W2144625075,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. In oxygenated and iron replete cells, HIF-α subunits are rapidly destroyed by a mechanism that involves ubiquitylation by the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. This process is suppressed by hypoxia and iron chelation, allowing transcriptional activation. Here we show that the interaction between human pVHL and a specific domain of the HIF-1α subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue (HIF-1α P564) by an enzyme we have termed HIF-α prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). An absolute requirement for dioxygen as a cosubstrate and iron as cofactor suggests that HIF-PH functions directly as a cellular oxygen sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2040031153,"HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to changes in oxygen availability. In the presence of oxygen, HIF is targeted for destruction by an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). We found that human pVHL binds to a short HIF-derived peptide when a conserved proline residue at the core of this peptide is hydroxylated. Because proline hydroxylation requires molecular oxygen and Fe 2+ , this protein modification may play a key role in mammalian oxygen sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2112863519,"A comparative (15)N-tracer study of nitrogen dynamics in headwater streams from biomes throughout North America demonstrates that streams exert control over nutrient exports to rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The most rapid uptake and transformation of inorganic nitrogen occurred in the smallest streams. Ammonium entering these streams was removed from the water within a few tens to hundreds of meters. Nitrate was also removed from stream water but traveled a distance 5 to 10 times as long, on average, as ammonium. Despite low ammonium concentration in stream water, nitrification rates were high, indicating that small streams are potentially important sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide. During seasons of high biological activity, the reaches of headwater streams typically export downstream less than half of the input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from their watersheds."
https://openalex.org/W2079458733,"We report the formation of a three-dimensionally ordered array of air bubbles of monodisperse pore size in a polymer film through a templating mechanism based on thermocapillary convection. Dilute solutions of a simple, coil-like polymer in a volatile solvent are cast on a glass slide in the presence of moist air flowing across the surface. Evaporative cooling and the generation of an ordered array of breath figures leads to the formation of multilayers of hexagonally packed water droplets that are preserved in the final, solid polymer film as spherical air bubbles. The dimensions of these bubbles can be controlled simply by changing the velocity of the airflow across the surface. When these three-dimensionally ordered macroporous materials have pore dimensions comparable to the wavelength of visible light, they are of interest as photonic band gaps and optical stop-bands."
https://openalex.org/W2002622198,"The protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is implicated in insulin signaling in mammals and functions in a pathway that regulates longevity and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans . We screened for long-lived mutants in nondividing yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified mutations in adenylate cyclase and SCH9 , which is homologous to Akt/PKB, that increase resistance to oxidants and extend life-span by up to threefold. Stress-resistance transcription factors Msn2/Msn4 and protein kinase Rim15 were required for this life-span extension. These results indicate that longevity is associated with increased investment in maintenance and show that highly conserved genes play similar roles in life-span regulation in S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2084623348,"It is generally perceived that biodiversity is better protected from human activities after an area is designated as a protected area. However, we found that this common perception was not true in Wolong Nature Reserve (southwestern China), which was established in 1975 as a “flagship” protected area for the world-renowned endangered giant pandas. Analyses of remote sensing data from pre- and post-establishment periods indicate that the reserve has become more fragmented and less suitable for giant panda habitation. The rate of loss of high-quality habitat after the reserve's establishment was much higher than before the reserve was created, and the fragmentation of high-quality habitat became far more severe. After the creation of the reserve, rates of habitat loss and fragmentation inside the reserve unexpectedly increased to levels that were similar to or higher than those outside the reserve, in contrast to the situation before the reserve was created."
https://openalex.org/W2039413544,"Evidence is presented that North Atlantic climate change since 1950 is linked to a progressive warming of tropical sea surface temperatures, especially over the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The ocean changes alter the pattern and magnitude of tropical rainfall and atmospheric heating, the atmospheric response to which includes the spatial structure of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The slow, tropical ocean warming has thus forced a commensurate trend toward one extreme phase of the NAO during the past half-century."
https://openalex.org/W2037632643,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important regulatory enzyme in the cardiovascular system catalyzing the production of NO from arginine. Multiple protein kinases including Akt/PKB, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activate eNOS by phosphorylating Ser-1177 in response to various stimuli. During VEGF signaling in endothelial cells, there is a transient increase in Ser-1177 phosphorylation coupled with a decrease in Thr-495 phosphorylation that reverses over 10 min. PKC signaling in endothelial cells inhibits eNOS activity by phosphorylating Thr-495 and dephosphorylating Ser-1177 whereas PKA signaling acts in reverse by increasing phosphorylation of Ser-1177 and dephosphorylation of Thr-495 to activate eNOS. Both phosphatases PP1 and PP2A are associated with eNOS. PP1 is responsible for dephosphorylation of Thr-495 based on its specificity for this site in both eNOS and the corresponding synthetic phosphopeptide whereas PP2A is responsible for dephosphorylation of Ser-1177. Treatment of endothelial cells with calyculin selectively blocks PKA-mediated dephosphorylation of Thr-495 whereas okadaic acid selectively blocks PKC-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser-1177. These results show that regulation of eNOS activity involves coordinated signaling through Ser-1177 and Thr-495 by multiple protein kinases and phosphatases."

https://openalex.org/W1983851126,"Much interest has been generated by recent reports on the discovery of circular (i.e. head-to-tail cyclized) proteins in plants. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of one of the newest such circular proteins, MCoTI-II, a novel trypsin inhibitor fromMomordica cochinchinensis, a member of the Cucurbitaceae plant family. The structure consists of a small β-sheet, several turns, and a cystine knot arrangement of the three disulfide bonds. Interestingly, the molecular topology is similar to that of the plant cyclotides (Craik, D. J., Daly, N. L., Bond, T., and Waine, C. (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 294, 1327–1336), which derive from the Rubiaceae and Violaceae plant families, have antimicrobial activities, and exemplify the cyclic cystine knot structural motif as part of their circular backbone. The sequence, biological activity, and plant family of MCoTI-II are all different from known cyclotides. However, given the structural similarity, cyclic backbone, and plant origin of MCoTI-II, we propose that MCoTI-II can be classified as a new member of the cyclotide class of proteins. The expansion of the cyclotides to include trypsin inhibitory activity and a new plant family highlights the importance and functional variability of circular proteins and the fact that they are more common than has previously been believed.

They contain ∼30 amino acids, including six highly conserved cysteine residues that form three structurally important disulfide bonds. The latter contribute to the molecules having well defined and stable three-dimensional structures (8Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Because of their well defined structures and potent biological activities, the molecules may be regarded as miniproteins. We recently proposed that the known circular proteins most likely form part of a large family of proteins that we refer to as the plant cyclotides (8Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). They contain the conserved cysteine spacing CX3-CX4-CX4–7-CX1-CX4–5-CX5–7within their circular backbone. The plant cyclotides display a diverse range of biological activities ranging from uterotonic action (kalata B1 (1Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar)), to anti-HIV activity (circulins (2Gustafson K.R. Sowder R.C., II Henderson L.E. Parsons I.C. Kashman Y.

Ransom R.W. Wood T. Sardana M. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). Although their precise role in plants has not yet been reported, it appears that they are most likely present as defense molecules. All of their biological activities in mammalian systems seem to be related in one way or another to membrane interactions, a common feature of plant defense molecules. Recently the cyclotides have also been reported to display a wide range of anti-microbial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and against certain fungi (9Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Chiu K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8913-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), further enhancing the likelihood that they are indeed plant defense molecules. The three-dimensional structures of three members of the plant cyclotide family have now been determined, including the prototypic member kalata B1, the first macrocyclic peptide for which a full three-dimensional structure was determined (1Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), circulin A (11Daly N.L. Koltay A. Gustafson K., R. Boyd M.R. Casas-Finet J.R. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and cycloviolacin O1 (8Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The structures are all highly conserved and contain a distorted triple stranded β-sheet, perhaps better described as a well defined β-hairpin with a third strand forming a β-bulge (8Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The three disulfide bonds are arranged in a so called cystine knot, in which an embedded ring in the structure formed by two disulfide bonds and their connecting backbone segments forms a ring that is penetrated by the third disulfide bond (12McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 13Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Although a seemingly unlikely structural motif, the cystine knot has now been seen in a variety of small disulfide-rich proteins from both the plant and animal kingdoms (15Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and seems to be associated with exceptionally high stability and resistance to proteolytic cleavage of molecules containing it. This is particularly so for the cyclotides, which contain a cyclic cystine knot motif (8Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Recently Hernandez et al. (16Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 30-5722Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar) reported two new macrocyclic peptides derived from Momordica cochinchinensis, a vine plant from the Cucurbitaceae plant family. The two molecules, named MCoTI-I and MCoTI-II are trypsin inhibitors and comprise 34 amino acids, a cyclized peptide backbone, and three disulfide bonds. They are homologous to a large range of open-chain trypsin inhibitors from plants (16Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 30-5722Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar), but are the first reported macrocyclic trypsin inhibitors (although note that a smaller, single disulfide-containing cyclic trypsin inhibitor was recently reported from sunflower seeds (17Luckett S. Garcia R.S. Barker J.J. Konarev A.V. Shewry P.R. Clarke A.R. Brady R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 33-525Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar)). This exciting discovery supports our view that macrocyclic peptides are much more common in plants than has previously been realized, and that many more are likely to be discovered over coming years. The sequences of the two new trypsin inhibitors, MCoTI-I and MCoTI-II, show little homology with the known plant cyclotides apart from the six-conserved cysteine residues and the macrocyclic peptide backbone, as seen by a comparison of MCoTI-II and kalata B1 in Fig.1. Note that because the molecules are cyclic the choice of numbering of residue 1 is arbitrary but throughout the text we have adopted the numbering scheme used by Hernandezet al. (16Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 30-5722Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, we adopted our earlier nomenclature for defining the six cysteine residues (labeled I-VI) and the six backbone loops that make up the sequences between the cysteine residues (loops 1–6). This numbering scheme is defined in Fig. 1. The three-dimensional structure of MCoTI-II has been modeled (16Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 30-5722Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar) based on its sequence similarity to open chain trypsin inhibitors, however, no experimental determination of the three-dimensional structure of the new macrocyclic peptides is available. We were interested to see whether this class was similar to the plant cyclotides and contained the cystine knot motif. We therefore isolated and purified a sample of MCoTI-II from M. cochinchinensis and herewith report the three-dimensional structure determined using NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. One of the motivating factors for examining structures of this class of molecules is that they are known to be highly stable and, indeed, in the case of kalata B1, are apparently orally bioavailable, a most unusual feature for peptide-based molecules. This bioavailability is demonstrated in the native medicine applications of Oldenlandia affinis, the plant from which kalata B1 is derived. Women of certain tribes in the Congo region ingest a tea made from the plant to accelerate labor (18Gran L. Sandberg F. Sletten K. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2000; 70: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The possibility of using the cyclic cystine knot macrocyclic disulfide knotted framework as a template in pharmaceutical design applications is thus very attractive (19Craik, D. J., Daly, N. L., and Nielsen, K. J. (2000) PCT Int. Patent Appl. 43 pp WO 0015654.Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure reported here provides a basis for these applications, as well as demonstrating that the new trypsin inhibitors form part of the cyclotide family. Ripe frozen fruits ofM. cochinchinensis were purchased from a Vietnamese store in Melbourne, Australia. The dormant seeds were homogenized using a blender and extracted with 20 mm sodium acetate. The fine debris was removed using a cotton plug. 40% Acetone, H2O (v/v) solution was added to the crude extract at a ratio of ∼1:1 (v/v). Acetone was reduced using a rotary evaporator after which the mixture was cooled down to 4 °C and centrifuged for 30 min. The supernatant was then passed through a filter before purification using preparative RP-HPLC1 on a Vydac C18 column. Gradients of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid were employed with a flow rate of 8 ml/min, and the eluant monitored at 230 nm. Further purification was performed using semipreparative RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column. The final purity was examined with analytical RP-HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry. Samples for 1H NMR measurements contained 1 mm peptide in either 99.99% D2O or 90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v) at pH 3.5. Spectra were recorded at 288, 293, and 298 K on a Bruker AVANCE 750 MHz spectrometer. The two-dimensional NMR experiments employed were similar to those used for the related cyclic peptide circulin A (11Daly N.L. Koltay A. Gustafson K., R. Boyd M.R. Casas-Finet J.R. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and included DQF-COSY, E-COSY, and TOCSY using a MLEV-17 spin lock sequence with a mixing time of 80 ms, and NOESY with mixing times of 150, 200, 250, and 300 ms. Slowly exchanging NH protons were detected by acquiring a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra of the fully protonated peptide immediately following dissolution in D2O.3 JαH-βHcoupling constants were measured from E-COSY spectra and3 JNH-αH coupling constants were measured from DQF-COSY spectra, transformed over the fingerprint region to 8 × 1 K. Spectra were processed according to methods given in Daly et al. (11Daly N.L. Koltay A. Gustafson K., R. Boyd M.R. Casas-Finet J.R. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts were referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 0.00 ppm and the spectra were analyzed and assigned using XEASY (20Eccles C. Guntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Peak volumes were integrated using XEASY and distance restraints obtained from CALIBA with appropriate pseudoatom corrections. Backbone dihedral restraints were inferred from3 JNH-αH coupling constants, with φ restrained to 120 ± 30° for a3 JNH-αH greater than 9 Hz, and 65 ± 30° for a3 JNH-αH less than 6 Hz. Stereospecific assignments and χ1 angle restraints were obtained for 7 residues using coupling constants measured in an ECOSY spectrum in conjunction with NOE intensities. Both proline residues were in the trans-conformation based on characteristic NOEs. The β-methylene protons of the proline residues were stereospecifically assigned based on the peak intensities in the NOESY spectra. Six hydrogen bonds were determined based on slow exchange data and preliminary structure calculations. Hydrogen bond restraints of 1.7–2.2 and 2.7–3.2 Å were used for the HNi-Oj and Ni-Ojdistances, respectively. Three-dimensional structures were initially calculated using DYANA (21Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) to check NOE restraints for violations and resolve ambiguous cross-peaks. Dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints were subsequently included in these structure calculations. The final 50 structures were generated using a torsion angle dynamics protocol (22Rice L.M.

Refinement of these structures was achieved using the conjugate gradient Powell algorithm with 1000 cycles of energy minimization (25Clore G.M. Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol.

Various peptides were isolated and their molecular weights were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Molecular weights consistent with the previously isolated macrocyclic peptides, MCoTI-I (3480) and MCoTI-II (3453), were present in addition to isomers corresponding to the β-aspartyl (3453) and succinimide (3435.5) forms of MCoTI-II (16Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 30-5722Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the previous study (16Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 30-5722Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar) the peptide bond between Asp-4 and Gly-5 was shown to be susceptible to succinimide and β-aspartyl formation and this was confirmed in the current study. Sufficient quantities of MCoTI-II and its β-aspartyl isomer were isolated to allow characterization with NMR spectroscopy. Amino acid sequencing was performed essentially using NMR spectroscopy, as the spin systems observed in TOCSY spectra and the sequential connectivities observed in NOESY spectra were completely consistent with those of the published sequence (16Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 30-5722Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Assignments were made using established techniques (29Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) and the 1H chemical shifts are supplied as supplementary material. The fingerprint regions of a TOCSY and NOESY spectra of MCoTI-II are given in Fig.2. The amide region is very well dispersed and this facilitated the assignment process. The excellent dispersion and large number of cross-peaks in the NOESY spectrum also provided the first indication of a well defined three-dimensional structure. As the β-aspartyl homologue of MCoTI-II has an identical molecular weight to the normal (α-aspartyl) isomer, NMR spectroscopy was used to discriminate between these molecules. Only one form (i.e.that eluting later on HPLC) displayed the expected sequential NOE connectivities (Fig. 3 a) between residues 4 and 5, which strongly suggests this form contains the “normal” peptide backbone. Comparison of the αH chemical shifts of both isomers (Fig. 3 b) suggests that the molecules have very similar structures, with the exception of the region surrounding residues 4 and 5. Having established the similarity of the two forms, in the current study we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the isomer of MCoTI-II with the α-Asp-4 configuration. Analysis of the NOE data, coupling constants and slow exchange amide protons (Fig. 4 a) allowed the secondary structure to be elucidated as shown in Fig. 4 b. A β-hairpin is present within residues 26–34 and there are β-sheet interactions between this hairpin and residues 13–15. An analysis of secondary shifts (i.e. the differences between observed chemical shifts and random coil values (30Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar)) supported this interpretation of the secondary structure and indicated the presence of β-strands but no helical regions. The three-dimensional structure of MCoTI-II was determined using torsion angle dynamics coded within the program XPLOR (24Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual Version 3.851. Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). The disulfide bonding pattern had not been determined chemically and so it was important to define this using NMR methods. For small disulfide-rich molecules in which the disulfide bonds form a compact core such an approach is often the only one available due to the difficulty of obtaining suitable cleavage products. Preliminary structure calculations without any disulfide bonds included as restraints were consistent with the disulfide connectivities being identical to those in linear squash trypsin inhibitors (31Holak T.A. Gondol D. Otlewski J. Wilusz T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) previously characterized and those in the cyclotide peptides (8Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) (i.e.Cys I-Cys IV, Cys II-Cys V, and Cys III-Cys VI). This conclusion was based on an analysis of distances between all possible pairs of S atoms in the preliminary structures (Supplementary Material). This clearly shows that the optimal S-S pairing corresponds to the Cys I-Cys IV, Cys II-Cys V, and Cys III-Cys VI connectivity. Subsequent structure calculations were performed with the disulfide bonds formally connected in this way and these yielded structures of low energy and excellent covalent geometry. Combined with the consistency with the homologous squash inhibitors and the plant cyclotides this was taken as strong evidence for the proposed disulfide connectivity. Hydrogen bonds were also inferred from the preliminary structure calculations in conjunction with the slow exchange data, and all were consistent with the β-sheet shown in Fig. 4 b. The family of structures for MCoTI-II is well defined over most of the molecule (residues 8–34), however, there are few medium or long range NOEs for the first seven residues and this results in a lack of definition in this region (Fig.5 a). This is reflected in the angular order parameters (Supplementary Material) that are generally >0.9 for the φ and ψ angles for residues 8–34, but vary between 0.2 and 0.9 for residues 1–7. Geometric and energetic statistics that define the 20 lowest energy structures are given as supplementary data. The RMSD's for residues 8–34 are 0.70 ± 0.17 and 1.86 ± 0.38 Å for the backbone atoms and all heavy atoms, respectively. The corresponding values are 0.45 ± 0.11 and 1.56 ± 0.22 Å for superimposition over residues 12–34. The major features of the three-dimensional structure are a β-sheet region and several turns. Analysis of the secondary structure elements in the final family of calculated structures with PROMOTIF (27Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) reveals a γ turn between residues 18 and 20 and β-turns between residues 15–18 and 22–25. A β-hairpin is formally recognized by PROMOTIF between residues 26 and 34, as expected from the preliminary secondary structure analysis, and a type I β-turn between residues 28 and 31 connects the strands. The β-sheet interactions observed between the hairpin and residues 13–15 (Fig. 4 b) are not formally recognized by PROMOTIF as part of a triple-stranded β-sheet. However, this is also found for other related small disulfide-rich peptides and is hence not surprising. In the plant cyclotides (19Craik, D. J., Daly, N. L., and Nielsen, K. J. (2000) PCT Int. Patent Appl. 43 pp WO 0015654.Google Scholar) the third β-strand is only loosely connected to the well defined β-hairpin. Thus, despite the presence of NOEs and slowly exchanging amide protons characteristic of β-sheets, the orientations of the strands in the structure calculations are such that they are not formally recognized as part of a triple-stranded β-sheet in all of the structures. The disulfide bonds of MCoTI-II form a cystine knotted structure similar to that in the plant cyclotides. In this arrangement the embedded ring formed by Cys I-Cys IV and Cys II-Cys V and their connecting backbone segments is threaded by the third disulfide bond, Cys III-Cys VI. A schematic representation of the secondary structure and the cystine knot of MCoTI-II is given in Fig. 5 b. Since the peptide backbone of MCoTI-II is cyclic, a convenient way to describe the structural features is in terms of the six segments, or loops, that are flanked by pairs of successive Cys residues. Fig.6 shows the backbone considered in this way and highlights several features of the derived structures, including the location of the three β-strands and the various turns. The disulfide bond connectivity is also shown. Loop 1, between Cys I and Cys II contains a highly positively charged (+3) hexapeptide segment which, based on homology with corresponding acyclic trypsin inhibitors, comprises the putative active site residues Lys/Ile. Loop 2 contains two positive and two negative charges and includes a β-turn between residues 15–18 and a γ turn between residues 18 and 20. Loop 3 contains no charged residues but incorporates a β-turn within its PGA sequence. Loop 4 contains a single amino acid (I) and is incorporated within one of the β-strands that make up the β-hairpin. It is followed by loop 5, which contains a type I β-turn and leads into loop 6, which incorporates the second strand of the β-hairpin. In the final folded structures the disulfide bonds “pinch” the circular backbone and loops 2 and 5 are drawn very close to one another. Loop 6 protrudes from the structure more than any of the other loops and is also the most disordered. Fig. 5 shows that individual structures vary widely in their placement of this loop relative to the core of the molecule. This may reflect intrinsic flexibility or simply a lack of NOEs defining this region. Loop 6 contains a high Gly content and hence the number of possible protons, and hence NOEs, is reduced relative to larger amino acids. To assess whether it was lack of NOEs, or flexibility that results in the disorder for loop 6, the chemical shift separation of the β-protons of various amino acid side chains was examined. In general, rigid conformations are associated with widely separated β-proton shifts while, in contrast, degenerate β-proton shifts can be indicative of conformational averaging. For example, in an analysis of acyclic permutants of kalata B1, those permutants with decreased stability, based on amide exchange rates, displayed a decreased shift dispersion for cysteine β-protons (32Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19068-19075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Analysis of the β-proton chemical shift separations for the six cysteine residues of MCoTI-II supports the proposal of flexibility in loop 6. The disulfide bond connecting residues 8 to 25 is the closest disulfide bond to the disordered region and the β-protons are essentially degenerate for both of these residues, suggesting conformational averaging in this region of the molecule. By contrast, the β-shifts for the remaining four cysteine residues are separated by 0.17 to 0.34 ppm and correspond to well defined regions of the molecule. The flexibility i"

After 3 years of CO2 fumigation, trees were twice as likely to be reproductively mature and produced three times as many cones and seeds as trees at ambient CO2 concentration. A disproportionate carbon allocation to reproduction under CO2 enrichment results in trees reaching maturity sooner and at a smaller size. This reproductive response to future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to change loblolly dispersal and recruitment patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1998909889,"Endostatin is a potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor that induces regression of tumors in mice. Neither an extracellular receptor for endostatin nor intracellular signals that result in the regression of tumor vascular beds have been identified. We demonstrate that endostatin, but not angiostatin, at comparable concentrations to those used in in vivo animal trials, rapidly down-regulates many genes in exponentially growing endothelial cells. These include immediate early response genes, cell cycle-related genes, and genes regulating apoptosis inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, focal adhesion kinase, G-protein-coupled receptors mediating endothelial growth, a mitogenic factor, adhesion molecules, and cell structure components. Suppression of both apoptosis inhibitors and cell proliferation genes may have a limited contribution to the antiangiogenesis process because endostatin induces neither apoptosis nor growth inhibition, unless studied under reduced serum conditions. In contrast, the antimigratory effect of endostatin was rapid and potent even under serum-supplemented conditions. Endostatin caused gene suppression and migration arrest exclusively in endothelial cells, most profoundly in microvascular endothelial cells. The c-myc null fibroblasts obtained by targeted homologous recombination showed an attenuated migration rate compared with isogenic parental cells, whereas the introduction of the c-myc gene into endothelial cells abrogated the antimigratory effect of endostatin. Inhibition of E-box-driven transcription by overexpressing max or mad suppressed endothelial migration. Thus, rapid down-regulation of genes by endostatin neither restores proliferating endothelial cells to their resting states nor induces apoptosis; rather, it potently inhibits endothelial cell migration partly via suppression of c-myc expression."

Six months before the eruption, an increase in CO2 flux was detected on the summit caldera, from 120 (September 1998) to 340 metric tons per day (September 1999), followed by a sudden decrease to 39 metric tons per day in June 2000, 3 months after the eruption. The change in CO2 flux and seismic observations suggests that before the eruption, advective processes controlled gas migration toward the surface. The decrease in flux after the eruption at the summit caldera could be due to a rapid release of CO2 during the eruption from ascending dacitic dikes spreading away from the magma chamber beneath the caldera."

It has also emerged as a proinflammatory mediator that induces the expression of tissue factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in mononuclear phagocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In addition, EMAP II mRNA is most abundant at sites of tissue undergoing apoptosis in mouse embryo (3Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C.A. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The tissue expressing a high level of EMAP II mRNA also accumulates macrophages, suggesting that EMAP II is a chemoattractant recruiting macrophages into dead cells. EMAP II was initially purified from the culture medium of murine methylcholanthrene A-induced fibrosarcoma cells based on its capacity to induce activation of tissue factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (1Kao J. Ryan J. Brett J. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.-G. Godman G. Familletti P. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. Stern D. Clauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20239-20247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since EMAP II is identical to the COOH-terminal domain of the p43 subunit of the mammalian multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) complex (4Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), p43 has been suggested to be a pro-EMAP II. It is cleaved at the amino acid motif ASTD by caspase-7 activated in apoptotic cells (5Behrensdorf H.A. van de Craen M. Knies U.E. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), producing EMAP II that is sequentially released from the cells. p43 is a noncatalytic subunit of the mammalian multi-ARS complex (6Ibba M. Soll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Since p43 occupies a central position within the complex in the electron microscopic images of immunocomplexes (7Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it could be a scaffolding protein forming the multi-ARS complex. It has been demonstrated that p43 interacts with the NH2-terminal extension of human cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase through its NH2-terminal domain (8Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J.

Although its COOH-terminal domain is equivalent to EMAP II, this domain contains a tRNA binding motif (9Kim Y. Shin J. Li R. Cheong C. Kim K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27062-27068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to deliver tRNAs to the bound arginyl-tRNA synthetase (8Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although p43 is universally expressed (10Tas M.P.R. Murray J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), its expression level is varied temporally and spatially in developing mouse (11Schwarz M. Lee M. Zhang F. Zhao J. Jin Y. Smith S. Bhuva J. Stern D. Warburton D. Starnes V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L365-L375PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, there is a significant surge in the expression of p43 within the lungs on postnatal days 8–16 of mouse. p43 is produced throughout the lung, with predominance in the myoepithelium that lines the bronchioles. In addition, p43 is highly expressed in microglial cells within lesions of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, neuritis, and uveitis (12Schluesener H.J. Seid K. Zhao Y. Meyermann R. Glia. 1997; 20: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The high expression level of p43 in specific developmental stages and tissues suggests that p43 could have unexpected functions in angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis (13Berger A.C. Tang G. Alexander H.R. Libutti S.K. J. Immunother. 2000; 23: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mature EMAP II is generated and secreted during late apoptosis (3Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A.

Since the full-length p43 is constitutively secreted from various cells (3Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C.A. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar), we focus on the cytokine function of p43. Here, we show that p43 itself was selectively secreted from cells, even in the absence of an apoptosis signal, and had a cytokine function, inducing MIP-1α and MCP-1 as well as TNF and IL-8 from THP-1 cells. Interestingly, p43 was highly expressed by the foam cells of atherosclerosis lesions, implying that p43 could be a major contributor of inflammation in atherosclerosis development. Human monocyte THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. 32D mouse myeloid precursor cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and interleukin-3 (1 ng/ml). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Preparation of anti-p43 antibody was described previously (8Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S.

For the preparation of anti-p18 antibody, the cDNAs encoding the full length of human p18 was amplified by PCR. The resulting PCR product was cloned into a PET28a vector (Novagen) using EcoRI and SalI sites to express as a His-tagged fusion protein. p18 was expressed as an insoluble protein that was used for preparing monoclonal mouse anti-p18 antibody that was made by Boditech. Anti-Myc and -tubulin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz and Sigma, respectively. The constructs of p43-(1–312), p43-(1–147), and p43-(148–312) were described previously (8Park S.G. Jung K.H.

To construct p43-(1–108), pET28a (Novagen) containing the full-length p43 was digested with Asp718 andSalI, and the large fragment was treated with the Klenow fragment to fill up the DNA ends and re-ligated. The DNA fragments coding for p43-(91–256), p43-(91–312), p43-(218–312), and p43-(257–312) regions were synthesized by PCR with specific primer sets (the primer sequences will be available upon request). The specific PCR products were digested with EcoRI andXhoI and ligated into pET28a cut with the same enzymes. Each of the full-length p43 and p43-deleted constructs was expressed as His-tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography and Mono Q or S ion-exchange chromatography as described previously (8Park S.G.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell supernatant was collected and concentrated by using Vivaspin (VivaScience).

The lysate proteins and cell supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting. THP-1 cells treated with p43 were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 12 mmβ-glycerophosphate). The proteins in the lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Antigens were visualized by sequential treatment with specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit. The cell lysates prepared in JNK lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were incubated with anti-JNK antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, and protein G-agarose was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for additional 1 h. The immunocomplex was precipitated and washed four times with the lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The washed immunocomplexes were incubated in the same buffer containing GST-c-Jun (5 μg each), 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The proteins in the reaction were then separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The phosphorylated c-Jun was determined by autoradiography of the dried blot. THP-1 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in 24-well tissue culture plates in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in a total volume of 0.5 ml/well in duplicate. Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then incubated with p43 (100 nm). The supernatants were harvested 2 h after stimulation and assayed for TNF, IL-8, MIP-1, and MCP-1 using their corresponding ELISA kits (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Atlas Human cDNA Expression Array 1.2 (CLONTECH) was used for cDNA array analysis. Total and polyadenylated RNAs were prepared from the control or p43-treated THP-1 cells by the Atlas Pure Total RNA Labeling System (CLONTECH) as recommended by the manufacturer. One μg of polyadenylated RNA isolated from the control or p43-treated cells was converted to radioactive cDNA by reverse transcription in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The radioactively labeled cDNA was then denatured and hybridized to the cDNA expression arrays as recommended by the manufacturer. The radioactivity on the membranes was quantified by a phosphoimager. We calculated the change in gene expression after the p43 treatment as the percentage of the untreated cells, using three of the internal controls recommended by the manufacturer for normalization to ensure the comparability of the control and p43-treated samples. For immunohistochemical analysis, carotid endoarterectomy specimens were obtained from 13 patients, aged from 63 to 81, who underwent the surgery at Samsung Seoul Hospital. Atherosclerotic plaque specimens were washed with saline and embedded in optimal cutting temperature to make frozen sections. Standard 5-mm sections were stained using the Labeled Streptavidin Biotin kit (Dako) according to the manual provided by the manufacturer. Monoclonal antibodies to CD68 (KP1), and SMC α-actin (1A4) were purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). For the detection of p43, rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant p43 was used in 1 ng/ml concentration. Since EMAP II was secreted during late apoptosis, it may not play an active role in recruiting and activating monocytes and macrophages to scavenge apoptotic corps in the early stage of apoptosis. Although methylcholanthrene A fibrosarcoma cells secrete 40- and 23-kDa (EMAP II) cytokines that stimulate the generation of tissue factor in HUVECs (1Kao J. Ryan J. Brett J. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.-G. Godman G. Familletti P. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. Stern D. Clauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20239-20247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only 23-kDa (EMAP II) protein has been investigated as a cytokine. In addition, the full-length p43 (precursor of EMAP II) is constitutively secreted in methylcholanthrene fibrosarcoma cells, 32D myeloid precursor cells, and human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells even in the absence of apoptotic stimulus (3Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C.A. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Barnett G. Jakobsen A.M. Tas M. Rice K. Carmichael J. Murray J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). All of these previous data suggest that p43 itself could function as a cytokine. To explore the possibility of p43 as a cytokine, we first investigated the secretion pattern of p43 and EMAP II from normal or apoptotic cells. We incubated 32D myeloid precursor cells with serum-free medium for the indicated times in the presence or absence of IL-3. Since IL-3 withdrawal makes the cells undergo apoptosis within 12 h, we could test the secretion of p43 and EMAP II stimulated by apoptosis. Immunoblotting with anti-p43 antibody revealed that p43 was secreted from the cells as early as 30 min after serum starvation even in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 1 A). The p43 secretion was very specific, because there was no tubulin (a cytoplasmic protein) and p18 (another noncatalytic component of multi-ARS complex) from the medium at early time points of IL-3 withdrawal and at any time points in the presence of IL-3. Meanwhile, EMAP II appeared from the cell supernatant only when cells were exposed to apoptosis by IL-3 withdrawal. It was detected in the supernatant at the later time points when p18 and tubulin were also found in the medium (Fig. 1 A), implying that EMAP II secretion results from the cellular breakdown by apoptosis. To confirm these data, we investigated whether excess p43 is specifically secreted from 293 cells that do not normally release p43 and EMAP II (data not shown). We transiently overexpressed the Myc-tagged full-length (p43-F), NH2-terminal domain (p43-N) or the EMAP II domain of p43 (EMAP II) (Fig. 1 B) in 293 cells. Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 1, 3, or 6 h. Proteins from the cell supernatant were collected, concentrated, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, increasing amount of p43-F and -N appeared in the medium, while EMAP II was barely detected even though p43-F, p43-N, and EMAP II are equally overexpressed (left panel indicated as WCL). Since the Myc-tagged p43-F was targeted to the multi-ARS complex (data not shown), it is clearly functional as endogenous p43. From these data, we conclude that p43-F and -N could be secreted from cells in the absence of apoptosis signal if their expression is induced. To determine which regions of p43 are involved in its cytokine function, several deletion derivatives of p43 were constructed. The mutant p43 constructs used in this study are shown schematically in Fig.2 A. The mutant proteins were purified as histidine-tagged fusion proteins using a bacterial expression system, and the purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B). Endotoxin from the purified proteins was removed by using a polymyxin affinity column. To investigate TNF and IL-8 production by p43 mutant proteins, the purified recombinant proteins were added to THP-1 cells. Two hours after incubation, we determined TNF and IL-8 production by ELISA using their specific antibodies. Since p43-(1–312), p43-(1–146), p43-(1–108), and p43-(92–256) showed higher cytokine activity than p43-(147–312) called EMAP II, the NH2-terminal domain of p43, especially p43-(92–146), might be a stronger cytokine domain than EMAP II. Meanwhile, p43-(218–312) and p43-(257–312) did not activate TNF and IL-8 production. The results corresponded with previous work (16Kao J. Fan Y.-G. Haehnel I. Brett J. Greenberg S. Clauss M. Kayton M. Houck K. Kisiel W. Seljelid R. Burnier J. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-9774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the EMAP II-derived COOH-terminal domain is not necessary for cytokine activity. Activation of MAPKs and NFκB are essential steps for the up-regulation of many proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes, implying that p43 could regulate the activation of some signal transduction pathways. To address this question, we tested whether p43 affects the activities of the major signaling molecules such as MAPKs and NFκB. Among MAPKs, the activation of ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK was determined by their phosphorylation, and the activity of JNK was determined by the phosphorylation of its substrate, c-Jun. The three tested MAPKs were all activated by p43 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Although three different MAPKs showed similar time courses of activation by p43, they showed different sensitivities to the concentration of p43. The activation of ERK1/2 was observed from 1 nm p43, while p38 MAPK and JNK were activated at higher concentrations of p43 (Fig. 3), suggesting that these MAPKs are activated by different mechanisms. We then tested whether NFκB is also activated by p43. The activity of NFκB was determined by degradation of IκB that suppresses NFκB (17Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). The level of IκB was decreased by the treatment of p43 in a time-dependent manner and also from 1 nm p43 (Fig. 3), suggesting that p43 would also activate NFκB. The activation of NFκB by p43 was also confirmed by electrophoresis mobility shift assay with an oligonucleotide containing a NFκB binding site (data not shown). Since the NH2-terminal peptide of p43 and EMAP II showed the same pattern with p43 in the activation of the tested signaling molecules (data not shown), p43 and EMAP II might share the receptor for activating the signaling pathways. Since p43 activates three different MAPKs and NF-κB, it is tempting to speculate that p43 could activate various genes including those for inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To characterize changes in mRNA expression of the human monocyte in response to p43, THP1 cells were treated with p43, and total mRNA was extracted at various time points after the treatment. Radiolabeled cDNA was prepared from mRNA by reverse transcription and hybridized to the membrane that carries nonoverlapping arrays of cDNAs for a range of known human genes. The amounts of radioactive probes specifically bound to the cDNA array were analyzed by densitometry, and relative increases in mRNA levels in the p43-treated cells were calculated. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with the full-length p43 resulted in activation of over 37 genes, out of 1,176 genes tested. As shown in theupper right panel of Fig. 4, TNF is greatly up-regulated in p43-treated cells (30-fold increase over the control), consistent with the result of ELISA (Fig. 2 C). Even though we used the cDNA array containing 1,176 genes involving in oncogenesis, signal transduction, cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription factors, receptors, cytokines, and chemokines, we found that only 37 genes (mostly cytokine, chemokine, and receptor genes) were highly activated (more than 3-fold increase over control) (Fig.5), indicating that p43 induces the expression of specific cytokine, chemokine, and receptor genes.Figure 5Chemokines are highly induced in p43-treated THP-1 cells. Cells were treated with 100 nm p43 for 0, 0.5, 2, or 6 h, and up-regulated genes were analyzed by cDNA array. Each gene was quantified by a phosphoimager and normalized based on three housekeeping genes. The genes showing more than 3-fold increase over the control at any time point are listed here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cytokine and chemokine genes were the most highly induced genes by p43 stimulation (Fig. 4, lower right panel, and Fig. 5). For example, TNF, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IL-1β, IL-8, MIP-2α, and MIP-1β were very strongly activated 6 h after the p43 treatment (more than 7-fold increase over the control). Since p43 began to activate these genes as early as 30 min after the treatment, these molecules would be directly induced by p43. Some receptor genes such as IL-7R, ErbB-3R, ephrin receptor, NMBR, CD40L receptor, PGE receptor, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 were moderately induced by p43 (3–9-fold increase). The induction of these receptor mRNAs might render the cells sensitive to their specific ligands. The expression of mRNAs for transcription factors HOXB7, ERF1, IRF-7, c-Jun, and c-Myc are also activated. Since c-Jun and c-Myc mRNA induction requires JNK activation, JNK activation by p43 (Fig.3) could explain why c-Jun and c-Myc induction occurs as early as 30 min after the p43 treatment. Moreover, the mRNA level of the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, was increased after the p43 treatment (11-fold increase at the time point of 2 h). This result is consistent with the previous report on the cell-cell adhesion induced by p43 (2Kao J. Houck K. Fan Y. Haehnel I. Libutti S.K. Kayton M.L. Grikscheit T. Chabot J. Nowygrod R. Greenberg S. Kuang W.-J. Leung D.W. Hayward J.R. Kisiel W. Heath M. Brett J. Stern D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25106-25119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the results obtained with the cDNA array, we used ELISA to quantify the amounts of MCP-1 and MIP-1α. THP-1 cells were treated with p43 (100 nm) for 3 h, and the concentration of MCP-1 and MIP-1α was measured from cellular supernatant. As shown in Fig. 6, p43 induced secretion of MCP-1 and MIP-1α, consistent with the cDNA array data (Figs. 4 and5). The above data raise the intriguing possibility that p43 could be involved in the process of inflammation, since cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, MCP-1, MIP-1α, IL-1β, and IL-8 are found in inflammation areas. A pivotal question, then, is whether p43 is actually expressed in such lesions. We thus examined the level of p43 protein in atherosclerotic lesions by immunohistochemistry using sections of aorta from a human patient carrying atherosclerosis. Expression of p43 was mainly restricted to regions rich in foam cells that were detected by a foam cell-specific marker, CD68 (Fig.7). Meanwhile, a basal level of p43 expression was detected in smooth muscle cells that were detected by a smooth muscle-specific marker α-actin. Since the p43 antibody for the immunostaining is a polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length p43 (8Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and p43 may be cleaved into the fragments including EMAP II, it is hard to conclude that the signals detected by immunostaining indeed represent the full-length p43. To address the issue, we prepared protein extracts from a fibrous plaque containing dominant smooth muscle cells, and an atheromatous plaque containing foam cells, and then analyzed the extracts by immunoblotting with anti-p43 antibody. As expected, the atheromatous plaque showed a high level of human p43 compared with a fibrous plaque. In addition, there was only one band (34 kDa) that represents a human p43 protein. The apparent molecular mass of human p43 was previously determined to be 34 kDa (15Barnett G. Jakobsen A.M. Tas M. Rice K. Carmichael J. Murray J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these data, we concluded that immunostaining signal in Fig. 7 A represents the full length of p43. Thus, these data strongly support the involvement of p43 in atherosclerosis by inducing cytokines and chemokines that are key molecules in atherosclerosis development. Without phagocyte clearance of apoptotic cells, cellular proteins released from dying cells are harmful to surrounding cells. Thus, the dying cells should be removed rapidly. EMAP II has been shown to be an active cytokine that recruits monocytes and macrophages in the apoptosis areas for scavenging apoptotic corps. However, our data demonstrated that EMAP II could not be a good candidate for mediating the scavenger, since EMAP II was released with other cellular proteins after cells were completely destroyed by apoptosis (Fig.1 A). Instead of EMAP II, we found that p43 (a precursor of EMAP II) is selectively secreted as early as 30 min after serum starvation, implying that p43 itself would work as an active cytokine. The expression level of p43 is spatially and temporally changed. For instance, the mRNA and protein level of p43 decrease in the developing lungs of the fetal mouse, while they remain low throughout postnatal life with the exception of a surge at postnatal days 8–16 (11Schwarz M. Lee M. Zhang F. Zhao J. Jin Y. Smith S. Bhuva J. Stern D. Warburton D. Starnes V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L365-L375PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p43 mRNA and protein are localized to the epithelium, with its highest expression in neurons, blood vessels, and at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction (18Zhang F. Schwarz M.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p43 is up-regulated in the differentiation stage of hematopoietic stem cells (19Phillips R.L. Ernst R.E. Brunk B. Ivanova N. Mahan M.A. Deanehan J.K. Moore K.A. Overton G.C. Lemischka I.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1635-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). When p43 was highly expressed in 293 cells by transient transfection, it was secreted from the cells that did not release p43 in normal condition (Fig. 1 B). This implies that p43 itself could be secreted from cells in which p43 is up-regulated. It would be interesting to understand the signal that induces the expression of p43. Although p43 was found to be released from cells previously, its ability to function as a proinflammatory cytokine has been neglected. Deletion mapping of EMAP II identified that the NH2-terminal heptamer peptide is responsible for the cytokine activity (16Kao J. Fan Y.-G. Haehnel I. Brett J. Greenberg S. Clauss M. Kayton M. Houck K. Kisiel W. Seljelid R. Burnier J. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-9774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the data in the present work shows that the full-length and NH2-terminal peptide of p43 are more active in the production of proinflammatory cytokines than EMAP II (Fig. 2). Thus, the suggested peptide of EMAP II does not seem to be the only portion responsible for the cytokine activity. The full-length p43 has one known function helping aminoacylation of the bound ARSs within cell and another function as a cytokine. There are several other proteins with different functions depending on their cellular localization (20Jeffery C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). For example, phosphoglucose isomerase, thymidine phosphorylase, and Hsp70 function as metabolic enzymes or chaperoning protein within cells, whereas they work as cytokines when secreted from cells (20Jeffery C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 21Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Like these proteins, p43 lacks a signal peptide necessary for membrane translocation, and the molecules may be secreted without any processing. Based on the results of this work, the proteolytic cleavage of p43 does not appear to be the prerequisite to generate an active cytokine. This is in contrast to the case of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (22Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This enzyme is released from apoptotic cells and split into two distinct cytokines with elastase. However, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase itself did not show the cytokine activities, indicating that the proteolysis is required to activate each cytokine. If the proteolysis of p43 is not required to activate or release EMAP II, its physiological reason remains unclear. We have shown previously that the intact p43 is required for its stimulatory effect on the bound arginyl-tRNA synthetase (8Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the cleavage of p43 with caspase-7 upon apoptosis would disrupt its stimulatory role in protein synthesis, which may further accelerate cell death. Based on these data, the functional reason for the p43 cleavage does not appear to activate cytokine but to break protein synthesis machinery in apoptotic cells. This notion was also mentioned in the release of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from apoptosis cells (22Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The leakage of an enzyme essential for protein synthesis would inhibit protein synthesis and thus further accelerate apoptosis. Our cDNA array data demonstrate that p43 up-regulates the chemokines that are involved in the main proinflammatory response. The most strongly induced chemokines are MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) that belong to the CC chemokine subfamily. They exhibit chemotactic activity primarily for monocytes and T cells and activate T cells and macrophages (23Janeway C.A. Travers P. Walport M. Capra J.D. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 4th Ed. Current Biology Publications, London, UK1999: 380-385Google Scholar, 24Reape T.J. Groot P.H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 147: 213-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Other chemokines induced by p43 are IL-8 and MIP-2α that belong to the CXC chemokine subfamily and are chemotactic primarily for neutrophils and stimulate neutrophil degranulation, adhesion, and microbicidal activity (23Janeway C.A. Travers P. Walport M. Capra J.D. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 4th Ed. Current Biology Publications, London, UK1999: 380-385Google Scholar, 24Reape T.J. Groot P.H.

These chemokines are also induced by LPS, but the mRNA expression profile by p43 is quite different from that by LPS or INFγ (25Wang Z.M. Liu C. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20260-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Scott M.G. Rosenberger C.M. Gold M.R. Finlay B.B. Hancock R.E. J.

A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). For example, DB-1, HLA-1, MRP-14, TMSb-10, and IL-6 are highly up-regulated by LPS or INFγ (25Wang Z.M. Liu C. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20260-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but not by p43, suggesting that p43 is a specific proinflammatory cytokine that up-regulates a unique set of genes. It is tempting to speculate that p43 itself could be an initiator for the inflammation process, since p43 induces proinflammatory chemokines that are involved in a number of inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (28Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar, 29de Winther M.P. Hofker M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Steinman L.

Med. 2000; 192: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Previous works showed that p43 is highly expressed in autoimmune inflammatory regions such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis, and uveitis (12Schluesener H.J. Seid K. Zhao Y. Meyermann R. Glia. 1997; 20: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Schluesener H.J. Seid K. Meyermann R. Acta Neuropathol. ( Berl. ). 1999; 97: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We also observed that p43 was present in high concentration in the foam cells of human atherosclerosis lesions (Fig. 6), suggesting that p43 is also involved in the inflammatory response during atherosclerosis procedure. Therefore, it should be noted that p43 induces MCP-1 and MIP-1α as well as TNF, myeloperoxidase, and tissue factor that are major factors inducing atherosclerosis (28Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar, 29de Winther M.P. Hofker M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further investigation on the role of p43 in the proinflammatory response would help to understand the pathological process leading to these inflammation-related diseases. We thank Dr. Guy A.

Although cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and its receptor, GRP-R, are not normally expressed by the epithelial cells lining the human colon, the levels of all three proteins are aberrantly overexpressed in premalignant adenomatous polyps and colorectal carcinomas of humans.

Considerable experimental data have accumulated indicating an important role for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)1 in colorectal carcinogenesis.

Several large epidemiological studies have shown that mortality from colorectal cancers decreases (40–50%) in persons who regularly take aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (3Moghimzadeh E. Ekman R. Hakanson R. Yanaihara N. Sundler F. Neuroscience. 1983; 10: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which inhibit COX activity. Additionally, experiments with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene-deficient mice (Min mice) revealed that inhibition of COX activity with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs resulted in a reduction in the number and multiplicity of spontaneously formed tumors (4Jacoby R.F.

Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Although mounting evidence supports an important role for COX-2 in colorectal carcinogenesis, the molecular mechanisms leading to COX-2 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells are not completely understood. Like COX-2, the mammalian homologue of bombesin (BBS), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its cognate G-protein-coupled receptor, GRP receptor (GRP-R), are aberrantly overexpressed in premalignant adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancers. Prestonet al. (8Preston S.R. Miller G.V. Primrose J.N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1996; 23: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed that 24% of colorectal cancers, but not the adjacent nonmalignant mucosa, exhibited high affinity binding sites for GRP. Immunohistological analysis of archival tissue specimens from colonic polyps and colon cancers revealed that 42% (n= 5) of high grade dysplastic polyps and 62% (n = 50) of colon cancers stained positively for both GRP and GRP-R protein (9Carroll R.E. Matkowskyj K.A. Chakrabarti S. McDonald T.J. Benya R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G655-G665PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that 42% (n = 5) of freshly resected adenomatous polyps and 67% (n = 12) of colorectal cancers contain cytokeratin-positive cells that exhibit an increase in the concentration of free intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) in response to BBS stimulation, indicating the presence of functional BBS receptor. 2M. R. Hellmich and C. M. Townsend, Jr., unpublished data. Although the precise role of BBS-like peptides and GRP-R in colorectal carcinogenesis has not been defined, recent observations that aspirin inhibits BBS-induced DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (10Castano E. Dalmau M. Marti M. Berrocal F. Bartrons R. Gil J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 366-372PubMed Google Scholar) and GRP stimulates expression of COX-2 in the same cell line (11Hecht J.R. Duque J. Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. Walsh J.H. Slice L.W. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have raised the possibility that GRP-R-mediated signaling pathways may contribute to the up-regulation of COX-2 expression during colorectal carcinogenesis. The aims of our study were to examine whether the expression of GRP-R leads to BBS-dependent up-regulation of COX-2 in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line, RIE-1, and if so, to determine the molecular signaling pathways linking GRP-R to the regulation of COX-2 expression. We selected the RIE-1 cell line for these studies for several reasons. 1) It is a nontumorigenic intestinal epithelial cell line, which, like the normal human colonic epithelium, does not express endogenous GRP-R or other BBS receptor subtypes. 2) Unlike many epithelioid cell lines derived from cancer cells, the endogenous level of COX-2 expression, under normal culture conditions, is very low. 3) Constitutive overexpression of COX-2 in RIE-1 cells increases their tumorigenic potential (12Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). 4) The aberrant overexpression of GRP-R and COX-2 in premalignant adenomatous polyps suggests that these proteins may play a role in the early stages of colon carcinogenesis. To evaluate the potential role of GRP-R-mediated signaling pathways in COX-2 gene expression, we developed RIE-1 cell lines expressing recombinant GRP-R called RIE/GRPR. We found that the GRP-R agonist, BBS, markedly stimulates COX-2 mRNA and protein expression as well as the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from these cells. The increase in COX-2 expression is largely due to BBS-enhanced transcription of the COX-2 gene and is dependent on an agonist-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i, activation of MAP kinase-dependent pathways, and the increased expression and activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. These findings partially identify the signaling pathways coupling GRP-R to the up-regulation of COX-2 expression and identify the regulation of COX-2 gene expression as a potential mechanism by which aberrantly expressed GRP-R plays a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. The mouse GRP-R expression vector was a gift from Dr. James F. Battey (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The mouse COX-2 promoter constructs, TIS10L-luc, TIS10–80-luc, and TIS10–40-luc, as well as the mouse prostaglandin synthase-2 (COX-2) cDNA probe were kindly provided by Dr. Harvey R. Herschman (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). The reporter constructs Gal4-Elk-(307–428), Gal-4-Sap-(268–431), and Gal4-luc were gifts from Dr. Ralf Janknecht (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). c-fos-luc and 3XTRE-luc were provided by Dr. Johannes L. Bos (University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and Dr. Joan Massagué (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, NY), respectively. Mouse c-Fos and c-Jun cDNA probes were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The anti-COX-2 antibodies were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The anti-active ERK-1 and -2 antibody (pTEpY) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-phospho-p38MAPK, anti-phospho-ELK-1, and antiphospho-ATF-2 antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). RIE-1 cells were a gift from Dr. Kenneth D. Brown (Cambridge Research Station, Babraham, Cambridge, UK). RIE-1 cells were transfected with mouse GRP receptor using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. G418-resistant colonies were selected as described previously (13Guo Y.S. Jin G.F. Houston C.W. Thompson J.C. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The number of binding sites (Bmax) and their binding affinities (Kd) were determined using [125I]BBS binding assays as described (14Guo Y.S. Jin G.F. Townsend Jr., C.M. Zhang T. Sheng H.M. Beauchamp R.D. Thompson J.C. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1995; 181: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were detected using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2/AM as previously described (15Hellmich M.R. Ives K.L. Udupi V. Soloff M.S. Greeley Jr., G.H. Christensen B.N. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23901-23909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and Geneticin (G418; 400 μg/ml; Life Technologies). Total cellular RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA samples (30 μg/lane) were separated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto Nytran plus filters (Schleicher and Shuell). The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random primer extension. Specific hybridization was visualized by autoradiography. To ensure RNA integrity and to confirm equal loading between lanes, the filters were stripped and rehybridized with a probe for 18 S rRNA. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (13Guo Y.S. Jin G.F. Houston C.W. Thompson J.C. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed for 30 min in a solution consisting of 1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cellular proteins were denatured by heating, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the indicated antibodies and then with a peroxide-coupled second antibody (Promega). Proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RIE/GRPR cells were plated in 24-well plates. Thirty-six hours later, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. The cells were then incubated with or without BBS for the indicated times. Media were collected from each well and analyzed for PGE2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). RIE/GRPR cells were cultured in Lab-TekII chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Prior to immunostaining with anti-COX-2 antiserum, the cells were incubated with or without BBS (100 nm) for 6 h at 37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 min), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (10 min), and incubated in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 20 min). After incubating the cells with anti-COX-2 antiserum (1:400) for 90 min at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (1:2000, 30 min). Specific immunostaining was visualized with a Nikon Eclipse fluorescence microscope. RIE/GRPR cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. After overnight adhesion, cells were transfected with 2 μg of promoter/luciferase reporter gene DNA using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prior to assaying for luciferase activity, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum (24 h) and treated with BBS for 6 h. Luciferase activity in 20 μl of cell extract was assayed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison WI). Transfection efficiency was assessed using a β-galactosidase expression plasmid as described previously (17Evers B.M. Wang X. Zhou Z. Townsend Jr., C.M. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3870-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (18Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) whose sequence corresponded to the AP-1 binding site consensus sequence was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction mixtures contained 50,000 cpm of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide, 20 μg of nuclear protein extract, and 1.0 μg of poly(dL·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 20 μl. Reaction mixtures were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 200 V for 2 h. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography (17Evers B.M. Wang X. Zhou Z. Townsend Jr., C.M. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3870-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated on at least two separate occasions. Results from Northern and Western blots were quantified by densitometry. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between means were compared using the analysis of variance test and were considered significantly different at the level of p < 0.05. The RIE-1 cell line, isolated originally from the rat small intestine, exhibits epithelioid morphology and the normal rat diploid number of chromosomes, and the cells do not form colonies in soft agar (19Blay J. Brown K.D. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1984; 8: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These properties have made them one of the preferred cell models for examining nontumorigenic intestinal epithelial cell physiology and biochemistry in vitro. Constitutive overexpression of recombinant COX-2 in RIE-1 cells is associated with altered cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, decreased expression of E-cadherin, increased expression of the antiapoptotic gene product, BCL-2, and decreased apoptosis (12Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). To determine whether BBS and GRP-R could regulate endogenous COX-2 expression in RIE-1 cells, cells were stably transfected with an expression plasmid containing a mouse GRP-R cDNA downstream of the constitutively active CMV promoter. After selection with G418, surviving cell clones were evaluated for the level of receptor expression and activity using radiolabeled ligand binding and Ca2+-imaging with the calcium indicator dye Fura-2/AM, respectively. Five clones were isolated withBmax values ranging from ∼3000 to 8900 binding sites/cell. The calculated affinity constants exhibited a range of values from 0.33 to 1.3 nm. For the remainder of the studies, we used the RIE/GRPR cell line with an affinity constant for BBS of 0.54 nm and Bmax values of approximately 3000 receptors/cell. Fura-2 imaging experiments revealed that greater than 99% of these cells exhibited an increase in [Ca2+]i upon stimulation with BBS (1 nm). BBS stimulated time- and dose-dependent increases in the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein in RIE/GRPR cells. Compared with untreated cells, the level of COX-2 mRNA increased in cells treated with BBS (100 nm) by 3-, 20-, 15-, 8-, and 0.5-fold at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively (Fig.1 A). The increase in COX-2 mRNA at 2 h was dependent on the concentration of BBS used to stimulate the cells. Maximum increases in COX-2 mRNA levels were detected in cells stimulated with 10, 100, and 1000 nm BBS (Fig. 1 B). BBS treatment also stimulated a time-dependent increase in the level of COX-2 protein. Western blots revealed an increase in COX-2 protein by 1 h following BBS (100 nm) stimulation and a peak in expression at 6 h (Fig. 1 C). Untreated RIE/GRPR cells showed no detectable expression of COX-2 protein. Consistent with the Western blot data, immunofluorescence staining showed an increase in COX-2 immunoreactivity in RIE/GRPR cells following stimulation with BBS (Fig.1 D, BBS), whereas untreated cells did not exhibit COX-2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 D, Control). COX converts arachidonic acid, released from phospholipid stores by the action of phospholipase A2, to prostaglandin H2, the common precursor of all prostaglandins. To assess whether increased COX-2 expression was associated with an increased prostaglandin synthesis, the levels of PGE2 released from RIE/GRPR cells were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared with untreated control cultures, PGE2levels in the media of RIE/GRPR cells treated with BBS increased by 6.8-fold at 1 h and continued to increase to 45-fold at 24 h (Fig. 1 E). Agonist binding to GRP-R initiates the activation of intracellular signaling pathways (20Kroog G.S. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Med. Res.

J. 1993; 289: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). BBS stimulation of RIE/GRPR cells induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.2 A). To assess the role of [Ca2+]i in BBS regulation of COX-2 mRNA expression, cells were pretreated for 1 h with the membrane-permeable chelating agent BAPTA-AM (30 μm). Treatment with the chelator was sufficient to inhibit the BBS-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2 A) and COX-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2 B) but did not affect either cell viability, measured by trypan blue exclusion assay (percentage of blue cells was as follows: vehicle (0.1% Me2SO), 3.56 ± 0.79% versus BAPTA-AM, 3.23 ± 0.67%), or alter the expression of 18 S ribosomal RNA. Together, these data indicate that an agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is required for BBS-stimulated increases in COX-2 mRNA levels in RIE/GRPR cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediate the regulation of COX-2 expression to a variety of extracellular stimuli (27Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Molina-Holgado E. Ortiz S. Molina-Holgado F. Guaza C. Br. J.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 31Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar); they are referred to as the ERK pathway, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and the p38MAPK pathway. The activities of MAPKs are regulated by upstream dual specificity MAPK kinases (MEKs). MEKs activate MAPKs, such as ERKs, JNK, and p38MAPK, by phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues. To determine whether BBS activated MAPK pathways in RIE/GRPR cells, the levels of phosphorylated ERK, p38MAPK, and JNK proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Bombesin treatment stimulated the activation of the two ERK isozymes, ERK-1 and -2, as well as p38MAPK (Fig. 2, C andD) but did not activate JNK (data not shown). Western blots of RIE/GRPR cell extracts, probed with antibodies selective for the phosphorylated (activated) forms of ERK-1 and -2, showed that BBS induced a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated ERK-1 and -2 (Fig. 2 C). ERK-1 and -2 phosphorylation was increased 1 min after BBS treatment and reached a peak at 10 min before returning to base line at 15 and 30 min. A second, smaller increase in ERK-1 and -2 activation was detected at 60 min after BBS stimulation (Fig.2 C). The active status of ERK-1 and -2 was confirmed byin vitro phosphorylation experiments using immunoprecipitated ERK-1 and -2 and the substrate, myolin basic protein. A 5-fold increase in myolin basic protein phosphorylation was observed when using immunoprecipitated proteins from RIE/GRPR cells treated for 10 min with BBS versus immunoprecipitated proteins from untreated cultures (data not shown). In addition to ERK activation, BBS stimulated a time-dependent activation of p38MAPK. An increase in the phosphorylated form of p38MAPK was detected 5 min following BBS treatment (Fig.2 D). In contrast to the transient activation of ERK-1 and -2, p38MAPK phosphorylation reached a maximum by 5 min and remained elevated up to 60 min after agonist stimulation (Fig.2 D). To determine whether MAPK activation was required for BBS-induced increases in COX-2 mRNA levels, cells were pretreated with selective inhibitors of MEK (PD98059) and p38MAPK(SB203580). PD98059 (10 μm) and SB203580 (5–20 μm) significantly, but incompletely, inhibited the BBS-stimulated increases in COX-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2, Eand F). Although the indicated concentrations of PD98059 and SB203580 were sufficient to completely inhibit agonist-dependent kinase activation, the inhibition by either compound alone was insufficient to completely block the BBS-stimulated increases in COX-2 mRNA levels, suggesting that both MEK/ERK and p38MAPK-dependent pathways are partially involved in GRP-R-mediated regulation of COX-2 mRNA levels. COX-2 expression is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (32Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 33Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol.

To determine whether BBS regulated COX-2 promoter activity, RIE/GRPR cells were transfected with different size fragments of the mouse COX-2 promoter coupled to a luciferase reporter gene. BBS (100 nm) induced a 3.6-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transiently expressing TIS10L-luc (positions −963 to +30) compared with untreated control cultures. A 2.3-fold induction was observed when using a shorter fragment of the COX-2 promoter (TIS10–80luc, −80 to +30). BBS did not stimulate an increase in luciferase activity in cells containing the shortest COX-2 promoter construct (TIS10–40luc (positions −40 to +30)) (Fig.3 A). We also assessed the effects of BBS treatment on RIE/GRPR cells transfected with rat and human COX-2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs, because differences exist in the sequences of mouse, rat, and human COX-2 promoters. Similar to the mouse promoter, BBS-induced increases in luciferase activity were detected in cells expressing both the rat and human COX-2 reporter constructs (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrated that GRP-R-mediated signaling pathways are linked to regulation of COX-2 promoter activity in RIE/GRPR cells. The COX-2 promoter contains multiple potentialcis-activating regulator elements. To date, CRE, E-box, NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ), and NF-κB transcriptional elements have been identified as being involved in receptor-mediated COX-2 expression (32Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D.

https://openalex.org/W1984657847,"High levels of the plasminogen activators, but also their inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), have been documented in neovascularization of severe ocular pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the primary cause of irreversible photoreceptors loss, and current therapies are limited. PAI-1 has recently been shown to be essential for tumoral angiogenesis. We report here that deficient PAI-1 expression in mice prevented the development of subretinal choroidal angiogenesis induced by laser photocoagulation. When systemic and local PAI-1 expression was achieved by intravenous injection of a replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing human PAI-1 cDNA, the wild-type pattern of choroidal angiogenesis was restored. These observations demonstrate the proangiogenic activity of PAI-1 not only in tumoral models, but also in choroidal experimental neovascularization sharing similarities with human AMD. They identify therefore PAI-1 as a potential target for therapeutic ocular anti-angiogenic strategies."

In this study we demonstrated for the first time that [Ca2+] o stimulated proliferation of primary human osteoblasts and selectively activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs).

In bone, [Ca2+] o has been postulated to play an important role in bone remodeling. Concentrations of [Ca2+] o fluctuate dramatically to as high as 40 mm in the local microenvironment as a result of the resorptive action of osteoclasts (4Silver I.A. Murrills R.J. Etherington D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). High concentrations of [Ca2+] o have been suggested to stimulate osteoblast proliferation and inhibit osteoclast resorption. Indeed,in vitro studies showed that [Ca2+] o and other cations stimulate proliferation in a number of osteoblast-like cell lines (5Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Butters Jr., R.R. Sugimoto T.

However, not all osteoblast cell lines are responsive to [Ca2+] o (9Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E., II Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For example, the effects of [Ca2+] o on proliferation of human osteoblast cell lines are either lacking or marginal (9Quarles L.D.

Varying degrees of [Ca2+] o -stimulated proliferation among these clonal osteoblast-like cell lines raise the interesting question of whether calcium responsiveness exists in in vivo matured osteoblastic cells. Studies on [Ca2+] o responsive osteoblast-like cell lines have so far provided only limited information regarding the intracellular signaling mechanism underlying [Ca2+] o stimulation of osteoblast proliferation (3Quarles L.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that multiple intracellular signal pathways in osteoblasts can be activated by [Ca2+] o and other cations. High concentrations of [Ca2+] o activate phospholipase C, probably through a G-protein-coupled receptor mechanism, which then leads to accumulation of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol and mobilization of intracellular calcium (8Godwin S.L. Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11307-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E., II Middleton J.P. Zhang J. Arthur J.M. Raymond J.R.

Activation of protein kinase C is also required for mediating the mitogenic effects of [Ca2+] o and cations (14Hartle J.E., II Prpic V. Siddhanti S.R. Spurney R.F. Quarles L.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). How activation of these signal pathways leads to osteoblast proliferation is not clear. A variety of extracellular signals have been shown to control various cell functions such as cell proliferation and differentiation through activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase signal pathways (15Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 16Dikic I. Blaukat A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 369-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MAP kinase superfamily has been classified into three subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), stress-activated protein kinases/ c-Jun N-terminal kinases (SAKs/JNKs), and p38 MAP kinase. ERKs have been best known for their involvement in mediating intracellular signals in cell proliferation, although members of the other two MAP kinase subfamilies have also been reported to be capable of responding to mitogenic stimuli (17Bost F. McKay R. Dean N. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Maher P. J. Biol.

Res. 1994; 40: 253-256PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MAP kinase signal cascades have been shown to be involved in other cellular processes such as differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (15Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 16Dikic I. Blaukat A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 369-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although [Ca2+] o can activate p38 MAP kinase in primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells 2A. Brown, personal communication. 2A. Brown, personal communication. and ERK1 in rat 1 fibroblastic cells (20McNeil S.E. Hobson S.A. Nipper V. Rodland K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1114-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), there is little information on the role and specificity of MAP kinase signal cascades in mediating [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate that [Ca2+] o exerts a mitogenic response in primary human osteoblasts and MG-63 cells. We provide the first demonstration that [Ca2+] o -stimulated cell proliferation in osteoblasts is dependent on sustained activation of ERK1 and ERK2 but that other MAP kinase signal pathways, p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK, are not activated by [Ca2+] o in osteoblasts. Unless otherwise specified, all chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. The tissue culture media were purchased either from BioWhittaker, Inc. or from the Tissue Culture Support Center (Washington University). SDS-polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. The MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem, Inc. The protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Primary human osteoblasts derived from bone chips were prepared as described previously (21Kimoto S. Cheng S.L. Zhang S.F. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2423-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The clonal osteoblastic cell lines (human MG-63, mouse MC3T3-E1, and rat ST2) were routinely maintained in α-minimum essential medium plus 10‥ fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For proliferation assays using [3H]thymidine incorporation, the cells were subcultured into 12-well plates, and the subconfluent cells were maintained in normal culture medium for 48 h. The cells were then incubated in serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1 mm Ca2+ and 0.9 mmMg2+) for 24 h. The cells were treated with various agents for time periods as specified in the figure legends. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well and incubated in treatment medium for the last 3 h. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and once with 5‥ trichloroacetic acid before 0.75 ml of 0.1 nNaOH was added to each well to lyse the cells. The cell lysates were transferred to scintillation vials along with 10 ml of ScintiVerse (Fisher), and the radioactivity in each vial was measured in a scintillation counter. DNA synthesis measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation was used as an index of cell proliferation. For assessing cell proliferation by direct cell counting, cells were subcultured into 10-cm dishes that were premarked with 0.5-cm grids. The cells in a grid were monitored using an inverted light microscope and photographed through a CCD camera at 0-, 24-, 48-, and 72-h time points. The cell numbers were measured using at least three grids that contain similar cell numbers at the starting time points. For inhibition of MEK, PD98059 was added to DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium at a final concentration of 50 μm 1 h before calcium treatment. For the removal of PD98059, cells treated with PD98059 were washed three times for 1 h each with serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium. For inhibition of p38 MAP kinase, SB 203580 was added to DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium at a final concentration of up to 10 μm 1 h before calcium treatment. At the end of the treatment period, media were removed immediately, and the cells in 10-cm dishes were lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml of the kinase extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 5 mmEDTA, 10‥ glycerol, 1‥ Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture, 1 tablet/10 ml of buffer). The cells were detached from dishes by scraping, and the cell lysates were collected in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. After a 5-min centrifugation at 12,000 rpm, the supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations of the samples were determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Activation of various MAP kinases (ERK1/2 MAP kinases, p38 MAP kinase, and SAPK/JNK) has been shown to occur through dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues by upstream MAP kinase kinases. The dual phosphorylation sequences are TEY for ERK1/2, TGY for p38, and TPY for SAPK/JNK. The levels of dual phosphorylation at these positions in both control and treated samples were measured using PhosphoPlus antibody kits (New England Biolabs, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphorylation of specific MAP kinases was detected by affinity-purified antibodies recognizing specific dual phospho-peptide sequences present in these MAP kinases. As a control, antibodies recognizing MAP kinases independent of their phosphorylation status were used to determine the total amount of individual MAP kinases present in the samples. Briefly, protein samples were size-fractionated by 10‥ SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked in 5‥ nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature followed by an overnight incubation with the primary antibody at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1‥ Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were washed three times in TBS-T and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in TBS-T, membranes were subject to a chemiluminescence-based detection assay (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Proliferative responses to [Ca2+] o stimulation have been demonstrated in a number of osteoblastic cell lines (6Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E., II Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner.

Commun. 1991; 181: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, varying degrees of calcium responsiveness were reported among various human and mouse osteoblastic cell lines (5Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Butters Jr., R.R. Sugimoto T. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1530-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E., II Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner.

Res. 1995; 10: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus it raises the interesting question of whether calcium responsiveness is an intrinsic property of osteoblastic cells. To address this question, we assessed the effects of [Ca2+] o on the proliferation of primary human osteoblasts. Treatment of quiescent primary culture of human osteoblasts with 5 mm Ca2+ resulted in a 5-fold stimulation of DNA synthesis over the control value (1 mmCa2+) (Fig. 1). To compare the degree of calcium responsiveness of the primary human osteoblast cells with those of clonal osteoblast-like cells, we also determined [Ca2+] o -stimulated cell proliferation of human MG-63 cells, mouse MC3T3-E1 cells, and rat ST2 cells. The proliferative responses to [Ca2+] o stimulation were found to be similar among all of these osteoblastic cells (Fig. 1). Demonstration of [Ca2+] o -stimulated proliferation in primary human osteoblastic cells indicates that calcium responsiveness is an intrinsic property of human osteoblast cells and supports the hypothesis that [Ca2+] o may play a critical role in the bone remodeling process in vivo. The degrees of mitogenic response observed in our studies were very similar among various cell lines across different species, suggesting that the differences in calcium responsiveness reported in the literature may be the results of the different experimental conditions and the specific cell lines established (5Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Butters Jr., R.R. Sugimoto T. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1530-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Kano J. Kobayashi T. Yamaguchi T. Fukase M. Chihara K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E709-E716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E., II Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Honda Y. Fitzsimmons R.J. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because the human osteoblastic cell line MG-63 responded to [Ca2+] o in a manner similar to that of primary human osteoblasts, we therefore chose to use MG-63 cells for all of the subsequent experiments. [Ca2+] o -stimulated proliferation in MG-63 cells was dose-dependent (1–10 mm) with maximum stimulation at 5 mm (Fig.2 A). The mitogenic effect of [Ca2+] o was also time-dependent (3–72 h) with increments observed at 24–72 h in cells treated with 5 mm [Ca2+] o (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, no differences in [3H]thymidine incorporation were found in the 3-h treatment (day 0) between 1 and 5 mm [Ca2+] o -treated groups, suggesting that prolonged treatment of [Ca2+] o was required for stimulation of cell proliferation. To rule out the possibility that calcium-stimulated increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation was due to unscheduled DNA synthesis such as DNA repair following damage, we assessed the effects of extracellular calcium on osteoblast proliferation by directly measuring osteoblast cell number. MG-63 cells were treated with 1 or 5 mm calcium for 24, 48, and 72 h, and the numbers of osteoblast cells in the 5 mm calcium-treated group were progressively further increased by 1.5-, 2.4-, and 4.1-fold, whereas the number of osteoblast cells treated with 1 mmcalcium was only marginally increased by 1.1-, 1.3-, and 1.7-fold (Fig.3). Thus extracellular calcium clearly stimulates osteoblast proliferation by enhancing DNA synthesis as well as increasing cell number. This result validates the use of [3H]thymidine incorporation as an index for cell proliferation. Cations other than calcium have been reported to be able to activate cell proliferation in a number of osteoblast-like cell lines. We therefore assessed the ability of several cations (Gd3+, Ni2+, and neomycin) to elicit mitogenic responses in MG-63 cells (Fig. 2 C). Gd3+ (100 μm), a known agonist for the cloned calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), was able to stimulate cell proliferation to almost the same degree as that induced by Ca2+. Gd3+ is a non-cell-permeable cation, suggesting that the entry of the cation into the cells might not be required for stimulation of cell proliferation (23Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ni2+ treatment (100 μm) did not induce a mitogenic response in MG-63 cells. Ni2+ ion is not an agonist for the cloned CaR but is a known agonist for the ranyodine-like receptor present in the osteoclasts (3Quarles L.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Zaidi M. Shankar V.S. Tunwell R. Adebanjo O.A. Mackrill J. Pazianas M. O'Connell D. Simon B.J. Rifkin B.R. Venkitaraman A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that a ranyodine-like receptor was probably not involved in mediating cation-induced mitogenesis in osteoblasts. The addition of neomycin (300 μm), a known agonist for CaR, also weakly stimulated cell proliferation. Thus these combined data are consistent with the hypothesis that [Ca2+] o stimulates osteoblast cell proliferation through the cloned CaR or other calcium-sensing receptor(s) with similar cation specificity (5Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Butters Jr., R.R. Sugimoto T. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1530-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Ye C.

Commun. 1998; 243: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Various extracellular mitogenic signals such as growth factors and cytokines have been shown to stimulate cell proliferation through ERK, p38, or SAPK/JNK MAP kinase signal pathway (17Bost F. McKay R. Dean N. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Maher P. J. Biol.

Res. 1994; 40: 253-256PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation was mediated by any of these MAP kinase signal pathways, we first assessed whether any of the MAP kinases were activated by [Ca2+] o . We took advantage of the fact that activation of all three types of MAP kinases occurs through dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues that can be recognized by antibodies specific for the phospho-proteins. The quiescent MG-63 cells were treated with [Ca2+] o for various time periods, and activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was measured by Western blotting analysis. At the basal state (1 mmcalcium), we detected low but measurable phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 using a phospho-antibody that recognizes the dual phosphorylated, active form of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 4,top left panel). Thus it indicated that even at 1 mm calcium, low levels of activated ERK1 and ERK2 were present and might contribute to low but measurable basal proliferation. However, a rapid increase (within 5 min) in phosphorylation over basal levels was observed for both ERK1 and ERK2 following 5 mmcalcium treatment. The phosphorylation levels of the ERK1 and ERK2 peaked after 5 min of calcium stimulation and gradually declined with time. However, even at 60 min, phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was still significantly higher than basal levels. We thus examined whether sustained ERK phosphorylation occurred with longer exposure to elevated [Ca2+] o (2, 6, 24, 48 h). The increases in phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 were maintained for up to 48 h (Fig. 4, top right panel), indicating that [Ca2+] o stimulation resulted in sustained activation of ERK1 and ERK2. This sustained activation was consistent with our finding that [Ca2+] o -stimulated proliferation required prolonged treatment of [Ca2+] o . The increase in phosphorylation of ERK MAP kinases, especially in the sustained phase, could be due to three mechanisms: 1) an increase in the percentage of phosphorylated proteins in the existing ERK MAP kinase pool; 2) an increase in overall expression levels of ERK MAP kinases without altering the percentage of phosphorylation; or 3) a combination of the two. Western blotting analysis using the antibody recognizing all forms of ERK1 and ERK2 showed that the total amounts of ERK1 and ERK2 were similar at all time points (Fig. 4, bottom panels), indicating that protein expression was not significantly altered. Thus the increases of phosphorylation in both the acute and the sustained phases were due to the increase in the percentage of phosphorylation in the existing ERK MAP kinases rather than as the consequence of an increase in the overall expression levels of ERK MAP kinases. The ability of Gd3+ to mimic calcium in stimulating osteoblast proliferation raised the question of whether Gd3+ can also stimulate ERK phosphorylation. To address this, MG-63 cells were treated with 100 μmGd3+ for various time periods. Gd3+ not only stimulates acute phosphorylation of the ERKs but also induced sustained activation of the ERKs up to 24 h (Fig.5). This pattern of activation is similar to that observed with calcium stimulation, suggesting that two different ions may use a common mechanism for activation of ERKs. To assess whether other MAP kinases such as p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK were activated by [Ca2+] o , we assessed phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK using phospho-antibodies against phosphorylated peptides derived from p38 MAP kinase and the SAPK/JNK, respectively. We found that p38 MAP kinase was not phosphorylated at either the basal or [Ca2+] o -stimulated conditions, whereas sufficient protein expression was detected (Fig. 6,A and B). Similarly, no phosphorylation of SAPK/JNKs was observed when cells were treated with 5 mm[Ca2+] o , whereas expression of SAPK/JNKs was readily seen (Fig. 6, C and D). This result demonstrated that [Ca2+] o did not activate either p38 MAP kinase or SAPK/JNK in MG-63 cells and that neither p38 MAP kinase nor SAPK/JNK was likely to play any role in [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast cell proliferation. ERK1 and ERK2 are known to be activated by the upstream enzyme MEK1 and MEK2, and such activation can be blocked by the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor PD98059 (26Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J.

To test whether PD98059 could block activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by [Ca2+] o , we treated MG-63 cells with 50 μm PD98059 for 1 h before calcium stimulation. PD98059 treatment not only markedly reduced basal phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 but also completely eliminated [Ca2+] o -stimulated phosphorylation (Fig.7). To address the question of whether activation of the MEK/ERK signal cascade (phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2) was functionally important for [Ca2+] o -stimulated proliferation, we measured [Ca2+] o -stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence and absence of PD98059 (Fig.8). PD98059 treatment not only severely impaired [Ca2+] o -stimulated proliferation but also markedly reduced basal cell proliferation (Fig. 8). This result showed that ERK MAP kinases were important in both [Ca2+] o -stimulated and basal cell proliferation. It was consistent with the effects of PD98059 on phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 7), where both basal and [Ca2+] o -stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 were blocked by PD98059. This result indicated that there might be a direct association of ERK1 and ERK2 activation with cell proliferation in MG-63 cells. To rule out the possibility that the decrease in cell proliferation was due to cell death as a result of the potential cytotoxicity of PD98059, we carried out a recovery experiment, in which MG-63 cells were first treated with PD98059 for 24 h and then washed three times for 1 h each with normal DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium containing 1 mm Ca2+ to remove PD98059. The cells were then treated with 1 or 5 mm Ca2+ for an additional 24 h (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8, 5 mm calcium treatment of MG-63 cells following the removal of PD98059 resulted in a ∼3-fold increase in cell proliferation over that of 1 mmcalcium (recovery group). The fold induction was similar to the fold induction in the control group. Regaining calcium responsiveness after removal of PD98059 indicated that MG-63 cells were still functionally viable after 24 h of PD98059 treatment. Thus blocking phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 with PD98059 suppressed both basal and [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast cell proliferation, indicating that the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was critical for these two processes. To directly assess whether p38 MAP kinase activity was required for calcium-stimulated proliferation, we incubated MG-63 cells with a potent p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, which has an in vitro IC50 of ∼0.6 μm (29Cuenda A.

Both 1 and 10 μm concentrations of SB203580 failed to inhibit calcium-stimulated osteoblast proliferation (Fig.9). This result further confirmed that p38 MAP kinase was not critical for calcium-stimulated osteoblast proliferation. A number of recent studies suggested that sustained MAP kinase activation was required for cellular functions such as cell proliferation and differentiation (31Orsini M.J. Krymskaya V.P.

To assess whether the acute or the prolonged activation of ERK1/2 was responsible for mediating mitogenic effects of [Ca2+] o , we first tested whether transient exposure to high calcium was sufficient to cause sustained activation of ERK1/2 and/or increase cell proliferation. MG-63 cells were transiently exposed to 5 mm[Ca2+] o for 1 h and then incubated in normal growth medium (1 mm [Ca2+] o ) for an additional 1 or 23 h. The cells were then either harvested for assessing ERK activation or treated with [3H]thymidine to measure cell proliferation. One hour after removal of high calcium medium, ERK phosphorylation levels were reduced back to the basal level, and subsequent incubation with 1 mm calcium up to 24 h did not result in reactivation of the ERKs (Fig.10). Transient exposure to 5 mm [Ca2+] o (1 or 2 h) did not result in increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation at 24 h either (Fig. 11). These results indicate that transient exposure to high calcium causes acute activation of ERKs but does not lead to sustained activation of ERKs. Acute activation of ERK1/2 by transient calcium treatment was not sufficient to stimulate osteoblast proliferation. This result suggested that the continuing presence of high calcium is required for sustained activation of ERKs and stimulation of osteoblast proliferation.Figure 11Transient calcium stimulation does not induce proliferation of MG-63 cells. MG-63 cells were incubated in 1 mm (open bars) or 5 mm(filled bars) calcium at 37 °C for 24 h (24 hr). For transient calcium treatment, cells were treated with 1 or 5 mm calcium for 1 h or 2 h and then switched to 1 mm calcium for 24 h (1 hr and 2 hr). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was used as an index of cell proliferation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly test whether sustained activation of ERK1/2 as the result of prolonged treatment of high calcium is required for calcium-stimulated osteoblast proliferation, we first treated MG-63 cells with 5 mm [Ca2+] o for 1 h and then added PD98059 to the medium (Fig.12). The delayed treatment of cells with PD98059 suppressed the proliferative effect of [Ca2+] o . The degree of suppression was similar to that obtained by pretreatment with PD98059. (PD98059 was added 1 h prior to addition of 5 mm Ca2+.) Thus it confirmed that acute activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was not sufficient for [Ca2+] o -stimulated proliferation. It also demonstrated that prolonged treatment with high calcium in the absence of sustained activation of ERKs was not sufficient for stimulation of osteoblast proliferation, which indicated that prolonged activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was critical for [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation. Successful bone remodeling requires balanced rates of bone formation and bone resorption. The rates of bone formation are dependent on the number of functionally active osteoblasts. It is thus of prime importance to identify the extracellular factors in the bone milieu that regulate the proliferation of osteoblasts. In this study, we demonstrated that [Ca2+] o is indeed such an extracellular factor that stimulated proliferation of primary human osteoblast cells and clonal osteoblast cell lines across a number of species. We also provided clear evidence for the first time that [Ca2+] o stimulation of human osteoblasts resulted in both an acute phase and a sustained phase of ERK1 and ERK2 activation, which were through dual phosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues. The sustained activation was required for proliferative responses, whereas the acute activation was not sufficient. We found that although p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK were present in MG-63 cells, they were not activated by [Ca2+] o stimulation. Thus our studies suggest that the ability to sense [Ca2+] o is present inin vivo matured human osteoblasts, supporting the hypothesis that [Ca2+] o plays an important role in the bone remodeling process. Our findings also establish a molecular and cellular mechanism for [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation. The mitogenic effects of [Ca2+] o are mediated through sustained activation of specific ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases. Our results do not support the possibility that other MAP kinases such as p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK are involved in [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation. The discovery that ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases play a key role in [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation raises an interesting question regarding the molecular nature of the upstream signaling cascades leading toward activation of ERK1 and ERK2. Growth factor receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors have all been shown to activate ERK MAP kinase signal cascades through a number of mechanisms (15Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 35Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Adv.

Several studies provided molecular evidence that the cloned G-protein-coupled CaR was present in osteoblastic cells, suggesting that the changes in [Ca2+] o may be sensed by the CaR, which then activates intracellular signal cascades (5Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Butters Jr., R.R. Sugimoto T. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1530-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5883-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A very recent study demonstrated unambiguously that the mRNA and protein of the CaR were present in MG-63 cells and that the CaR was actively coupled to a K+ channel in MG-63 cells (13Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Ye C. Vassilev P.M. Sanders J.L. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C382-C393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus this evidence clearly resolved the controversial issue of the presence of the CaR in osteoblast cells and supported the hypothesis that the CaR is a possible candidate for mediating [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation. Cation specificity displayed by MG-63 cells in this study is functionally consistent with cation specificity of the cloned G-protein-coupled CaR (1Brown E.M. Vassilev P.M. Quinn S. Hebert S.C. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 38Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar). However, the critical issues of whether the cloned CaR is the only calcium sensor in MG-63 cells and whether it plays any functional role in mediating [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation remain unsolved (3Quarles L.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Quarles L.D. Hartle J.E., II Siddhanti S.R. Guo R. Hinson T.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). More direct functional studies are needed to firmly establish a role for the CaR as an upstream component in [Ca2+] o -stimulated osteoblast proliferation. Although acute activation of MAP kinase signal cascades by extracellular signals have been established in many cell systems, sustained activation of MAP kinases has only been reported in a limited number of studies, all of which indicate that the sustained activation, but not the acute activation, plays a more critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration as well as gene expression (31Orsini M.J.

This study establishes an important role for sustained activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in mediating the mitogenic effects of [Ca2+] o on osteoblast cell proliferation. Further studies examining the molecular mechanism underlying sustained activation will provide insight regarding how [Ca2+] o regulates osteoblast proliferation and the bone remodeling process.

Hearts from myoglobin knockout (myo -/- ) mice served as appropriate controls. The intracellular MbO 2 dissociation curve, as measured by 1 H NMR, was determined by systematically lowering the O2 content of the perfusion medium. At 100% MbO2 saturation (buffer O2: 75%), complete inhibition of Mb with 20% CO did not alter left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) or coronary venous PO2 (PvO2) and thus myocardial O2 consumption. At 87% MbO2 saturation (buffer O 2: 65%), CO applied to WT hearts significantly decreased LVDP by 12% and increased P vO2 by 30% (both P<0.005) respectively, whereas no effects were observed in myo -/- hearts. Cell width in isolated myo -/- as compared with WT cardiomyocytes was reduced (4.8 µm vs. 5.4 µm, P<0.001), whereas cell length did not differ. At ambient PO2 of 8 mm Hg, oxygen consumption of stimulated myo -/cardiomyocytes was only 60% that of WT controls (P<0.001). Our results do not support Mb-mediated oxidative phosphorylation in the beating mouse heart. However, we find conclusive evidence that Mb is important in facilitating O 2 diffusion from the vasculature to mitochondrial cytochromes and that the oxygen reservoir of myoglobin is of functional relevance in the beating mammalian heart."
https://openalex.org/W2125512097,"Unlike most eukaryotes, many apicomplexan parasites contain only a few unlinked copies of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Based on stage-specific expression of these genes and structural differences among the rRNA molecules it has been suggested that Plasmodium spp. produce functionally different ribosomes in different developmental stages. This hypothesis was investigated through comparison of the structure of the large subunit rRNA molecules of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, and by disruption of both of the rRNA gene units that are transcribed exclusively during development of this parasite in the mosquito (S-type rRNA gene units). In contrast to the human parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, we did not find evidence of structural differences in core regions of the distinct large subunit rRNAs which are known to be associated with catalytic activity including the GTPase site that varies in P. falciparum. Knockout P. berghei parasites lacking either of the S-type gene units were able to complete development in both the vertebrate and mosquito hosts. These results formally exclude the hypothesis that two functionally different ribosome types distinct from the predominantly blood stage-expressed A-type ribosomes, are required for development of all Plasmodium species in the mosquito. The maintenance of two functionally equivalent rRNA genes might now be explained as a gene dosage phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2052438966,"In this study we examine signaling pathways linking the M1 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 mAChR) to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 in neuronal PC12D cells. We first show that activation of ERK1/2 by the M1 mAChR agonist carbachol takes place primarily via a Ras-independent pathway that depends largely upon Rap1, another small GTP-binding protein in the Ras family. Rap1 in turn activates B-Raf, an upstream activator of ERK1/2. Consistent with these results, carbachol was found to activate Rap1 more potently than Ras. Similar to other small GTP-binding proteins, activation of Rap1 requires a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to promote its conversion from the GDP- to GTP-bound form. Using specific antibodies, we show that a recently identified Rap1 GEF,calcium- anddiacylglycerol-regulatedguanine nucleotide exchange factorI (CalDAG-GEFI), is expressed in PC12D cells and that carbachol stimulates the formation of a complex containing CalDAG-GEFI, Rap1, and activated B-Raf. Finally, we show that expression of CalDAG-GEFI antisense RNA largely blocks carbachol-stimulated activation of hemagglutinin (HA)1-tagged B-Raf and formation of the CalDAG-GEFI/Rap1/HA1-tagged B-Raf complex. Together, these data define a novel signaling pathway for M1 mAChR, where increases in Ca2+ and diacylglycerol stimulate the sequential activation of CalDAG-GEFI, Rap1, and B-Raf, resulting in the activation of MEK and ERK1/2.

Intracellular signaling events that are activated by M1 mAChR include PLCβ-mediated production of diacylglycerol (DAG), which activates protein kinase C (PKC), and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which stimulates the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. This release of Ca2+ is often accompanied by a sustained influx of extracellular Ca2+ (3Felder C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 8Berstein G. Blank J.L.

In addition to this well established Ras-dependent ERK1/2 kinase pathway, the ERK1/2 kinase cascade has been proposed to be activated by the small GTP-binding protein Rap1 in cells expressing B-Raf (42Vossler M.R.

Activation of Rap1 and B-Raf has been proposed to be essential for the sustained activation of ERK1/2 kinase in PC12 cells by NGF (43York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The ability of Rap1 to activate B-Raf is still controversial, however, since activated Rap1 does not activate ERK1/2 in some cell lines (48Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L.

Several pathways for Rap1 activation have been shown to be mediated by GEFs that respond to specific intracellular signals (50Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For example, increases in the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities of growth factor receptors (e.g. TrkA, EGF receptors) activate Rap1 via the GEF C3G (51Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y.

Increases in intracellular levels of Ca2+ and DAG activate Rap1 by activating CalDAG-GEFI ((58), structurally related to RasGRP/HCDC25L (59Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J.

Among these Rap1 GEFs, CalDAG-GEFI (calcium- anddiacylglycerol-regulatedguanine nucleotide exchange factorI (58Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J.

Until now, however, there have been no studies of the function of endogenous CalDAG-GEFI. In the present study we show that CalDAG-GEFI plays a central role in M1 mAChR-mediated activation of the ERK1/2 cascade in PC12D cells. First, we show that the mAChR agonist carbachol activates ERK1/2 largely via a Ras-independent pathway. Second, we show that carbachol rapidly activates B-Raf, an upstream activator of ERK1/2, and that this activation depends upon the activation of Rap1. Third, we use specific antibodies to show that CalDAG-GEFI is expressed in PC12D cells and that a complex containing CalDAG-GEFI, Rap1, and activated B-Raf is formed following stimulation of M1 mAChR. Finally, we show that carbachol-mediated activation of hemagglutinin (HA)1-tagged B-Raf and formation of the CalDAG-GEFI/Rap1/HA1-tagged B-Raf complex can be blocked by expression of CalDAG-GEFI antisense RNA. Together, these data indicate that stimulation of M1 mAChR by carbachol causes the sequential activation of CalDAG-GEFI, Rap1, and B-Raf, leading to the activation of MEK and ERK1/2. Nerve growth factor (human 2.5 S) and carbamylcholine (carbachol) were obtained from Wako Chemicals Industries, Ltd. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was obtained from Sigma. Dexamethasone was from Nacalai Tesque. K252a (a glycosylated indole carbazole alkaloid from Nocardiopsis species) was from Kyowa Medex Co. GF109203X (3-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-indolyl]-3(3-indolyl)maleimide) was purchased from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes and other reagents for modification of DNA were obtained from Toyobo, Takara Shuzo Co., and New England Biolabs. A dominant-negative (dn)Rap1 (Rap1Asn-17) was obtained by PCR amplification from the mouse full-length Rap1 cDNA cloned in pT7T3d-Pac (identified in the mouse expressed sequence tag data base (GenBankTMaccession number AA272379) and purchased from Genome Systems, Inc., Livermore, CA) using the mutant oligonucleotide primer GGCGTGGGGAAGAATGCTCTAACAGTTCAGTTTGTTCAG to change the 17th amino acid from serine to asparagine with the QuikChange Site-directedTM Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was performed before and after mutagenesis. The Rap1Asn-17 cDNA was excised from this vector by digestion with NotI and XhoI and subcloned in pOPRSVI/MCS LacSwitchTM II (Stratagene) between theNotI and XhoI sites to produce the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible expression vector (pRap1N17) containing Rap1Asn-17 under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter and the Lac operator/repressor. Full-length rat CalDAG-GEFI cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from RNA isolated from PC12D cells and rat brain. Primers were designed based on the mouse CalDAG-GEFI sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AF081193). The forward primer was 5′-AGGATCAGAGGCTGAGCTGGTT-3′, and the backward primer was 5′-TCTCCAAGGCAGGAATGAGTCC-3′. RT-PCR product was isolated from a 1% agarose gel and cloned in pGEM-T Easy (Promega). This plasmid was then used as a template for constructing an expression vector encoding c-Myc-tagged CalDAG-GEFI. The forward primer used in this construction was 5′-GGTGACACTATAGAATACTCAAGCTATGCATCC-3′, and the backward primer was 5′-TTATCGTCGACTAAGTGGATGTCGAACA-3′. This PCR product was purified from a 1% agarose gel and cloned in pGEM-T Easy. CalDAG-GEFI cDNA was excised from this vector by digestion with EcoRI andSalI and subcloned between the EcoRI andSalI sites of pCMV-Tag 5 (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was designated pCalDAG-GEF1-myc. An antisense expression vector, pCalDAG-GEFI-myc-antisense, was constructed by subcloning a cDNA fragment encoding CalDAG-GEFI between the EcoRI andBamHI sites of pCMV-Tag 5. PC12D cells (19Katoh-Semba R. Kitajima S. Yamazaki Y. Sano M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 17: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a rapidly differentiating subline of rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells (20Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar), were a gift from Prof. Mamoru Sano (Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine). PC12D cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 0.16% sodium bicarbonate, 3.6 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 45 ng/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 as described previously (21Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were used in the non-differentiated state in all the experiments. Drugs were added directly to the culture medium and were present until the time when the cells were harvested. The corresponding vehicle (water, Me2SO, or ethanol) was added to control cells. Cells were seeded in 3.5-cm plastic dishes (Corning or Iwaki Glass Co.) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish and then cultured for 1 day, allowing the cells grow to 90–95% confluency prior to transfection. LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for making stable cell lines containing the dnRap1gene. Transfections were performed essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. 5 μg of PCMVLacI repressor (Stratagene) together with 5 μg of pRap1N17, and 39 μl of LipofectAMINE were used for each 10 cm dish. LipofectAMINETM 2000 Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for other transfections (10 cm) essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. pCalDAG-GEFI-myc (1 μg or as indicated), 1 μg of pHA1-B1-Raf (an expression plasmid encoding hemagglutinin (HA) 1-tagged quail B-Raf, Ref. 62Papin C.

Cells were kept in normal DMEM for 48 h until they were ready to be used. A PC12D subline, PC12D-37, stably expressing a dexamethasone-inducible dnRas gene (RasAsn-17) (63Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat promoter (64Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), has been described previously (65Kumahara E. Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines that express the dnRap1 gene (Rap1Asn-17) under the control of the IPTG-inducible Lac operator/repressor were obtained by transfecting PC12D-37 cells with pRap1N17 and PCMVLacI repressor using LipofectAMINETM, followed by selection for hygromycin B-resistant colonies in DMEM containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. (Selection was initiated 1 week after transfection.) After 2 weeks of selection, hygromycin B-resistant colonies were isolated and screened for the ability of Rap1Asn-17 (induced by exposing cells to IPTG) to block the activation of B-Raf by carbachol. Cell lines that showed complete or nearly complete inhibition of carbachol-mediated B-Raf activation were chosen for further study. In this way, the cell line PC12D-37-19 containing RasAsn-17under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter and Rap1Asn-17 under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter was selected. PC12D-37-19 cells were subsequently maintained in DMEM containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin B and 100 μg/ml G418. Overexpression of dnRap1, dnRas, or dnRap1 and dnRas in these cells was achieved by pretreating the cells with 5 mm IPTG for 7 h, 0.5 μm dexamethasone for 19 h, or by pretreating the cells with both IPTG and dexamethasone. ERK1/2 kinase assays using anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were performed essentially as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs Inc.). Briefly, cells grown to 90–95% confluency in 3.5-cm uncoated plastic culture dishes were stimulated with various reagents for the times indicated and then lysed by adding 100 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue, and then immediately scraped off the plates. The resulting cell lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes on ice, sonicated for 10–15 s in a bath sonicator, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation for 5 min to remove cellular debris, the proteins in the samples were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (ImmobilonTM transfer membrane, Millipore), and probed with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies as described below. In vitro phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 substrate myelin basic protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP was carried out as described previously (26Kumahara E. Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Quantification of ERK1/2 activation was performed by liquid scintillation counting. B-Raf kinase assays were performed as described previously (40Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells grown to 90–95% confluency in 3.5-cm uncoated plastic culture dishes were stimulated with various reagents for the times indicated and then lysed by addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100. After 5 min centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, 1 μg of anti-B-Raf antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, for endogenous B-Raf) or 1 μg of anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, for HA1-tagged B-Raf) were added to the supernatant fractions, which were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation to provide gentle mixing. Protein A/G-agarose (10 μl of resin suspension, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was subsequently added to each sample, and the incubation was continued with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The agarose in each sample was collected by centrifugation (2,500 rpm for 5 min) and washed twice with 200 μl of lysis buffer and once with PAN buffer containing 10 mmPIPES (pH 7.0), 20 units/ml aprotinin, and 100 mmNaCl. The resin from each sample was then resuspended in 16.5 μl of 1× MEK buffer containing 2 μg of MEK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 10 μl of PAN buffer, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mm), and 4 μl of 5× kinase buffer (5× kinase buffer: 50 mm MgCl2, 20 units/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0)). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, then resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. Phosphorylated MEK1 was assessed by autoradiography and quantified using the BAS2000 Bio Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Co.). GTP-bound forms of Rap1 and Ras were detected as described by Frank et al.

Exposure of cells to vanadium led to the transactivation of NFAT in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Scavenging of vanadium-induced H2O2 withN-acety-l-cyteine (a general antioxidant) or catalase (a specific H2O2 inhibitor) or the chelation of vanadate with deferoxamine, resulted in inhibition of NFAT activation. In contrast, an increase in H2O2generation by the addition of superoxide dismutase or NADPH enhanced vanadium-induced NFAT activation. This vanadate-mediated H2O2 generation was verified by both electron spin resonance and fluorescence staining assay. These results demonstrate that H2O2 plays an important role in vanadium-induced NFAT transactivation in two different cell types. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, inhibited vanadium-induced NFAT activation, whereas A23187 and ionomycin, two calcium ionophores, had synergistic effects with vanadium for NFAT induction. Incubation of cells with cyclosporin A (CsA), a pharmacological inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, blocked vanadium-induced NFAT activation. All data show that vanadium induces NFAT activation not only through a calcium-dependent and CsA-sensitive pathway but also involved H2O2 generation, suggesting that H2O2 may be involved in activation of calcium-calcineurin pathways for NFAT activation caused by vanadium exposure.

Over the last decade, studies from several laboratories have indicated that the pre-existing/cytoplasmic component of NFAT was a mixture of proteins belonging to a novel family of transcription factors (22Crabtree G.R.

Other distinct proteins belonging to the same family, such as NFATc, NFAT3, and NFAT4, were also isolated and cloned (27Hoey T. Sun Y.-L. Williamson K. Xu X.

There are three functional domains in NFAT family proteins: the Rel-similarity domain, which is responsible for DNA-binding activity and interaction with AP-1; the NFAT-homology region, which regulates intracellular localization; and the transcriptional activation domain (31Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The activation of NFAT in T cells includes dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and an increase in affinity for DNA binding (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Stimuli that elicit calcium mobilization result in rapid dephosphorylation of NFAT proteins and their translocation to the nucleus. These dephosphorylated proteins show increased affinity for DNA binding (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar).Growing evidence indicates that NFAT is not only a T cell-specific transcriptional factor but also is expressed in a variety of lymphoid cells and in non-lymphoid tissue (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 32Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R.

Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies from our laboratory and other groups have shown that TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 are involved in vanadium-induced inflammation (6Carter J.D. Ghio A.J. Sainet J.M. Devlin R.B. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 146: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 7Pierce L.M. Alessandrini F. Godleski J.J. Paulauskis J.D. Toxicol. Appl.

Castranova V. Shi X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 198: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine if activation of NFAT occurred in response to vanadium and if so to investigate the molecular mechanism, by which lead to NFAT activation.DISCUSSIONThe antigen-regulated, cyclosporin A-sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is not only expressed in lymphoid cells as once thought but also expressed in other cells and organs, such as the skin and lung (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 32Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The stimuli and regulation of NFAT in cells other than lymphoid cells, however, remains unknown. In this report, we investigated the possible involvement of H2O2in NFAT activation of fibroblasts and epidermal cells in response to vanadium. Exposure of cells to vanadium caused marked increases in NFAT-dependent transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Co-stimulation studies show thatA23187 or ionomycin augments the NFAT-mediated transcription synergistically in response to vanadium. Pretreatment of cells with nifedipine or CsA results in impairment of NFAT transactivation induced by vanadium. These results strongly suggest that vanadium is able to induce NFAT activation. Furthermore, scavenging of vanadium-induced H2O2 by NAC or catalase, or the chelation of vanadate by deferoxamine resulted in inhibition of NFAT activation, whereas an increase in H2O2 generation in response to SOD or NADPH enhanced vanadium-induced NFAT activation. These results suggest that vanadium induces NFAT transactivation is dependent on H2O2 generation caused by vanadium.NFAT isoforms are expressed in different tissues. It has been reported that NFAT1 and NFAT2 mRNAs have been detected in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, testis, placenta, pancreas, small intestine, prostate, colon, skin tumors, as well as in lung (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar,32Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). NFAT expression or NFAT-derived transactivation has also been described in several types of nonlymphoid cells, including mast (43Weiss D.H. Hural J. Tara D. Timmerman L.A. Henkel G. Brown M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), endothetial (44Cockerill G.W. Bert A.G. Ryan G.R. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 2689-2698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neuronal (45Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle (46Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.-F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and liver-derived Chang cells (47Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L. Majano P.L. Redono J.M. Lopez-Cabrera M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that exposure of either mouse embryo fibroblasts (PW cells) or mouse epidermal cells (Cl 41) resulted in marked activation of NFAT-dependent transcription. These results are not only consistent with previous findings that NFAT mRNA is detectable in skin (32Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) but also for the first time provide the evidence that NFAT is expressed in embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that NFAT may play some role in embryonic development. The activation of NFAT includes dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and an increase in affinity for DNA binding (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Stimuli that elicit calcium mobilization result in rapid dephosphorylation of NFAT proteins and their translocation to the nucleus. NFAT then binds to the promoter region of its target genes and initiates the transcription of these target genes, in turn leading to translation (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Therefore, the translocation of NFAT occurs within 3 h (33Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Rincon M. Chen N.-Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9143-9149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas its target gene proteins could be detected between 24 and 48 h after cells exposed to stimulus (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). The system used in this study is NFAT-luciferase reporter cDNA, which includes the firefly luciferase cDNA under the control of NFAT regulatory element (promoter region of mouse IL-2, a typical target gene of NFAT). Thus, the NFAT activation by vanadium appears at 12 h and reaches peak around 36–48 h after cells exposed to vanadium.In T cells, transactivation of NFAT is regulated tightly in response to elevations of both intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) and diacylglycerol following activation of phospholipase C (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular calcium stimulates the activation of calmodulin (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). It is believed that binding of calmodulin to a region near the C terminus of calcineurin displaces the auto-inhibiting domain and exposes the calcineurin active site (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Activated calcineurin subsequently dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic NFAT proteins, leading to NFAT nuclear translocation (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 16Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar, 48Jain J.P. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). NFAT forms a heteromeric transcriptional co-activator complex with AP-1 that co-induces NFAT-dependent transactivation (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that phosphorylation of NFAT is regulated by several protein kinases, including GSK3 and JNK2 (15Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 49Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 50Chow C.W.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2609-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Other than lymphocytes, NFAT activation has been demonstrated in only a few cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells following induction with platelet-derived growth factor and liver-derived Chang cells following exposure to hepatitis B virus × protein (46Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.-F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 47Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L. Majano P.L. Redono J.M. Lopez-Cabrera M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results obtained from the present investigation show that vanadium alone could induce an increase of NFAT activity of more than 10-fold. It appears that vanadium alone is the strongest NFAT inducer reported thus far. Recently, we reported (33Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Rincon M. Chen N.-Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9143-9149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that UV irradiation resulted in activation of NFAT-mediated transcription through a calcium-dependent pathway in mouse epidermal JB6 cells as well as in mouse skin. The present study found that A23187 or ionomycin augmented the NFAT-mediated transcription synergistically in combination with vanadium. Pretreatment of cells with nifedipine or CsA resulted in impairment of NFAT transactivation induced by vanadium. Therefore, the vanadium-induced NFAT transactivation appears to require an increase in free intracellular calcium and calcineurin activation.Vanadium-containing compounds exert potent toxic and carcinogenic effects, such as cell transformation (3Huang C. Chen N. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 711-715PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cohen M.D. Klein C.B. Costa M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 269: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5Sheu C.W.

It has been demonstrated that vanadium-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for most biological effects caused by vanadium (41Shi X. Dalal N.S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Huang C. Zhang Z. Ding M. Li J. Ye J. Leonard S.S. Shen H.M. Butterworth L. Lu Y. Costa M. Rojanasakul Y. Castranova V.

It is well accepted that extracellular stimuli trigger signals through a cascade of protein-protein interactions (52Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 53Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 54Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that these extracellular stimuli generate and/or require reactive free radicals or derived oxidant species to successfully transmit their signals to the nucleus (53Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 55Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). In addition to inducing cellular injury, such as DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, ROS also function as intracellular messengers (2Sabbioni E. Bonardi M. Gallorini M. Pietra R. Fortaner S.

Accumulating data suggest a vital role of ROS in mediating cellular responses by various extracellular stimuli (2Sabbioni E. Bonardi M. Gallorini M. Pietra R. Fortaner S. Tartaglia G.P. Groppi F. J.

It has been reported that generation of H2O2 is required for platelet-derived growth factor signal transduction (57Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Involvement of ROS in NFAT activation in T lymphocytes was first demonstrated by the observation that treatment of T cells with dithiocarbamate resulted in inhibition of NFAT activation and NFAT-mediated cytokine gene expression (58Martinez-Martinez S. Gomez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 59Saccani S. Saccani A. Varesio L. Ghosh P. Young H.A. Sica A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that increased intracellular H2O2 levels are associated with induction of NFAT activity by vanadium. The following experimental observations support this conclusion: (a) the ESR spectrum and dye staining show that vanadium induces ROS generation in cells; (b) catalase, a scavenger of H2O2, inhibited NFAT activation induced by vanadium; (c) sodium formate, an ⋅OH radical scavenger, did not affect vanadium-induced NFAT activation; (d) SOD, which scavenges O⨪2 and generates H2O2, enhanced NFAT activation by vanadium; (e) NADPH, which promotes H2O2generation, also enhanced NFAT activation by vanadium; (f) deferoxamine, a metal chelator, dramatically decreased the NFAT activation induced by vanadate, indicating a key role for vanadate in ROS generation and NFAT activation. Thus, H2O2is involved in vanadium-induced NFAT activation. Considering the results that calcium-calcineurin pathway is also required for vanadium-induced NFAT activation, we speculate that H2O2 may be an initiator for calcium-calcineurin pathway for NFAT activation (Fig.10). This hypothesis was strongly supported by the previous findings that exposure of cells to H2O2 induces early release of Ca2+from mitochondria into cytosol, which was mediated by annexin VI translocation and inactivation of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (60Hoyal C.R. Thomas A.P. Forman H.J. J. Biol.

Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Binding sites for NFAT have also been found within the promoter regions of cytokines, including granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-8 (15Rao A.

Therefore, we suggest that NFAT is involved in vanadium-induced inflammation and may subsequently be involved in the carcinogenic effects of vanadium.

It has been deduced from rodent studies that the extent and direction in which, for example, fatty acid levels, GLUT4 content and physical training affect UCP3 mRNA expression is muscle fiber-type specific. To explore the role of UCP3 in human energy metabolism further, we wanted to examine the abundance of protein expression of UCP3 relative to muscle fiber typology in a direct manner and at the protein level in m. vastus lateralis muscle of healthy controls and type 2 diabetics.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. The antibody used here specifically recognizes UCP3 in cryo-sections of human m. vastus lateralis sections as well as in whole muscle homogenatesThe UCP3 antibody was raised against a 20 amino acid (147–166 of human UCP3).

In adults, this receptor is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, and mutant VEGFR3 alleles have been implicated in human hereditary lymphedema. To better understand the basis of its specific endothelial lineage-restricted expression, we have characterized the VEGFR3 gene and its regulatory 5' flanking region. The human gene contains 31 exons, of which exons 30a and 30b are alternatively spliced. The VEGFR3 proximal promoter is TATA-less and contains stretches of sequences homologous with the mouse Vegfr3 promoter region. In transfection experiments of cultured cells, the Vegfr3 promoter was shown to control endothelial cell-specific transcription of downstream reporter genes. This result was further confirmed in vivo; in a subset of transgenic mouse embryos, a 1.6 kb Vegfr3 promoter fragment directed weak lymphatic endothelial expression of the LacZ marker gene. This suggests that endothelial cell-specific elements occur in the proximal promoter, although further enhancer elements are probably located elsewhere. The sequence, organization, and variation in the VEGFR3 gene and its regulatory region provide important tools for the molecular genetic analysis of the lymphatic system and its disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1993922963,"Reduced replicative capacity is a consistent characteristic of cells derived from patients with Werner syndrome. This premature senescence is phenotypically similar to replicative senescence observed in normal cell strains and includes altered cell morphology and gene expression patterns. Telomeres shorten with in vitro passaging of both WRN and normal cell strains; however, the rate of shortening has been reported to be faster in WRN cell strains, and the length of telomeres in senescent WRN cells appears to be longer than that observed in normal strains, leading to the suggestion that senescence in WRN cell strains may not be exclusively associated with telomere effects. We report here that the telomere restriction fragment length in senescent WRN fibroblasts cultures is within the size range observed for normal fibroblasts strains and that the expression of a telomerase transgene in WRN cell strains results in lengthened telomeres and replicative immortalization, thus indicating that telomere effects are the predominant trigger of premature senescence in WRN cells. Microarray analyses showed that mRNA expression patterns induced in senescent WRN cells appeared similar to those in normal strains and that hTERT expression could prevent the induction of most of these genes. However, substantial differences in expression were seen in comparisons of early-passage and telomerase-immortalized derivative lines, indicating that telomerase expression does not prevent the phenotypic drift, or destabilized genotype, resulting from the WRN defect."

Because cell survival reflects a balance between death and survival pathways and because the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is known to downregulate apoptosis in response to diverse stimuli, our study examined the role of ganglioside GD3 (GD3) and related structural analogs, including short-chain ceramide analogs—for example, ceramide C2 (C2)—on NF-κB regulation, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and survival of cultured rat hepatocytes.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1.

We cloned a human cDNA whose predicted amino acid sequence showed 41% similarity to yeast Sec34p with homology throughout the entire coding region. Affinity-purified antibodies raised against the human SEC34 protein (hSec34p) recognized a cellular protein of 94 kDa in both soluble and membrane fractions. Like yeast Sec34p, cytosolic hSec34p migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 300 kDa on a glycerol velocity gradient, suggesting that it is part of a protein complex. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized hSec34p to the Golgi compartment in cells of all species examined, where it co-localized well with thecis/medial Golgi marker membrin and partially co-localized with cis-Golgi network marker p115 andtrans-Golgi marker TGN38. The co-localization with membrin was maintained at 15 °C and after microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole. During transport of the tsO45 vesicular stomatitis virus G protein through the Golgi, there was significant overlap with the hSec34p compartment. Green fluorescent protein-hSec34 expressed in HeLa cells was restricted to Golgi cisternae, and its membrane association was sensitive to brefeldin A treatment.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). The process can be divided into three stages: (a) vesicle budding, (b) vesicle docking, and (c) membrane fusion, with distinct sets of proteins mediating each stage. The budding stage involves recruitment of coat proteins to the membrane and culminates with the release of coated vesicles (2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Vesicular transport between membrane compartments requires high specificity and tight regulation to deliver cargo molecules in donor vesicles to the correct acceptor organelle and thereby maintain the integrity of distinct compartments. To ensure the proper directionality of membrane flow, the target organelle must possess appropriate molecular machinery allowing for specific recognition and docking of the incoming vesicle. The docking reaction is likely to require a set of integral membrane proteins on the vesicle and target membranes, termed SNAREs.1 Initially, the SNARE proteins were thought to confer specificity through their pair-wise interactions (3Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). However, more recent evidence suggests that SNAREs cannot be the only targeting components; some SNAREs can function at several transport steps in vivo (4Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), SNAREs that faithfully function at different transport steps in vivo can interact promiscuously in vitro, and some SNAREs have been found in multiple SNARE complexes (5Lupashin V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. McNew J.A. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2659-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Likewise, members of the Rab GTPase family were at first thought to be the principle determinants for targeting specificity because distinct family members display unique organellar localizations that correlate with their site of action (6Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, it has been demonstrated that a single chimeric Rab protein can function at two transport steps (7Brennwald P. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 362: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), indicating that the Rabs cannot be the sole determinants for specificity in vesicle docking.Given that neither Rabs nor SNAREs are the sole determinants of targeting specificity, other components must play important roles. Additional candidates include the so-called tethering factors, which are proteins that link donor and acceptor vesicle membranes prior to SNARE-SNARE interactions (8Pfeffer S.R. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Tethering factors are a diverse group of proteins with a tendency to form elongated, coiled-coil structures and/or to assemble into large, multimeric complexes (for review, see Ref. 9Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, because they are peripheral membrane proteins and therefore must interact with integral membrane components with distinct localizations, once again, tethering factors cannot be the sole determinants of targeting specificity. Taken together, these results indicate that specificity in vesicle docking and fusion might be generated by the interaction of several factors in such a way that no individual component plays the dominant role.A recent genetic screen identified temperature-sensitive alleles of two yeast genes, SEC34 and SEC35, that, when incubated at the restrictive temperature, are defective in ER to Golgi transport and accumulate large numbers of 50-nm vesicles (10Wuestehube L.J. Duden R. Eun A. Hamamoto S. Korn P. Ram R. Schekman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 393-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant alleles of these genes can be efficiently suppressed by YPT1, which encodes the Rab GTPase required early in the secretory pathway, or bySLY1–20, which encodes a dominant form of the ER to Golgi SNARE-associated protein Sly1p. Weaker suppression is evident upon overexpression of genes encoding the v-SNAREs SEC22,BET1, or YKT6, a trait shared with all previously characterized ER to Golgi tethering factors (11Sapperstein S.K. Lupashin V.V. Schmitt H.D. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it was hypothesized that SEC34 and SEC35might be involved in tethering. This was demonstrated to be the case for SEC34 and SEC35 by the discovery that these genes displayed a genetic interaction with genes involved in tethering and that both Sec34p and Sec35p are required in an in vitrotethering assay (12VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Sapperstein S.K. Chiang E.C. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Using a cell-free assay that measures distinct steps in vesicle transport from the ER to the Golgi, it was shown that Sec34p and Sec35p are required for a vesicle docking stage catalyzed by the tethering factor Uso1p (12VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These genetic and biochemical results suggest that Sec34p and Sec35p may act with Uso1p to dock ER-derived vesicles to the Golgi.Sec34p is a peripheral membrane protein with a calculated molecular mass of 93 kDa. Fractionation of yeast cytosol indicates that Sec34p and Sec35p exist in an ∼450-kDa protein complex (13VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Sapperstein S.K. Chiang E.C. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Kim D.W. Sacher M. Scarpa A. Quinn A.M. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently Sec34p has also been described as Grd20p, a protein involved in the proper localization of yeast enzymes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (15Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A severe defect in TGN localization of Kex2p and missorting of vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y occurs rapidly after loss of Grd20p function. A complete loss of GRD20 function also results in a severe growth defect, although the growth defect appears to be independent of the TGN sorting defect. The Grd20/Sec34 protein is only partially localized to the TGN, so it is possible that the observed Golgi localization defects of Kex2p are indirect and a manifestation of defects in Golgi recycling. Alternatively, Sec34p might be a general transport factor that is involved in several membrane trafficking steps. Additional experiments will be required to unambiguously address these possibilities.In this study, we report the cloning and sequencing of a novel membrane-associated human protein, p94. Based on several independent lines of evidence, we propose that p94 is hSec34, the human orthologue of yeast Sec34p. p94 has sequence and structural homology to the yeast vesicle tethering factor Sec34p, it localizes to thecis-Golgi, and like yeast Sec34p, it exists as a component of high molecular complex. Although yeast Sec34p is predicted to act on the same transport step as Uso1p, the localization of hSec34p and its sensitivity to Brefeldin A differ from that of p115, a human orthologue of Uso1p. Therefore, we propose that hSec34 may function on the vesicle transport step that is distinct from the one that requires p115.RESULTSBecause many secretory factors are evolutionarily conserved, we determined whether the components of the yeast Sec34p/Sec35p complex were also conserved in higher eukaryotes. Searches of the GenBankTM data base did not yield any Sec35p homologues, but several human expressed sequence tags were discovered with a high degree of similarity to Sec34p.We used the primary sequence of expressed sequence tag z21242 to design an expressed sequence tag-specific oligonucleotide and used the RACE procedure to amplify a 5′ 850-bp-long fragment from human colon cDNA. The resulting DNA fragment encoded a 269-amino acid polypeptide highly homologous to Sec34p. A complete 4.5-kilobase human cDNA was obtained by PCR screening of an arrayed human fetal brain cDNA library with hSec34-specific primers. The complete cDNA for hSec34 was sequenced (GenBankTM accession numberAF349676) and found to contain a 2484-bp open reading frame encoding a 828-amino acid polypeptide homologous to Sec34p with a calculated molecular mass of 94 kDa. The hSec34p polypeptide has no predicted transmembrane or other membrane anchoring sequences and contains a predicted coiled-coil domain (amino acid residues 126–205) and a putative “leucine zipper” domain (amino acid residues 399–420). The predicted amino-terminal coiled-coil domain is evolutionary conserved among all Sec34-like proteins (Fig.1). Several large fragments of the HSEC34 cDNA sequence are identical to to GenBankTMAL139326high throughput genomic sequencing phase entry draft sequence from chromosome XIII clone RP11-351K3, indicating that HSEC34 gene is on human chromosome XIII.The strongest homology between the yeast and human proteins is found in a region containing amino acid residues 174–280 (32% identity and 54% similarity) and in a region containing amino acid residues 554–626 (34% identity and 52% similarity), indicating that the functional elements of the protein could reside in these regions. These regions are also highly conserved in potential homologues of Sec34 found in the Drosophila melanogaster genome data base (AAF51107) and the genomes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe(CAB51337), Candida albicans (unfinished fragment of complete genome Contig6-2488 obtained from the Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology Center), Arabidopsis thaliana (AAG30981), andCaenorhabditis elegans (computed from the genomic Y71F9AM DNA sequence available at the Sanger Center). The aligned amino acid sequences of the putative Sec34p-related proteins are shown in Fig. 1, and their pairwise sequence identities are shown in TableI. We also have found that the carboxyl-terminal half (amino acid residues 301–807) of hSec34p is similar (21% identical and 40% similar) to the central domain (amino acid residues 610–1106) of the endosomal tethering factor EEA1 (data not shown).Table IRelative sequence identity/similarity of Sec34p-related proteinsS.pombeC.albicansA.thalianaC.elegansD.melanogasterH.sapiens1-aGenBank™ accession numberAF349676.S. cerevisiae(NP 011084)24/4429/4622/3821/3824/4522/41S.pombe (CAB51337)23/4420/3919/3921/4322/42C.albicans1-bTranslated from unfinished fragment of complete genome Contig6–2488 obtained from the Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology Center.22/3820/4120/4423/44A.thaliana(AAG30981)22/3828/5133/51C.elegans 1-cComputed from the genomic Y71F9AM DNA sequence available at the Sanger Center.28/4830/51D. melanogaster(AAF51107)42/59The percentage of amino acid identity/similarity of putative Sec34p-related proteins are displayed.

Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis for HSEC34 revealed a transcript of about 4.5 kilobases in length that is abundantly and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined with the highest RNA level observed in pancreas and testis and the lowest level found in lung (Fig.2 A). By contrast the level of a control transcript (β-actin) was more abundant in lung than in pancreas and testis. Ubiquitous expression is indeed a feature expected of an essential molecule like Sec34. Therefore, we conclude that the cDNA isolated from the fetal brain library represents a full-length hSec34 RNA molecule.Figure 2mRNA and protein expression levels of hSec34p in different mammalian tissues. A, Northern blot analysis of hSec34p and β-actin was performed with human mRNA samples (MTN™ blot; CLONTECH).B, to determine the expression pattern of Sec34p, homogenates were prepared from different rat organs.

Affinity-purified anti-hSec34p antibodies recognize a 94-kDa protein in HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 3 A,lane 1), in numerous rat tissues (Fig. 2 B), and in extracts from CV-1, HEK 293, and all other mammalian cell lines tested (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Interestingly, two different high molecular mass species in addition to the 94-kDa polypeptide are detected in brain and heart (Fig. 2 B). This may indicate the presence of a family of hSec34 immunologically related proteins with different tissue distributions. These proteins may be involved in specific membrane trafficking pathways in specialized tissues. Additional experiments are required to determine whether these immunologically related proteins are functionally and structurally related to the hSec34p.Figure 3hSec34p is a peripheral Golgi protein existing in a large complexes. A, affinity-purified rabbit antibodies raised against recombinant hSec34p recognized a protein of ∼94 kDa in whole cell lysates of HeLa cells (lane 1) and in lysates from cells transfected with pCMV-hSec34 (lane 2) and pGFP-hSec34 (lane 3). The GFP-hSec34 fusion protein migrated as a 120-kDa protein. For this assay, cells from one 100-mm dish were lysed in 200 μl of preheated (95 °C) SDS sample buffer. The lysates were clarified, and 5 μl were analyzed by immunoblotting after separation on a 12% gel. B, to estimate the distribution of hSec34p between cytosolic and membrane fractions, HeLa and CV-1 (wild type and transfected with pGFP-hSec34) cells were grown to 50% confluency, collected in PBS, and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. Cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g using a Beckman TLA55 rotor. The volumes for both fractions were adjusted, and equivalent proportions of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using anti-hSec34p. C, to determine whether hSec34p is enriched in Golgi fraction, rat liver Golgi membranes were isolated from a light mitochondrial fraction on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (43Fleischer B. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The total liver lysate (total) and Golgi membranes (Golgi) (20 μg of protein each) were separated on a 12% gel, and immunoblotted using affinity-purified anti-hSec34p antibodies.D, cytosol (lanes C) and CHAPS-solubilized membranes (lanes M) from wild type HeLa cells (HeLa lanes) and from pCFP-hSec34 transfected CV-1 cells (CV-1 p lanes) were fractionated on 10–30% glycerol (w/v) gradients. The fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and equivalent amounts of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using anti-hSec34 antibodies. Fractions at which the molecular mass markers peaked are indicated. The asteriskindicates the deduced position of the functional hSec34p complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the major 94-kDa protein was hSec34p, HeLa cells were transfected with hSec34p under control of cytomegalovirus promoter and analyzed by Western blotting. Overexpressed hSec34p comigrated with the endogenous 94-kDa immunoreactive protein (Fig. 3 A,lane 2), indicating that hSec34p is encoded by the HSEC34 cDNA that we cloned. Further, a new immunoreactive 120-kDa protein appeared in cells engineered to overexpress a GFP-hSec34p hybrid protein (Fig. 3 A, lane 3).We next determined whether hSec34p, like its yeast orthologue Sec34p, was a peripheral membrane protein. In proliferating HeLa cell cultures (30–50% confluency), 60–90% of the hSec34p was associated with the membrane pellet (Fig. 3 B, HeLa, lane M). A similar distribution was observed in CV-1 cells (Fig.3 B, CV-1), and several different mammalian tissue extracts (data not shown). A membrane-bound pool of hSec34p was also concentrated on Golgi membranes purified from rat liver (Fig.3 C).To determine whether soluble hSec34p exists in a high molecular mass complex, membranes and cytosols were fractionated on glycerol velocity gradients (Fig. 3 D). In HeLa cytosols, hSec34p migrated as a 300-kDa species, indicating that it is part of a protein complex (Fig.3 D). In HeLa membranes, hSec34p was found in even larger protein complex(es) that may indicate associations with cognate t-SNARE membrane receptors. These observations for hSec34p are consistent with those for yeast Sec34p, which is also associated with a high molecular mass protein complex (13VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Sapperstein S.K. Chiang E.C.

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that hSec34p is primarily localized in the juxtanuclear region of HeLa cells along with the v-SNARE membrin, a cis/medial Golgi localized protein (18Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). Similar co-localization was observed in living HeLa (Fig. 4 A, middle row) and CV-1 (Fig. 4 B, top row) cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding CFP-membrin (19Chao D.S. Hay J.C. Winnick S. Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and YFP-hSec34. To more rigorously assess the co-localization of hSec34p and membrin, a temperature shift experiment was performed. Incubation of the cells at 15 °C inhibits anterograde ER to Golgi transport (20Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), whereas retrograde transport appears less affected such that the net effect on the localization of a cis-Golgi protein is redistribution from the juxtanuclear region to enlarged peripheral vesicular-tubular compartment (22Lippincott-Schwartz J.

To determine whether hSec34p exhibits such a redistribution in concert with membrin, HeLa cells were incubated at 15 °C for 3 h. YFP-hSec34p and CFP-membrin were present on membrane elements scattered throughout the cell and co-localized in all structures (Fig. 4 A, bottom row). We also used a pharmacological approach to explore the co-localization of hSec34p and membrin. Nocodazole treatment induces microtubule depolymerization that leads to fragmentation and dispersal of the Golgi (23Rogalski A.A. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Fig.4 B shows that after nocodazole treatment YFP-hSec34 was localized on the same Golgi fragments as was CFP-membrin (lower row). Thus, in three different situations, hSec34p is localized to the same cis/medial Golgi compartment as is membrin.Figure 4hSec34p is co-localized with the v-SNARE membrin on Golgi membranes. A, top row, HeLa cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-hSec34p (1:100) and mouse anti-membrin (1:500) antibodies. Secondary goat anti-rabbit-Alexa488 and goat anti-mouse-Alexa594 (Molecular Probes) were used at the 1:500 dilution. Cytoplasmic “spotty” staining visible in cells labeled with anti-hSec34p was nonspecific because it was observed in cells incubated without primary antibodies (not shown). Nuclear DNA was stained blue with DAPI.Middle row, cells were co-transfected with pYFP-hSec34 and pCFP-membrin, incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and observed with the yellow (left panel) or cyan (middle panel) filter set. Bottom row, cells were transfected as before, grown for 24 h at 37 °C, and then incubated for 3 h at 15 °C. B, CV-1 cells were co-transfected with pYFP-hSec34 and pCFP-membrin, incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and observed with the yellow (left panel) or cyan (middle panel) filter set. Upper row, the specific fluorescence for both molecules was observed in the untreated living cells on the same elaborated Golgi membranes. Lower row, cells were treated with nocodazole for 120 min. The third picture of each row was generated by merging of the images inred and green (A, top row) or yellow and cyan (A, middle and bottom rows) channels. The right inset in B(upper row) shows a 2-fold magnified view of the Golgi region.

CFP-hSec34 expressed in CV-1 cells (Fig. 3 B) and in HeLa cells (data not shown) was found in both cytoplasmic and membrane fractions similar to endogenous hSec34p. CFP-hSec34 was also efficiently incorporated into high molecular mass (∼300 kDa) complexes as defined by glycerol velocity gradients in both soluble (Fig. 3 D, CV-1 p, row C) and membrane (Fig. 3 D, CV-1 p,row M) fractions. We suggest that the functional pool of hSec34p contains both CFP-hSec34 and hSec34p (fraction marked with anasterisk). In addition to this functional pool, there is also a large pool of monomeric CFP-hSec34p in cytosols. This is most likely due to overexpression, because monomers of endogenous hSec34p are not detectable in either the HeLa or the CV-1 cytosols.GFP-VSVG Moves through hSec34p-positive CompartmentTo provide more direct evidence that hSec34p localized to thecis-face of the Golgi apparatus, we used the temperature-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, tsO45-VSVG, that transits the secretory pathway (24Beckers C.J. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were co-transfected with pCFP-hSec34 and a plasmid encoding tsO45-VSVG fused with GFP (GFP-VSVG) (25Cao H. Thompson H.M. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells expressing GFP-VSVG at 39.5 °C, newly synthesized protein is trapped in the ER, whereas CFP-hSec34 is localized in the juxtanuclear region (Fig.5, top row). When new protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide and the cells were incubated at 15 °C, the GFP-VSVG preferentially accumulated in pre-Golgi intermediates (26Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) where its distribution partially overlapped with that of CFP-hSec34p (Fig. 5, 15 °C row). Some VSVG was observed at ER exit sites at the cell periphery (marked byarrowheads) that lacked CFP-hSec34. Incubation at 25 °C led to a redistribution of GFP-VSVG to the Golgi apparatus where it is completely co-localized with CFP-hSec34. Finally, prolonged incubation at 32 °C led to redistribution of GFP-VSVG from the CFP-hSec34-positive compartment to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5,bottom row). Thus, a model secretory protein transits the hSec34 compartment.Figure 5hSec34p co-localizes with a secretory cargo that moves through the Golgi. HeLa cells were co-transfected at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) with plasmids encoding tsO45-VSVG-GFP and CFP-hSec34p. The cells were kept at 39.5 °C (top row) or shifted to either 15 °C for 1 h (15 °C row), 25 °C for 1 h (25 °C row), or 32 °C for 2 h (bottom row). Living cells were viewed using yellow (for GFP) or cyan (for CFP) filter sets. As shown in the merged images at 25 °C, but not at 39.5 °C or 32 °C, hSec34p overlapped with VSVG in the Golgi structures. At 15 °C hSec34p and VSVG showed partial overlap with noticeable absence of CFP-hSec34p on peripheral ER exit sites (marked byarrowheads).

Tungsten is very similar in size and chemical behavior to molybdenum, and therefore, tungsten can act as a specific antagonist of molybdenum-containing enzymes. Tungsten-containing enzymes seem to catalyze similar or even the same reactions as related molybdoenzymes (1Kletzin A. Adams M.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 5-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ljungdahl L.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 63-65Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 3Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Adams M.W.W. Chem.

Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the structures of the ModA proteins from Escherichia coli andAzotobacter vinelandii have been analyzed at 1.75 and 1.25 Å resolution, respectively (17Hu Y. Rech S. Gunsalus R.P. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 4: 703-707Google Scholar, 18D. M. Lawson C. E. Williams D. J. White A. P. Choay L. A. Mitchenall R. N. Pau J. Chem. Soc.

The specificity of ModA to bind molybdate and tungstate, but not sulfate or other anions, is determined mainly by the size of the binding pocket for molybdate/tungstate (17Hu Y. Rech S. Gunsalus R.P. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 4: 703-707Google Scholar). Because tungstate and molybdate have nearly identical sizes, ModA cannot discriminate between these anions (16Rech S. Wolin C. Gunsalus R.P. J.

Labeling studies were done for certain enzymes, and the tungstate requirement for optimal growth was analyzed for some organisms, most of them being (hyper)thermophilic (1Kletzin A. Adams M.W.

The Gram-positive anaerobe Eubacterium acidaminophilum grows at mesophilic temperatures, degrades amino acids by Stickland reactions, and requires the addition of selenite but not molybdate or tungstate for growth (20Zindel U. Freudenberg W. Rieth M. Andreesen J.R. Schnell J. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 254-266Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Two enzymes are involved in its metabolism: formate dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, which are now described to be specifically dependent on tungsten availability to exhibit enzymatic activity. This correlates with a specific incorporation into both enzymes (21Graentzdoerffer A.

This report focuses on uptake experiments using resting cells of E. acidaminophilumand radioactive labeled tungstate as well as on cloning and sequencing of an ABC transporter. The extracytoplasmic binding protein of this transporter, TupA, was overexpressed in E. coli, and its anion binding characteristics show a specificity for tungstate. Thus, this is the first report of a transport system specific for tungstate. All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise specified. E. acidaminophilum (DSM 5388T) was grown anaerobically as described (20Zindel U. Freudenberg W. Rieth M. Andreesen J.R. Schnell J. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 254-266Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Glycine (50 mm) or the substrate combination serine (10 mm), formate (40 mm), betaine (60 mm) was used as growth substrate. The organism was also grown without the addition of tungstate and molybdate as described in this paper. E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ and E. coli SOLR were obtained from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany) and used for cloning purposes and expression of proteins. They were grown in Luria broth medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar) or on agar plates containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin was added, and 40 μg ml−1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside and 48 μg ml−1 isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside if needed. The plasmid vector pBluescipt KS+ was obtained from Stratagene, the protein expression vector pASK-IBA2 was from Institut für Bioanalytik (Göttingen, Germany). Formate dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase were measured by a standard procedure (12Wagner R. Andreesen J.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 147: 295-299Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) at 34 °C under anaerobic conditions by monitoring the substrate-dependent reduction of benzyl viologen at 578 nm (ε = 8.3 mm−1cm−1) or methyl viologen at 600 nm (ε = 13.1 mm−1cm−1). To assay formate dehydrogenase, the reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 1 ml, 50 mmTris buffer (pH 8.0), 5 mm benzyl or methyl viologen, 20 mm sodium formate, and 0.1–10 μl of extract. 1–5 μl of 50 mm sodium dithionite was added to the reaction mixture to obtain a light reduction of the viologen as an indication for strict anaerobic conditions. Aldehyde dehydrogenase was measured under similar conditions (6White H. Simon H. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) except that the reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 1 ml, 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.5), 25 mm benzyl viologen, and 0.5 mm acetaldehyde. Blanks were run with the same reaction mixture excluding the substrate. The reactions were always started by the anaerobic addition of substrate. 1 unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 2 μmol of viologen min−1. [185W]Tungstate was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig, Germany); after discontinuation of that service, the unlabeled salt was irradiated with neutrons at the GKSS Forschungszentrum (Geesthacht, Germany) to obtain [185W]tungstate (t1/2=75 d). Na2WO4·2H2O (2.2 mg, 6.7 μmol) was irradiated for 7 days to obtain a final radioactivity of 1.7·107 Bq and a specific radioactivity of 1.7·109 Bq/mmol. For uptake experiments, cells (10 ml) were grown overnight with serine/formate/betaine as substrates, harvested anaerobically at 2,000 × g, and washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Na2HCO3 buffer (pH 7.5). Cells were suspended in the same buffer, and 10 mm serine, 40 mm formate, 60 mm betaine, and 30 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol were added to give a final volume of 9.9 ml. Subsequently, cells were incubated at 30 °C, and 100 μl of a 10 μm [185W]tungstate solution was added. At different time intervals, 1-ml samples were taken and collected on nitrocellulose filter discs (pore size 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany). The filter discs had been preincubated in 50 mm Na2HCO3buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm tungstate and were washed after cell collection with 20 ml of this buffer. Filter discs were dried for 30 min at 60 °C, incubated in scintillation fluid (Beckmann, München Germany), and the radioactivity was determined in a Beckmann LS6500 scintillation counter with an efficiency of nearly 90%. To label proteins of E. acidaminophilum with [185W]tungstate, cells were grown overnight with glycine as substrate in 3 liters of medium supplemented with [185W]tungstate (4·105 Bq) and different concentrations of unlabeled tungstate to give the final concentration. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × gand 15 min and were washed two times with potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) and suspended in this buffer. After rupture of the cells by two passages through a French pressure cell, cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 20 min. To separate the labeled proteins, the supernatant was desalted using a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and applied to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column had been preequilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl. Routine DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from E. acidaminophilum was isolated according to Saito and Miura (24Saito H. Miura K.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Enzymes were used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Plasmid preparations were done using the Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) kits as outlined in the manufacturer's manual. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using the Rhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems PRISM 377 DNA sequencer. Sequence information of large inserts were obtained using the GPSTMgenome priming system from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Alternatively, the primer-walking method was used. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Metabion (Martinsried, Germany). DNA fragments were labeled, and hybridizing bands were detected using the DIG DNA labeling and detection kit from Roche Diagnostic according to the manufacturer's manual. A λZAP II library was constructed using the λZAP II-predigestedEcoRI/CIAP-treated vector Kit (Stratagene). Genomic DNA ofE. acidaminophilum was digested with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI and separated by centrifugation for 24 h at 200,000 × g using a sucrose density gradient (10–40% (w/v) sucrose). DNA fragments of 5–10 kb1 were ligated into theEcoRI site of the λZAP II vector and subjected to in vitro packaging according to the manufacturer. The resulting phage particles represented a library of E. acidaminophilum DNA and were screened by plaque hybridization after infection of E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′. M13 ExAssist helper phage and E. coli SOLR were used for in vivo excision of the pBluescript phagemid according to the instructions provided by Stratagene. E. acidaminophilum was grown in medium containing glycine or serine/formate/betaine as substrates to an absorbance of 0.9 and harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 ×g and 4 °C for 10 min. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with modifications. 10–25-ml cultures were used, and the cells were lysed in 20 mg of lysozyme ml−1 for 10 min. Northern hybridizations were performed as described (26Graentzdoerffer A. Pich A. Andreesen J.R. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR experiments, purified RNA was treated with DNase RQ1 (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) following the instructions of the supplier to obtain DNA-free RNA. For reverse transcription of mRNA, 1 μl of purified RNA and 1 μl of hexanucleotide mixture (500 μg/ml) were added to 10 μl of H2O, denatured for 10 min at 70 °C, and cooled for 2 min on ice. Subsequently, 4 μl of first strand buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 20 mm dNTP, and 0.7 μl of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and 1 h at 42 °C. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 94 °C for 5 min. This reaction mixture contained the synthesized cDNA, and 1 μl of it was used as template in the following PCR. 100 pmol of forward and 100 of pmol reverse primer, 1 μl of 20 mm dNTP, 1 μl ofTaq DNA polymerase (Quantum Appligene, Heidelberg), 5 μl of Taq buffer, and 42 μl of H2O were mixed, and PCR was performed with 30 cycles: 30 s at 94 °C for denaturing, 30 s of annealing at 42–72 °C (depending on the primers used), and 1–3-min extension (depending on the distance between both primers) at 72 °C. To clone thetupA coding sequence into the pASK-IBA2 expression vector (IBA, Göttingen), the gene was amplified by PCR usingPwo DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), primers PA3 and PA3r (Table I), and chromosomal DNA from E. acidaminophilum as template. The leader peptide of TupA including the conserved cysteine residue was omitted and replaced by the OmpA leader peptide provided by the vector pASK-IBA2. Both primers contain a BsaI restriction site and were cloned into the respective site of pASK-IBA2 resulting in the TupA fusion protein with an N-terminal OmpA signal peptide and a C-terminal Strep-tagII. This plasmid, pASK-tupA, was transformed into E. coli XL 1-Blue MRF′. The insert of pASK-tupA was sequenced for confirmation.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′–3′)PA3TAATTAGGTCTCCGGCCGCTGCAAAACAATCACCAGAPA3rATTAATGGTCTCAGCGCTTTTTGCTGCGTTAGGAGTPprobeATTTCGTCAATGTCAGGTCTPprobeArTTTCGTCAATGTCAGGTCTFDHlongCGGGTTTTATGGAGTTATTTCAAGGGCGGCUniversal primerCGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTPprobeBGGGAAAGGTGGAGAGGCTGACPprobeBrTTAGGAGTGAACAGAGGTGCG Open table in a new tab An E. coliXL1-Blue clone harboring the plasmid pASK-tupA was inoculated into 3 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg ml−1ampicillin and was grown overnight at 30 °C. 2 ml of this culture was transferred to 100 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. After the culture had reached an absorbance of 0.5 at 550 nm, 10 μl of an anhydrotetracyclin solution (2 mg ml−1 in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to induce expression of the binding protein. After 3 h at 30 °C the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 12 min at 4,000 × g and 4 °C and used directly for the preparation of crude extract or stored at −20 °C. E. coli cells overexpresing TupA were suspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 g of cells ml−1 buffer) and were lysed by sonication using a GM 60 HD sonicator (Uni Eqip Laborgerätebau, Martinsried, Germany) at intervals of 5 s until most cells were broken. After each interval the samples were cooled on ice for 10 s. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was used directly or stored at −20 °C. The supernatant containing TupA was applied to a 1-ml Strep-Tactin column (IBA) that had been equilibrated previously with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A and subsequently, the TupA-binding protein was eluted in 3 ml of buffer A containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. The ligand-dependent gel shift assay developed by Rech et al. (16Rech S. Wolin C. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used to analyze anion binding by TupA. Aliquots of purified TupA were incubated with the indicated concentration of anion in binding buffer (50 mm potassium acetate (pH 5.0), 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0)) for 30 min on ice. Samples were mixed with 0.25 volume of a sucrose solution (30% w/v) containing bromphenol blue and applied to a native 12% polyacrylamide gel. Protein was separated in a mini-Gel system (Biometra, Göttingen). The gel was buffered with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), and the running buffer contained 0.1 m Tris and 0.1 m glycine. Electrophoresis was done at 150 mV and 4 °C until bromphenol blue left the gel. The concentration of proteins was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Whole cells were incubated in 0.1 m NaOH for 10 min at 95 °C and neutralized with 0.5 m HCl prior to protein determination. The extinction coefficient for TupA was determined to 24,460 mol−1cm−1 according to Gill and von Hippel (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) and used to calculate protein concentration of the purified protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done with the Laemmli buffer system as described (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted from an SDS gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to Towbin et al. (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm NaBO3buffer (pH 9.0) containing 20% (v/v) methanol at 1.2 mA cm−2 membrane for 1–2 h. For Edman degradation, blotted proteins were cut from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed in a 476A amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Molybdenum and tungsten were determined by ICP-MS with an Agilent 7500 Series ISP-MS (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Omission of tungstate and molybdate from the added trace element solution did not affect growth of E. acidaminophilum over hundreds of generations in a defined mineral medium on different substrates. After growth ofE. acidaminophilum in the presence of 10−9m[185W]tungstate, labeled proteins were analyzed by gel filtration. This revealed a strong radioactivity peak at 74 kDa and one shoulder at about 160 kDa. If 10−8m radioactive tungstate was present during growth, the specific radioactivity eluting at about 160 kDa was nearly unchanged, whereas the value of the radioactivity peak at 74 kDa increased 2-fold, and a new radioactivity peak appeared at about 40 kDa which became prominently labeled if higher concentrations of tungstate were provided (data not shown). The simultaneous addition of equimolar amounts of molybdate had a negligible effect on the observed labeling pattern (data not shown), pointing to a high specificity for tungstate. However, a coelution of radioactivity and enzyme activity could already be obtained for the 160-kDa protein with a viologen-dependent formate dehydrogenase (31Meyer M. Granderath K. Andreesen J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Granderath K. Charakterisierung der Formiat-Dehydrogenase und Aldehyd-Dehydrogenase als Wolframhaltige Proteine von Eubacterium acidaminophilum. Ph.D. thesis. University of Göttingen, 1993Google Scholar) and for the 74-kDa protein with a viologen-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (32Granderath K. Charakterisierung der Formiat-Dehydrogenase und Aldehyd-Dehydrogenase als Wolframhaltige Proteine von Eubacterium acidaminophilum. Ph.D. thesis. University of Göttingen, 1993Google Scholar). Both enzymes were now independently purified to homogeneity and contain tungsten but no molybdenum. 2A. Graentzdoerffer, A. Pich, and J. R. Andreesen, manuscript in preparation., 3D. Rauh, A. Graentzdoerffer, A. Pich, and J.R. Andreesen, manuscript in preparation.Tungstate and molybdate had quite different effects on both enzyme activities. In tungstate/molybdate-depleted cells of E. acidaminophilum, viologen-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was no longer measurable, whereas viologen-dependent formate dehydrogenase activity was still present at 18% of its maximum value (100% = 1.1 unit mg−1) which was obtained after growth in the presence of 10−7m tungstate added to the medium. The latter concentration was also optimal for aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (0.56 unit mg−1). Formate dehydrogenase activity was unaffected by higher tungstate concentrations added to the medium, whereas the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity declined by about 30% if 10−5m tungstate was present during growth. In the absence of tungstate, the addition of molybdate at physiological concentrations (10−9 to 10−7m) did not give rise to an aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. However, if a high concentration of molybdate (10−5m) was added to the medium, the specific activities of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase increased to values of 14 and 62% of their maximum activity, respectively. These activity levels corresponded to those determined for a suboptimal tungstate supplementation by 10−9m. Because molybdenum salts are contaminated by tungsten (33Herzig A.J. Briggs J.Z. Hampel C.A. Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements. Reinhold Book Corp., New York1968: 412-422Google Scholar), the induction of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase activity by high molybdate concentrations added to the medium might be caused by a contamination by tungstate. However, it might also be possible that both tungsten-containing enzymes incorporate molybdenum and form an active enzyme when this metal is added in high concentrations to the medium. At least, these physiological results suggested a strong preference for tungstate compared with molybdate and a specific uptake of tungsten even at quite low concentrations by growing cells. Cells of E. acidaminophilum were grown with serine/formate/betaine as carbon and energy source. Uptake experiments using [185W]tungstate were carried out with 1 μm labeled tungstate and resting cells in carbonate buffer and serine/formate/betaine as energy source. The highest uptake rate of 0.53 pmol min−1 mg of protein−1 was obtained at 36 °C (Fig.1). Significant lower values were obtained at room temperature (22 °C) and at 50 °C. This is in good agreement with the optimal growth temperature of E. acidaminophilum, which is between 30 and 35 °C (20Zindel U. Freudenberg W. Rieth M. Andreesen J.R. Schnell J. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 254-266Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Uptake experiments at 0 °C, performed as control, gave a strongly reduced uptake rate of 0.1 pmol min−1 mg of protein−1 (Fig. 1). Tungstate uptake was not influenced by the presence of equimolar amounts of molybdate in the uptake buffer (data not shown). No impairment of tungstate uptake was observed if the ATPase inhibitor arsenate (5 mm) or the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (2 mm) was present during the uptake experiments by resting cells (data not shown). The genes encoding a tungstate uptake system were identified in the downstream region of the genes encoding the tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase I and some enzymes involved in pterin-cofactor biosynthesis of E. acidaminophilum (21Graentzdoerffer A.

Sequence comparison and later biochemical analysis (see below) revealed that the three genes in the immediate downstream region of the mentioned 7.3-kb fragment encode an ABC uptake system that seems to be specific for tungstate. According to the results presented below, these genes have been named tup fort ungstate up take (Fig.2).

https://openalex.org/W2051542573,"Dendritic cells are important antigen-presenting cells of the immune system that induce and modulate immune responses. They interact with T and B lymphocytes as well as with natural killer cells to promote activation and differentiation of these cells. Dendritic cells generated in vitro from monocytes by use of the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-4 are increasingly used clinically to enhance antitumor immunity in cancer patients. However, recent studies revealed that the functional repertoire of monocyte-derived dendritic cells may be incomplete. Important functions of monocyte-derived dendritic cells such as migration or the ability to induce natural killer cell activation or type 2 T helper cell differentiation appear to be impaired. We propose that all these deficiencies relate to a single biochemical deficiency of monocyte-derived dendritic cells. IL-4, which is used to generate monocyte-derived dendritic cells, suppresses phospholipase A2, the enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and contributes to the synthesis of platelet-activating factor. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells must therefore fail to generate platelet-activating factor as well as arachidonic acid derivatives such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and lipoxins, collectively referred to as eicosanoids. Since eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor are known to play an important role in processes such as leukocyte migration, natural killer cell activation, and type 2 T helper cell differentiation, the deficiency in eicosanoid and platelet-activating factor biosynthesis may be responsible for the observed handicaps of monocyte-derived dendritic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2030841602,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleotropic polypeptide that can function as a morphogen, motogen, mitogen, angiogen, carcinogen, and tumor suppressor, depending on the target cell and tissue. Previous studies from our laboratory using transgenic mice have shown that HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and that the upstream regulatory elements are crucial for the control of HGF gene transcription. In the present study, we have identified and characterized one of these elements as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)-responsive element. This regulatory element was localized at −246 to −233 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site of the HGF gene promoter having the sequence GGGCCAGGTGACCT. Gel mobility shift and supershift assays demonstrated that this cis-acting element strongly binds to the PPARγ isoforms as well as to chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily. Mutational analysis and gel mobility band shift assays indicated that the binding site is an inverted repeat of the AGGTCA motif with two spacers (inverted repeat 2 configuration) and that the two spacers are important for PPARγ binding. This binding site overlaps with functional binding sites for activating protein-2, nuclear factor 1, and upstream stimulatory factor, and together, they constitute a multifunctional composite binding site through which these different transcription factors exert their regulatory effects on HGF promoter activity. Functional assays revealed that PPARγ, with its ligand, 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2, strongly stimulates HGF promoter activity. On the other hand, nuclear factor 1, activating protein-2, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor transcription factors repress the stimulatory action of PPARγ by competing with PPARγ for their overlapping binding sites.

In adulthood, HGF also plays an important role in supporting the maintenance and renewal of cells in various organs such as liver, lung, and kidney. HGF gene expression is regulated by extracellular cues such as hormones and cytokines (8Matsumoto K. Okazaki H. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In vivo, the level of HGF mRNA dramatically increases in response to cell loss to facilitate tissue regeneration. For example, HGF mRNA increases in the liver as well as in distal organs such as lung and spleen after loss of hepatic tissue induced by partial hepatectomy or hepatotoxin treatment. Similarly, after injury to the lung or kidney (by toxins or by surgical procedures such as unilateral pneumonectomy or nephrectomy, respectively), HGF gene expression is induced in these organs to promote their regeneration (13Kono S.

In vivo analyses of HGF gene promoter regulation in transgenic mice (15Bell A.W. Jiang J.-G. Chen Q. Liu Y. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6900-6908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as well as inin vitro transient transfection studies have shown that important regulatory element(s) exist in the proximal promoter region of the HGF gene (16Liu Y.

In recent studies, we have partially characterized this region and revealed that it harbors a composite element located at position −260 to −230 bp from the transcriptional start site. We showed that this composite site binds to members of the nuclear factor 1 (NF1), activating protein-2 (AP2), and upstream stimulatory factor (USF) families to regulate HGF gene transcription. Functional studies show that NF1 and AP2 suppress the activity of the HGF gene promoter whereas USF has an activating function (21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Jiang J.-G. DeFrances M.C. Machen J. Johnson C. Zarnegar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we discovered that this region (−260 to −230) also harbors a functional PPARγ-responsive element at −246 to −233 bp from the +1 site of the HGF gene promoter having the sequence GGGCCAGGTGACCT. This is apparently a novel PPARγ site, which has an inverted RGGTCA motif with two spacer (IR2), rather than the well described DR1 (direct RGGTCA motif with one spacer) (23Mangelsdorf D.J.

Gel mobility shift and supershift assays using nuclear extracts from various sources such as whole liver, isolated non-parenchymal liver cells, fibroblast cell lines, and in vitro translated PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 protein demonstrated that this element binds to the nuclear receptor PPARγ family. Additionally, we found that COUP-TF, an orphan nuclear receptor, also binds to this nuclear hormone binding site and negates the stimulatory effects of PPARγ. Functional studies revealed that PPARγ, with its ligand, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, strongly stimulates HGF promoter activity. On the other hand, NF1 and AP2 transcription factors repress the stimulatory function of PPARγ by competing with PPARγ for their individual overlapping binding sites present within this composite element. Moreover, for the first time, our studies demonstrated that the PPARγ ligand, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, induces the expression of the endogenous HGF mRNA and protein in cultured fibroblasts. 0.7 mouse HGF-CAT promoter construct (−699 to +29 bp) was described in an earlier work from our laboratory (16Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.7 HGF-CAT/NF1-M, in which the NF1 binding site was mutated, was created by a sequential PCR mutagenesis method (21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). COUP-TFI and AP2 expression vectors were gifts from Dr. M.-J. Tsai, Baylor Medical College, and Dr. R. Buettner at the University of Regensberg, Germany, respectively. COUP-TFI in vitro expression vectors were from Dr. Xiao-Kan Zhang, University of San Diego, San Diego, CA.

Mouse PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and PPARα expression vectors, as well as RXRα, were generous gifts from Dr. Bruce Spiegelman, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Mouse NIH3T3 and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in the conditions suggested by the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown to ∼90% confluence, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped with a rubber policeman in the same buffer. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described previously (20Jiang J.-G. Bell A. Liu Y. Zarnegar R. J. Biol.

Rat liver non-parenchymal cells were prepared from collagenase-perfused rat liver followed by centrifugation at 50 × g to remove hepatocytes and were provided by Dr. G. K.

Rojkind from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and cultured as described previously (25Greenwel P. Rubin J. Schwartz M. Hertzberg E.L. Rojkind M. Lab.

For preparation of mouse liver nuclear protein extracts, livers were removed from mice and homogenized in buffer A containing protease inhibitors (20Jiang J.-G. Bell A. Liu Y. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3928-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nuclei were collected, and the nuclear proteins were extracted by the same method as described above. Mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h and then transfected with various mouse HGF promoter-CAT chimerical plasmids using the DNA calcium phosphate method according to the instructions of the CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (19Jiang J.-G. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5758-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase reference plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as an internal control for monitoring the transfection efficiency and normalizing the data accordingly. The amount of plasmid used per well in transfection was as follows: 5 μg of one chimerical CAT construct and 1 μg of pCH110. After coprecipitation of the cells with DNA-calcium phosphate for 16 h in serum-containing medium, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and kept in serum-containing medium for an additional 24 h before harvesting for determination of CAT activity. CAT activity was determined as described previously (19Jiang J.-G. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5758-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Jiang J.-G. Bell A. Liu Y. Zarnegar R.

Transfections were performed at least three separate times with two independent preparations of purified plasmid DNA. For cotransfection with COUP-TFI, AP2, NF1/X, RXRα, and PPARγ1 in 3T3-L1 cells, the amount of plasmid used per well in transfection was as follows: 5 μg of one chimerical CAT construct, 1 μg of pCH110, and different amounts of expression plasmids. The total amount of DNA per well was equilibrated by addition of corresponding empty (no insert) expression plasmid. The following oligonucleotides and antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and used in gel mobility shift and supershift assays: NF1, 5′-TTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA-3′; USF, 5′-CACCCGGTCACGTGGCCTACACC-3′; RXRE (DR-1), 5′-AGCTTCAGGTCAGAGGTCAGAGAGCT-3′; and anti-PPARγ, anti-PPARα, anti-Sp1, anti-RXRα, anti-thyroid hormone, anti-COUP-TF (which can react with both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII), anti-nerve growth factor-induced B, and anti-vitamin D receptor antibodies. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift assays were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by end labeling with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The labeled oligonucleotide probes were then gel-purified and used in gel mobility shift assays as described previously (21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Two μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as the nonspecific competitor in 10 μl of reaction mixture. When antibodies for supershift were used, they (1 μl) were incubated with nuclear extracts at room temperature for 20 min before performing the DNA binding shift assays. The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for another 20 min before loading onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gels. The amount of the nuclear protein extract used in each reaction was about 4 μg, and that of the labeled probe was between 0.2 and 0.4 ng. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was included in reaction mixtures. Gels were run in 0.5× TBE buffer (0.045 m Tris borate, 0.001 mEDTA) at a constant voltage of 210 V, dried, and autoradiographed with intensifying screens. Total RNA was isolated by using RNAzol B solution (Cinna/Biotecx, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. For quantitative RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in reverse transcriptase reaction and amplified for 25 cycles (the number of cycles were optimized to ensure that quantitative assessment could be performed) with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per the manufacturer's instructions using primers specific to HGF (sense, 5′-ATCAGACACCACACCGGCACAAAT-3′; antisense, 5′-GAAATAGGGCAATAATCCCAAGGAA-3′) or β-actin (CLONTECH Laboratories). β-actin served as an RNA integrity and normalization control. A transcription and translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was used to preparein vitro translated COUP-TFI, mouse PPARγ1, PPARγ2, PPARα, and mRXRα proteins from their cognate expression vectors driven by the T7 promoter (27Wu Q. Li Y. Liu R. Agadir A. Lee M.O. Liu Y. Zhang X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Transcription/translation reactions were carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume as recommended by the supplier (Promega). The authenticity of translation products was always confirmed in parallel experiments by including radioactive [35S]methionine and radioactive [35S]cysteine in the translation reaction followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Translation reactions using empty vectors were always included as negative controls in these analyses, including the gel shift assays, to exclude potential false signals. Translation products were stored at −80 °C. For each gel mobility shift assay, about 1 μl was used from each translated reaction. Our recent studies of the HGF promoter revealed that the proximal promoter region at position −260 to −230 is a multifunctional composite site to which different transcription factors such as NF1, USF, and AP2 can bind and regulate HGF gene transcription (21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Jiang J.-G. DeFrances M.C. Machen J. Johnson C. Zarnegar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During those studies, we found that distinct factor(s) also specifically bind to this element that are not related to the NF1, USF, or AP2 families (21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Within this 30-bp region (−260 to −230) of the promoter, we identified RGGTCA hexanucleotide motifs, which are potential binding sites for the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (23Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. et al.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar, 28Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). To further characterize the composite binding site and its cognate transcription factors, we radiolabeled the HGF promoter composite element (−260 to −230) with 32P and used this oligonucleotide as a probe to perform gel mobility band shift assays. In these experiments, nuclear protein extracts from 3T3-L1 and NIH3T3 fibroblast cell lines were used. As shown in Fig.1, this DNA element forms several specific complexes, of which the major complex(es) (shown by alarge arrow head) are efficiently abrogated by an excess amount of binding site for NF1 (compare lane 2 withlane 4 and lane 7 with lane 9, respectively). The remaining two complexes, which we have labeled in the figure as C1 and C2, formed by nuclear protein extract from NIH3T3 cells, are abolished by an excess amount of USF and nuclear hormone binding sites (RXRE), respectively (Fig. 1, lanes 9–11). We have previously shown by super shift assays that the major complex(es) C contain NF1 isoform(s) and that the C1 complex is composed of USF1 and USF2 isoforms (21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts do not have detectable C1 and only form the C2 complex, which is totally abrogated by RXRE (DR1, direct AGGTCA repeat with one spacing) (Fig. 1,lane 6). Thus, these results extend our previous observation and demonstrate that the complex C2 may contain nuclear hormone receptor(s), because it can be competed by a binding site having an AGGTCA motif (please see Ref. 21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To better define the binding site for complex C2, several mutant versions of the promoter element were synthesized (see Fig. 2E for nucleotide sequences) and used as competitors in electrophoretic mobility band shift assays using NF1-depleted 3T3-L1 nuclear protein extracts. As depicted in Fig. 2A, deletion of up to 11 base pairs from the 5′ region did not have a notable effect on the binding activity (because these oligonucleotides still effectively competed with the radiolabeled wild-type probe; Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4, oligonucleotides designated S1 and S2). However, when six nucleotides from the 3′ region were truncated, the resulting oligonucleotide totally lost its competitive ability (Fig.2A, lane 5). These results revealed that the binding site for C2 should be between −249 and −230. Close examination of the promoter element (−249 to −230) indicated that it harbors a potential RGGTCA inverted repetitive sequence separated by two nucleotides (IR2) (Fig. 2B, shown by arrows). The AGGTCA site is known as the perfect nuclear hormone binding half-site, although in almost every case, it is a variation of this sequence known as imperfect motif (28Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Indeed, comparison of the nucleotide sequence of this 31-base pair element among the mouse, rat, and human HGF promoters revealed perfect conservation of this site (Fig. 2B). To define the binding site for the C2 complex in more detail, several mutated oligonucleotides were synthesized and used in gel shift competition assays, as above, using fibroblast nuclear extracts (Fig. 2, C and D). Mutations in the AGGTCA half-site in the 3′ region abolished the binding capability (mutant oligonucleotides named M4 and M5 in which AGGTCA is mutated to AGGGAC and CTTTCA, respectively) (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 7). Conservative mutations in the 5′-half-site RGGTCA motif (GGGCCA to AAGCCA or GGGAAA and also mutations in the two spacers (GG to AT) (oligonucleotides named M1, M2, and M3, respectively)) did not dramatically affect binding, because these oligonucleotides still competed with the labeled probe for binding (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–5). However, mutation in the 5′-half-site that totally changes the hexanucleotide from GGGCCA to TTTGGC completely abolished its binding activity (Fig.2D, lane 8). To define the role of the two spacers in the IR2 configuration, we generated additional mutant oligonucleotides as indicated in Fig. 2E and used them as competitors. As shown in Fig. 2D, deleting of one or both spacer nucleotides (GG) dramatically reduced the binding activity (Fig.2D, lanes 5 and 6). On the other hand, mutating the two putative spacers from GG to TT did not affect the binding activity (Fig. 2D, lane 7). These results implied that the RGGTCA half-sites and the two-spacer configuration are important for binding of complex C2 to this region. As mentioned above, it is well known that the RGGTCA is the binding half-site for some members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (23Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. et al.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar, 28Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Therefore, several antibodies against the members of the nuclear receptor superfamily were used to identify complex C2 by supershift assays using fibroblast nuclear extract; these antibodies were against retinoic acid receptor, OR-1, thyroid hormone receptor, COUP-TF, vitamin D receptor, and nerve growth factor-induced B. None of these antibodies reacted with the C2 complex (data not shown). Further analysis using additional antibodies against other nuclear receptors revealed that anti-PPARγ antibody reacted with and totally supershifted complex C2 formed by the fibroblast nuclear extracts (Fig.3, lanes 2 and 6). Neither anti-RXRα antibody nor an unrelated antibody (anti-Sp1; see Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 8) reacted with complex C2. Taken together, the data clearly show that PPARγ binds to the HGF promoter element located at −246 to −233 bp from the transcription start site.Figure 2Characterization of the binding motif(s) for the nuclear receptor in the HGF promoter regulatory region.A, truncated (shortened from 5′ or 3′ ends as indicated inE) oligonucleotides S1, S2, and S3 corresponding to the promoter element were synthesized and used as competitors in gel mobility competition assays using NF1-depleted nuclear protein extract from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and the wild-type HGF promoter element (−260 to −230) as a probe. B, analysis of the potential RGGTCA motifs within the regulatory region (from −260 to −230 bp) of the mouse HGF gene promoter. RGGTCA inverted repeats separated by two nucleotides (IR2) were identified as indicated by arrows. For comparison, the nucleotide sequences of the rat and human HGF promoter element are also presented. The functional binding sites for NF1, USF, AP2, and an E box (i.e. USF binding site) are also shown. C, mutated oligonucleotides M1–M5 (for sequence information, please see E) were synthesized and used as competitors as described under A. D, the S2 oligonucleotide was labeled and used as a probe with NIH3T3 nuclear extracts to further define the IR2 site. The nuclear extract used in this gel shift assay was not depleted of NF1. The DR1 site (direct AGGTCA motif with one spacing) was also used as competitor.E, the nucleotide sequences of the wild-type and mutant versions of the promoter element used to define the PPARγ binding site are shown. The mutated nucleotides are underlined. C2 denotes complex C2.

Because the PPARγ binding site overlaps with those of NF1 and USF and because we have shown that NF1 strongly suppresses HGF gene promoter activity (21Jiang J.-G. Gao B. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2786-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we decided to eliminate the interference of NF1 with the PPARγ function. To do this, two different HGF-CAT constructs were generated and used: the wild-type 0.7 HGF-CAT construct and its mutated version, the 0.7 HGF-CAT/NF1-M construct, in which the NF1 site is mutated but the PPARγ binding site remains intact. Another HGF-CAT construct, 0.1 HGF-CAT, which does not have the NF1 and PPARγ binding sites, was also used as a negative control. We selected the 3T3-L1 cell line because the nuclear protein extract from this cell line did not form a USF complex (C1) (see Figs.1 and 3) with this element that may interfere with the PPARγ function. As shown in Fig. 4, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, the PPARγ ligand, significantly induced the promoter activities of both the 0.7 HGF-CAT and the 0.7 HGF-CAT/NF1-M constructs but not the 0.1 HGF-CAT construct (Fig. 4).

In the case of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) signaling, heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) are involved through interaction with both FGF2 and its receptors (FGFRs) in assembling a tertiary complex and modulating FGF2 activity. Biochemical data have suggested different modes of HLGAG-induced FGF2 dimerization involving specific protein-protein contacts. In addition, several recent x-ray crystallography studies of FGF·FGFR and FGF·FGFR·HLGAG complexes have revealed other modes of molecular assemblage, with no FGF-FGF contacts. All these different biochemical and structural findings have clarified less and in fact raised more questions as to which mode of FGF2 dimerization, if any, is essential for signaling.

Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6113) Google Scholar). The FGF family consists of at least 20 members, including the well characterized acidic FGF (FGF1) and basic FGF (FGF2), both of which are potent mitogens of many cell types (4Gospodarowicz D. Ferrara N. Schweigerer L. Neufeld G. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 5Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). FGF signaling is mediated primarily through high affinity interactions with cell-surface FGF receptors (FGFRs), transmembrane polypeptides composed of immunoglobulin-like and tyrosine kinase domains (6Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 7Wilkie A.O. Morriss-Kay G.M. Jones E.Y. Heath J.K. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). FGF binding to different isoforms of FGFR is believed to trigger receptor dimerization, followed by transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues (8Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In turn, phosphorylated tyrosine residues activate other signaling proteins, leading to cell proliferation, migration, and survival. For proper presentation to FGFR, FGF2 and other members of the FGF family interact with heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs). Consisting of a disaccharide repeat of glucosamine and uronic acid, HLGAGs are heterogeneous in length (10–100 disaccharide units) and chemical composition (including differential sulfation, acetylation, and epimerization of each disaccharide unit) (9Gallagher J.T.

Found in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface as part of proteoglycans, HLGAGs modulate FGF2 activity by low affinity interactions with specific FGF2- and FGFR-binding sites (13Faham S.

HLGAGs promote FGF2-induced activation of FGFR through a number of mechanisms, including regulating the diffusion rate of FGF2 (16Dowd C.J. Cooney C.L. Nugent M.A. J. Biol.

Another hypothesis is that FGF2 binding to HLGAGs induces ligand oligomerization, which in turn induces dimerization and transphosphorylation of FGFR. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that HLGAGs facilitate FGF oligomerization (21Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 22Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Waksman G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar); however, due to a lack of direct evidence, it is unclear whether this biochemical phenomenon is important for FGF2 signaling. Furthermore, different modes of FGF-FGF interactions have been observed in various studies, drawing into question what modes of FGF oligomerization, if any, are biologically relevant. Examination of apo-FGF and FGF·HLGAG crystal structures has led to the proposal of preferential FGF2 self-association in acis-mode, with substantial protein-protein interactions between the adjacent molecules (24Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); and biochemical studies (including chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation, and mass spectrometry) support this model (22Herr A.B.

A. 1999; 96: 1892-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, NMR studies predict a different mode of FGF oligomerization, viz. a symmetrical FGF2 dimer with possible disulfide bond formation between two surface cysteines (27Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P. Kitchen D. Bohlen P. Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recently solved FGF1·decasaccharide co-crystal points to an FGFtrans-dimer involving no FGF-FGF contacts (28DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), a mechanism for dimerization that may or may not extend to other members of the FGF family, viz. FGF2. More recently, several crystallography studies of FGF·FGFR and FGF·FGFR·HLGAG complexes, including FGF2·FGFR1 (29Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), FGF1·FGFR1 (30Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M.

A. 2000; 97: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), have revealed assemblages of two FGFs bound to two FGFRs, with no FGF-FGF contacts in the complex. Thus, conflicting biochemical and biophysical evidence makes it unclear whether FGF oligomerization is important for signaling through FGFR and, if so, which dimerization mode of FGF, involving either protein contact or no protein contact, mediates FGF signaling. This problem is compounded when one considers that the two recent crystal structures of the ternary complex involving FGF, FGFR, and HLGAG (32Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A.

In this study, we apply conformational studies and molecular engineering techniques to systematically explore proposed modes of FGF2 oligomerization and to evaluate the importance of FGF-FGF interactions in signaling. Together, our data suggest that an FGF2 dimer involving substantial noncovalent protein-protein contact is readily formed and mediates signaling. Ampicillin, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 1,10-phenanthroline, sodium chlorate, and dithiothreitol were from Sigma. Human recombinant wild-type FGF and anti-FGF2 antibody were gifts from Scios Nova (Mountain View, CA). The pET14b expression vector variant and FGFR were a generous gift from D. M. Ornitz (Washington University). Heparin sodium from porcine intestinal mucosa was from Kabi Pharmacia (Franklin, OH). Ready-Gel (15% polyacrylamide gel) and Bradford assay, immunoblot assay, and silver staining kits were from Bio-Rad. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out through a two-step PCR procedure as described previously (34Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-185Google Scholar). PCR products were subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Inserts were subcloned into a variant of the pET14b expression vector through the NdeI/SpeI sites. To express recombinant protein, an overnight culture of BL21 cells was transferred to 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (400 mg/liter) and allowed to grow with shaking at 37 °C until cell density reached A600 ∼ 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce protein expression for 2 h. Protein purification by nickel chromatography was performed as previously described (35Ernst S.

Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, and concentration was determined by Bradford assay using recombinant wild-type FGF2 as a control. Purified protein was buffer-exchanged into HEPES with 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Oxidative cross-linking was performed by incubating 50 μg of protein (30 μm final concentration) with 750 μm Cu2+phenanthroline (made from a 1:1 mixture of 25 mmCuSO4 and 130 mm phenanthroline) in a 100-μl reaction volume at room temperature for 10 min. Longer incubation times (up to 2 h) did not significantly increase the amount of oligomer formed. For heparin treatment, the protein was incubated with 3 μm heparin for 1 h prior to cross-linking. The protein/heparin ratio was 10:1, which was previously shown to be optimal for FGF2 dimer formation (25Davis J.C. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raj P.A. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other reaction conditions are indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. The reaction was terminated with 0.1m EDTA and 10 mm iodoacetic acid. Cross-linked products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 15% nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by silver staining. Conformational studies were performed with the Insight II package (Molecular Simulations, Burlington, MA) on a Silicon Graphics workstation. The coordinates of the FGF2 dimer in the FGF2·FGFR1 crystal structure (code 1CVS) and that of free FGF2 (code 4FGF) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. The sequential dimer was constructed from code 4FGF by translating the coordinates along the 31-Å axis. The linker used in the experiment contained a tripeptide with the sequence GAL. However, since the N and C termini of FGF2 in most of the crystal structures are disordered, the modeled linker included the tripeptide sequence and the disordered residues of FGF2. The sequence of the linker was of the form Cterm-GAL-Nterm, where Cterm and Nterm are the disordered C and N termini of FGF2, respectively. By deleting residues from the disordered N terminus, linkers of different lengths could be obtained. The most optimal structure for each of the linkers was obtained as follows. Combinations of structures for the linker were generated from the C terminus of one of the FGF2 monomers to the N terminus of the other monomer in the receptor-bound and sequential dimer using the homology modeling of Insight II. A good starting structure from the randomly generated linker structures in each FGF2 dimer was subjected to energy minimization with the Newton-Raphson method until convergence. Potentials were assigned using the consistent valence force field. Interchanging the N and C termini among monomers did not lead to significant changes in the model of the cross-linked dimer; and therefore, it did not affect the interpretation of the results. Based on the results from the conformational studies, the two DNA sequences of FGF2 were ligated and subcloned into an expression vector as outlined in Fig.4 A. NdeI/SacI sites were introduced by PCR 5′ and 3′ to the first sequence, whereas SacI/SpeI sites were introduced to the second. Both the first and second sequences encode FGF2 with the first nine N-terminal residues removed. To facilitate purification of dFGF2, a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site were introduced by PCR 5′ to the first sequence, and a T7 tag and another thrombin cleavage site were introduced similarly 3′ to the second sequence. Upon subcloning of the PCR product of the first sequence into pCR2.1-TOPO (which carries an internal SpeI site), a SacI/SpeI double digest was performed to linearize the vector. The PCR product from the second sequence was subcloned similarly, and the insert was excised by aSacI/SpeI double digest. Ligation between the linearized vector and the insert from the second sequence resulted in a fused DNA of two tandemly linked FGF2 DNA sequences. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the identities of the fused DNA sequences. Protein expression and purification were performed as described above, except that a T7 affinity column (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as described by the manufacturer after nickel chromatography. Biochemical studies were performed to ensure that dFGF2 was folded properly. Immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody raised against the native form of wild-type FGF2 showed that the eluants from the nickel and T7 affinity chromatographies were recognized by the antibody in a concentration-dependent fashion (data not shown). dFGF2 was concentrated to 1 μm and buffer-exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2). CD spectroscopy of dFGF2 was performed in a quartz cell with a 1-mm path length (Starnz, Atascadero, CA) at room temperature. Data were recorded in an average of 20 scans between 195 and 260 nm on an Aviv 62SD spectropolarimeter. MALDI mass spectrometry was completed by diluting a solution of FGF2, FGFR1, and a heparinase-derived HLGAG decasaccharide (consisting of a trisulfated disaccharide repeat unit) to 20 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). To 1 μl of this sample was added an equimolar amount of the purified dFGF2 construct. The sample was allowed to come to equilibrium for 30 min at 4 °C. 1 μl of the sample was then immediately spotted on the MALDI target with 1 μl of a saturated sinapinic acid solution in 50% acetonitrile. After drying, the sample was washed with water, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and subjected to mass spectral analysis. MALDI mass spectra were acquired in the linear mode using a Voyager Elite Reflectron time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) fitted with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Delayed extraction was used to increase resolution (25 kV, grid at 91%, guide wire at 0.25%, pulse delay of 350 ns, and low mass gate at 2000). SMCs isolated from bovine aorta were maintained in propagation medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. The proliferation assay of SMCs, as measured by tritium incorporation, was performed as follows. Cells were split at 95% confluence and seeded onto 24-well plates at 1 ml/well. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved in medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine calf serum for another 24 h. An appropriate amount of growth factor was added to eight wells for each protein concentration tested. 75 mmsodium chlorate was added to half of the wells for each condition. After 21 h, [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was applied to each well and incubated for 3 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH was subsequently added. The contents of each well were transferred to scintillation vials filled with 5 ml of ScintiSafe Plus 50% scintillation fluid (Fisher, Fair Lawn, NJ). Total [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. HUVECs in passage 3 or 4 were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in medium M199 (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, HUVECs were trypsinized briefly at 37 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were seeded at a density of ∼1–2 × 104/well onto 96-well plates coated with fibronectin-like polymer (Sigma). Appropriate amounts of growth factor were added to the wells using a multichannel pipette. Each experimental condition was tested in six different wells. Cell viability was accessed after 18 h using a cell titer 96 proliferation assay (Promega) by measuring absorbance at 490 nm. Pellets containing sucralfate with FGF2 or sucralfate alone were prepared as described by Kenyon et al. (37Kenyon B.M. Voest E.E. Chen C.C. Flynn E. Folkman J. D'Amato R.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1625-1632PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, suspensions of sterile FGF2 solution containing appropriate amounts of FGF2 (5 and 20 μg) and dFGF2 (5 μg) were prepared and speed-vacuumed for 5 min. 10 μl of 12% Hydron in ethanol was added, and the suspension was deposited onto an autoclave-sterilized nylon mesh. The mesh was stacked between two layers of fiber covered with a thin film of Hydron. After drying on a sterile Petri dish for 30 min, the fibers of the mesh were pulled apart. With the aid of a dissecting microscope, uniformly sized pellets were selected from ∼200 pellets produced. Each pellet contained ∼1.5 and 6 pmol of FGF2 or 0.7 pmol of dFGF2. Control pellets containing no FGF2 were also prepared. For pellet implantation, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (400–450 g;n = 5) were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) or xylazine (10 mg/kg). Using an operating microscope, an intrastromal linear keratotomy was performed with a surgical blade (Bard-Parker No. 15, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) parallel to and 2 mm away from the limbus. A lamellar micropocket was dissected toward the limbus. A single pellet was placed at the base of the pocket with jeweler's forceps. On day 6 after the implantation, the corneal angiogenesis was photographed with a slit lamp, and the area of angiogenesis was assessed as described (37Kenyon B.M. Voest E.E. Chen C.C. Flynn E. Folkman J. D'Amato R.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1625-1632PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of FGF2 has been thoroughly elucidated by a variety of biophysical techniques, including solution NMR and crystallography (13Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R.

All have pointed to roughly the same basic structure for FGF2, whether free, bound to its HLGAG ligand, or complexed with the receptor. An analysis of all of these structures suggests that three orthogonal surfaces exist on FGF2 (Fig.1). As indicated in Fig. 1, the first surface has been implicated in binding of FGF2 to its high affinity protein receptor. Through rigorous biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis studies, a second orthogonal surface has been implicated in HLGAG binding. The third surface, orthogonal to both of the first two, has been implicated in FGF2 oligomerization. Biochemical and structural studies have suggested different modes of FGF2 oligomerization within the third surface both in the presence and absence of HLGAGs (24Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P.

Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As schematically represented in Fig.2, three modes of HLGAG-induced FGF2 dimerization have been proposed. Specific protein-protein contacts are involved in both the sequential and symmetrical FGF2 dimers (Fig.2 A and C, respectively), but not in the HLGAG-bridged or sandwich dimer (Fig. 2 B). It was earlier demonstrated that FGF2 was capable of dimerization and oligomerization in the absence of heparin using an amine-specific chemical cross-linker with an 11-Å spacer (25Davis J.C. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raj P.A. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is not consistent with the proposed HLGAG-bridged dimer in Fig. 2 B since, in this FGF sandwich model, there are no residues on neighboring FGF2 molecules proximal to one another and thus available for covalent cross-linking with an 11-Å spacer (additional experiments described below also are not consistent with this dimer mode). Therefore, we focused our initial experiments on determining whether either of the dimer models involving protein contacts (represented in Fig. 2, A and C) is an accurate representation of FGF2 dimerization mediated by HLGAGs. To establish the presence of proximal contacts between FGF2 molecules and to distinguish between different modes of FGF2 dimerization, we performed oxidative cross-linking experiments targeting the cysteine residues of FGF2 using copper phenanthroline, an oxidative agent used widely for disulfide bond formation (41Bisaccia F. Zara V. Capobianco L. Iacobazzi V. Mazzeo M. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This approach is anticipated to probe for atomic distance interactions between the FGF molecules through the introduction of a disulfide bond between two FGF2 molecules. As discussed below, by taking advantage of the surface-exposed cysteine residues in FGF2 and through rationally engineering cysteine residues on the surface of FGF2, we systematically explored possible modes of FGF2 dimerization. There are four cysteines in FGF2, two of which are surface-exposed (Cys69and Cys87), and two of which are buried in the protein core (Cys25 and Cys92). The surface positions of the two exposed cysteines (Cys69 and Cys87) in wild-type FGF2 are related to each other by 90°. Taking advantage of the surface-exposed cysteine residues in the wild-type structure of FGF2, we performed oxidative cross-linking studies to test the proposed symmetrical mode of FGF2 dimerization in Fig. 2 C, as this model predicts facile cross-linking between two FGF2 molecules (27Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P. Kitchen D. Bohlen P. Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Under mild oxidative conditions, wild-type FGF2 showed very little oligomer formation in the presence and absence of heparin (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2). (Several control experiments were performed to ensure authenticity of the data and are described below.) The absence of significant dimers or oligomers suggests either that the FGF-FGF interface does not involve molecular contacts or that the contacts are such that the two surface-exposed cysteines are not at the dimer interface. Our observation is not consistent with the proposed symmetrical mode of FGF2 dimerization wherein dimerization is mediated by disulfide bond formation between Cys69 of each monomer (27Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P. Kitchen D. Bohlen P. Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In a previous study (24Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we had performed an extensive analysis of all FGF2 crystal structures available at that time and identified protein-protein interfaces (p-p′ and q-q′) that were conserved along the two unit-cell axes. Based on our analysis, we had proposed an FGF2 dimerization model in which FGF2 molecules were preferentially self-associated in a sequential fashion and HLGAG binding stabilized FGF2 dimers and oligomers that were subsequently presented to FGFR for signaling.

Incubation of dark-adapted bovine rod outer segments with [γ-32P]ATP led to RGS9-1 phosphorylation by an endogenous kinase in rod outer segment membranes, with an average stoichiometry of 0.2–0.45 mol of phosphates/mol of RGS9-1. Mass spectrometry revealed a single major site of phosphorylation, Ser475. The kinase responsible catalyzed robust phosphorylation of recombinant RGS9-1 and not of an S475A mutant. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the region surrounding Ser475 was also phosphorylated, and a similar peptide with the S475A substitution inhibited RGS9-1 phosphorylation. The RGS9-1 kinase is a peripheral membrane protein that co-purifies with rhodopsin in sucrose gradients and can be extracted in buffers of high ionic strength. It is not inhibited or activated significantly by a panel of inhibitors or activators of protein kinase A, protein kinase G, rhodopsin kinase, CaM kinase II, casein kinase II, or cyclin-dependent kinase 5, at concentrations 50 or more times higher than their reported IC50 orKi values. It was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I and by lowering Ca2+ to nanomolar levels with EGTA; however, it was not stimulated by the addition of phorbol ester, under conditions that significantly enhanced rhodopsin phosphorylation. A monoclonal antibody specific for the Ser475-phosphorylated form of RGS9-1 recognized RGS9-1 in immunoblots of dark-adapted mouse retina. Retinas from light-adapted mice had much lower levels of RGS9-1 phosphorylation. Thus, RGS9-1 is phosphorylated on Ser475 in vivo, and the phosphorylation level is regulated by light and by [Ca2+], suggesting the importance of the modification in light adaptation."

Adenovirus-mediated expression of apoA-IFIN decreased apoA-I and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in both wild-type C57BL/6J mice and in apoA-I-deficient mice expressing native human apoA-I (hapoA-I). Interestingly, apoA-IFIN was degraded in the plasma, and the extent of proteolysis correlated with the most significant reductions in murine apoA-I concentrations. ApoA-IFIN had impaired activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in vitro compared with hapoA-I, but in a mixed lipoprotein preparation consisting of both hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN there was only a moderate reduction in the activation of this enzyme. Importantly, secretion of apoA-I was also decreased from primary apoA-I-deficient hepatocytes when hapoA-I was co-expressed with apoA-IFIN following infection with recombinant adenoviruses, a condition that mimics secretion in heterozygotes.

However, the complex and often poorly understood etiology for variations in HDL-C concentrations within the general population has made the therapeutic control of HDL levels an elusive target to date. This is attributed to the intricate nature of HDL metabolism that involves many components including the major HDL structural protein apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and multiple factors required for cholesteryl ester (CE) formation, lipolysis, lipid transfer, cellular lipid efflux, and cell surface interactions (reviewed in Refs.2Breslow, J.

Defective clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) is recognized as a major determinant of HDL-C concentrations. Recessive mutations in lipoprotein lipase and its major activator protein apolipoprotein C-II, which result in impaired hydrolysis of TRL, also contribute to low HDL-C concentrations. Also the efficient conversion of free cholesterol (FC) to CE on HDL by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is necessary for HDL maturation and depends on apoA-I as its physiological activator (reviewed in Refs. 2Breslow, J.

Many apoA-I mutations have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 3Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 853-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Calabresi L. Franceschini G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but particularly interesting among them are those associated with a dominant FHA phenotype, such as apoA-I Finland (apoA-IFIN). This mutation was originally identified in a Finnish kindred and results from a Leu to Arg substitution at amino acid (aa) 159 (15Miettinen H.E. Gylling H. Miettinen T.A. Viikari J. Paulin L. Kontula K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These individuals are heterozygous carriers of this mutation and yet have HDL-C and apoA-I concentrations that are 20 and 25‥ of the normal plasma concentrations, respectively (15Miettinen H.E. Gylling H. Miettinen T.A. Viikari J. Paulin L. Kontula K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cause for this dominant negative effect on HDL-C concentrations remains largely unknown. ApoA-IFIN was shown to have reduced LCAT activation compared with native human apoA-I (hapoA-I) (16Miettinen H.E. Jauhiainen M. Gylling H. Ehnholm S. Palomaki A. Miettinen T.A. Kontula K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3021-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it has not been established whether this mutant can inhibit LCAT activation by hapoA-I and confer its dominant negative phenotype in this manner. We present the results of a combined in vivo, ex vivo, andin vitro study of the mechanisms responsible for the dominant negative effects on HDL-C brought about by apoA-IFIN, and we demonstrate that the mutation exerts its effects at multiple levels.RESULTSSince apoA-IFIN causes hypoalphalipoproteinemia in carriers of this mutation, we first sought to reproduce this phenotype in a mouse model by de novo expression of apoA-IFIN. This was accomplished by two different approaches. First, wild-type C57BL/6J mice were injected with either the apoA-IFIN.Ad5 or the hapoA-I.Ad5, and their effects on mapoA-I (Fig. 1) and HDL-C concentrations were compared. The concentrations of mapoA-I were decreased significantly by apoA-IFIN (Fig. 1 B, lower right panel, lanes 1–4) but not by hapoA-I (Fig.1 A, lower right panel, lanes 1–4). Interestingly, evidence of apoA-IFIN proteolysis was seen in the plasma (Fig. 1 B, upper right panel), and the greatest decreases in mapoA-I concentrations correlated with plasma samples that had the most significant amounts of apoA-IFIN degradation (Fig. 1 B, lower right panel, lanes 3and 4). Overall, low concentrations of circulating apoA-IFIN (50 ± 4.6 mg/dl) caused a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.03) in mapoA-I concentrations (to 32 ± 22‥ of pre-injected values) that was not found for higher and more physiological concentrations (141 ± 27 mg/dl) of hapoA-I (p = 0.14) (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, apoA-IFIN decreased the HDL-C concentrations and caused a remodeling of HDL in these mice converting the large HDL2 to smaller HDL3 (not shown). This is similar to what was observed when hapoA-I and apoA-IFINwere co-expressed in apoA-I-deficient mice (below).To confirm these results and more closely mimic the human heterozygous state, apoA-I-deficient mice were co-injected with the hapoA-I.Ad5 and the apoA-IFIN.Ad5, and the circulating apoA-I and total cholesterol concentrations were compared with mice injected with either the hapoA-I.Ad5 or the apoA-IFIN.Ad5 alone (Fig.2). Mice injected with the hapoA-I.Ad5 had high circulating concentrations of hapoA-I that reached physiological concentrations by 4 days and peaked at high levels between 7 and 9 days before returning to lower concentrations at 12 days (Fig. 2 A, ●). In contrast, co-expression of hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN (Fig. 2 A, ▴) resulted in only moderate concentrations of circulating apoA-I (50–70 mg/dl) that were 3–8-fold lower in these mice throughout the time course of expression compared with hapoA-I. In fact, the apoA-I concentrations following co-expression of the two proteins were similar to mice expressing only apoA-IFIN (Fig. 2 A, ▪), except that apoA-I levels were sustained longer in the plasma when both proteins were present. The increases in total cholesterol concentrations were confined to the HDL pool (ρ > 1.06 g/ml) and paralleled the expression of the human apoA-I proteins in these mice (Fig.2 B). Native hapoA-I increased the HDL-TC concentrations reaching a maximum between 7 and 9 days (Fig. 2 B, ●), whereas co-expression of hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN had only a moderate effect on the HDL-TC concentrations (2–3-fold increase) (Fig.2 B, ▴) throughout the time course (TableI). ApoA-IFIN (Fig.2 B, ▪) produced a similar effect, but the return to base-line plasma cholesterol concentrations occurred more rapidly (by 6–8 days) (Table I) and followed the more transient expression of this protein in apoA-I-deficient mice.Figure 2ApoA-I-deficient mice co-expressing hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN or apoA-IFIN alone have greatly reduced apoA-I and HDL total cholesterol concentrations compared with mice expressing only hapoA-I over the time course of expression.ApoA-I-deficient mice were pre-bled and then injected with either 2 × 109 pfu of the hapoA-I.Ad5 alone (3 males), 1 × 109 pfu of each of the hapoA-I.Ad5 and the apoA-IFIN.Ad5 (2 males and 1 female), and for comparison 2 × 109 pfu of the apoA-IFIN.Ad5 alone (3 females) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, the apoA-I concentrations in mouse plasma samples were measured with a standard radioimmunoassay as described previously (19Bergeron J.

Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6477-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In mice expressing hapoA-I alone (●), the apoA-I concentrations reach physiological concentrations 4 days following injections of the adenoviruses and peaks between days 7 and 9 before returning to physiological concentrations once again by day 12. In contrast, mice co-expressing hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN (▴) have a delayed appearance of apoA-I in the plasma, and the apoA-I concentrations attained are much lower. The apoA-I concentrations are more similar to mice expressing only apoA-IFIN (▪), except the duration of expression is sustained longer in mice expressing both proteins.B, the plasma total cholesterol concentrations were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the increases following apoA-I expression are confined to the HDL pool. Mice expressing hapoA-I alone (●) have large increases in HDL total cholesterol that parallel the apoA-I concentrations over the time course of expression. Mice co-expressing hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN (▴) or apoA-IFIN alone (▪) have only moderate increases in HDL total cholesterol concentrations, which demonstrate the dominant negative effect of this human mutation in these mice. The transient expression of apoA-IFIN is paralleled by a return to normal plasma cholesterol concentrations in these mice 6 days post-injection (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IThe changes in apoA-I-deficient plasma lipid concentrations as a function of time of expression of either hapoA-I or apoA-I FIN alone or co-expression of hapoA-I and apoA-I FINApoA-I-expressedLipids (mg/dl)Total cholesterolFree cholesterolCholesteryl esterPhospholipidDay 2Day 4Day 8Day 2Day 4Day 8Day 2Day 4Day 8Day 2Day 4Day 8mg/dlHapoA-I (n = 3)138 ± 20157 ± 41-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.302 ± 151-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.56 ± 958 ± 51-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.119 ± 111-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.82 ± 1299 ± 71-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.182 ± 61-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.268 ± 43374 ± 491-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.612 ± 281-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.ApoA-IFIN(n = 3)79 ± 1253 ± 41-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.42 ± 11-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.48 ± 1730 ± 826 ± 21-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.31 ± 523 ± 41-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.16 ± 31-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.164 ± 20160 ± 22120 ± 231-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.HapoA-I/apoA-IFIN (n = 3)79 ± 2873 ± 111-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.82 ± 81-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.1-cStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) for hapoA-I/apoA-IFIN mice compared with apoA-IFIN mice.41 ± 833 ± 41-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.41 ± 61-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.38 ± 2039 ± 81-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.41 ± 61-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.1-cStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) for hapoA-I/apoA-IFIN mice compared with apoA-IFIN mice.174 ± 33170 ± 241-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.221 ± 261-aStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from pre-injected mice.1-bStatistically significant lipid concentrations (p < 0.05) from the hapoA-I.Ad5-injected mice.Pre-injected (n = 9)40 ± 623 ± 318 ± 4102 ± 13The increases in plasma lipid concentrations were found in HDL fractions (ρ > 1.06 g/ml).

Open table in a new tab A more detailed analysis of the effects of the different adenovirus injections on plasma lipid concentrations in these mice is provided in Table I. Shown are the changes for 3 different days (2, 4, and 8 days) and are representative of early, intermediate, and late time points following injections of the adenoviruses. Statistically significant increases (p < 0.05) in all pre-injected plasma lipid concentrations occur following expression of hapoA-I by 4 days post-injection and are maintained at day 8 and beyond. Expression of apoA-IFIN or co-expression of hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN, on the other hand, did not produce these large changes in plasma lipid concentrations. Therefore, by 4 days post-injections there were significant differences in plasma lipid concentrations between mice expressing apoA-IFIN alone or co-expressing hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN and mice expressing hapoA-I (p < 0.05). Co-expressing hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN produced significant changes by 8 days post-injections compared with mice expressing apoA-IFINalone (p < 0.05) due to the return to base-line plasma lipid concentrations in mice expressing only the mutant protein.HDL size and charge were also monitored 4 days following injections of the different adenoviruses (Fig. 3). Interestingly, small HDL only were formed (8–9 nm) in apoA-I-deficient mice injected with the hapoA-I.Ad5 and the apoA-IFIN.Ad5 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 5) similar in size although somewhat larger than in mice injected with the apoA-IFIN.Ad5 (lane 6). The absence of large HDL in mice expressing both proteins is consistent with that found in heterozygous carriers of the apoA-IFIN mutation (16Miettinen H.E. Jauhiainen M. Gylling H. Ehnholm S. Palomaki A. Miettinen T.A. Kontula K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3021-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, hapoA-I formed mostly large HDL2 in these mice (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 4). Despite the decrease in HDL pool size and concentrations, both α- and pre-β-migrating HDL were present in mice co-expressing apoA-IFIN and hapoA-I (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 5) as was found for mice expressing only hapoA-I (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, apoA-IFIN was found predominantly as pre-β-HDL with a minor population that migrated between the pre-β- and α-migrating species. Negative staining electron microscopy also revealed that discoidal HDL were formed by apoA-IFIN (not shown) similar to what we observed previously for apoA-I central domain deletion mutants (18McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5043-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Of note, the antibodies used (which were generated against lipid-free apoA-I) reacted much more strongly with pre-β-HDL on transferred agarose gels, and no quantitative information on HDL charge distribution is implied or can be determined from this figure (Fig. 3 B). As such, there appeared to be more pre-β- than α-migrating HDL in mice expressing hapoA-I than was the case. Most of the hapoA-I was α-migrating as demonstrated by lipid and protein staining (not shown), large (Fig. 3 A) and very buoyant (Fig. 4). The pre-β-HDL containing the human apoA-I proteins in these mice were predominantly larger pre-β2-HDL that co-migrated with the α-HDL on native gels (Fig. 3 A). There were also smaller amounts of lipid-poor pre-β1-HDL that appeared on the native gels (bottom of Fig. 3 A) and when HDL were isolated by discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 4).Figure 3Differences in HDL size and charge are observed in apoA-I-deficient mice expressing either hapoA-I or apoA-IFIN alone or co-expressing hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN. Plasma was isolated from apoA-I-deficient mice 4 days following injections with the hapoA-I.Ad5, the apoA-IFIN.Ad5, or both as described for Fig. 2.A, plasma was subjected to 4–20‥ nondenaturing PAGGE and then to Western blot analysis following transfer to nitrocellulose.Lanes 1 and 7 contain biotinylated high molecular weight markers of known hydrodynamic diameters as indicated on theleft; lanes 2 and 4, hapoA-I plasma (0.33 μl); lanes 3 and 5,hapoA-I/apoA-IFIN plasma (1 μl); and lane 6,apoA-IFIN plasma (1 μl). Large HDL2 are absent in mice that co-express apoA-IFIN and hapoA-I, which mimic the phenotype observed in individuals heterozygous for this mutation. Mice expressing hapoA-I alone form predominantly large HDL2 species, whereas mice expressing apoA-IFINform smaller HDL (8–9 nm) similar in size to mice co-expressing hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN. B, the charge of the apoA-I lipoproteins was determined by Western blot analysis of an agarose gel electrophoresis. The antibodies react much more strongly with the pre-β-HDL, and no quantitative information on HDL charge distribution is implied from this figure. However, apoA-I circulates as a mixture of α- and pre-β-migrating HDL following expression of hapoA-I alone (1 μl, lanes 2 and 3) or following co-expression of hapoA-I and apoA-IFIN (5 μl,lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, apoA-IFIN (1 μl, lane 6) is found predominantly as pre-β-HDL with minor population that migrates in between the α- and pre-β-species. Lipid-free apoA-I (0.2 μg) prepared from human plasma (lane 1) is run as a standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Proteolysis of apoA-IFIN is confined to HDL3 and lipid-poor species in the plasma of apoA-I-deficient mice expressing this human apoA-I mutant.ApoA-I-deficient mice were maintained on the Teklad Western diet for 3 weeks prior to injection of either the hapoA-I and the apoA-IFIN recombinant adenoviruses (2 × 109 pfu). A, plasma isolated from apoA-I-deficient mice at the given days following injections with either the hapoA-I.Ad5 or the apoA-IFIN.Ad5 was subjected to 12‥ SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Western blot analysis. Proteolysis of apoA-IFIN is detected in the plasma, and the size of the major fragment (→) was found to be 18.5 kDa. This is the size predicted for an N-terminal fragment if cleavage occurs at or very close to the site of the apoA-IFINmutation (antibodies used recognize N-terminal epitopes on apoA-I).B, selected HDL fractions were isolated from the plasma of fasted (9–11 h) apoA-I-deficient mice 4 days following injections of the recombinant adenoviruses and were subjected to 12‥ SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Degradation products for apoA-IFIN are confined to the smaller HDL (HDL3) and lipid-poor species, and none are detected for hapoA-I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Proteolysis of apoA-IFIN was also also evident following adenovirus-mediated expression in apoA-I-deficient mice (Fig. 4), similar to that observed in C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 1). For these experiments, female apoA-I-deficient mice between 4 and 6 months of age were maintained on a Western diet 3 weeks prior to injection of the recombinant adenoviruses. Under these dietary conditions, apoA-IFIN reached significantly higher levels (>100 mg/dl) allowing direct detection of the degradation products in the plasma by both Ponceau staining (not shown) and Western blot analysis (Fig.4 A). The monoclonal antibodies used for Western blot analysis recognize epitopes N-terminal to the Leu159 → Arg mutation (4H1 and 5F6 epitopes map to residues 1–8 and 118–148 of human apoA-I, respectively). Therefore, the major 18.5-kDa fragment represents an N-terminal degradation product and corresponds to the size expected if cleavage occurred at or near the site of the mutation. HDL fractions were isolated by centrifugation of pooled plasma collected from fasted (9–11 h) apoA-I-deficient mice on the Western diet 4 days after injection with either the hapoA-I or the apoA-IFIN recombinant adenoviruses (Fig. 4 B).

https://openalex.org/W2021890580,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a widespread human herpes virus causing chicken pox on primary infection and persisting in sensory neurons. Reactivation causes shingles, which are characterized by severe pain and often lead to postherpetic neuralgia. To elucidate the mechanisms of VZV-associated hyperalgesia, we elaborated an in vitro model for the VZV infection of sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglia. Between 35 and 50% of the neurons showed strong expression of the immediate-early virus antigens IE62 and IE63 and the late glycoprotein gE. When the intracellular calcium concentration was monitored microfluorometrically for individual cells after infection, the sensitivity to GABA or capsaicin was similar in controls and in VZV-infected neurons. However, the baseline calcium concentration was increased. Neurons became de novo sensitive to adrenergic stimulation after VZV infection. Norepinephrine-responsive neurons were more frequent and calcium responses to norepinephrine were significantly higher after infection with wild-type isolates than with the attenuated vaccine strain OKA. The adrenergic agonists phenylephrine and isoproterenol had similar efficacy. We suggest that the infection with wild-type VZV isolates confers norepinephrine sensitivity to sensory neurons by using alpha(1)- and/or beta(1)-adrenergic receptors providing a model for the pathophysiology of the severe pain associated with the acute reactivation of VZV."
