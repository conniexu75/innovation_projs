However, their sources and removal pathways are very uncertain, and their atmospheric evolution is poorly characterized. Jimenez et al. (p. 1525 ; see the Perspective by Andreae ) present an integrated framework of organic aerosol compositional evolution in the atmosphere, based on model results and field and laboratory data that simulate the dynamic aging behavior of organic aerosols. Particles become more oxidized, more hygroscopic, and less volatile with age, as they become oxygenated organic aerosols. These results should lead to better predictions of climate and air quality."

Application to the case of protein aggregation demonstrates that the kinetics of amyloid growth can often be dominated by secondary rather than by primary nucleation events. Our results further reveal a range of general features of the growth kinetics of fragmenting filamentous structures, including the existence of generic scaling laws that provide mechanistic information in contexts ranging from in vitro amyloid growth to the in vivo development of mammalian prion diseases."

Now Chan et al. (p. 302 , published online 10 December) have identified the specific DNA changes that control this major skeletal adaptation. The key locus controlling pelvic phenotypes mapped to a noncoding regulatory region upstream of the Pituitary homeobox transcription factor 1 gene, which drives a tissue-specific pelvic enhancer. Multiple populations showed independent deletions in this region and enhancer function was inactivated. Reintroduction of the enhancer restored pelvic development in a pelvic-reduced stickleback."

These include transistors, light-emitting diodes, actuators, and sensors. Sekitani et al. (p. 1516 ) use a low-temperature hybrid dielectric based on a thin metal oxide and a self-assembled monolayer to develop flexible floating-gate memory transistors with small program and erase voltages. These are integrated into a flexible large-area sensor area, capable of storing values from applied external pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2125093810,"An Innervative Small RNA Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentless disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons that control muscle movement, leading to muscle atrophy and paralysis. Williams et al. (p. 1549 ; see the Perspective by Brown ) show that a small noncoding RNA that is selectively expressed in skeletal muscle, miR-206, senses motor neuron injury or loss and helps ameliorate resultant muscle damage by promoting regeneration of neuromuscular synapses. Expression of miR-206 was dramatically induced in a mouse model of ALS, and when this RNA was removed from mice by genetic manipulation, the disease progressed at a faster rate. The salutary effects of miR-206 appear to be mediated through a signaling pathway in muscle cells involving histone deacetylase 4 and a fibro-blast growth factor modulator, activation of which leads to release of factors that promote nerve-muscle interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2071723955,"Granulomas, organized aggregates of immune cells, are a hallmark of tuberculosis and have traditionally been thought to restrict mycobacterial growth. However, analysis of Mycobacterium marinum in zebrafish has shown that the early granuloma facilitates mycobacterial growth; uninfected macrophages are recruited to the granuloma where they are productively infected by M. marinum. Here, we identified the molecular mechanism by which mycobacteria induce granulomas: The bacterial secreted protein 6-kD early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6), which has long been implicated in virulence, induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) in epithelial cells neighboring infected macrophages. MMP9 enhanced recruitment of macrophages, which contributed to nascent granuloma maturation and bacterial growth. Disruption of MMP9 function attenuated granuloma formation and bacterial growth. Thus, interception of epithelial MMP9 production could hold promise as a host-targeting tuberculosis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2045847295,"To Stall or Not to Stall Recent studies in mammals and Drosophila have shown that RNA polymerase II frequently stalls shortly after initiating messenger RNA synthesis and that this stalling is important for proper expression of genes. Although several protein factors that affect polymerase stalling are known, the role of DNA sequence in this process has remained unclear. Now Nechaev et al. (p. 335 , published online 10 December) report that the initially transcribed sequences of many genes contain a signal that works like a stop sign for the elongating polymerase. Expression of genes may thus be regulated by a combination of a DNA signal that induces promoter-proximal stalling and protein factors that alter its duration."

https://openalex.org/W2169318944,"Cells have self-organizing properties that control their behavior in complex tissues. Contact between cells expressing either B-type Eph receptors or their transmembrane ephrin ligands initiates bidirectional signals that regulate cell positioning. However, simultaneously investigating how information is processed in two interacting cell types remains a challenge. We implemented a proteomic strategy to systematically determine cell-specific signaling networks underlying EphB2- and ephrin-B1-controlled cell sorting. Quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of mixed populations of EphB2- and ephrin-B1-expressing cells that were labeled with different isotopes revealed cell-specific tyrosine phosphorylation events. Functional associations between these phosphotyrosine signaling networks and cell sorting were established with small interfering RNA screening. Data-driven network modeling revealed that signaling between mixed EphB2- and ephrin-B1-expressing cells is asymmetric and that the distinct cell types use different tyrosine kinases and targets to process signals induced by cell-cell contact. We provide systems- and cell-specific network models of contact-initiated signaling between two distinct cell types."

However, fossils from basal lineages are rare. A new theropod dinosaur from New Mexico is a representative of the early North American diversification. Known from several nearly complete skeletons, it reveals a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived features that clarify early saurischian dinosaur evolution and provide evidence for the antiquity of novel avian character systems including skeletal pneumaticity. The taxon further reveals latitudinal differences among saurischian assemblages during the Late Triassic, demonstrates that the theropod fauna from the Late Triassic of North America was not endemic, and suggests that intercontinental dispersal was prevalent during this time."

To assess the role of N-glycans in receptor-mediated immune responses, we investigated the functionality of Arabidopsis receptor kinases EFR and FLS2, sensing bacterial translation elongation factor Tu (elf18) and flagellin (flg22), respectively, in N-glycosylation mutants. As revealed by binding and responses to elf18 or flg22, both receptors tolerated immature N-glycans induced by mutations in various Golgi modification steps. EFR was specifically impaired by loss-of-function mutations in STT3A, a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum resident oligosaccharyltransferase complex. FLS2 tolerated mild underglycosylation occurring in stt3a but was sensitive to severe underglycosylation induced by tunicamycin treatment. EFR accumulation was significantly reduced when synthesized without N-glycans but to lesser extent when underglycosylated in stt3a or mutated in single amino acid positions. Interestingly, EFRN143Q lacking a single conserved N-glycosylation site from the EFR ectodomain accumulated to reduced levels and lost the ability to bind its ligand and to mediate elf18-elicited oxidative burst. However, EFR-YFP protein localization and peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion assays support that both EFR produced in stt3a and EFRN143Q in wild type cells correctly targeted to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus. These results indicate that a single N-glycan plays a critical role for receptor abundance and ligand recognition during plant-pathogen interactions at the cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W2064153659,"Bax and Bid are pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family. Upon cleavage by caspase-8, Bid activates Bax. Activated Bax inserts into the mitochondrial outer membrane forming oligomers which lead to membrane poration, release of cytochrome c, and apoptosis. The detailed mechanism of Bax activation and the topology and composition of the oligomers are still under debate. Here molecular details of Bax activation and oligomerization were obtained by application of several biophysical techniques, including atomic force microscopy, cryoelectron microscopy, and particularly electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy performed on spin-labeled Bax. Incubation with detergents, reconstitution, and Bid-triggered insertion into liposomes were found to be effective in inducing Bax oligomerization. Bid was shown to activate Bax independently of the stoichiometric ratio, suggesting that Bid has a catalytic function and that the interaction with Bax is transient. The formation of a stable dimerization interface involving two Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domains was found to be the nucleation event for Bax homo-oligomerization. Based on intermolecular distance determined by EPR, a model of six adjacent Bax molecules in the oligomer is presented where the hydrophobic hairpins (helices alpha5 and alpha6) are equally spaced in the membrane and the two BH3 domains are in close vicinity in the dimer interface, separated by >5 nm from the next BH3 pairs."

Likewise, the increase in prevalence of the G6PD-Mahidol 487 A allele among Karen people in Thailand, who only in the past few thousand years have migrated into malarious zones, may be the result of selection by Plasmodium vivax malaria. P. vivax has recently been implicated in more severe disease than previously suspected, providing both a direct selective effect through mortality and an indirect selective effect through morbidity and reproductive failure. Louicharoen et al. (p. 1546 ) link population-genetic evidence for positive selection in an 8-year family-based study of 3000 Karen individuals and reveal that there is an association between the presence of the G6PD-Mahidol 487 A allele and a reduction in the density of P. vivax parasites circulating in the bloodstreams of infected individuals.

Claudins and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) are major cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at TJs, whereas cadherins and nectins are major CAMs at AJs. Claudins and JAMs are associated with ZO proteins, whereas cadherins are associated with β- and α-catenins, and nectins are associated with afadin. We previously showed that nectins first form cell-cell adhesions where the cadherin-catenin complex is recruited to form AJs, followed by the recruitment of the JAM-ZO and claudin-ZO complexes to the apical side of AJs to form TJs. It is not fully understood how TJ components are recruited to the apical side of AJs. We studied the roles of afadin and ZO-1 in the formation of TJs in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Before the formation of TJs, ZO-1 interacted with afadin through the two proline-rich regions of afadin and the SH3 domain of ZO-1. During and after the formation of TJs, ZO-1 dissociated from afadin and associated with JAM-A. Knockdown of afadin impaired the formation of both AJs and TJs in MDCK cells, whereas knockdown of ZO-1 impaired the formation of TJs, but not AJs. Re-expression of full-length afadin restored the formation of both AJs and TJs in afadin-knockdown MDCK cells, whereas re-expression of afadin-ΔPR1–2, which is incapable of binding to ZO-1, restored the formation of AJs, but not TJs.

https://openalex.org/W1975755106,"VAPB (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident tail-anchored adaptor protein involved in lipid transport. A dominantly inherited mutant, P56S-VAPB, causes a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and forms poorly characterized inclusion bodies in cultured cells. To provide a cell biological basis for the understanding of mutant VAPB pathogenicity, we investigated its biogenesis and the inclusions that it generates. Translocation assays in cell-free systems and in cultured mammalian cells were used to investigate P56S-VAPB membrane insertion, and the inclusions were characterized by confocal imaging and electron microscopy. We found that mutant VAPB inserts post-translationally into ER membranes in a manner indistinguishable from the wild-type protein but that it rapidly clusters to form inclusions that remain continuous with the rest of the ER. Inclusions were induced by the mutant also when it was expressed at levels comparable to the endogenous wild-type protein. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the inclusions represent a novel form of organized smooth ER (OSER) consisting in a limited number of parallel cisternae (usually 2 or 3) interleaved by a ~30 nm-thick electron-dense cytosolic layer.

https://openalex.org/W2167733085,"Dendritic cells (DCs)--immunomodulatory cells that initiate adaptive immune responses--have recently been shown to exert proangiogenic effects when infiltrating the tumor microenvironment. As tumors that escape immune surveillance inhibit DC maturation, we explored whether maturation status determines their ability to promote angiogenesis and whether angiogenesis depends on the presence of DCs. Using mouse xenograft models of human tumors, we show that fast-growing ""angiogenic"" tumors are infiltrated by a more immature DC population than respective dormant avascular tumors. Accordingly, supplementation of immature DCs, but not mature DCs, enhanced tumor growth. When DCs were mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into mice, only immature DCs promoted the ingrowth of patent blood vessels. Notably, depletion of DCs in a transgenic mouse model that allows for their conditional ablation completely abrogated basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs, and significantly inhibited tumor growth in these mice. Because immature DCs actively promote angiogenesis and tumor growth, whereas DC maturation or ablation suppresses this response, we conclude that angiogenesis is dependent on the presence of immature DCs. Thus, cancer immunotherapies that promote DC maturation may act by both augmenting the host immune response to the tumor and by suppressing tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2059204759,"Iapetus Revealed The striking appearance of Saturn's moon Iapetus—half black and half white—has puzzled astronomers for over three centuries. Now Spencer and Denk (p. 432 , published online 10 December) present an explanation for this asymmetry: A thermally controlled runaway migration of water ice triggered by exogenic deposition of dark material on the moon's leading darker side, which faces the direction of motion of the moon in its orbit around Saturn. This mechanism is unique to Iapetus because it rotates slowly enough to allow large temperature variations to arise, it is small enough to allow long-range migration of water, and there is a source of dust to trigger the process. In a related paper, Denk et al. (p. 435 , published online 10 December) present data derived from the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem that reveal that both dark and bright materials on the leading side of Iapetus are redder than their trailing-side counterparts. This asymmetry results from the deposition of dust and debris from other moons in the saturnian system—the very same process that initiates the thermal segregation proposed above."
https://openalex.org/W2069817997,"Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) due to activation of Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels leads to sustained elevation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and activation of lymphocytes. CRAC channels consisting of four pore-forming Orai1 subunits are activated by STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensor that senses intracellular store depletion and migrates to plasma membrane proximal regions to mediate SOCE. One of the fundamental properties of CRAC channels is their Ca(2+)-dependent fast inactivation. To identify the domains of Orai1 involved in fast inactivation, we have mutated residues in the Orai1 intracellular loop linking transmembrane segment II to III. Mutation of four residues, V(151)SNV(154), at the center of the loop (MutA) abrogated fast inactivation, leading to increased SOCE as well as higher CRAC currents. Point mutation analysis identified five key amino acids, N(153)VHNL(157), that increased SOCE in Orai1 null murine embryonic fibroblasts. Expression or direct application of a peptide comprising the entire intracellular loop or the sequence N(153)VHNL(157) blocked CRAC currents from both wild type (WT) and MutA Orai1. A peptide incorporating the MutA mutations had no blocking effect. Concatenated Orai1 constructs with four MutA monomers exhibited high CRAC currents lacking fast inactivation. Reintroduction of a single WT monomer (MutA-MutA-MutA-WT) was sufficient to fully restore fast inactivation, suggesting that only a single intracellular loop can block the channel. These data suggest that the intracellular loop of Orai1 acts as an inactivation particle, which is stabilized in the ion permeation pathway by the N(153)VHNL(157) residues. These results along with recent reports support a model in which the N terminus and the selectivity filter of Orai1 as well as STIM1 act in concert to regulate the movement of the intracellular loop and evoke fast inactivation."

Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is composed of three separately folded subdomains: N1, N2, and N3 (11.Deivanayagam C.C. Wann E.R. Chen W. Carson M. Rajashankar K.R. Höök M. Narayana S.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Subdomains N1 of ClfA and Fbl have 19% amino acid identity, whereas the subdomains N2N3 share almost 60% identity (2.Mitchell J. Tristan A. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3831-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The A domains are linked to the cell wall-anchoring domain by serine-rich repeats (tandem SD repeats in the case of ClfA and SDSDSA repeats for Fbl). The N2N3 subdomains form the minimum fibrinogen-binding site of ClfA. ClfA binds to a peptide sequence comprising the extreme C terminus of the γ-chain of Fg that protrudes from the D domain (12.McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T. Höök M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of ClfA N2N3 has been solved both as an apoprotein and in complex with a peptide mimicking the C terminus of the γ-chain (11.Deivanayagam C.C. Wann E.R. Chen W. Carson M.

Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The γ-chain peptide binds predominantly in a hydrophobic trench formed between the separately folded N2 and N3 subdomains. ClfA binds to fibrinogen by a variation of the “dock, lock, and latch” mechanism of ligand binding (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The dock, lock, and latch mechanism was proposed and validated for the structurally related SdrG from Staphylococcus epidermidis, which binds to the N-terminal β-chain peptide protruding from domain E of fibrinogen (14.Ponnuraj K.

The apo-form of the protein adopts an open conformation. Docking of the Fg peptide in the hydrophobic trench between the N2 and N3 subdomains induces a redirection of the C-terminal extension of subdomain N3, resulting in it covering the trench with the bound peptide, thus locking it in place and interacting with the subdomain N2 by making β-strand complementation (14.Ponnuraj K.

For SdrG, an open form of the protein is required to bind its ligand. ClfA can bind to the Fg γ-chain even in an artificially constrained closed form where the C-terminal extension of subdomain N3 is held in place in N2 by a disulfide bond (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Residues at the extreme C terminus of the γ-chain of Fg are crucial for ligand binding because removal of two residues from the C terminus of a 17-mer γ-chain peptide abolished binding to ClfA. The model was supported by substituting several residues in the binding trench of ClfA that were predicted to be involved in ligand binding. This study describes a detailed comparison of the mechanism of binding to Fg by Fbl and ClfA and concludes that the two staphylococcal proteins are functionally very similar. This striking similarity suggests that new anti-staphylococcal compounds mimicking the C terminus of the γ-chain may be designed to simultaneously target both ClfA and Fbl. Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) was used as the host for selecting recombinant plasmids following cloning or mutagenesis. E. coli strain TOPP 3 (Stratagene) was used for expression of recombinant proteins and grown in Luria broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Plasmid pKS80::fbl (2.Mitchell J. Tristan A. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3831-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) containing the entire coding region of the fbl gene of S. lugdunensis strain N920143 was used as a template for amplification of the region encoding amino acids 206–533 and 40–533, respectively, using primers incorporating BglII and HindIII restriction sites. Plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen) was manipulated to replace the BamHI site of the multiple cloning site with a BglII site. PCR products were cloned into this modified vector allowing N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins to be expressed. Plasmids pCF41 and pCF40 are derivatives of pQE30 containing codons for ClfA amino acids 221–559 and 40–559, respectively (16.O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged proteins were expressed and purified by Ni2+ chelate chromatography as described previously (16.O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment using the LALIGN server (17.Huang X.M. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar) showed no gaps in the sequences between ClfA and Fbl. A homology model of the Fbl-Fg γ-chain peptide complex in closed conformation was generated using the crystal structure of the ClfA-Fg γ-chain D410A peptide complex (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) as template. The structure of the Fbl N2N3 subdomains (Fbl206–533) was modeled with the HOMOLOGY module of InsightII software (Accrelys Inc.) using the sequence alignment from LALIGN. The wild-type sequence of γ-chain rather than the D410A variant was used for modeling. The resulting model did not show any steric violation between the γ-chain peptide and Fbl. The stereochemical parameters of the model were checked using PROCHECK (18.Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The figures with ribbon models were generated using RIBBONS (19.Carson M. J. Mol. Graph. 1997; 5: 103-106Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Overlapping complementary primers containing the appropriate base changes (Table 1) were used to amplify the pQE30 plasmid containing the DNA encoding amino acids 206–533 of Fbl. Cycling conditions used were as outlined by the QuikChange protocol. The products were digested with DpnI to eliminate parental DNA and transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue. The mutations were verified by sequencing (GATC Biotech).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequenceaThe restriction sites are in bold type.Fbl40–533 forwardGGGAGATCTGAAGAAGTGGAGCGTAATTTGFbl reverseGGGAAGCTTATTTGTTGCTTCAACTTTTGFbl206–533 forwardGAGAGATCTACAGATAATAACGTTACTCN270A forwardCATTAAACTTGCTGGTGTAACAGN270A reverseCTGTTACACCAGCAAGTTTAATGY322A forwardCAATTCCTGGGGCTATTGATCCTAAAATGY322A reverseCATTTTAGGATCAATAGCCCCAGGATTGW507A forwardGTTTCTATGGCAGCGGATAATGAAGW507A reverseCTTCATTATCCGCTGCCATAGAAACE510A forwardCATGGGATAATGCAGTAGAATATCE510A reverseGATATTCTACTGCATTATCCCATGa The restriction sites are in bold type. Open table in a new tab A synthetic peptide comprising the 17 C-terminal residues (residues 395–411) of the γ-chain of human Fg was synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ). The human 15-mer and the putative ovine 15-mer were synthesized by Biomatik (Wilmington, DE). Variant human Fg γ-chain peptides with alanine (or serine) substitutions at each position (Table 2) were synthesized as previously described (12.McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant Fbl or ClfA were preincubated with a range of concentrations of a synthetic peptide comprising the 17 C-terminal residues of the γ-chain of Fg or variant peptides with alanine (or serine) substitutions at each position (Table 2) for 1 h at room temperature. A solution of Fg in PBS (10 μg/ml) was used to coat microtiter wells (Sarstedt) for 18 h at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed again, and recombinant proteins were added. The plates were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Unbound protein was removed by washing with PBS. Bound protein was detected by incubation with anti-His6-peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 1 h and detected as described previously (20.Keane F.M. Loughman A. Valtulina V. Brennan M. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The percentage of inhibition was calculated relative to the level of bound protein detected in the absence of inhibitor peptide. Recombinant ClfA or Fbl was coated onto microtiter plates (Nunc) in sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) for 18 h at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk proteins in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed again, and varying dilutions of polyclonal rabbit anti-ClfA or anti-Fbl antibodies were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS, and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako) were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected as described previously (20.Keane F.M. Loughman A. Valtulina V. Brennan M. Speziale P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ITC was performed with a VP-ITC or ITC200 microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) stirring at 1000 rpm at 30 °C. In a typical experiment, the cell contained 30 μm rFbl 206–533 or rClfA 221–559, and the syringe contained 0.5–1 mm peptide. Both solutions were in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). To take into account the heat of dilution, two blank titrations were performed, one by injecting peptide into buffer and the other by injecting buffer into the protein solution. The averaged heats of dilution were subtracted. The data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software (version 5.0), fitting them to a single site model. SPR was performed using the BIAcore X100 system (GE Healthcare). Human Fg purified from contaminating fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) was covalently immobilized on CM5 sensor chips using amine coupling. This was performed using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, followed by N-hydroxysuccinimide and ethanolamine hydrochloride, as described by the manufacturer. Fg (10 μg/ml) was dissolved in 10 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.5 and then immobilized on the flow cell at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in PBS. On another flow cell, the dextran matrix was treated as described above but without Fg present to provide an uncoated reference flow cell. Increasing concentrations of recombinant proteins were flowed over immobilized Fg at a rate of 5 μl/min. For murine monoclonal antibody 12-9, a capture approach was used. Rabbit anti-mouse Fc IgG (Pierce) was diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.5 and immobilized on two flow cells by amine coupling as described above. The 12-9 murine monoclonal antibody (100 μg/ml) in PBS was passed over the anti-mouse Fc IgG surface of one flow cell, and the other flow cell served as a reference. Recombinant ClfA221–559 (100 nm) and rFbl206–533 (100 nm) were flowed over the surface at a rate of 5 μl/min. All of the sensorgram data presented were subtracted from the corresponding data from the reference flow cell. The response generated from injection of buffer over the chip was also subtracted from all of the sensorgrams. The data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software version 3.0. A plot of the level of binding (response units) at equilibrium against concentration of analyte was used to determine the KD. The full-length recombinant Fbl A domain (N1N2N3; rFbl40–533) and the N2N3 subdomains (rFbl206–533) were expressed with N-terminal His6 tags (Fig. 1A). The affinity of these proteins for fibrinogen was measured and compared with recombinant His6-tagged ClfA N1N2N3 domains (rClfA40–559) and ClfA N2N3 domains (rClfA221–559) using SPR (Fig. 1, B and C). Increasing concentrations of recombinant proteins were flowed over a chip that had been coated with Fg. From analysis of the equilibrium binding data, the dissociation constant (KD) of the interaction between rFbl40–533 and Fg was determined to be 0.79 ± 0.09 μm, and for rFbl206–533 and Fg the KD was 0.59 ± 0.1 μm, indicating that these proteins bind to fibrinogen with similar affinities. Similarly, the recombinant His6-tagged ClfA N1N2N3 domains (rClfA40–559) bound to Fg with a KD of 0.8 ± 0.11 μm and ClfA N2N3 domains (rClfA221–559) with a KD of 0.77 ± 0.06 μm. This demonstrates that the Fg binding activities of both Fbl and ClfA lie solely in the N2N3 subdomains and that the N1 subdomains have no discernable role. Furthermore, ClfA and Fbl have very similar affinities for Fg. Similar results were obtained in solid phase fibrinogen binding assays (data not shown). ClfA binds to the extreme C terminus of the γ-chain of Fg (12.McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T. Höök M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because recombinant ClfA could block binding of Fbl to Fg (2.Mitchell J. Tristan A. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3831-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and given the high level of similarity between ClfA and Fbl binding domains, it seemed likely that the two proteins would bind to the same region of Fg. Thus the affinities of rClfA221–559 and rFbl206–533 for a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 17 amino acids of the γ-chain were measured by ITC. Recombinant Fbl206–533 bound with a KD of 9 ± 0.6 μm (Fig. 2A), whereas rClfA221–559 had a KD of 15 ± 2 μm (Fig. 2B). These experiments showed that Fbl bound to the C terminus of the Fg γ-chain and that the affinity of Fbl for the peptide is very similar to that of ClfA. To further investigate the interaction between Fbl and the C-terminal residues of Fg, the 17-mer γ-chain peptide was tested for its ability to inhibit the binding of rFbl206–533 to immobilized Fg. This peptide was previously shown to inhibit recombinant ClfA and FnBPA A domain binding to Fg (21.Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Preincubation of rFbl206–533 or rClfA221–559 with increasing concentrations of peptide resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of binding (Fig. 3A). This confirms that the binding site for Fbl in Fg is the C-terminal residues of the γ-chain. The maximum inhibition achieved by the γ-chain peptide was ∼50% for Fbl and ∼60% for ClfA. Inhibition of rFbl206–533 and rClfA221–559 binding to Fg was measured using γ-chain peptides with single alanine (or serine) substitutions in each of the terminal 17 residues (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The variant peptides had the same effect on rFbl206–533 and rClfA221–559 binding to Fg. Peptides with G395A, H400A, G403A, G404A, K406A, Q407A, A408S, and G409A substitutions had reduced ability to inhibit both ClfA and Fbl compared with the native peptide (Fig. 3B). Variants Q398A, L402A, A405S, D410A, and V411A had an increased inhibitory effect on both ClfA and Fbl binding to Fg. Amino acid substitutions that increase or reduce inhibition by the peptide presumably alter the affinity of the peptide for ClfA and Fbl, indicating that these residues are important in the interaction with the MSCRAMM. Substitutions E396A, G397A, Q399A, and H401A had little effect on the inhibition of either protein binding to Fg. This indicates that the interaction of ClfA and Fbl with the C-terminal residues of the γ-chain of Fg is very similar. The ability of rClfA and rFbl to bind Fg from different species was compared. Differences in the C-terminal γ-chain residues might influence the affinity of ClfA and Fbl and could be informative. Microtiter plates were coated with human, bovine, ovine, murine, feline, canine, and porcine Fg. Both ClfA and Fbl bound to canine, murine, and porcine Fg at similar levels to human Fg (Fig. 4). In contrast, both ClfA and Fbl bound weakly to bovine Fg and did not bind to ovine Fg. The one difference between the two MSCRAMMs was the weak binding of Fbl to feline Fg compared with ClfA, which bound with the same avidity as it did to human Fg (Fig. 4). Thus Fbl and ClfA behave almost identically with the exception of the binding to feline Fg. The ovine Fg γ-chain is not annotated in the public databases. A bioinformatic search was performed for ovine expressed sequence tag clones using BLAST (tblastn module) (22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70539) Google Scholar). The sequence of the C-terminal residues of the human γ-chain (residues 351–411) was used as template. This generated a liver cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number gi114476568) with a matching stop codon and 90% identity to the human C-terminal sequence. When the sequences were aligned, the putative ovine sequence had an apparent gap at human position 395 and substitutions E396D and Q407K. The crystal structure of the ClfA-Fg γ-chain complex (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that Gln407 of Fg makes key interactions with ClfA and is completely buried in the complex. Furthermore, the alanine scan of γ-chain peptide (Fig. 3) showed that substitution of a bulky glutamine residue with alanine (Q407A) reduced binding to ClfA or Fbl. To determine whether the Q407K variation is responsible for the inability of ClfA and Fbl to bind ovine Fg, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 residues of the predicted ovine Fg γ-chain was compared with the equivalent human Fg 15-mer (Table 2). The human peptide bound to ClfA with a KD of 44 ± 8.6 μm and to Fbl with a KD of 40 ± 6.9 μm (data not shown), but the 15-mer ovine peptide did not bind detectably to either MSCRAMM (data not shown). This suggests that the failure of Fbl and ClfA to bind to the ovine γ-chain may be due to the Q407K substitution in the C terminus of the ovine Fg γ-chain. To examine this in more detail, structural models of both Fbl and ClfA in complex with the Q407K variant peptide were generated. The crystal structure of the ClfA-Fg γ-chain peptide complex (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was used as template. Visual examination of the model suggests that the bulky Lys407 residue (human Fg numbering) of the ovine Fg sequence clashes with Thr383 and the backbone atoms of Ile384 of ClfA (Fig. 4C), preventing the ovine sequence from fitting into the binding trench and abolishing the interaction with ClfA. In addition, changing a polar uncharged glutamine to a positively charged lysine could impose charge-charge repulsion with any of the surrounding positively charged residues such as His252 or Lys381. Thus the loss of binding of ClfA and Fbl to ovine Fg may be due to the Q407K substitution in the C terminus of the ovine Fg γ-chain. The homology model of the Fbl-Fg γ-chain peptide complex (based on the structure of the ClfA-Fg γ-chain D410A peptide complex) (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was used to identify residues in the putative ligand-binding trench of Fbl that might be involved in Fg binding (Fig. 5). Residues lining the trench region located between N2 and N3 are completely conserved between ClfA and Fbl in contrast to residues located elsewhere where 40% divergence occurs. Amino acid substitutions were made in four residues in the putative ligand-binding trench of Fbl that could possibly interact with the γ-chain of Fg (Asn270, Tyr322, Trp507, and Glu510; Fig. 5, right panel). The same residues are located at equivalent positions (Asn286, Try338, Trp523, and Glu526) in ClfA. The crystal structure of the ClfA-Fg γ-chain complex demonstrates a direct interaction between the side chains of residues Tyr338 and Trp523 and the Fg peptide (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The backbone atoms of the residues Glu526 and Asn286 of ClfA play a role in anchoring the peptide through hydrogen bonding interactions (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of residues Tyr338 and Glu526 in fibrinogen binding by ClfA (11.Deivanayagam C.C. Wann E.R. Chen W. Carson M. Rajashankar K.R. Höök M. Narayana S.V.

Analysis of the equilibrium binding data showed that rFbl N270A and rFbl E510A had slightly reduced affinity for Fg compared with rFbl206–533 (KD of 1.17 ± 0.29 and 1.74 ± 0.17 μm, respectively compared with 0.59 ± 0.11 μm for wild type). Amino acids in the loop regions around the ligand-binding trench are critical for optimum binding even when their side chains are not directly involved. The P336A substitution near the binding site in ClfA reduced Fg binding (25.Loughman A. Fitzgerald J.R. Brennan M.P. Higgins J. Downer R. Cox D. Foster T.J. Mol.

Residue Asn270 in Fbl is located in a loop in the N2 domain (Fig. 5), and the N270A substitution at the binding site could alter the conformation around the residue and also affect the interaction through the main chain atoms. The E526A substitution is at the linker region before the latch and could affect optimal redirection of the latch segment and backbone hydrogen bonding interaction (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The rFbl W507A and rFbl Y322A mutants had much weaker affinity for Fg. Recombinant Fbl W507A was estimated to have a KD of ∼28.65 μm for fibrinogen (Fig. 6C), whereas the response for rFbl Y322A was so low that the KD could not be determined with any reliability (Fig. 6D). Thus Fbl residues Tyr322 and Trp507 appear to play an important role in Fg binding by Fbl. Comparison of the x-ray crystal structure of ClfA with the modeled structure of Fbl indicated that the majority of variant residues are located on the surfaces of the proteins (data not shown). The cross-reactivity of rabbit polyclonal anti-ClfA and anti-Fbl antibodies was measured. Anti-ClfA A domain antibodies had a 32-fold lower titer for rFbl206–533, whereas polyclonal anti-Fbl A domain antibodies had a 2-fold lower titer for rClfA221–559 (Fig. 7). Both recombinant proteins reacted equally with monoclonal anti-His6-peroxidase antibody (data not shown), indicating that they coated the dish similarly. In addition, an important function-blocking anti-ClfA monoclonal antibody 12-9 (26.Hall A.E. Domanski P.J. Patel P.R. Vernachio J.H. Syribeys P.J. Gorovits E.L. Johnson M.A. Ross J.M. Hutchins J.T. Patti J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6864-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that binds with high affinity to ClfA did not bind detectably to Fbl when analyzed by SPR (Fig. 7C) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). S. lugdunensis expresses a fibrinogen-binding surface protein called Fbl that is similar in structure and organization to ClfA of S. aureus. In particular the minimum ligand-binding region of ClfA, subdomains N2 and N3, is 60% identical to the same region of Fbl. This study set out to compare Fbl and ClfA to gain further insight into their mechanism of binding to Fg. We have shown using SPR that the affinities of ClfA and Fbl for human fibrinogen are very similar. This contradicts an earlier report suggesting that Fbl had a lower affinity for Fg than ClfA (2.Mitchell J. Tristan A. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3831-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This can be attributed to the use of polyclonal antibodies to measure Fbl and ClfA binding to immobilized Fg in a solid phase binding assay in the earlier study. The polyclonal antibodies have different affinities for the two antigens and are likely to contain some antibodies with the ability to displace the bound MSCRAMM. The data reported in this paper directly demonstrate that Fbl binds to the C terminus of the γ-chain of Fg in a very similar fashion to ClfA. The proteins bound to the synthetic 17-mer γ-chain peptide. The KD determined here for rClfA221–559 binding to γ-chain by ITC (15 μm) is similar to the KD previously determined for rClfA229–550 binding to γ-chain peptide by ITC (5.8 μm) (13.Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and rClfA221–559 binding to fluorescein-labeled γ-chain peptide by fluorescence polarization (15 μm (16.O'Connell D.P.

Wann E.R. Chen W. Carson M. Rajashankar K.R. Höök M. Narayana S.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). A synthetic γ-chain peptide inhibited the binding of Fbl to Fg by ∼50%. Previous reports have noted incomplete inhibition of ClfA by this peptide (60–70%) (12.McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K.

In contrast binding to Fg by the recombinant A domain of fibronectin-binding protein A was completely inhibited by the peptide (21.Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Wann et al. (21.Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) suggested that ClfA recognizes an additional site in Fg, whereas FnBPA binds only to the γ-chain. Two different approaches were taken to probing the interaction of Fbl and ClfA with Fg. First, a set of synthetic 17-mer peptides with alanine (or serine) substitutions in each of the 17 positions at the C terminus of the Fg γ-chain were used to compare inhibitory effects on rClfA221–559 and rFbl206–533 binding to immobilized Fg. Each of the peptides had the same effect on ligand binding by the two MSCRAMMs, suggesting that the mechanism of binding of ClfA and Fbl to Fg is very similar. Some peptides inhibited binding of both proteins more weakly than the parental peptide, which could indicate that the residue replaced is directly involved in binding. Several peptides inhibited binding more strongly than the parental peptide, indicating that they have a higher affinity for the MSCRAMM. Information about the mechanism of ligand binding was also obtained by measuring the ability of ClfA and Fbl to bind to Fg purified from different species. This was particularly informative where the sequences of the C termini of the γ-chains are known. ClfA and Fbl did not bind detectably to ovine Fg. The ovine Fg γ-chain sequence is not annotated, but because the putative ovine γ-chain 15-mer with a single Q407K substitution compared with the human sequence lost binding to both MSCRAMMs, this result may explain the lack of binding to full-length ovine Fg. It will be of particular interest to see whether ClfA from ovine strains bind to ovine Fg more strongly than ClfA from human strains. Fbl bound weakly to feline Fg compared with ClfA, which bound with the same affinity as to human Fg. This indicates a subtle difference between the two MSCRAMMs, but unfortunately a molecular explanation is lacking because the amino acid sequence of the γ-chain of feline Fg is not known. The reduced binding of ClfA and Fbl to Fg from certain animals could represent adaptation to the human host. The three-dimensional structure of the apo-protein and ligand bound form of ClfA has been solved. It is possible to model the structure of Fbl based on its amino acid sequence similarity and structural similarity to ClfA. Amino acid residues in the ligand-binding trench are completely conserved in contrast to residues located elsewhere on the protein. Four residues in the putative ligand-binding trench of Fbl were substituted, and the variant proteins showed a reduction in ligand binding by SPR. This confirms that Fbl and ClfA bind to Fg similarly and that the Fbl ligand binding site is the trench located between subdomains N2 and N3. Solving the crystal structures of Fbl in complex with γ-chain peptide will provide further insight into the mechanism of Fg binding by Fbl. Overall it appears that the ClfA and Fbl interaction with Fg is very similar. This similarity may be used to design new anti-staphylococcal compounds mimicking the Fg γ-chain C terminus that would have an effect against both S. aureus and S. lugdunensis. We thank Dr. A.

Previous studies showed that infiltration of immune inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, and release of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB)-dependent pro-inflammatory mediators are increased in lungs of patients with COPD and in rodent lungs exposed to CS (1.Yang S.R.

It is well known that the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes is up-regulated by activation of NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and modifications of histones, such as acetylation on lysine residues of histones, leading to increased accessibility for transcription factor NF-ÎºB binding to coactivator complex (7.Ito K.

We have recently shown that PKCÎ¶ regulates NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity by phosphorylating RelA/p65 at serine 311 and activating IÎºB kinase leading to translocation of RelA/p65 into the nucleus (18.Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. GarcÃ­a J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D. Moscat J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Separate evidence suggests that phosphorylation of RelA/p65 on serine 311 enhances its binding with CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional coactivator possessing intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, leading to acetylation of RelA/p65 (20.Zhong H.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that PKCÎ¶ regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB through recruitment and association of CBP with RelA/p65 as well as CBP-mediated acetylation of histone proteins on promoters of pro-inflammatory genes.Recently, a role of PKCÎ¶ in allergic airway inflammation is shown by the finding that disruption of PKCÎ¶ attenuated ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation in mice (15.Martin P. Villares R. Rodriguez-Mascarenhas S. Zaballos A. Leitges M. Kovac J. Sizing I. Rennert P. MÃ¡rquez G. MartÃ­nez-A C. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Importantly, the expression of PKCÎ¶ is elevated in lungs of patients with COPD implicating the critical role of PKCÎ¶ in chronic airway diseases (22.Park J.W. Kim H.P. Lee S.J. Wang X. Wang Y.

However, the role of endogenous PKCÎ¶ in regulation of lung inflammatory response to CS exposure or any inflammatory agents is not known. We hypothesized that down-regulation of PKCÎ¶ protects lungs against inflammatory response and chromatin modifications by CS, its reactive aldehydes as well as other pro-inflammatory agents, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), because endotoxin present in tobacco smoke is an important etiological factor for the pathogenesis of COPD/emphysema and exacerbates asthma from smoking (23.van Houwelingen A.H.

To test this hypothesis, PKCÎ¶-deficient (PKCÎ¶âˆ’/âˆ’) and wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to CS and LPS, and the role of PKCÎ¶ in lung inflammatory response, NF-ÎºB signaling, and histone modifications was determined in lungs. Furthermore, human monocyte-macrophage cells (MonoMac6 cells) and primary mouse alveolar macrophages were used to determine the role and molecular mechanism of PKCÎ¶ in CS-, aldehyde-, and LPS-mediated inflammatory response.DISCUSSIONCigarette smoke-induced oxidative stress, reactive aldehydes, and endotoxin present in tobacco smoke are important risk factors in the development of COPD/emphysema by increasing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and recruiting inflammatory cells into the lungs (23.van Houwelingen A.H.

This is confirmed by our results showing that the activation of PKCÎ¶, which is reflected by increased phosphorylation of PKCÎ¶ on Thr410, in WT mouse lung exposed to CS and LPS, and in monocytes/macrophages treated with CSE, LPS, and reactive aldehydes (i.e. acrolein and acetaldehyde). Similarly, the activation of PKCÎ¶ is also observed in lungs of patients with COPD, and in human adenocarcinoma A549 cells treated with nicotine (22.Park J.W. Kim H.P. Lee S.J. Wang X. Wang Y.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Hence, we determined whether reduced inflammatory response in PKCÎ¶âˆ’/âˆ’ mice is associated with decreased NF-ÎºB activation in lungs in response to CS and LPS exposures. As expected, the levels of phosphorylated RelA/p65 on Ser311 were decreased in lungs of PKCÎ¶-deficient mice as compared with WT mice exposed to CS and LPS. However, the phosphorylated levels of RelA/p65 on serine 276 were not altered in lungs of PKCÎ¶-deficient mice compared with WT mice in response to CS and LPS. This is consistent with the previous observation where serine 311, but not serine 276, accounts for the phosphorylation of RelA/p65 by PKCÎ¶, although the mechanism underlying these discrepancies is not clear (19.Duran A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of total RelA/p65 were also decreased in lung nuclear proteins of PKCÎ¶-deficient mice as compared with WT mice exposed to CS and LPS implicating the involvement of PKCÎ¶ in activation/translocation of RelA/p65 into the nucleus. The mechanism might be associated with activation of IÎºB kinase Î² by PKCÎ¶ because the levels of phosphorylated IÎºB kinase Î² were decreased in PKCÎ¶-deficient mice in response to CS and LPS exposures.Â 3H. Yao and I. Rahman, unpublished observations. This contention is in agreement with the previous studies showing that PKCÎ¶ was able to phosphorylate and activate IÎºB kinase Î² leading to NF-ÎºB activation by inducing IÎºB degradation (17.Savkovic S.D.

Nevertheless, these results suggest that PKCÎ¶ regulates CS- and LPS-mediated NF-ÎºB activation by inducing the phosphorylation (Ser311) and translocation of RelA/p65, leading to increased transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in lungs, although certain pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon-Î³) determined in this study can also be transcriptionally regulated by other transcription factors, such as SP-1, AP-1, and nuclear factor of activated T-cells in addition to NF-ÎºB (61.Samten B.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that LPS increased the interaction of CBP with RelA/p65, and increased acetylation of RelA/p65 occurs in lungs in response to CS (3.Yao H. Edirisinghe I. Rajendrasozhan S.

Most importantly, we show that the phosphorylation of RelA/p65 on Ser311 was regulated in lungs by PKCÎ¶. In the light of these observations, we hypothesized that acetylation of RelA/p65 and its association with CBP was altered in lungs of PKCÎ¶-deficient mice in response to CS and LPS exposures. As expected, disruption/inhibition of PKCÎ¶ attenuated the CS- and LPS-induced interaction of CBP with RelA/p65 and acetylation of RelA/p65 on Lys310 in lungs and MonoMac6 cells. This observation corroborates our previous study showing that the interaction of RelA/p65 with CBP is decreased in PKCÎ¶-deficient embryonic fibroblasts treated with tumor necrosis factor-Î± (19.Duran A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that both CS and LPS exposures also increased the association of CBP with PKCÎ¶ in WT mouse lungs and MonoMac6 cells suggesting that PKCÎ¶ does translocate into the nucleus and forms a complex with CBP and RelA/p65. This is confirmed by our results showing the increased levels of phosphorylated and total PKCÎ¶ by CS and LPS in lung nuclear proteins of WT mice. Furthermore, HAT activity of CBP is required for PKCÎ¶-mediated RelA/p65 acetylation and inflammatory response to CS, aldehyde, and LPS exposures. Therefore, we propose that PKCÎ¶ is a master regulator and facilitates the assembly of RelA/p65 with coactivator CBP in transcriptional machinery, thereby increasing acetylation of RelA/p65, subsequently enhancing the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in lungs in response to CS and LPS exposures (Fig. 11).CS and LPS can induce phosphorylation or acetylation of histones H3 and H4, and it is known that chromatin modification plays an important role in CS- and LPS-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (1.Yang S.R.

Furthermore, it has been recently recognized that alterations in chromatin remodeling on pro-inflammatory gene promoters are the key mechanisms for underlying abnormal inflammation seen in lungs of patients with COPD. Interestingly, PKCÎ¶ is shown to regulate IL-6 expression by altering the acetylation of histone H4 on its promoter (69.Galvez A.S. Duran A. Linares J.F. Pathrose P. Castilla E.A. Abu-Baker S. Leitges M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our data showed that the acetylation of RelA/p65 (Lys310), histone H3 (Lys9), and histone H4 on promoters of il-6 and mip-2 genes was decreased in lungs of PKCÎ¶-deficient mice as compared with WT mice in response to CS and LPS exposures. This is associated with decreased recruitment of CBP, which is known to acetylate histone or non-histone proteins, on the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes in PKCÎ¶âˆ’/âˆ’ mice. Furthermore, the phosphorylation/acetylation of histone H3 (Ser10/Lys9) and acetylation of histone H4 were decreased in lungs of PKCÎ¶-deficient mice exposed to CS and LPS. These results suggest that once PKCÎ¶ is activated, it forms a complex with CBP and RelA/p65 on the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes leading to acetylation of RelA/p65 and histones H3 and H4. Indeed, both CS and LPS exposures were able to recruit PKCÎ¶ on the promoters of il-6 and mip-2 genes in lungs of WT mice as detected by ChIP assay. Therefore, acetylated RelA/p65 interacts with PKCÎ¶ and CBP forming a coactivator complex on the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes, thereby leading to sustained transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators in lungs.Inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, are the main orchestrators and amplifiers in chronic inflammatory and injurious responses in lungs of smokers and patients with COPD (70.Barnes P.J.

Myoferlin-null mice have smaller muscles and defective myoblast fusion. To understand the mechanism by which myoferlin loss retards muscle growth, we found that myoferlin-null muscle does not respond to IGF1. In vivo after IGF1 infusion, control muscle increased myofiber diameter by 25%, but myoferlin-null muscle was unresponsive. Myoblasts cultured from myoferlin-null muscle and treated with IGF1 αlso failed to show the expected increase in fusion to multinucleate myotubes. The IGF1 receptor colocalized with myoferlin at sites of myoblast fusion. The lack of IGF1 responsiveness in myoferlin-null myoblasts was linked directly to IGF1 receptor mistrafficking as well as decreased IGF1 signaling. In myoferlin-null myoblasts, the IGF1 receptor accumulated into large vesicular structures. These vesicles colocalized with a marker of late endosomes/lysosomes, LAMP2, specifying redirection from a recycling to a degradative pathway. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis showed a marked increase in vacuoles in myoferlin-null muscle. These data demonstrate that IGF1 receptor recycling is required for normal myogenesis and that myoferlin is a critical mediator of postnatal muscle growth mediated by IGF1.—Demonbreun, A.

Inhibition of NF-κB or activation of NF-κB resulted in decreased or increased Wip1 expression, respectively, at both the mRNA and protein levels. PPM1D promoter activity was positively regulated by NF-κB, and this regulation was dependent on the presence of the conserved κB site in the PPM1D promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed basal binding of the p65 NF-κB subunit to the PPM1D promoter region encompassing the κB site, which is enhanced after NF-κB activation by tumor necrosis factor-α. Finally, we show that Wip1 expression is induced in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse splenic B-cells and is required for maximum proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2080579437,"The archaeal ribosomal stalk complex has been shown to have an apparently conserved functional structure with eukaryotic pentameric stalk complex; it provides access to eukaryotic elongation factors at levels comparable to that of the eukaryotic stalk. The crystal structure of the archaeal heptameric (P0(P1)(2)(P1)(2)(P1)(2)) stalk complex shows that the rRNA anchor protein P0 consists of an N-terminal rRNA-anchoring domain followed by three separated spine helices on which three P1 dimers bind. Based on the structure, we have generated P0 mutants depleted of any binding site(s) for P1 dimer(s). Factor-dependent GTPase assay of such mutants suggested that the first P1 dimer has higher activity than the others. Furthermore, we constructed a model of the archaeal 50 S with stalk complex by superposing the rRNA-anchoring domain of P0 on the archaeal 50 S. This model indicates that the C termini of P1 dimers where translation factors bind are all localized to the region between the stalk base of the 50 S and P0 spine helices. Together with the mutational experiments we infer that the functional significance of multiple copies of P1 is in creating a factor pool within a limited space near the stalk base of the ribosome."

The HECT class of E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases directly transfers Ub from bound E2 enzyme to a myriad of substrates. The catalytic domain of HECT Ub ligases has a bilobal architecture that separates the E2 binding region and catalytic site. An important question regarding HECT domain function is the control of ligase activity and specificity. Here we present a functional analysis of the HECT domain of the E3 ligase HUWE1 based on crystal structures and show that a single N-terminal helix significantly stabilizes the HECT domain. We observe that this element modulates HECT domain activity, as measured by self-ubiquitination induced in the absence of this helix, as distinct from its effects on Ub conjugation of substrate Mcl-1. Such subtle changes to the protein may be at the heart of the vast spectrum of substrate specificities displayed by HECT domain E3 ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2014912370,A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) include a family of scaffolding proteins that target protein kinase A (PKA) and other signaling proteins to cellular compartments and thereby confine the activities of the associated proteins to distinct regions within cells. AKAPs bind PKA directly. The interaction is mediated by the dimerization and docking domain of regulatory subunits of PKA and the PKA-binding domain of AKAPs. Analysis of the interactions between the dimerization and docking domain and various PKA-binding domains yielded a generalized motif allowing the identification of AKAPs. Our bioinformatics and peptide array screening approaches based on this signature motif identified GSKIP (glycogen synthase kinase 3beta interaction protein) as an AKAP. GSKIP directly interacts with PKA and GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3beta). It is widely expressed and facilitates phosphorylation and thus inactivation of GSK3beta by PKA. GSKIP contains the evolutionarily conserved domain of unknown function 727. We show here that this domain of GSKIP and its vertebrate orthologues binds both PKA and GSK3beta and thereby provides a mechanism for the integration of PKA and GSK3beta signaling pathways.

Here we used a combination of methods to investigate the dimerization properties of the three human EB proteins EB1, EB2, and EB3. Based on Förster resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate that the C-terminal dimerization domains of EBs (EBc) can readily exchange their chains in solution. We further document that EB1c and EB3c preferentially form heterodimers, whereas EB2c does not participate significantly in the formation of heterotypic complexes. Measurements of the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, homology modeling, and mutagenesis provide details of the molecular determinants of homo- versus heterodimer formation of EBc domains. Fluorescence spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance studies in the presence of the cytoskeleton-associated protein-glycine-rich domains of either CLIP-170 or p150glued or of a fragment derived from the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein show that chain exchange of EBc domains can be controlled by binding partners.

Microtubules are filamentous structures involved in many vital cellular activities. They contain two structurally and functionally distinct ends, slow-growing minus ends, and fast-growing plus ends and are, thus, intrinsically polar (for review, see Refs. 1.Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar and 2.Howard J. Hyman A.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In cells, the microtubule minus ends are often anchored to the microtubule organizing center and are, thus, stable, whereas microtubule plus ends are highly dynamic and stochastically switch between phases of growing and shortening. The intrinsic dynamic nature of microtubules is central to microtubule function and is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally by so-called microtubule-associated proteins.

Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 5.Tirnauer J.S. Bierer B.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). EBs autonomously track microtubule tips independent of additional factors, most likely by recognizing a structural feature of the growing microtubule plus end (6.Bieling P. Laan L. Schek H.

Moreover, EBs play an essential role in targeting a diverse range of +TIP binding partners to microtubule ends (4.Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). EBs comprise about 300 residues and contain highly conserved N- and C-terminal domains that are separated by a more variable linker sequence (4.Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The globular N-terminal moiety shows the characteristic features of calponin homology (CH) domains and is necessary and sufficient for microtubule binding (11.Hayashi I. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36430-36434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (EBc) contains an α-helical parallel coiled-coil, which mediates the dimerization of EB polypeptide chains (12.Honnappa S. John C.M. Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It partially overlaps with the unique EB homology (EBH) domain, which contains a four-helix bundle and a disordered C-terminal tail (12.Honnappa S. John C.M. Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13.Slep K.C. Rogers S.L. Elliott S.L. Ohkura H. Kolodziej P.A. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The EBH domain specifically recognizes SXIP motifs embedded within basic and serine-rich sequence regions (14.Honnappa S. Gouveia S.M. Weisbrich A. Damberger F.F. Bhavesh N.S. Jawhari H. Grigoriev I. van Rijssel F.J. Buey R.M. Lawera A. Jelesarov I. Winkler F.K. Wüthrich K. Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Cell. 2009; 138: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation-controlled EBH-SXIP interaction is necessary and sufficient for targeting numerous structurally and functionally unrelated +TIPs to microtubule plus ends, including the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, the microtubule-actin cross-linking factor (MACF), cytoplasmic linker protein (CLIP-170)-associated proteins (CLASPs), the transmembrane protein stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1), and the mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK). The SXIP motif thus acts as a widespread microtubule tip localization signal (MtLS) (14.Honnappa S. Gouveia S.M. Weisbrich A. Damberger F.F. Bhavesh N.S. Jawhari H. Grigoriev I. van Rijssel F.J. Buey R.M. Lawera A. Jelesarov I. Winkler F.K. Wüthrich K. Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Cell. 2009; 138: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 20–30-residue tails of EBs share a highly conserved C-terminal tripeptide, denoted the EE(Y/F) motif. The EE(Y/F) motif with the carboxylate group of the terminal aromatic residue is specifically recognized by the highly conserved GKNDG motif of cytoskeleton-associated protein-glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domains present in, for example, CLIP-170 and the large dynactin subunit p150glued (15.Weisbrich A.

Akhmanova A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 535-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mammals, the EBs are represented by three proteins, EB1, EB2 (RP1), and EB3 (EBF3), which are encoded by separate genes (17.Su L.K. Qi Y. Genomics. 2001; 71: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). So far, functional studies have been primarily focused on EB1, but it is becoming increasingly clear that despite their high sequence conservation, the individual EBs exhibit different regulatory and functional properties. For example, EB2 displays lower affinity than EB1 and EB3 for several well characterized binding partners, such as APC and mitotic centromere-associated kinesin, and is, thus, less likely to be involved in their targeting to microtubule plus ends (18.Bu W. Su L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49721-49731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19.Lee T. Langford K.J. Askham J.M. Brüning-Richardson A. Morrison E.E. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). EB3 was also found to bind to the F-actin-binding protein drebrin (20.Geraldo S. Khanzada U.K. Parsons M. Chilton J.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH-1 (21.Ban R. Matsuzaki H. Akashi T. Sakashita G. Taniguchi H. Park S.Y. Tanaka H. Furukawa K. Urano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28367-28381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas no such interactions were observed for the other EBs. These observations support the view that the individual mammalian EBs can differentially bind to partners. The EBs also exhibit different spatial and temporal expression patterns. In contrast to EB1 and EB2, EB3 is up-regulated in neurons and muscle cells (22.Jaworski J. Kapitein L.C. Gouveia S.M. Dortland B.R. Wulf P.S. Grigoriev I. Camera P. Spangler S.A. Di Stefano P.

Furthermore, a phosphorylation controlled interaction between EB3 and SIAH-1 regulates EB3 degradation and, hence, expression levels during the cell cycle, whereas no such regulation was observed for EB1 and EB2 (21.Ban R. Matsuzaki H. Akashi T. Sakashita G. Taniguchi H. Park S.Y. Tanaka H. Furukawa K. Urano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28367-28381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have recently documented that mammalian EBs differentially affect microtubule dynamics (9.Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). EB1 and EB3 promote persistent microtubule growth by suppressing catastrophes (a switch from the growing to the shrinkage phase of a microtubule). By comparison, EB2 is much less potent; this functional difference is partially due to amino acid substitutions in the CH domain of EB2. Although both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that CH domains are sufficient for tracking growing microtubule plus ends, dimerization was shown to be necessary for the anti-catastrophe activity of EB proteins (9.Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In this context, we reported that the EBs can also form heterodimers through their C-terminal domains (9.Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Differences or changes in the dimerization properties of the three EBs may, therefore, contribute to the differences in the anti-catastrophe activity. Interestingly, C-terminal EB dimerization domains act as dominant negative mutants and have been used in an array of cellular studies as tools to interfere with the activity of endogenous EB proteins (9.Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J.

They were found to affect all EB species by removing them from microtubule plus ends, which results in an increase in the catastrophe frequency (9.Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of EB dimerization and the mechanism underlying the dominant negative effect of EBc domains is poorly understood. Acquiring knowledge of these properties is, however, important to understand the different functions of mammalian EB proteins and to interpret data obtained in the presence of transiently overexpressed EBc domains in cells. Moreover, the dimerization properties of EB proteins are likely to play a role in regulatory mechanisms used by EBs to control microtubule dynamics. Using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, structural, and cell biological methods together with computational modeling, this paper provides molecular insight into the mechanism of EB dimerization and its regulation by +TIPs binding partners. For all EB constructs, DNA was PCR-amplified from human EB1, EB2, and EB3 full-length cDNA clones kindly provided by W. Bu and L. Su (18.Bu W. Su L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49721-49731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19.Lee T. Langford K.J. Askham J.M. Brüning-Richardson A. Morrison E.E. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2494-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The insertion of EB1c (Asp-191—Tyr-268) into the bacterial expression vector pET15b (Invitrogen) has been described (33.Honnappa S. Okhrimenko O. Jaussi R. Jawhari H. Jelesarov I. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To create a tag-less version of EB1c, a PCR-amplified EB1c fragment was ligated between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET15b (Invitrogen). Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) of EB3c (Ala-200—Tyr-281) into a pDEST17 vector has been previously described (9.Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). N-terminal fluorescent protein-tagged EB1c, EB2c (Thr-242—Tyr-327), and EB3c constructs were generated as follows. First, monomeric variants of enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (mECFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (mEYFP) were generated using pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 vectors (Clontech) as DNA templates. Next, PCR products of mECFP and mEYFP were inserted by a PCR-splicing method (34.Geiser M. Cèbe R. Drewello D. Schmitz R. Biotechniques. 2001; 31: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) into pET15b between the regions encoding for the hexahistidine tag and the thrombin cleavage site. The thrombin cleavage site and the BamHI site were part of the 11-amino acid linker SGLVPRGSSDP introduced between the fluorescent proteins and EBc domains. The antisense primer used in this step also introduced two stop codons followed by an EcoRI restriction site. Finally, PCR-amplified EBc domains were ligated between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. For bacterial expression of full-length EB1 and EB3, PCR-amplified DNA was ligated into the pET28a vector (Invitrogen) between the NcoI and BamHI sites, where the intrinsic BamHI site in EB2 was silently mutated. These plasmids were used to generate C-terminal fluorescent protein-tagged EB full-length constructs. PCR-amplified fluorescent protein DNA fragments were derived from pmECFP, pmEYFP, pmEGFP-N1, and pmCherry-N1 (Clontech) and ligated between the BamHI and XhoI sites to provide all constructs with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The insertion of p150CG (Met-18—Ser-111 of human p150glued), and the construction of the p150CG(A49M) mutant in pET15b has been described in (33.Honnappa S. Okhrimenko O. Jaussi R. Jawhari H.

The Gateway cloning of ClipCG2 (Arg-210—Gly-282 of human CLIP-170) is reported in Ref. 15.Weisbrich A. Honnappa S. Jaussi R. Okhrimenko O. Frey D. Jelesarov I. Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar. All mutagenesis was carried out using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene. The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) was used for all protein expressions. Bacteria were grown to an A600 of 0.8 in LB medium at 37 °C containing the appropriate antibiotic. Cultures were induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and protein expression was performed at 22 °C for 16 h. For the preparation of uniformly 15N-labeled EB1c, cells were grown in a minimal medium as previously described (35.Honnappa S. Cutting B. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38926-38934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins were purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography on HisTrap Ni2+-Sepharose chelating columns (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. To remove the His tag, the recombinant proteins were dialyzed against thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2), and proteolytic cleavage was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C using human thrombin (Sigma) at a concentration of 3 units/mg of recombinant protein. The processed proteins were reapplied to immobilized metal-affinity chromatography to separate digested proteins from the hexahistidine tag and from uncleaved protein. Uniformly 15N-labeled EB1c containing no affinity tag was purified by ion exchange chromatography using a self-packed ResourceQ™ FastFlow 10/5 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, supplemented with 5 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT) at 4 °C. After sample loading, the column was washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by applying a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m) in the same buffer. All processed protein samples were gel-filtered on a SEC HiLoad™ Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The N-acetylated and C-amidated APCp1 (Val-2781—Lys-2819 of human APC) peptide was assembled on an automated continuous-flow synthesizer employing standard methods. The homogeneity of the proteins and peptides was confirmed by either 15% SDS-PAGE (proteins) or HPLC followed by mass spectral analysis (APCp1). The concentrations of protein and peptide solutions were determined by tyrosine and tryptophan absorbance at 280 nm. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements at 37 °C were carried out in PBS, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. 50-μl protein solutions were analyzed in 384-well plates (black flat-bottom; Greiner no. 781900) covered with an optical clear adhesive seal (ABsolute QPCR Seal (AB-1170), Thermo scientific) in a TECAN Saphir II plate reader. A minimal excitation/emission bandwidth of 5 nm was used. The gain and the Z-position were set manually to 85 and 10,000 μm, respectively. Emission spectra were recorded between 450 and 650 nm, and excitation was performed at 434 nm. For kinetic measurements, FRET fluorescence was recorded at 527 nm. 10 readings per time point with an integration time of 40 μs were collected. For data analysis, three kinetic traces or spectra were averaged. Kinetic half-lives were calculated by single-exponential fitting using MATLAB Version 7.8 (The MathWorks, Inc.). S.D. from the average values were <5%. SLS experiments were performed on a miniDawn TriStar system equipped with an Optilab rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technology Corp.) coupled to a Superdex 200 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column run on an Agilent 1100 HPLC. 100 μl of 20 μm protein solutions were injected at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto the column equilibrated in PBS supplemented with 2 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. The molecular masses of the eluted proteins were determined with the Wyatt Astra Version 5.3.1.5 software package (Wyatt Technology Corp.). CD experiments with EBc domains were performed on a J-715 instrument (Jasco Ltd.) equipped with a computer-controlled water bath using cylindrical jacketed cuvettes of 1-mm optical path length. Thermal melting curves were recorded with 50 μm protein in PBS, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA by continuous heating at 1 deg min−1. Data points (ellipticity at 222 nm) were collected every 10 s. Reversibility was determined from the recovery of the mean residue ellipticity (MRE222) after cooling and was always found to be better than 95%. Thermal melting curves were analyzed according to a two-state model as described in Ref. 36.Dürr E. Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar. For measurements of urea melting curves, 40 μm of protein was incubated overnight at the corresponding urea concentrations. The signal was averaged for 3 min after thermal equilibration. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression according to well established procedures (37.Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Kinetic CD experiments with EBc domains were performed with the π*-180 instrument (Applied Photophysics). The dead time was 1–2 ms, and the optical path length was 10 mm. The detection wavelength was 225 nm, and the slits were set to 4 mm. Refolding was initiated by mixing one volume of buffered protein solution (PBS, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA) containing 8–9 m urea with 10 or 25 volumes of buffer or with buffer containing various concentrations of the denaturant. Unfolding rates were measured by a 1:10 dilution of the protein into solutions containing final urea concentrations higher than the midpoint of equilibrium urea unfolding. 10–15 mixing experiments were averaged for each kinetic trace. Unfolding traces were modeled with a single-exponential function to extract the rate constants for unfolding (ku) using the software provided by the manufacturer. The rate constants for refolding (kf) in urea were calculated as described previously (36.Dürr E. Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Linear extrapolation to 0 m denaturant of the corresponding limbs in plots of ln kf,u versus [urea] yielded the kinetic constants in the absence of urea (38.Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999Google Scholar). All dimeric forms of human EBc domains (EB2c·EB2c, EB3c·EB3c, EB1c·EB2c, EB1c·EB3c, EB2c·EB3c) were modeled based on the x-ray structure of human EB1c·EB1c at 1.54 Å resolution (PDB code 1WU9). The EB1c homodimer structure was used as a template in Modeler 9v6 (39.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar), allowing for simultaneous energy minimization of both chains in the homo- or heterodimers. A multiple-sequence alignment of human, murine, and rat EB1c, EB2c, and EB3c was used as the basis for the modeling process. The homo- or heterodimeric models, thus, obtained were geometry-regularized with PHENIX 1.4 (40.Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCo"
https://openalex.org/W1965723381,"IIp45 (aka MIIP) is a newly discovered gene whose protein product inhibits cell migration. HDAC6 is a class IIb deacetylase that specifically deacetylates α-tubulin, modulates microtubule dynamics, and promotes cell migration. A yeast two-hybrid assay using IIp45 as bait identified HDAC6 protein as a binding partner of IIp45. This physical interaction of the two functionally antagonistic proteins was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay in human cells. Serial deletion constructs of HDAC6 were used to characterize the interaction of HDAC6 and IIp45, and this analysis found that the two catalytic domains of HDAC6 protein are required for IIp45 binding. We examined the protein expression patterns of IIp45 and HDAC6 in glioma tissues. Elevated protein levels of HDAC6 were found in high grade glioma samples, in contrast to the decreased protein expression of IIp45. The potential negative regulation of HDAC6 expression by IIp45 was confirmed in cell lines with altered IIp45 expression by constitutive overexpression or small interfering RNA knockdown. Protein turnover study revealed that overexpression of IIp45 significantly reduces the intracellular protein stability of endogenous HDAC6, indicating a possible mechanism for the negative regulation of HDAC6 by IIp45. Results from the HDAC activity assay demonstrated that overexpressed IIp45 effectively decreases HDAC6 activity, increases acetylated α-tubulin, and reduces cell migration. The increased cell migration resulting from siIIp45 knockdown was significantly reversed by co-transfection of siHDAC6. Thus, we report here for the first time a novel mechanism by which IIp45 inhibits cell motility through inhibition of HDAC6.

HDAC6 is a class IIb deacetylase that specifically deacetylates α-tubulin, modulates microtubule dynamics, and promotes cell migration. A yeast two-hybrid assay using IIp45 as bait identified HDAC6 protein as a binding partner of IIp45. This physical interaction of the two functionally antagonistic proteins was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay in human cells. Serial deletion constructs of HDAC6 were used to characterize the interaction of HDAC6 and IIp45, and this analysis found that the two catalytic domains of HDAC6 protein are required for IIp45 binding. We examined the protein expression patterns of IIp45 and HDAC6 in glioma tissues. Elevated protein levels of HDAC6 were found in high grade glioma samples, in contrast to the decreased protein expression of IIp45. The potential negative regulation of HDAC6 expression by IIp45 was confirmed in cell lines with altered IIp45 expression by constitutive overexpression or small interfering RNA knockdown. Protein turnover study revealed that overexpression of IIp45 significantly reduces the intracellular protein stability of endogenous HDAC6, indicating a possible mechanism for the negative regulation of HDAC6 by IIp45. Results from the HDAC activity assay demonstrated that overexpressed IIp45 effectively decreases HDAC6 activity, increases acetylated α-tubulin, and reduces cell migration. The increased cell migration resulting from siIIp45 knockdown was significantly reversed by co-transfection of siHDAC6. Thus, we report here for the first time a novel mechanism by which IIp45 inhibits cell motility through inhibition of HDAC6."
https://openalex.org/W2073162592,"Alterations in mitochondrial metabolism have been associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. This is seen in diseases caused by misfolding of proteins with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts, such as Huntington's disease. Although evidence of mitochondrial impairment has been extensively documented in patients and disease models, the mechanisms involved and their relevance to the initiation of polyQ cytotoxicity and development of clinical manifestations remain controversial. We report that in yeast models of polyQ cytotoxicity, wild-type and mutant polyQ domains might associate early with the outer mitochondrial membrane. The association of mutant domains with mitochondrial membranes could contribute to induce significant changes in mitochondrial physiology, ultimately compromising the cell's ability to respire. The respiratory defect can be fully prevented by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis by overexpression of Hap4p, the catalytic subunit of the transcriptional activator Hap2/3/4/5p complex, the master regulator of the expression of many nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in yeast. Protecting cellular respiratory capacity in this way ameliorates the effect of expanded polyQ on cellular fitness. We conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction is an important contributor to polyQ cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that therapeutic approaches enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis could reduce polyQ toxicity and delay the development of clinical symptoms in patients.—Ocampo, A., Zambrano, A., Barrientos, A.

https://openalex.org/W1992919242,"We combined fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) beam-size analysis with biochemical assays to investigate the mechanisms of membrane recruitment and activation of phospholipase C-β2 (PLCβ2) by G protein αq and βγ dimers. We show that activation by αq and βγ differ from activation by Rac2 and from each other. Stimulation by αq enhanced the plasma membrane association of PLCβ2, but not of PLCβ2Δ, which lacks the αq-interacting region. Although αq resembled Rac2 in increasing the contribution of exchange to the FRAP of PLCβ2 and in enhancing its membrane association, the latter effect was weaker than with Rac2. Moreover, the membrane recruitment of PLCβ2 by αq occurred by enhancing PLCβ2 association with fast-diffusing (lipid-like) membrane components, whereas stimulation by Rac2 led to interactions with slow diffusing membrane sites. On the other hand, activation by βγ shifted the FRAP of PLCβ2 and PLCβ2Δ to pure lateral diffusion 3- to 5-fold faster than lipids, suggesting surfing-like diffusion along the membrane. We propose that these different modes of PLCβ2 membrane recruitment may accommodate contrasting functional needs to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) in localized versus dispersed populations. PLCβ2 activation by Rac2, which leads to slow lateral diffusion and much faster exchange, recruits PLCβ2 to act locally on PtdInsP2 at specific domains. Activation by αq leads to lipid-like diffusion of PLCβ2 accompanied by exchange, enabling the sampling of larger, yet limited, areas prior to dissociation.

Recent results show that βγ and Rac/Cdc42 activate PLCβ2 by interacting, at least in part, with different regions of the effector enzyme. Thus, although the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCβ2 is dispensable for activation of the enzyme by βγ dimers (6Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol.

Because both PLCβ substrate(s) and stimulators are membrane-bound (16Drin G. Scarlata S. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1383-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23McLaughlin S. Wang J.

This view is consistent with the loss of PLCβ activation following mutations that interfere with the membrane association of αq or βγ (25Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R.

The PH domains of several proteins (e.g. PLCδ1 and the Dictyostelium discoideum CRAC protein) were found to undergo dynamic membrane-cytoplasm exchange along with lateral diffusion over short distances (35Matsuoka S.

Using FRAP beam-size analysis (37Henis Y.I. Rotblat B. Kloog Y. Methods. 2006; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which discriminates between recovery by lateral diffusion and exchange, we demonstrated that activation by Rac2 enhances the association of PLCβ2 and PLCβ2Δ with the plasma membrane via binding to slow diffusing membrane proteins. However, the effects of the G protein subunits αq and βγ on the membrane interactions of PLCβ2 and their potential relevance to PLCβ2 stimulation were not explored. Here, we show that αq and βγ recruit PLCβ2 to the plasma membrane by distinct mechanisms, which differ from the mechanism employed by Rac2 and from each other. Each stimulator leads to a specific ratio between the rates of exchange and lateral diffusion characterizing the interaction of PLCβ2 with the membrane, and this in turn allows the enzyme to act preferentially on localized or dispersed PtdInsP2 populations.

Bovine and human γ2 have identical amino acid sequences, and mouse αq differs from human αq in but one residue (S141A). There are several indications that this residue has no role in αq function: (i) In mouse αq, Ser141 is in a long loop connecting helices αE and αF of the helical domain (PDB accession codes 2BCJ and 2RGN); it does not reside in any of the three switch domains or in regions known to interact with PLCβ isozymes and is not among the residues that contact the bound guanine nucleotide and Gβγ (38Arkinstall S.

Experiments were conducted with each beam size (beam-size analysis; described previously (7Illenberger D. Walliser C. Strobel J. Gutman O. Niv H. Gaidzik V. Kloog Y. Gierschik P. Henis Y.I. J. Biol.

The ratio between the illuminated areas (ω2(40×)/ω2(63×)) was 2.56 (n = 39). After a brief measurement at the monitoring intensity, a 5-milliwatt pulse (4–6 ms or 10–20 ms for the 63× and 40× objectives, respectively) bleached 50–70% of the fluorescence in the spot. Fluorescence recovery was followed by the monitoring beam. The apparent characteristic fluorescence recovery time (τ) and the mobile fraction (Rf) were derived from the FRAP curves by nonlinear regression analysis, fitting to a lateral diffusion process with a single τ value (49Petersen N.O. Felder S. Elson E.L. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C.C. Herzenberg L.A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Edinburgh1986: 24.21-24.23Google Scholar). The significance of differences between τ values measured with the same laser beam size was evaluated by Student's t test. To compare ratio measurements (τ(40×)/τ(63×) and ω2(40×)/ω2(63×)), we employed bootstrap analysis, which is preferable for comparison between ratio values (50Efron B. Tibshirani R. Cox D.R. Hinkley D.V. Reid N. Rubin D.B. Silverman B.W. An Introduction to Bootstrap. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 124-130Google Scholar). The τ(40×) and τ(63×) values were resampled with replacement using Excel, and average values from each group of resampled data (τ(40×)Boot and τ(63×)Boot) were derived. For each beam size, 1000 averaged samples were generated, followed by calculation of the bootstrap ratio dividing τ(40×)Boot by τ(63×)Boot. To evaluate whether the τ ratios thus obtained differ significantly from the beam-size ratio calculated by the same method (ω2(40×)Boot/ω2(63×)Boot), the set of the τ bootstrap ratios was divided by the set of beam area bootstrap ratios, and the p value was derived from the spread of the resulting histogram at ∼1. Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed once with 0.5 ml/well of buffer A (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), followed by addition of 0.4 ml/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) and 10 mm LiCl. After incubation for 20 h, the cells were washed once with 0.4 ml/well of buffer A and lysed in 0.2 ml/well 10 mm ice-cold formic acid (51Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, neutralized with 0.3 ml/well of 10 mm NH4OH, and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g. The total inositol phosphates in the supernatants were separated on columns of Dowex® 1 × 8–200 ion exchange resin (Sigma), as described (51Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 52Camps M. Hou C.F. Jakobs K.H. Gierschik P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. COS-7 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected as described above by vectors encoding wt or mutant GFP-PLCβ2 and various activators. After 20 h, the cells were serum-starved (24 h) to avoid serum-induced activation, scraped into 8 ml of buffer A, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. The cells were lysed in 70 μl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 3 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing followed by homogenization, forcing the suspension ten times through a 0.40- × 20-mm syringe needle. After removal of unbroken cells and nuclei (300 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The P fraction was washed once with 100 μl of buffer B and resuspended in 25 μl of buffer B. To enable direct comparison of the relative distribution of PLCβ2-GFP (wt or mutant) between the two fractions, equal proportions (identical percentages by volume, v/v) of pairs of the P and S fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibodies followed by peroxidase goat anti-mouse and ECL. The bands were quantified by densitometry using EZQuant-Gel 2.2 (EZQuant Ltd.). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (53Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine IgG as standard. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were as described before (7Illenberger D. Walliser C. Strobel J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8645-8652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECLTM Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). PLCβ2 can be activated by G protein subunits (αq, βγ) and by Rac with different orders of efficacy and potency (1Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 6Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3006-3014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because the different stimulators interact with distinct regions of the enzyme, they may differ in their ability to recruit PLCβ2 to the membrane, as well as in the resulting mode of membrane interactions. We therefore compared, in cells and under identical conditions, the activation of PLCβ2 and the PLCβ2Δ mutant by the different stimulators (Fig. 1). Because a major part of the studies involves PLCβ2-GFP chimeric proteins, we validated that the GFP tagging does not interfere with the activation of the enzyme by all the stimulators. To this end, we compared side-by-side (Fig. 1) the ability of β1γ2, αq, and Rac2 (wt or mutated) to stimulate inositol phosphate formation by PLCβ2, PLCβ2-GFP, and PLCβ2Δ-GFP. Inositol phosphate formation was measured in COS-7 cells co-transfected with vectors encoding one of the above PLCβ2 constructs (replaced by empty or GFP-encoding vectors as controls) together with: (i) β1γ2 (β1 along with γ2(wt)); (ii) β1γ2(C68S) (β1 along with the isoprenylation mutant γ2(C68S)); (iii) αq(wt); (iv) Rac2(wt); or (v) Rac2(G12V). Comparison between the inositol phosphate formation levels in cells transfected with PLCβ2 versus PLCβ2-GFP (third and fourth bar groups in Fig. 1) clearly demonstrates that PLCβ2-GFP was activated by all stimulators to an extent similar to that of untagged PLCβ2. These results confirm the earlier demonstration that PLCβ2-GFP is effectively stimulated by activated Rac2 (7Illenberger D. Walliser C. Strobel J. Gutman O. Niv H. Gaidzik V. Kloog Y. Gierschik P. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8645-8652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and extend them to show that attachment of GFP to the C terminus of PLCβ2 does not affect the regulation of the enzyme by the heterotrimeric G protein subunits. For both PLCβ2 and PLCβ2-GFP, the degree of stimulation was Rac2(G12V) > αq(wt) > β1γ2. Considering that only a portion of αq(wt) is activated under the conditions used here, this is consistent with the rank order of potencies (which cannot be directly determined in cells) of the three stimulators in in vitro assays: activated αq > activated Rac2 > β1γ2 (6Illenberger D.

https://openalex.org/W2022915573,"Recent studies in rodent models suggest that liver X receptors (LXRs) may play an important role in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis and islet function. To date, however, no studies have comprehensively examined the role of LXRs in human islet biology. Human islets were isolated from non-diabetic donors and incubated in the presence or absence of two synthetic LXR agonists, TO-901317 and GW3965, under conditions of low and high glucose. LXR agonist treatment enhanced both basal and stimulated insulin secretion, which corresponded to an increase in the expression of genes involved in anaplerosis and reverse cholesterol transport. Furthermore, enzyme activity of pyruvate carboxylase, a key regulator of pyruvate cycling and anaplerotic flux, was also increased. Whereas LXR agonist treatment up-regulated known downstream targets involved in lipogenesis, we observed no increase in the accumulation of intra-islet triglyceride at the dose of agonist used in our study. Moreover, LXR activation increased expression of the genes encoding hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase, two enzymes involved in lipolysis and glycerolipid/free fatty acid cycling. Chronically, insulin gene expression was increased after treatment with TO-901317, and this was accompanied by increased Pdx-1 nuclear protein levels and enhanced Pdx-1 binding to the insulin promoter. In conclusion, our data suggest that LXR agonists have a direct effect on the islet to augment insulin secretion and expression, actions that should be considered either as therapeutic or unintended side effects, as these agents are developed for clinical use."

https://openalex.org/W2013601117,"Iapetus Revealed The striking appearance of Saturn's moon Iapetus—half black and half white—has puzzled astronomers for over three centuries. Now Spencer and Denk (p. 432 , published online 10 December) present an explanation for this asymmetry: A thermally controlled runaway migration of water ice triggered by exogenic deposition of dark material on the moon's leading darker side, which faces the direction of motion of the moon in its orbit around Saturn. This mechanism is unique to Iapetus because it rotates slowly enough to allow large temperature variations to arise, it is small enough to allow long-range migration of water, and there is a source of dust to trigger the process. In a related paper, Denk et al. (p. 435 , published online 10 December) present data derived from the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem that reveal that both dark and bright materials on the leading side of Iapetus are redder than their trailing-side counterparts. This asymmetry results from the deposition of dust and debris from other moons in the saturnian system—the very same process that initiates the thermal segregation proposed above."
https://openalex.org/W2044439388,"c-Myc is an important transcription factor that regulates cellular proliferation, cell growth, and differentiation. A number of transcriptional co-factors for c-Myc have been described that have binding sites within highly conserved regions of the c-Myc transactivational domain (TAD). Given the importance of the c-Myc TAD, we set out to identify new proteins that interact with this region using a yeast two-hybrid assay. HBP1 was identified in our screen as a protein that interacts with full-length c-Myc but not a c-Myc mutant lacking the TAD. HBP1 is a transcriptional repressor and has been shown to negatively regulate the cell cycle. A correlation between HBP1 under-expression and breast cancer relapse has been described, suggesting that HBP1 may be an important tumor suppressor protein. We have found that HBP1 binds c-Myc in cells, and expression of HBP1 inhibits c-Myc transactivational activity at least partly by preventing c-Myc binding to target gene promoters. c-Myc binds to the C terminus of HBP1, a region lost in some breast tumors, and some HBP1 mutants found in breast cancer weakly interact with and/or no longer negatively regulate c-Myc. This work adds to our understanding of c-Myc regulation and mechanisms of tumor suppression by HBP1."

https://openalex.org/W1976771049,"The catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial (mt) RNA polymerase (RNAP) is highly homologous to the bacteriophage T7/T3 RNAP. Unlike the phage RNAP, however, the mtRNAP relies on accessory proteins to initiate promoter-specific transcription. Rpo41, the catalytic subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtRNAP, requires Mtf1 for opening the duplex promoter. To elucidate the role of Mtf1 in promoter-specific DNA opening, we have mapped the structural organization of the mtRNAP using site-specific protein-DNA photo-cross-linking studies. Both Mtf1 and Rpo41 cross-linked to distinct sites on the promoter DNA, but the dominant cross-links were those of the Mtf1, which indicates a direct role of Mtf1 in promoter-specific binding and initiation. Strikingly, Mtf1 cross-linked with a high efficiency to the melted region of the promoter DNA, based on which we suggest that Mtf1 facilitates DNA melting by trapping the non-template strand in the unwound conformation. Additional strong cross-links of the Mtf1 were observed with the -8 to -10 base-paired region of the promoter. The cross-linking results were incorporated into a structural model of the mtRNAP-DNA, created from a homology model of the C-terminal domain of Rpo41 and the available structure of Mtf1. The promoter DNA is sandwiched between Mtf1 and Rpo41 in the structural model, and Mtf1 closely associates mainly with one face of the promoter across the entire nona-nucleotide consensus sequence. Overall, the studies reveal that in many ways the role of Mtf1 is analogous to the transcription factors of the multisubunit RNAPs, which provides an intriguing link between single- and multisubunit RNAPs."
https://openalex.org/W2030438778,"The co-chaperone Hep1 is required to prevent the aggregation of mitochondrial Hsp70 proteins. We have analyzed the interaction of Hep1 with mitochondrial Hsp70 (Ssc1) and the determinants in Ssc1 that make it prone to aggregation. The ATPase and peptide binding domain (PBD) of Hsp70 proteins are connected by a linker segment that mediates interdomain communication between the domains. We show here that the minimal Hep1 binding entity of Ssc1 consists of the ATPase domain and the interdomain linker. In the absence of Hep1, the ATPase domain with the interdomain linker had the tendency to aggregate, in contrast to the ATPase domain with the mutated linker segment or without linker, and in contrast to the PBD. The closest homolog of Ssc1, bacterial DnaK, and a Ssc1 chimera, in which a segment of the ATPase domain of Ssc1 was replaced by the corresponding segment from DnaK, did not aggregate in Delta hep1 mitochondria. The propensity to aggregate appears to be a specific property of the mitochondrial Hsp70 proteins. The ATPase domain in combination with the interdomain linker is crucial for aggregation of Ssc1. In conclusion, our results suggest that interdomain communication makes Ssc1 prone to aggregation. Hep1 counteracts aggregation by binding to this aggregation-prone conformer."
https://openalex.org/W1967018327,"Several residues are conserved in the transmembrane domains (TMs) of G-protein coupled receptors. Here we demonstrate that a conserved proline, Pro247, in TM6 of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) is required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export and trafficking after agonist-induced internalization. Alanine-substituted mutants of the conserved residues of PAFRs, including P247A, were retained in the ER. Because a PAFR antagonist, Y-24180, acted as a pharmacological chaperone to rescue ER retention, this retention is due to misfolding of PAFR. Methylcarbamyl (mc)-PAF, a PAFR agonist, did not increase the cell surface expression of P247A, even though another ER-retained mutant, D63A, was effectively trafficked. Signaling and accumulation of the receptors in the early endosomes were observed in the mc-PAF-treated P247A-expressing cells, suggesting that P247A was trafficked to the cell surface by mc-PAF, and thereafter disappeared from the surface due to aberrant trafficking, e.g. enhanced internalization, deficiency in recycling, and/or accelerated degradation. The aberrant trafficking was confirmed with a sortase-A-mediated method for labeling cell surface proteins. These results demonstrate that the conserved proline in TM6 is crucial for intracellular trafficking of PAFR."

The R9AP·RGS11·Gβ5 complex is exclusively expressed in retinal ON-bipolar neurons which relay the light-elicited signals from the photoreceptors to ganglion cells in the circuit that connects the photoreceptors to the brain (23Cao Y.

Studies with knock-out mice suggest that RGS11 is involved in determining the kinetics of the overall synaptic transmission between photoreceptor and bipolar neurons (24Mojumder D.K. Qian Y. Wensel T.G. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7753-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and that all subunits of the R9AP·RGS11·Gβ5 complex are indispensable for its appropriate localization and expression in the bipolar neurons (23Cao Y.

In this study we have investigated the impact of R9AP on the functional activity of the RGS11·Gβ5 complex. We show that recruitment of RGS11·Gβ5 to the plasma membrane by R9AP results in a substantial increase in the GAP activity of the complex toward lipid-modified but not soluble Gαo. We reconstituted the mGluR6-Go-RGS11 signaling cascade in Xenopus oocytes and utilized the acceleration of the deactivation kinetics of co-expressed G protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as a measure of RGS11 GAP function. Activity of RGS11 in this assay system was discerned only when R9AP was co-expressed. These results establish that membrane anchoring by R9AP is a general mechanism for regulating activity of R7 RGS complexes and, in the case of RGS11, is an essential prerequisite for controlling Gαo signaling through mGluR6.

For the purification of the RGS11·Gβ5S complex, Sf9 cells from 1 liter of Sf9 culture were harvested 48 h after co-infection with amplified recombinant baculoviruses encoding His-tagged RGS11 and Gβ5S, resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and then lysed by sonication. All purification steps were conducted at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, after which the supernatants were diluted with 160 ml of lysis buffer and loaded onto a HisTrap HP 1 ml column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the His-tagged RGS11·Gβ5S complexes were eluted by generating increasing imidazole concentrations with wash buffer mixed with elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol). Peak fractions containing RGS11·Gβ5S complexes were pooled, and a buffer exchange was performed using a Zeba Desalt Spin Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equilibrated with storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Purification of Go from Sf9 cells was conducted as described previously with modifications (33Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells from 1 liter of culture were harvested 48 h after infection with recombinant baculoviruses encoding rat GαoA, Gβ1, and His-tagged Gγ2, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and then lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the resultant pellets were washed with wash buffer (lysis buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2). The pellets were resuspended in wash buffer. C12E10 detergent was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the mixture was stirred for 1 h before centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (wash buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) C12E10). The beads were washed with 25 volumes of buffer A and further washed with 10 volumes of buffer B (wash buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The Go was eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer containing 500 mm imidazole, 0.7% (w/v) CHAPS, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Fractions containing Go were pooled and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. Finally, buffer was exchanged to storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GDP, 0.7% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) by a Zeba Desalt Spin Column (Thermo Scientific). Rod outer segments treated by urea (uROS) and V8-uROS membranes were prepared as described previously with minor modifications (20Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24376-24381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the preparation of insect cell membranes, Sf9 cells and Sf9 cells infected with amplified recombinant baculoviruses encoding R9AP were sonicated in membrane preparation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2), and crude cellular debris was sedimented at 1200 × g for 5 min. The membranes were then sedimented at 30,000 × g for 30 min and washed 3 times with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2). The membranes were stored at −80 °C in membrane preparation buffer containing 10% glycerol. All steps were conducted at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers supplemented with protease inhibitors. Total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Single turnover GTPase assays were conducted as described previously (34Martemyanov K.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at room temperature in GTPase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Illuminated uROS or V8-uROS were used as the source of photoexcited rhodopsin required for G protein activation. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of 200 nm [γ-32P]GTP (∼105 cpm/sample) to 20 μl of uROS or V8-uROS membranes reconstituted with appropriate proteins and membranes from Sf9 cells. Final concentrations in the reactions were 20 μm rhodopsin, 1.0 μm Gαoβ1γ2 heterotrimer purified from Sf9 cells or 1.0 μm Gαo (E. coli) reconstituted with 1.0 μm β1γ1 complex, 180 nm RGS11·Gβ5, 0.68 μm GST, 0.68 μm GST-R9APΔTM, and 0.5 mg/ml Sf9 or R9AP-Sf9 membrane preparations unless otherwise mentioned. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% perchloric acid. Phosphate released from hydrolyzed GTP was determined by activated charcoal assay (35Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because high efficiency interactions between RGS9-1·Gβ5L and Gαo require the presence of the γ subunit of phosphodiesterase, type 6 (PDEγ) (32Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2003; 38: 857-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong T.M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8636-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we conducted the assay in the presence of 1.0 μm PDEγ. The relative amount of RGS9-1 and RGS11 used in the assays was determined by Western blotting. Control experiments were performed to ensure that single turnover conditions are maintained and that GDP/GTP exchange does not limit the GTP hydrolysis (see Refs. 34Martemyanov K.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and 35Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a description of the criteria and supplemental Fig. 1 for results). A membrane binding assay was performed as described previously (20Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24376-24381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, all experiments were conducted in GTPase buffer at 4 °C. Recombinant RGS9-1·Gβ5L or RGS11·Gβ5S was mixed with membranes in the volume of 100 μl, and the mixture was loaded on a 50-μl cushion containing 10% sucrose in GTPase buffer. The mixture was sedimented at 120,000 × g for 15 min in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Supernatants were collected, whereas the sucrose cushions were discarded. The pellet was washed once by GTPase buffer containing 1 m NaCl to reduce nonspecific protein binding and once by GTPase buffer and then resuspended in 100 μl of GTPase buffer. In some experiments, when indicated, the wash step was skipped. Input, resuspended Ppt and Sup fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and the contents of RGS11·Gβ5S, RGS9-1·Gβ5L, R9AP, and Gαo in each sample were determined by Western blot. For the membrane binding assays of Gαo, 10 mm NaF, 20 μm AlCl3, and 10 μm GDP were added into all buffers to activate Gαo and release from Gβγ so that we can test membrane binding activity of free Gα subunits. The final concentrations in the binding reactions were 50 nm RGS9-1·Gβ5L complexes, 27 nm RGS11·Gβ5S, 1.0 μm GST, 1.0 μm GST-R9APΔTM, 0.5 mg/ml Sf9 membranes, 0.5 mg/ml R9AP membranes, and uROS and V8-uROS containing 20 μm rhodopsin. Published methods were used for these studies (37Doupnik C.A. Jaén C. Zhang Q. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 131-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). cRNA was synthesized in vitro from plasmids containing the cDNA and appropriate promoters for cRNA transcription. Plasmids were linearized before cRNA synthesis, and mMESSAGE MACHINE kits (Ambion) were used to generate capped cRNA. cRNA was injected into oocytes at a volume of 50 nl/oocyte using a Drummond microinjector. Oocytes were maintained in a saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) solution supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm), gentamycin (50 μg/ml). A valve system controlled by the data acquisition software pCLAMP 6 (Axon Instruments) was used to control solution changes and to minimize washing and washout times. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings of the oocytes were performed 36–72 h after cRNA injection. Membrane potential was clamped at −80 mV using a AxoClamp 900A amplifier (Molecular Devices) and pCLAMP 6 software. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–1.5 megaohms. To reveal inward currents through the inwardly rectifying GIRK channels, recordings were performed in oocyte saline buffer with elevated (16 mm) KCl concentrations (other components were 82 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). After electrophysiological recording, oocytes were sonicated in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was added per oocyte. The homogenate was centrifuged at 750 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the resultant supernatant was used as a whole protein extract of oocytes. To compare the expression levels of RGS11 proteins in oocytes, Western blotting of the whole protein extracts was performed using rabbit anti-RGS11 CT antibody. Kinetic analysis and curve-fitting were performed using pCLAMP 6 software. Time constants (τ) were derived from the exponentials fitted to the activation and deactivation phases of the GIRK currents. Cursors were positioned at points on the activation and deactivation curves that corresponded to 20 and 80% of the maximum equilibrium responses, and the exponentials were fitted to the portions of the current trace between these two points. We used Student's t test for comparison of the independent means. Two-tailed p value <0.01 is defined as significantly different. Purified uROS have proven to be a valuable model for delineating activity regulation mechanisms of RGS9-1, the closest homologue of RGS11 (34Martemyanov K.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because urea treatment removes the G protein transducin (Gαt) and associated GAPs but leaves endogenous R9AP and GPCR rhodopsin intact (20Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24376-24381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we used this preparation as an initial reagent to study the effects of R9AP on the RGS11·Gβ5 complex. Previous studies have shown that anchoring purified RGS9-1·Gβ5 by native R9AP contained within the uROS preparation markedly potentiates its GAP activity toward exogenously added Gαt (19Baker S.A.

Because Gαt is not the physiological substrate of the RGS11·Gβ5 complex (23Cao Y. Masuho I. Okawa H. Xie K. Asami J. Kammermeier P.J. Maddox D.M. Furukawa T. Inoue T. Sampath A.P. Martemyanov K.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9301-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we first demonstrated that the uROS system could be exploited to study the effects of R9AP on the GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by Gαo, a G protein specifically co-expressed with the RGS11 in the ON-bipolar neurons (23Cao Y. Masuho I. Okawa H. Xie K. Asami J. Kammermeier P.J. Maddox D.M. Furukawa T. Inoue T. Sampath A.P. Martemyanov K.A. J.

The addition of increasing amounts of RGS9-1·Gβ5 to the uROS membranes reconstituted with lipid-modified Gαo, expressed and purified from Sf9 cells, produced a typical biphasic concentration dependence curve with an initial steep slope of 0.09 ± 0.01 s−1μm−1 catalytic activity rate followed by a shallower slope defined by a specific activity of 0.020 ± 0.003 s−1μm−1 (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have established that the inflection point in the curve corresponds to the concentration of active R9AP on the membranes (20Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24376-24381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, the initial steeper slope is interpreted as the specific activity of the R9AP-bound RGS complex, whereas the second shallower slope reflects the specific activity of excess RGS that remains free after all the R9AP in the reaction mixture has been bound up. Comparison of the two slopes indicates that binding of RGS9-1·Gβ5 to endogenous R9AP on the membranes can potentiate its GAP activity toward Gαo by ∼5-fold. Consistent with this, we found that RGS9-1·Gβ5 was efficiently recruited to the uROS membranes and that digestion of R9AP by V8 protease completely abolished association of RGS9-1·Gβ5 with the V8-treated uROS membranes (V8-uROS) (Fig. 1B). Although the magnitude of the stimulatory effect by R9AP is lower than seen in the Gαt-based system (21Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the results clearly indicate that this broken cell preparation can be used to assay the GAP activity of R7 RGS proteins toward Gαo, making this system amenable for assaying the action of R9AP on the GAP function of RGS11 toward Gαo. We found that recombinant RGS11·Gβ5 was also able to strongly bind to native uROS membranes but not to the V8-uROS (Fig. 2A). As observed for RGS9-1, GTPase hydrolysis rates of Gαo showed biphasic dependence on the RGS11·Gβ5 concentration (Fig. 2B, open circles), and the biphasic concentration dependence was completely abolished by the V8-mediated proteolysis of R9AP (Fig. 2B, filled circles). Comparing the specific activity rate of RGS11·Gβ5 in the fast phase (0.39 ± 0.02 s−1μm−1) to the slow phase (0.15 ± 0.01 s−1μm−1) or to the activity in the V8-treated system (0.16 ± 0.01 s−1μm−1) reveals that R9AP enhances GAP activity of RGS11·Gβ5 by ∼2.5-fold. Interestingly, when RGS11·Gβ5 was incubated with V8-uROS and the mixture subsequently fractionated by centrifugation, the RGS11 protein was not detected in either the Sup or Ppt fractions (Fig. 2A). The absence of RGS11 in both V8-treated fractions can be explained if the RGS11·Gβ5 complex can associate directly (i.e. indepen"
https://openalex.org/W2044051260,"Spectrin and protein 4.1 cross-link F-actin protofilaments into a network called the membrane skeleton. Actin and 4.1 bind to one end of beta-spectrin. The adjacent end of alpha-spectrin, called the EF-domain, is calmodulin-like, with calcium-dependent and calcium-independent EF-hands. It has no known function. However, the sph(1J)/sph(1J) mouse has very fragile red cells and lacks the last 13 amino acids in the EF-domain, suggesting the domain is critical for skeletal integrity. Using pulldown binding assays, we find the alpha-spectrin EF-domain either alone or incorporated into a mini-spectrin binds native and recombinant protein 4.2 at a previously identified region of 4.2 (G(3) peptide). Native 4.2 binds with an affinity comparable with other membrane skeletal interactions (K(d) = 0.30 microM). EF-domains bearing the sph(1J) mutation are inactive. Binding of protein 4.2 to band 3 (K(d) = 0.45 microM) does not interfere with the spectrin-4.2 interaction. Spectrin-4.2 binding is amplified by micromolar concentrations of Ca(2+) (but not Mg(2+)) by three to five times. Calmodulin also binds to the EF-domain (K(d) = 17 microM), and Ca(2+)-calmodulin blocks Ca(2+)-dependent binding of protein 4.2 but not Ca(2+)-independent binding. The data suggest that protein 4.2 is located near protein 4.1 at the spectrin-actin junctions. Because proteins 4.1 and 4.2 also bind to band 3, the erythrocyte anion channel, we suggest that one or both of these proteins cause a portion of band 3 to localize near the spectrin-actin junctions and provide another point of attachment between the membrane skeleton and the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W2158650322,"CHM-1 (2′-fluoro-6,7-methylenedioxy-2-phenyl-4-quinolone) has been identified as a potent antitumor agent in human hepatocellular carcinoma; however, its role in tumor angiogenesis is unclear. This study investigated the effects of CHM-1 and the mechanisms by which it exerts its antiangiogenic and vascular disrupting properties. Using a xenograft model antitumor assay, we found that CHM-1 significantly inhibits tumor growth and microvessel formation. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit revealed that CHM-1 inhibits growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by induction of apoptotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. CHM-1 also suppresses HUVEC migration and capillary-like tube formation. We were able to correlate CHM-1-induced apoptosis in HUVEC with the cleavage of procaspase-3, -7, and -8, as well as with the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by Western blotting assay. Such sensitization was achieved through up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5) but not DR4 or Fas. CHM-1 was also capable of increasing the expression level of p53, and most importantly, the induction of DR5 by CHM-1 was abolished by p53 small interfering RNA. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that CHM-1 exhibits vascular targeting activity associated with the induction of DR5-mediated endothelial cell apoptosis through p53 up-regulation, which suggests its potential as an antivascular and antitumor therapeutic agent. CHM-1 (2′-fluoro-6,7-methylenedioxy-2-phenyl-4-quinolone) has been identified as a potent antitumor agent in human hepatocellular carcinoma; however, its role in tumor angiogenesis is unclear.

Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit revealed that CHM-1 inhibits growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by induction of apoptotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. CHM-1 also suppresses HUVEC migration and capillary-like tube formation. We were able to correlate CHM-1-induced apoptosis in HUVEC with the cleavage of procaspase-3, -7, and -8, as well as with the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by Western blotting assay. Such sensitization was achieved through up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5) but not DR4 or Fas. CHM-1 was also capable of increasing the expression level of p53, and most importantly, the induction of DR5 by CHM-1 was abolished by p53 small interfering RNA. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that CHM-1 exhibits vascular targeting activity associated with the induction of DR5-mediated endothelial cell apoptosis through p53 up-regulation, which suggests its potential as an antivascular and antitumor therapeutic agent. In neoplasm, malignant angiogenesis and tumor mortality are highly associated with each other. Almost every step of aggressive tumor growth and metastatic dissemination relies on a functional vascular network to provide tumor cells with oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste products associated with tumor metabolism, a crucial hallmark of cancer (1.Shchors K. Evan G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7059-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nowadays, several antiangiogenic strategies have been developed to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. In addition to the indirect interference of proangiogenic communication between the tumor and endothelial cell compartments, several recent reports have suggested that the induction of apoptosis in proliferation of endothelial cells may represent a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of neovascularization-related diseases (2.Quesada A.R. Muñoz-Chápuli R. Medina M.A. Med. Res. Rev. 2006; 26: 483-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3.Cooney M.M. van Heeckeren W. Bhakta S. Ortiz J. Remick S.C. Nat. Clin. Pract.

For instance, numerous natural angiogenic inhibitors, such as endostatin, angiostatin, and thrombospondin-1, act in part through selective triggering apoptosis in endothelial cells, resulting in vascular regression (5.Ribatti D. Leuk. Res. 2009; 33: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6.Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Several antitubulin-binding agents (e.g. CA-4-phosphate, ZD6126, and TZT-1027) and flavonoids (5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4- acetic acid) have demonstrated the ability to induce apoptosis of tumor vascular endothelial cells, leading to the rapid collapse and obstruction of tumor vessels and ultimately causing a tumor vascular shutdown effect (7.Lippert 3rd, J.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2007; 15: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is an intracellular suicide program possessing morphologic characteristics and biochemical features, including chromatin condensation, nuclear DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (8.Taatjes D.J. Sobel B.E. Budd R.C. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9.Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). To date, two major apoptotic pathways have been described as follows: the extrinsic death receptor-mediated pathway and the intrinsic mitochondrion-initiated pathway. An apoptotic event engages the intrinsic mitochondrion-dependent processes, affecting mitochondrial permeability and resulting in cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway originates at membrane death receptors (DRs) 4The abbreviations used are: DRdeath receptorHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketonesiRNAsmall interfering RNARTreverse transcriptionMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTRAILtumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. such as Fas (CD95/APO-1), DR4 (TRAIL-R1), and DR5 (TRAIL-R2) and then engages the intracellular apoptotic machinery involving adaptor molecules and proximal caspase-8 as well as distal executioner caspases (10.Grütter M.G.

Berger M. Goldberg Z. Haupt Y. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4077-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). DRs such as DR4, DR5, and Fas are increased by p53-dependent transcriptional activation (13.Bates S. Vousden K.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interaction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of proteins, with DR4 and DR5 leads to recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD and initiator caspase-8 to the death-inducing signaling complex (14.Tas F.

This results in enzymatic activation of caspase-8, which in turn activates a downstream caspase cascade in the presence or absence of mitochondrial amplification machinery (15.MacFarlane M. Toxicol.

The 2-phenyl-4-quinolones and related compounds, a series of synthetic quinolone derivatives, were found to inhibit tubulin polymerization and disrupt microtubule organization, and they act as antimitotic agents (17.Kuo S.C.

In our previous study, we had speculated that CHM-1, which was identified from a synthetic 6,7-substituted 2-phenyl-4-quinolone derivative, potently inhibits hepatocyte growth factor-induced cell invasion in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, SK-Hep-1, and exhibits a novel antimitotic antitumor activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma both in vitro and in vivo (23.Wang S.W.

Recently, it was reported that CHM-1 has anticancer activity in human osteogenic sarcoma U-2 OS cells (25.Hsu S.C. Yang J.S. Kuo C.L. Lo C. Lin J.P. Hsia T.C. Lin J.J. Lai K.C. Kuo H.M. Huang L.J.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis induction by CHM-1 in endothelial cells. Our results suggest that CHM-1 targets tumor microvasculature through p53-mediated DR5 up-regulation. CHM-1 was synthesized by Prof. S.-C. Kuo (Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Medicine, China Medical University). Propidium iodide and 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were obtained from Sigma. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Antibody to caspase-3 was purchased from Imgenex (San Diego). Antibodies against PARP and caspase-9 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-8, and p53 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against DR4 and DR5 were purchased from Novus Biologicals Inc. (Littleton, CO). Z-VAD-fmk was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). p53 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was obtained from Invitrogen. DR5 siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were freshly isolated from human umbilical cords and cultured as described previously (26.Peng C.Y. Pan S.L. Lee K.H. Bastow K.F. Teng C.M. Cancer Lett. 2008; 263: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The human colorectal cancer HT-29 cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (27.Chen T.H. Pan S.L. Guh J.H. Liao C.H. Huang D.Y. Chen C.C. Teng C.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 4250-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere. For the transfection procedure, cells were grown to 70% confluence in a culture dish, and p53 siRNA or DR5 siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Following transfection, cells were seeded and treated with CHM-1 and then analyzed using MTT assay, Western blot analysis, or RT-PCR. Matrigel™ basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences) mixed with heparin (10 units/ml) and endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM2), with or without CHM-1, were injected subcutaneously in the midventral abdominal region of C57BL/6 mice and permitted to solidify. On day 7, Matrigel pellets were harvested, fixed with 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and subsequently processed for Masson's Trichrome staining. Hb was estimated by the Drabkin's method with Drabkin's reagent kit (Sigma) to quantify blood vessel formation. CHM-1-phosphate was dissolved completely in a vehicle mixture of DMSO/cremophor EL/saline. Male SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice were implanted subcutaneously with 1 × 107 HT-29 human colon cancer cells per mouse. Mice bearing established tumors (∼100 mm3) were randomized into two groups, and the agent treatment was initiated. CHM-1-phosphate at a dose of 25 mg/kg was administered intravenously every day. Tumors were measured every 3–4 days with a caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: volume (V) = lw2/2, with l being the length and the w being the width. Histological analysis was done on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded xenograft tissue samples. The primary antibody CD31 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used in this study to permit determination of the blood vessels. The protocols of all animal experiments were accordance with institutional guidelines for animal welfare. Cell viability was determined by measuring the ability of cells to transform the yellow tetrazolium salt MTT into formazan crystal, a purple dye. Cells (5 × 103 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well culture plates overnight for attachment and then were incubated with or without CHM-1 at different concentrations for 24 and 48 h. After the incubation, 0.5 mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. The color intensity of the formazan solution, which reflects the cell growth condition, was measured at 550 nm using an ELISA reader. HUVEC were plated (in complete medium) in the upper layer of an 8-μm pore size transwell. Cells were allowed to adhere for 4 h at 37 °C and then replaced the 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum/M199 medium, with or without CHM-1, for 8 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. At the same time, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum/M199 medium was added in the lower chambers. At the end of treatment, condition medium was removed from both upper and lower layers of chambers, and the membranes were fixed and stained with crystal violet for 10 min and then rinsed in water. Cells remaining on the filter side of the upper chamber were cleaned by gently wiping with a cotton swab. As the membranes dried, the cells that had migrated to the underside of the filters were photographed with microscope. To quantify the cells that had migrated through the membrane pores, the filters were gently cut from the chamber, and the dye was eluted in a solution containing sodium citrate and then determined using an ELISA reader at A550. 3 × 104 HUVEC were incubated in the absence or presence of CHM-1 and then seeded in a 96-well culture plate precoated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The tubular formation was observed and photographed under a phase contrast microscope after incubation at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 for 6 h. The quantitative data were determined using Image analysis software (Image-Pro® Plus). Morphological analysis of cells apoptosis was examined by a phase contrast microscopy (Nikon). CHM-1-induced apoptotic death of HUVEC was identified by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Cells were seeded into 8-well slide chambers the day before treatment. After the cells were incubated with CHM-1 (3 μm) for 24 h, they were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. The cells were then incubated in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min at room temperature. The slides were washed three times with PBS, and nuclear morphological alternations were then analyzed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. For quantitative assessment of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, Cell Death ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used to determined apoptosis. Spectrophotometric data at a wavelength of 405 nm, with a reference of 490 nm, was acquired on a microplate reader. The cells (80% confluence) were 2% fetal bovine serum/M199 medium-starved for 24 h to synchronize them in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, and then they treated with CHM-1 for the indicated time. The cells were trypsinized after treatment, washed with cold PBS, and centrifuged. The pellet was fixed in 75% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. After centrifugation, the fixed cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in 0.1 mol/liter phosphate/citric acid buffer (0.2 mol/liter Na2HPO4, 0.1 mol/liter citric acid, pH 7.8) for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended with 0.5 ml of propidium iodide working solution (100 μg/ml RNase, 80 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). The stained cells were sorted by FACScan flow cytometry and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For nuclear extracts, treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped into buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Nuclei were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cytosolic fraction) were removed, and the pellets were suspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were frozen at −20 °C. The cells were harvested and lysed in an ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) that was supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 m NaF, 0.5 m Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h on ice. Cellular lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of protein were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and the protein was subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting 2.5 h at 400 mA. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h and washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. After that, the membranes were probed for desired proteins using specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed four times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 followed by peroxidase-conjugated appropriate secondary antibody and visualized by ECL detection system. Total cellular RNA was extracted from HUVEC with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 5 μg of RNA and 500 ng/μl random primers at 65 °C for 5 min and then using Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT at 37 °C for 1 h. The single-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR. The amplification mixture (final volume, 20 μl) contained 10× Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 10 mm dNTPs, 10 μm primer pair, 0.5 μl of Taq DNA polymerase, cDNA, and diethyl pyrocarbonate water. The primers and PCR conditions used for DR5 were according to Cao et al. (28.Cao L. Li Y. Cheng F. Li S. Long D. Transplant. Proc. 2006; 38: 2207-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of separate experiments. Means were checked for statistical difference using the t test, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001). The significance of differences of in vivo xenograft data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. To determine whether CHM-1 has antiangiogenic activities, an in vivo mouse Matrigel plug assay was first carried out. Angiogenesis was induced in EGM2-treated Matrigel plugs (control). However, CHM-1 potently inhibited EGM2-induced blood vessel growth in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, top panel). We performed a histological examination to confirm the formation of numerous blood vessels. The stained section of the Matrigel plugs in the control groups showed abundant erythrocyte-filled vessels, indicating the formation of a functional vasculature in the Matrigel, whereas it was not observed in the CHM-1-treated plugs (Fig. 1A, middle panel). We also measured the hemoglobin content to quantify the antiangiogenic effect induced by the treatment with CHM-1. The hemoglobin quantity was markedly reduced by treatment with CHM-1 as compared with the control groups (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). To test the hypothesis that CHM-1 may disrupt vasculature within tumors, an HT-29 tumor xenograft model in SCID mice was used. CHM-1 treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth, without a toxic effect on body weight (Fig. 1B, left and right panel). We also performed immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples with CD31+ antibody, which is a specific endothelial marker for estimating whether CHM-1 suppresses vasculature within tumors. In the treated group, vessels were sparsely distributed throughout the tumor, as evidenced by the lack of CD31+ staining (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results demonstrated antitumor activity of CHM-1 in vivo through the disruption of tumor microvasculature. To assess the vascular targeting potential of CHM-1, we carried out an angiogenic cellular functional assay using HUVEC. We first executed an MTT assay to measure the effect of CHM-1 on the growth of HUVEC. The addition of CHM-1 resulted in time- and concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition, with IC50 values of 3.9 μm (24 h) and 1.1 μm (48 h), respectively (Fig. 2A). To examine whether CHM-1 affected the migratory behavior of endothelial cells, we performed a transwell migration assay. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, CHM-1 inhibited cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner. We proceeded to conduct a tube formation assay to estimate the effect of CHM-1 on morphological differentiation of the HUVEC. HUVEC were placed on a Matrigel-coated plate where they formed many strong, robust elongated tube-like structures in the presence of EGM2 (control). In contrast, treatment with CHM-1 strongly inhibited the formation of tube-like networks in a concentration-dependent manner. Capillary tubes were counted in five randomly selected areas of samples under microscopic field and showed a 32.4% (p < 0.001), 67.1% (p < 0.001), and 98% (p < 0.001) decrease following 0.1, 0.3, and 1 μm CHM-1 treatment, respectively (Fig. 2C). Overall, these results provided strong evidence of the antiangiogenic activity of CHM-1 in vitro. To determine the mechanism of the antiangiogenic activity of CHM-1, we analyzed the effect of CHM-1 on cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry to investigate whether CHM-1-induced growth inhibition in HUVEC was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Treatment with CHM-1 induced an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase, accompanied by a time-dependent increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells, as reflected by the presence of a peak in the number of sub-G1 cells (Fig. 3A). We next examined whether CHM-1-induced cell death showed the cytological features that are typically seen in cells undergoing apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3B, CHM-1 induced morphological changes and chromatin condensation, whereas untreated control cells displayed intact morphology and nuclear structure. Quantitative assessment of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation showed that CHM-1-treated cells increased this feature in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Overall, these results suggested that CHM-1 causes apoptosis in HUVEC. The induction of CHM-1-induced apoptosis was additionally confirmed by the cleavage of PARP, which serves as a reliable biochemical marker of cells undergoing apoptosis. A decrease in total PARP with a concomitant increase in PARP cleavage fragments was observed in CHM-1-treated cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B). We further documented the involvement of various caspases during CHM-1-triggered cell death. Treatment with CHM-1 resulted in the induction of cleaved forms of caspase-3, -7, and -8, but not -9 (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was shown to reverse CHM-1-induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4C). Because CHM-1 induced the cleavage of initiator caspase-8, we speculated that its proapoptotic response could be mediated via the death receptor-signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 5A, CHM-1 treatment was found to cause a time-dependent up-regulation of the DR5 protein without significant change in the expressions of FasL, TRAIL, Fas, and DR4. To confirm the effect of CHM-1 on DR5, we further measured the DR5 expression level at the cell surface using flow cytometry. CHM-1 consistently elevated the cell surface expression of DR5 but not DR4 in HUVEC (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, we also found that CHM-1 induced mRNA expression of DR5, reaching a maximum level at 1 h (Fig. 5C). To further evaluate the role of DR5 in CHM-1-induced apoptotic signaling in HUVEC, we used DR5 siRNA to block CHM-1-induced DR5 up-regulation and then determined its effect on CHM-1-induced apoptosis. The prevention of PARP and caspase-3 cleavage due to CHM-1 treatment was correlated with the decrease in DR5 protein levels by the transfection of DR5 siRNA (Fig. 5D, upper panel). Using the crystal violet assay, we also found that CHM-1-induced growth inhibition in HUVEC was nearly suppressed by DR5 siRNA (Fig. 5D, lower panel). Taken together, these results suggested that DR5 up-regulation plays an important role in CHM-1-induced apoptosis in HUVEC. In a previous study, we found a great deal of evidence indicating that p53, a transcriptional factor, could activate the extrinsic DR pathway through the induction of genes encoding transmembrane proteins such as DR5 (12.Haupt S. Berger M. Goldberg Z. Haupt Y. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4077-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first determined whether CHM-1 up-regulated the expression of p53, thereby regulating the expression of DR5 in HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment with CHM-1 increased the p53 protein level and translocated p53 into the nucleus, which is coincident with the change in DR5 protein level. Next, to elucidate whether p53 plays a critical role in CHM-1-induced DR5 up-regulation and apoptosis, we manipulated p53 expression using p53 siRNA. The data showed that knockdown of p53 attenuated the induction of DR5 as well as the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 (Fig. 6B) and consequently prevented growth inhibition and apoptosis in cells treated with CHM-1 (Fig. 6C). In our previous study, CHM-1 was shown to possess potent cytotoxic activity in vitro and in vivo. CHM-1 was found to bind to tubulin at the colchicine site, causing G2/M phase cell arrest and inducing cancer cell apoptosis (24.Wang S.W. Pan S.L. Huang Y.C. Guh J.H. Chiang P.C. Huang D.Y. Kuo S.C. Lee K.H. Teng C.M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have consistently reported that some microtubule-targeting agents, particularly those agents that work by acting at the colchicine-binding site of the β-subunit of endothelial tubulin, may disrupt the endothelial cytoskeleton, leading to loss of blood flow and tumor-related endothelial cell apoptosis and eventually tumor vasculature disruption (29.Meng F. Cai X. Duan J. Matteucci M.G. Hart C.P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2008; 61: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30.Schwartz E.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 2594-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this study, we first demonstrated that CHM-1 suppressed tumor growth through induction of endothelial cell apoptosis, which disrupted tumor microvascular networks. We provided strong evidence that CHM-1 significantly inhibits tumor angiogenesis using Matrigel-plug and xenograft animal models. We then showed that CHM-1 blocked endothelial cell functions such as cell survival, migration, and tube formation, in agreement with our in vivo findings. The previous study demonstrates that CHM-1 significantly inhibits the migration of U-2 OS cell migration at 3 μm (25.Hsu S.C. Yang J.S. Kuo C.L. Lo C. Lin J.P."
https://openalex.org/W2082150863,"The functional role of cytochrome (cyt) b559 in photosystem II (PSII) was investigated in H22Kα and Y18Sα cyt b559 mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. H22Kα and Y18Sα cyt b559 mutant carries one amino acid substitution on and near one of heme axial ligands of cyt b559 in PSII, respectively. Both mutants grew photoautotrophically, assembled stable PSII, and exhibited the normal period-four oscillation in oxygen yield. However, both mutants showed several distinct chlorophyll a fluorescence properties and were more susceptible to photoinhibition than wild type. EPR results indicated the displacement of one of the two axial ligands to the heme of cyt b559 in H22Kα mutant reaction centers, at least in isolated reaction centers. The maximum absorption of cyt b559 in Y18Sα mutant PSII core complexes was shifted to 561 nm. Y18Sα and H22Kα mutant PSII core complexes contained predominately the low potential form of cyt b559. The findings lend support to the concept that the redox properties of cyt b559 are strongly influenced by the hydrophobicity and ligation environment of the heme. When the cyt b559 mutations placed in a D1-D170A genetic background that prevents assembly of the manganese cluster, accumulation of PSII is almost completely abolished. Overall, our data support a functional role of cyt b559 in protection of PSII under photoinhibition conditions in vivo. The functional role of cytochrome (cyt) b559 in photosystem II (PSII) was investigated in H22Kα and Y18Sα cyt b559 mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. H22Kα and Y18Sα cyt b559 mutant carries one amino acid substitution on and near one of heme axial ligands of cyt b559 in PSII, respectively.

A(2B)ARs were significantly decreased in BAL macrophages from patients with COPD when compared with healthy smokers. The effect of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative/nitrosative stress on AR expression and function in U937 cells before and after PMA treatment was evaluated. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha treatment up-regulated A(2A)- and A(3)ARs but not A(1)- or A(2B)ARs, whereas IL-6 did not modify AR expression. In contrast, oxidative/nitrosative stress selectively decreased A(2B)AR expression, which was associated with a reduction in the potency of the adenosine agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA) to induce cAMP. Further, the ability of NECA to enhance cell proliferation was increased after oxidative/nitrosative stress. The specific involvement of A(2B)ARs was investigated by using potent and selective A(2B)AR antagonist and by A(2B)AR knockdown using siRNA and demonstrated responses similar to those obtained with oxidative/nitrosative stress. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant agent, counteracted the decrease in A(2B)AR expression, as well as the altered NECA effects on cAMP and cell proliferation. These findings highlight the central role of A(2B)ARs in alveolar macrophages, suggesting that their modulation could represent an innovative pharmacological strategy to manage COPD.-Varani, K., Caramori, G., Vincenzi, F., Tosi, A., Barczyk, A., Contoli, M., Casolari, P., Triggiani, M., Hansel, T., Leung, E., MacLennan, S., Barnes, P.
