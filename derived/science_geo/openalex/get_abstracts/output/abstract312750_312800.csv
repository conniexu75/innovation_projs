https://openalex.org/W2082738784,"By presenting these examples, I have tried to illustrate four main points. 1) Finite numbers can be really enormous, and the known universe is very small. Therefore the distinction between finite and infinite is not as relevant as the distinction between realistic and unrealistic. 2) In many cases there are subtle ways to solve very large problems quickly, in spite of the fact that they appear at first to require examination of too many possibilities. 3) There are also cases where we can prove that a fairly natural problem is intrinsically hard, far beyond our conceivable capabilities. 4) It takes a good deal of skill to decide whether a given problem is in the easy or hard class; but even if a problem does turn out to be hard there are useful and interesting ways to change it into one that can be done satisfactorily."

The machine does not possess a will, and its so-called ""conclusions"" are only the logical consequences of its input, as revealed by the mechanistic functioning of an inanimate assemblage of mechanical and electrical parts."

https://openalex.org/W2050615305,"An increasing trend of Sr(90) concentration in rain observed at Fayetteville, Ark., after November 1959, indicates that the seasonal and global movements of stratospheric air masses, such as described by Brewer (I) and Dobson (2), play an important role in causing the spring peaks of the Sr(90) fallout."
https://openalex.org/W2094584711,"A comprehensive engineering-economic model of residential energy use (developed at ORNL) was used to evaluate the energy impacts of various energy conservation strategies. The model simulates household energy use at the national level for four fuels, six end uses, and three housing types--single family, multifamily buildings, and trailers. Several cases were run with the model to determine the impacts on energy use of each factor, in isolation, and in combination with other determinants of fuel use. Dr. Hirst concludes the following: (1) residential energy use will grow more slowly during the last quarter of the 20th century than it did during the third quarter; (2) a ''high forecast'' developed in the study is not valid because it was assumed that fuel prices will hold constant (1975), that household formation and personal income will increase rapidly, and that the 1960-1970 trend in housing choices (away from single-family) will not continue; (3) implementation of energy conservation programs to raise fuel prices can have significant energy impacts; (4) implementation of a program to increase efficiency of residential equipment by 1980, as specified in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, can cut energy use in the year 2000 by at least 10 percent; andmore » (5) programs to improve thermal integrity of residential structures can also provide significant energy savings during the next 25 years.
