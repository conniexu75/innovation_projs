We report that valproic acid activates Wntdependent gene expression, similar to lithium, the mainstay of therapy for bipolar disorder. Valproic acid, however, acts through a distinct pathway that involves direct inhibition of histone deacetylase (IC50 for HDAC1 = 0.4 mm). At therapeutic levels, valproic acid mimics the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, causing hyperacetylation of histones in cultured cells. Valproic acid, like trichostatin A, also activates transcription from diverse exogenous and endogenous promoters. Furthermore, valproic acid and trichostatin A have remarkably similar teratogenic effects in vertebrate embryos, while non-teratogenic analogues of valproic acid do not inhibit histone deacetylase and do not activate transcription. Based on these observations, we propose that inhibition of histone deacetylase provides a mechanism for valproic acid-induced birth defects and could also explain the efficacy of valproic acid in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Tunnicliff G. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 347-365PubMed Google Scholar). The effectiveness of VPA as an anticonvulsant was discovered serendipitously when other compounds were dissolved in VPA for administration to animals used in experimental models of epilepsy (1Johannessen C.U. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Tunnicliff G. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 347-365PubMed Google Scholar, 3Meunier H. Carraz G. Meunier Y. et al.Therapie. 1963; 18: 435-438PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, VPA has been used to control a variety of seizures, including generalized and partial seizures (1Johannessen C.U. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the anticonvulsant activity of VPA, and, given the efficacy of VPA in diverse forms of epilepsy, it may act through more than one target (1Johannessen C.U. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). VPA increases the level of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with acute administration causing a 15–45% increase in GABA in the brains of rodents (cited in Ref. 1Johannessen C.U. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of GABAergic signaling can cause seizures and potentiation of GABA signaling can prevent seizures, this effect of VPA on GABA levels has been proposed as a mechanism for the anticonvulsant activity of VPA. However, the target(s) of VPA in this setting has not been definitively identified; VPA can stimulate GABA biosynthetic enzymes and inhibit enzymes involved in GABA degradation in vitro, but it is not clear whether these are important in vivo targets of VPA (1Johannessen C.U. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,2Tunnicliff G. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 347-365PubMed Google Scholar, 4Davies J.A. Seizure. 1995; 4: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). VPA is a potent teratogen in humans (5Robert E. Guibaud P. Lancet. 1982; 2: 937Abstract PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and is widely studied as a model teratogen in rodents. Although the target of VPA in this setting is unknown, strict structural requirements have been defined for the teratogenic activity of VPA and VPA-related compounds. Thus, potently teratogenic analogues of VPA contain a tetrahedral α-carbon bound to a free carboxyl group, a hydrogen, and two alkyl groups (6Lampen A. Siehler S. Ellerbeck U. Göttlicher M. Nau H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 160: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Nau H. Hauck R.S. Ehlers K. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 69: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, analogues such as valpromide (VPM), in which the carboxyl group is modified to an amide, and 2-methyl-2-propylpentenoic acid (2M2P), in which a methyl group is added to the α-carbon, do not cause neural tube defects in mouse embryos. These analogues can still protect against chemically induced seizures in mice (6Lampen A. Siehler S. Ellerbeck U. Göttlicher M. Nau H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 160: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Nau H. Hauck R.S. Ehlers K. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 69: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least some of the clinically observed effects of VPA involve distinct molecular targets. In the treatment of bipolar disorder, VPA is effective both in acute mania and as a prophylaxis for recurrent mania and depression, similar to lithium (1Johannessen C.U. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Tunnicliff G. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 347-365PubMed Google Scholar). However, as with lithium, the mechanism of VPA action in bipolar disorder remains unknown. A number of interesting mechanisms have been proposed, but in each case, the direct target of VPA has not been defined. The characteristic delay in response to lithium or VPA has led to the proposal that both drugs act through modulation of gene expression, and this is supported by data fromin vitro as well as in vivo systems (8Wang J.F. Bown C. Young L.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Manji H.K. McNamara R. Chen G. Lenox R.H. Aust. N. Z. J.

Brain Res. 1998; 58: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lithium and VPA can down-regulate expression of protein kinase C isoforms PKCα and PKCε, induce expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2, and activate AP-1-dependent transcription (through a direct effect on c-jun activity and by increasing expression of c-Jun (11Chen G. Yuan X. Jiang Y.M. Huang L.D. Manji H.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Asghari V. Wang J.F. Reiach J.S. Young L.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 58: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). Both VPA and lithium also stimulate glutamate release and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation in mouse cerebral cortex slices, although apparently through distinct mechanisms (14Dixon J.F. Hokin L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4757-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both VPA and lithium have been shown to confer protection from neurotoxic agents (15Mora A. Gonzalez-Polo R.A. Fuentes J.M. Soler G. Centeno F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Nonaka S. Katsube N. Chuang D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 539-547PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nonaka S. Hough C.J. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In each of these settings, there is a delay in the response, similar to that observed clinically; thus the direct targets of VPA in these settings have not been determined. Several direct targets of lithium have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 18Phiel C.J. Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), including inositol monophosphatase (19Hallcher L.M. Sherman W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10896-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), a family of related phosphomonoesterases (21York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β (22Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar)). GSK-3β is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates numerous processes, including axonal remodeling, cellular proliferation, embryonic patterning, and organogenesis (23Salinas P.C. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dickinson M.E. Krumlauf R. McMahon A.P. Development. 1994; 120: 1453-1471PubMed Google Scholar, 25Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 26Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Because GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its rapid degradation, inhibition of GSK-3β by either lithium or Wnt signaling leads to stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin protein (27Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 28Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); β-catenin then translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of Wnt-dependent genes by binding to factors of the Tcf/Lef family. Activation of Wnt signaling by lithium has been proposed to explain the similarity between lithium and Wnts in a variety of settings (22Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar), but a role for this pathway in bipolar disorder has not been demonstrated. Although VPA does not inhibit inositol monophosphatase (29Murray M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Vadnal R. Parthasarathy R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1995; 12: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it has also been reported to inhibit GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide derived from the CREB protein in vitro, and exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to VPA can also cause an increase in β-catenin protein levels (31Chen G. Huang L.D. Jiang Y.M. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility that VPA and lithium both act through inhibition of GSK-3β. However, VPA has not yet been shown to inhibit GSK-3β in vivo nor to activate Wnt-dependent gene expression. We have further investigated whether VPA activates Wnt signaling and find that VPA can indeed activate Wnt-dependent gene expression, similar to lithium, but through a distinct mechanism that involves direct activation of transcription. We show that VPA potently inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), a negative regulator of gene expression in multiple settings, at therapeutically relevant levels. Furthermore, the teratogenicity of VPA in vertebrate embryos is mimicked by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, whereas non-teratogenic analogues of VPA do not inhibit HDAC. These findings lead us to propose that HDAC is an important target of VPA in the pathogenesis of birth defects. HDAC also offers a plausible novel target for VPA action in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Luciferase constructs containing three wild-type (Lef-OT) or three mutated (Lef-OF) Lef binding sites were gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and have been described elsewhere (32Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). Renilla luciferase plasmids pRL-SV40 and pRL-CMV were purchased from Promega. Plasmids encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase (pSEAP) and enhanced green fluorescence protein were purchased from CLONTECH. Human HDAC1 in pcDNA3.1-myc/His-A (33Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. T. Kouzarides (The Wellcome/Cancer Research Campaign Institute, Cambridge, UK). 293T and Neuro2A cells were obtained from American Type Culture Center. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Neuro2A cells were grown in Eagle's Basal Medium in 10% FBS. Stable 293T cell lines were prepared by transfecting Lef-OT or Lef-OF together with pcDNA3.1. Cells were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and 400 mg/liter G418. For all transfections, cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 2.75 × 105 cells per well. Plasmids were transfected as follows: 1 μg of Lef-OT and Lef-OF reporter plasmids; 10 ng of pRL-CMV or pRL-SV40; and 0.5 μg of pSEAP. Firefly andRenilla luciferase activities for each sample were measured on a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Turner Designs) using the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega). All transfections included 0.5 μg of enhanced green fluorescence protein to assess transfection efficiency. In some cases (e.g. overexpression of HDAC1), pSEAP was also transfected, and SEAP activity in culture medium was used as an independent measure of transfection efficiency. Thus, 24 h after transfection, an aliquot of media was removed for SEAP assay, and VPA or LiCl was then added to the cells. After an additional 24 h, cells were harvested for luciferase assay. Valproic acid (sodium salt; Sigma Chemical Co.) and lithium chloride (Sigma) were prepared in sterile water as concentrated stocks and added to the final concentrations as indicated in the figures. Valpromide (kind gift of Katwijk Chemie B.V.) was prepared in Me2SO. 2-Methyl-2-propylpentenoic acid and 4-pentenoic acid were purchased from Alfa Aesar. For cycloheximide experiments, Neuro2A cells, plated at 5 × 105 cells per well, were treated 24 h later with the following compounds: 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), 20 mm LiCl, or 2 mm VPA. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested using Reporter lysis buffer (Promega) supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1:100, Sigma). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were added to Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 2 min. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), immunoblotted using β-catenin antibody (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories), or β-tubulin antibody (TUJ1, 1:1000, BabCO), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of tau protein, Neuro2A cells were exposed to VPA, 2-methyl-2-propylpentenoic acid, 4-pentenoic acid, or LiCl for 24 h and then harvested in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 50 mm NaF and Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (1:100). Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with PHF-1 antibody (1:250, provided by Peter Davies (34Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Schein J.D. Binder L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 564-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or Tau antibody (17026, 1:1000, provided by Virginia Lee) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To detect acetylation of endogenous histone H4, Neuro2A cells (1.6 × 106 cells per sample) were exposed to VPA or TSA at concentrations indicated in figure; nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) and then adjusted to 0.4n H2SO4. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, followed by centrifugation through a Centricon 10 membrane to concentrate protein (final volume 150 μl). SDS sample buffer was added, and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 12.5% acrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted with acetyl-histone H4 antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). GSK-3β assay was performed as described previously (22Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar), except that MgCl2was 1 mm. VPA was added at concentrations indicated in Fig.3B. For in vitro HDAC assays, myc epitope-tagged HDAC1 was transfected into HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated (36Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed, resuspended in HD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), and stored as frozen aliquots. HDAC1 was then added to a tube containing 40,000 cpm 3H-labeled acetylated histones (purified from HeLa cells) in 200 μl of HD buffer ± VPA, trichostatin A (Sigma), valpromide, or 2-methyl-2-propylpentenoic acid (at concentrations described in Figs. 3, 4, and 7). After rotation for 2 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of stop solution (1 m HCl, 0.16 m acetic acid) and released 3H-labeled acetic acid was extracted and analyzed by scintillation counting. To assay total nuclear HDAC activity, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (30 μg) were used as a source of HDAC activity in place of immunoprecipitated HDAC1, as described (36Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar). HDAC assay was otherwise as described above for HDAC1.Figure 4VPA inhibits HDAC activity.A, human HDAC1 activity was assayed in vitro as release of [3H]acetate from labeled histones (36Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 0–20 mm VPA. VPA inhibited HDAC1 with an IC50 of 0.4 mm, well within the therapeutic range of VPA in humans. Percent HDAC activity is shown with respect to the activity of HDAC alone (100%). B, VPA inhibits endogenous HDACs present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts from untransfected HeLa cells were isolated and added to HDAC assay as described in A. Percent HDAC activity is shown with respect to the activity of HDAC alone (100%).

A, non-teratogenic analogues valpromide (VPM; 5 mm) and 2-methyl-2-propylpentenoic acid (2M2P; 5 mm) do not inhibit HDAC1, whereas VPA (5 mm) and the established HDAC inhibitor TSA (300 nm) do inhibit HDAC1. Assay conditions are as in Fig. 4A. B–E,Xenopus embryos were treated from stage 8 until neurula stage with buffer, VPA, VPM, or TSA, and then scored at tadpole stages.B, control Xenopus tadpole.

Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: ???Google Scholar). Stage 8 embryos were incubated in 0.1× MMR containing valproic acid or valpromide (1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 mm) or trichostatin A (25, 50, or 100 nm) for 24 h. Embryos were then transferred to fresh 0.1× MMR and cultured until tadpole stages. VPA stock (2m) was prepared in water, whereas valpromide (2m) and TSA (100 μm) stocks were prepared in Me2SO. Control Me2SO-treated embryos developed normally. To test whether VPA can activate Wntdependent gene expression, we generated stable cell lines in human embryonic kidney cells (293T) transfected with firefly luciferase reporters containing either three wild-type Lef binding sites (Lef-OT) or three mutant Lef binding sites (Lef-OF) (32Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). These two stable cell lines were treated with VPA or lithium chloride (LiCl) for 24 h and then harvested to measure luciferase activity. Cells treated with lithium show a dosedependent increase in Lef-luciferase activity (over 70-fold) for the reporter containing wild-type, but not mutated, Lef sites (Fig.1A), as reported for transiently transfected C57MG cells (38Staal F.J. Burgering B.M. van de Wetering M. Clevers H.C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similarly, VPA also induces Lef-dependent luciferase activity over 20-fold (Fig.1B). Interestingly, the addition of both drugs to the 293T stable lines resulted in marked synergistic activation of reporter activity (Fig. 1C), with up to 315-fold activation, far exceeding additive effects. This synergy raises the possibility that lithium and VPA act through independent mechanisms in this assay. This could also explain the efficacy of combining lithium and valproate in bipolar disorder patients that are resistant to single drug therapy. To test whether neuronal cells may respond to VPA in a similar manner, Neuro2A cells were transiently transfected with Lef-OT or Lef-OF, together with a control reporter (pRL-SV40) encoding Renilla luciferase driven by the SV-40 promoter, and firefly and Renillaluciferase activities were measured after 24 h. As in 293T cells, VPA activated OT-Lef up to 6-fold in Neuro2A cells (not shown). Surprisingly, VPA also consistently activated the control reporter up to 10-fold (Fig. 1D), with half-maximal activation at 0.8 mm VPA. Transfection efficiency, assessed by frequency of green fluorescence protein-positive cells or by expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), was similar in each group prior to addition of VPA. Lithium did not stimulate this or other control reporters (not shown). VPA can activate AP-1-dependent transcription, and an increase in the activity of the SV-40 promoter has been proposed to be due to the presence of AP-1 sites within the SV-40 promoter (39Manji H.K. Lenox R.H. Biol. Psychiatry. 1999; 46: 1328-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, VPA also induces Renilla expression driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (pRL-CMV), which does not contain an AP-1 site (Fig. 4B), suggesting a more general mechanism of activation. VPA has also been reported to activate the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-δ-dependent transcription in F9 teratocarcinoma cells (6Lampen A. Siehler S. Ellerbeck U. Göttlicher M. Nau H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 160: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The effect of VPA on diverse promoters suggests that VPA acts through a mechanism distinct from lithium and may involve direct activation of transcription. Wnt signaling, or exposure to lithium, causes stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin protein (26Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of VPA on levels of β-catenin protein by Western blotting. In Neuro2A cells, both lithium (20 mm) and VPA (2 mm) caused accumulation of β-catenin protein, similar to published work on VPA in SY5Y cells (31Chen G. Huang L.D. Jiang Y.M. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, the rate of β-catenin accumulation differed with the two drugs. Lithium caused β-catenin accumulation within 30 min of treatment, whereas the effect of VPA was not evident until 10 h after treatment (Fig.2A). Although this could reflect differences in the access of VPA and lithium, VPA has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier within 1 min after intravenous injection and similarly is rapidly taken up by cells in culture (40Hammond E.J. Perchalski R.J. Villarreal H.J. Wilder B.J. Brain Res. 1982; 240: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility to explain the delay in β-catenin accumulation after VPA exposure is that VPA acts by increasing the expression of β-catenin rather than stabilizing the protein. To distinguish between these two possibilities, Neuro2A cells were cultured in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Agents, such as lithium, that stabilize β-catenin should slow its degradation, but no new protein will accumulate. Agents that induce new transcription or translation of β-catenin should have no effect on β-catenin protein levels in the presence of CHX. Under these conditions, β-catenin is rapidly degraded and is almost undetectable after 30 min of CHX treatment (Fig. 2B,lane 2). In the presence of CHX, lithium stabilized existing β-catenin protein, slowing the rate of degradation so that β-catenin protein was readily detectable at 30 min, 5 h, and 10 h (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 6, and9). Conversely, VPA treatment did not stabilize β-catenin; the protein was rapidly degraded within 30 min and was barely detectable at 5 or 10 h (Fig. 2B, lanes 4,7, and 10), as in cells treated with CHX alone. These observations suggest that VPA acts at the level of transcription or translation. Northern blot analysis confirmed that VPA increases the level of β-catenin mRNA in Neuro2A cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), with increased β-catenin mRNA detected as early as 4.5 h. These data strongly support that VPA induces β-catenin at the level of transcription (or message stability) rather than through post-translational regulation. VPA can inhibit GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of a CREB peptidein vitro, providing an intriguing potential mechanism for VPA action, but the effect of VPA on GSK-3β activity in vivo has not been studied. In vivo inhibition of GSK-3β can be followed by examining phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is phosphorylated by GSK-3βin vivo at specific sites recognized by the PHF-1 antibody (34Greenberg S.G.

VPA from 0.5 to 20 mm did not inhibit tau phosphorylation even after 24 h of exposure (Fig.3A). Rather, VPA caused a modest increase in the level of tau protein (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms). The non-teratogenic analogues of VPA, 2-methyl-2-propylpentenoic acid (2M2P) and 4-pentenoic acid (both at 2 mm) had no effect on levels of tau protein or tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, lithium inhibited tau phosphorylation in the presence of VPA (Fig. 3A), indicating that the tau phosphorylation under these conditions depends on GSK-3β activity. VPA also did not inhibit tau phosphorylation in Xenopusooc"

Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This region, acting in concert with the adjacent (u)n element, is one of the key cis-acting sequences which regulate the proportion of exon 9 skipping in the mature CFTR mRNA transcript (1Buratti E.

Indeed, the clinical relevance of these studies is highlighted by the existence of a clear association between certain (TG)m(T)n alleles with distinct forms of Cystic Fibrosis (1Buratti E. Dork T.

In addition, the study of (UG)m elements can provide further insight concerning the mRNA splicing process in general because (UG)m sequences have been described to act as splicing regulatory sequences in different genomic contexts. In fact, in addition to theCFTR gene, the presence of simple (UG)m-repeated sequences has been described to influence the splicing process of at least two other genes: the apolipoprotein AII gene (10Shelley C.S. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the human cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (11Gabellini N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the Apo AII gene the UG tract was shown to be functionally equivalent to a polypyrimidine tract and required for efficient splicing of Apo AII exon 2 (10Shelley C.S. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) while in the human cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger (11Gabellini N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) it acts as a strong intronic splicing enhancer situated in intron 2. It should be noted that in contrast with these two genes, the CFTR (UG)m element was found to possess a strong inhibitory effect on CFTR exon 9 splicing, a property that may probably be linked to its peculiar evolutionary history. In fact, sequencing of the mouse CFTR exon 9 genomic region has shown that in the flanking introns, the (TG)m(T)n regulatory elements are absent and that the intron themselves are of very different length when compared with the human introns (2Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the observation that mouse CFTR exon 9 is not subject to alternative splicing, suggests that the presence in humans of the (UG)m sequence represents a disturbing element, which interferes with the normal maturation process of the CFTR pre-mRNA. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that CFTR exon 9 and its intronic flanking sequences are found co-integrated with characteristic L1 sequences in multiple chromosome locations distinct from theCFTR locus (12Kazazian Jr., H.H. Moran J.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 13Rozmahel R. Heng H.H. Duncan A.M. Shi X.M. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.C. Genomics. 1997; 45: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings may indicate that the introduction of foreign elements in the CFTR IVS8 and IVS9 sequences may be a consequence of a retrotransposition event, which affected the human CFTR gene early during the course of evolution. In order to better elucidate the role of the CFTR (UG)m element and obtain functional clues regarding the role of TDP-43 in the splicing process we have characterized the RNA/DNA binding properties of TDP-43. Our results have confirmed the existence in this protein of two fully functional RNA recognition motifs (RRM),1 also known as RBD, for RNA binding domains (14Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G.

Plasmids pTCTT3 and pTG12 and minigenes lacking the (TG)m/T(n) elements were obtained as previously described (1Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Plasmids pTG3, pTG6, pTG9 were obtained by annealing the following forward and reverse oligos and ligating them in pBluescript KS (Stratagene) linearized with SmaI: 5′-gaaaattaatgtgtggaaaattaagaaa-3′ (oligo TG3) and 5′-tttcttaattttccacacattaattttc-3′ (oligo AC3) for pTG3, 5′-gaaaattaatgtgtgtgtgtggaaaatt-3′ (oligo TG6) and 5′-aattttccacacacacacattaattttc-3′ (oligo AC6) for pTG6, 5′-gaaaattaatgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtga-3′ (oligo TG9) and 5′-tcacacacacacacacacattaattttc-3′ (oligo AC9) for pTG9. The plasmid pTAR was obtained by annealing the following primers and ligating them in pBluescript KS (Stratagene) linearized with SmaI: 5′-ctgctttttgcctgtactgggtctctctggttagaccagatctgag-3′ (oligo TARS) as the forward and 5′-ctcagatctggtctaaccagagagacccagtacaggcaaaaagcag-3′ (oligo TARAS) as the reverse primer. The synthetic (UG)12oligo was obtained from MWG Biotech (Firenze, Italy). The GST-TDP43 and GST-TDP43(101–261) fusion proteins were obtained as previously described (1Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Deletion of the RRM1, RRM2, and 106–111 RNP-2 regions was obtained using a two step polymerase chain reaction extension method with sense and reverse primers spanning RRM1 (5′-aaaacatccgataaacttcctaat-3′ and 5′-attaggaagtttatcggatgtttt-3′), RRM2 (5′-ttgagaagcagatccaatgccgaa-3′ and 5′-ttcggcattggatctgcttctcaa-3′), and 106–111 RNP-2 (5′-aaaacatccgatccatggaaaaca-3′ and 5′-tgttttccatggatcggatgtttt-3′). It should be noted that these regions were identified through a search using the Pfam program at www.sanger.ac.uk. In order to introduce the L106D, V108D, and L111D mutations we used the following primers: 5′-tccgatgatatagatttgggtgatccatgg-3′ and 5′-ccatggatcacccaaatctatatcatcgga-3′. Similarly, the Phe residues (at positions 147 and 149) in the 145–152 RNP-1 motif were mutated to Leu using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-aaggggttgggcttggttcgtttt-3′ and 5′-aaaacgaaccaagcccaacccctt-3′. The single Phe-194 in the 193–197 RNP-2 motif was mutated to Leu using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-gtgttggtggggcgctgt-3′ and 5′-acagcgccccaccaacac-3′. The two Phe residues (at positions 229 and 231) in the 227–234 RNP-1 motif were mutated to Leu using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-agggccttggccttggttacattt-3′ and 5′-aaatgtaaccaaggccaaggccct-3′. Double and triple mutants were obtained using the same methodology on single- and double-mutated proteins. All fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells by overnight induction at room temperature in the presence of 0.1–0.3 mm IPTG. Cells were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, and sonicated. The supernatant was recovered after centrifugation at 3000 × g for 30 s in an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge and incubated with glutathione S-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The absorbed proteins were then eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were quantitated on an SDS-PAGE gel using bovine serum albumin standards (Sigma). Plasmids were linearized by digestion with HindIII and transcription was performed with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) in the presence of labeled [α-32P]UTP, DNase-treated according to standard protocols, and purified on a Nick column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled RNAs were then precipitated and resuspended in RNase-free water. The UV cross-linking assay was performed by adding [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA probes (1 × 106 cpm per incubation) in a water bath for 15 min at 30 ° C with 200 ng of each different purified protein in a 20-μl final volume. Binding conditions were 20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 72 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.78 mm magnesium acetate, 0.52 mmdithiothreitol, 3.8% glycerol, 0.75 mm ATP, and 1 mm GTP. In the competition experiments, cold RNA and DNA were also added as competitors 5 min before addition of the labeled RNAs (the molar excess of the unlabeled competitor used in the different experiments is stated in each figure legend). Samples were then transferred in the wells of an HLA plate (Nunc, InterMed) and irradiated with UV light on ice (0.8 joules, ∼5 min) using a UV Linker (Euroclone). Unbound RNA was then digested with 30 μg of RNase A (Sigma) and 6 units of RNase T1 (Sigma) by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath and then adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography with autoradiographic XAR film (Kodak). Films were then scanned on a Macintosh G3 work station using Adobe Photoshop and printed using a Phaser 400 printer. Oligonucleotides (200 ng, ∼25 pmols) were labeled by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK, Stratagene) for 1 h at 37 °C and then precipitated in 0.3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 and three volumes of ethanol. After centrifugation and a washing step with 70% ethanol the labeled oligos were resuspended in 400 μl of water. Each binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 15 min by mixing the purified protein with the labeled oligo (or RNA) in a 20-μl final volume. The reactions were performed in 1× bind shift binding buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2) and electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 1 h in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C. The gel was then dried on 3 MM Whatman filter paper and exposed for 20 min with autoradiographic XAR film (Kodak). For quantitation gels were measured with an InstantImager (Packard). In our search to identify proteins that recognize the splicing regulatory elements of CFTR exon 9, we recently isolated TDP-43 as a protein that binds specifically to the splicing regulatory (UG)m element found near the 3′-splice site of this exon (1Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Up to now, the only other described cellular function of TDP-43 was the ability to bind a HIV-1 TAR DNA polypyrimidinic sequence motif leading to the inhibition of HIV-1 transcription (19Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, no binding to TAR RNA had been reported (19Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our recent observation that TDP-43 can efficiently bind to (UG)m sequences (1Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) is consistent with the presence of two putative full-length RRM domains (Fig. 1A) located between residues 106 and 175 (RRM1) and 193 and 257 (RRM2) of its coding sequence according to the output of the Pfam program (available at www.sanger.ac.uk). This finding provided a functional basis that accounted for the ability of TDP-43 to bind RNA sequences, and in this study we provide a detailed analysis of their functionality and importance. Initially, using a GST fusion protein containing the TDP-43 full coding sequence (GST-TDP43), we confirmed the binding specificities of recombinant GST-TDP43 toward different RNAs in UV-cross-linking analysis. Fig. 1B shows that increasing amounts of unlabeled (UG)12 RNA were very efficient competitors. Because (UG)m sequences have been described as efficient polypyrimidinic sequences (10Shelley C.S. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) we also tested the possibility that recognition could be extended generally to this type of sequences. However, addition of a cold polypyrimidinic RNA (UCUU)3 did not have any effect on the binding of GST-TDP43 to (UG)12 (Fig. 1B), confirming the high specificity of TDP-43 binding to UG-repeated motifs. This result is consistent with our previously reported pull-down assay, which did not result in any TDP-43 being recognized by (UCUU)3 RNA (1Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The high sequence binding specificity of TDP-43 is also highlighted by the fact that addition of cold TAR RNA was incapable of competing with the binding of GST-TDP43 to the (UG)12 sequence, a finding that had already been described in the original isolation of TDP-43 (19Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and which we confirm here. It should be noted that at present no other RNA-binding protein has been described to bind UG-repeated sequences although CUG-BP (CUG-binding protein) has been recently described to bind UG repeats in a yeast three-hybrid system (20Takahashi N. Sasagawa N. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It was then of interest to analyze the minimum length of (UG) repeats that could be specifically bound by this protein. Therefore, cold RNAs competitors containing different lengths of (UG) repeats (3, 6, 9, and 12) were incubated in the presence of GST-TDP43 and labeled (UG)12 RNA. The results shown in Fig. 1Cdemonstrate that efficient competition can be observed only when the number of (UG) repeats is equal or above six and that there is a relationship between the number of (UG) repeats and the efficiency of binding. The fact that this protein was originally described to bind TAR DNA sequences raised the possibility that the binding characteristics of this protein might include (TG)-repeated sequences as well as (UG)-repeated sequences. Therefore, we performed competition analysis using GST-TDP43 bound to (UG)12 RNA in the presence of cold single-stranded DNA oligos (see TableI). As shown in Fig.2A the most efficient competitor was represented by the oligo TG12 carrying twelve (TG) repeats followed by the TARS oligo, a result that is consistent with what had been observed by Ou et al. (19Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should also be noted that other oligos (in particular TCTTS) display a weak but significant ability to compete for this protein, a characteristic not found in the (UCUU)3 RNA (see Fig. 1). This finding also confirms the original observations of Ou et al. (19Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who, using a polymerase chain reaction-based site selection procedure, found that recombinant TDP-43 preferably bound DNA stretches of eight contiguous pyrimidine residues. Nonetheless, Fig. 2B shows that the use of oligos containing different numbers of TG repeats yielded results very similar to those obtained in Fig. 1Cusing (UG)-repeated sequences. Also in this case, the minimum number of (TG) repeats needed to efficiently compete for GST-TDP43 binding is six, and there is a relationship between the number of (TG) repeats and the efficiency of competition.Table IssDNA oligonucleotides used for competition analysisNucleotide sequence (5′-3′)OligogaaaattaatgtgtggaaaattaagaaaTG3gaaaattaatgtgtgtgtgtggaaaattTG6gaaaattaatgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgaTG9tgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgTG12tttcttaattttccacacattaattttcAC3aattttccacacacacacattaattttcAC6tcacacacacacacacacattaattttcAC9acacacacacacacacacacacacAC12tcctcctccttcttcttcttcaggTCTTScctgaagaagaagaaggaggaggaTCTTASctgctttttgcctgtactgggtctctctggttagaccagatctgagTARSctcagatctggtctaaccagagagacccagtacaggcaaaaagcagTARASgAAAATTAACAATTTAAAmEX9AS Open table in a new tab Finally, oligos containing (AC) repeats can function as efficient competitors for the binding of GST-TDP43 to (UG)12 (data not shown). However, in this case competition was caused by the (AC) repeats annealing directly to the (UG)12-labeled sequence and inhibiting binding of the protein rather than by binding directly to GST-TDP43. In fact, EMSA analysis shows that there is little if any direct binding of GST-TDP43 to AC6, AC9, or AC12 end-labeled oligos (Fig. 2C, left panel) while direct binding of GST-TDP43 efficiently occurs for single-stranded (TG)-repeated sequences containing 6, 9, and 12 (TG) repeats (Fig. 2C,central panel). Notably, the fact that the oligo bearing three tg-repeats (TG3) could not efficiently bind GST-TDP43 confirms the previous competition data by UV-cross-linking (Fig. 2B). Thus, in order to establish whether TDP-43 could bind double-stranded oligos we then annealed labeled (AC) oligos with equal amounts of complementary and unlabeled (TG) oligos and then repeated the EMSA analysis. The results confirm that double-stranded oligos containing TG repeats do not bind TDP-43 (Fig. 2C, right panel). The DNA and RNA binding efficiencies of TDP-43 were assumed to depend on the two RRM regions. In order to establish whether there was no other protein domain involved in RNA/DNA recognition and to compare the two binding efficiencies we produced a construct coding for a truncated TDP-43 protein lacking the N- and C-terminal regions (Fig.3A). The DNA and RNA binding efficiencies of GST-TDP43 and GST-TDP43-(101–261) were then compared using as substrate a 5′-labeled (TG)12 or (UG)12 oligo (at a fixed concentration of 6 nm). The results, shown in Fig. 3B, demonstrate that deletion of the N- and C-terminal regions of TDP-43 does not appear to affect the RNA binding efficiency of the central RRM-containing region and may even slightly enhance it. It should be noted that the retarded complexes formed by each protein do not migrate at the same level, an indication of the higher molecular weight of the GST-TDP43/nucleic acid complex as opposed to the GST-TDP43(101–261)/nucleic acid complex. Interestingly, binding of TDP-43 to (UG)12 as opposed to (TG)12 presents some differences as well. In fact, Fig.3C shows that in UV cross-linking analysis only one RNA-protein complex of 50–52 kDa is formed when GST-TDP43-(101–261) is bound to (UG)12, as previously described (1Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). On the other hand, at least two major DNA-protein complexes with altered mobility can be detected when the same protein is bound to (TG)12. The formation of multiple complexes in SDS-PAGE following UV cross-linking analysis has already been described for another RRM protein, Gbp1p (21Johnston S.D. Lew J.E. Berman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as a result of the formation of multiple covalent cross-links between protein and nucleic acid. The fact that the migrating complexes are different when using (UG)12 as opposed to (TG)12 represents a further indication that TDP-43 RNA and DNA binding characteristics may not be identical. In order to test the importance of each TDP-43 RRMs we then made a series of deletion mutants and analyzed their binding to (UG)12 RNA. Fig.4A shows a schematic representation of two mutants in which we selectively deleted the first RRM motif (GST-TDP43/ΔRRM1) and the second RRM motif (GST-TDP43/ΔRRM2). In addition, in order to confirm the presence of the first RNP-2 motif (residues 106–111), which had not been previously detected in the original work by Ou et al. (19Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we prepared two mutants, the first containing a deletion of the entire 6-amino acid region (GST-TDP43/Δ(106–111)) and the second introducing an Asp residue in substitution for the three amino acids (Leu-106, Val-108, and Leu-111), which were predominantly conserved in the corresponding RNP-2 motifs of well characterized RNA-binding proteins (see Fig. 5). The four mutants were then analyzed by EMSA analysis using labeled (UG)12RNA. The results show that deletion of RRM1 and deletion (or mutation) of the 106–111 RNP-2 motif completely abolished the ability of TDP-43 to bind the RNA (Fig. 4B, first and second upper panels). This result not only confirms the presence of a functional RNP-2 motif localized in position 106–111 but also suggests that the RRM1 sequence spanning residues 106–175 is of fundamental importance for the binding to RNA.Figure 5Comparison of TDP-43 RRM regions with similarRRM motifs of known tertiary structure. This figure shows a comparison of the two TDP-43 RRM motifs with homologous RRM motifs belonging to proteins for which their crystallographic structure is known, hnRNP A1, Sxl, and PABP. Sequence identities with the TDP-43 sequence are marked in bold lettering while key residues involved in direct stacking interactions with the RNA, as confirmed by structural analysis are highlighted with open circles. The highly conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 consensus sequences areunderlined. The asterisk marks the position of the conserved TDP-43 Phe residues with respect to the other RRM sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It should be noted that deletion of RRM2 (leaving the RRM1 sequence intact) does not completely abolish the RNA binding capability of TDP-43 but leads to the appearance of a super-shifted RNA-protein complex (Fig. 4B, first panel), suggesting that the binding characteristics of RRM2 are quite different from those of RRM1. The specificity of this complex formation is confirmed by a competition analysis (Fig. 4C) in which we added increasing amounts of each mutant (GST-TDP43/ΔRRM1 and GST-TDP43/ΔRRM2) to a reaction mix that contained GST-TDP43 and labeled (UG)12RNA. The results show that the GST-TDP43/ΔRRM2 mutant is capable of actively competing with GST-TDP43 for the formation of the supershifted complex, but no change is observed following addition with GST-TDP43/ΔRRM1. In order to better characterize how TDP-43 binds to RNA we compared the sequence of TDP-43 RRMs domains with that of other well characterized RRMs found in proteins whose structure has been solved by crystallography: hnRNP A1 (22Shamoo Y. Krueger U. Rice L.M. Williams K.R. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), Sxl (23Handa N. Nureki O. Kurimoto K. Kim I. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y.

Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the RRM domains found in these proteins, which are most similar to RRM1 and RRM2 of TDP-43. It should be noted that very little homology was detected between U1A RRMs and TDP-43 RRMs (data not shown). Overall, the highest amino acid identity between the different RRMs can be found in correspondence with the highly conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 consensus motifs. In particular, several key aromatic residues that have been reported to be responsible for direct stacking interactions with RNA bases in these different proteins (marked with open circles) are conserved in TDP-43 RRMs. The only exception is represented by the first putative TDP-43 RNP-2 motif (residues 106–111) in which none of the aromatic residues reported to make direct stacking interactions with the RNA are conserved. It should be noted that mutation of these aromatic residues in hnRNPA1 (26Merrill B.M. Stone K.L. Cobianchi F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3307-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and U1A (27Jessen T.H. Oubridge C. Teo C.H. Pritchard C. Nagai K.

To further investigate these similarities we then prepared a series of GST-TDP43-(101–261) mutants in which the conserved Phe residues in each RNP motif were mutated to leucine residues (Fig.6A). The rationale for this change in residue resides in the fact that a Phe to Leu single amino acid mutation has been previously described to abolish the functionality of the RNP motif in the case of the nucleolin protein (29Serin G.

Each mutant was expressed in E. coli (Fig.6B), and its ability to bind (UG)12 RNA and (TG)12 DNA was assayed by EMSA (Fig. 6, C andD).

The ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) form of neuroglobin is also hexacoordinated with the protein ligand E7-His and does not exhibit pH dependence. Flash photolysis studies show a high recombination rate (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub>) and a slow dissociation rate (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>) for both O<sub>2</sub> and CO, indicating a high intrinsic affinity for these ligands. However, because the rate-limiting step in ligand combination with the deoxy hexacoordinated form involves the dissociation of the protein ligand, O<sub>2</sub> and CO binding is suggested to be slow<i>in vivo</i>. Because of this competition, the observed O<sub>2</sub> affinity of recombinant human neuroglobin is average (1 torr at 37 °C).

https://openalex.org/W2013809140,"The human estrogen receptor α-isoform (ERα) is a nuclear transcription factor that displays a complex pharmacology. In addition to classical agonists and antagonists, the transcriptional activity of ERα can be regulated by selective estrogen receptor modulators, a new class of drugs whose relative agonist/antagonist activity is determined by cell context. It has been demonstrated that the binding of different ligands to ERα results in the formation of unique ERα-ligand conformations. These conformations have been shown to influence ERα-cofactor binding and, therefore, have a profound impact on ERα pharmacology. In this study, we demonstrate that the nature of the bound ligand also influences the stability of ERα, revealing an additional mechanism by which the pharmacological activity of a compound is determined. Of note we found that although all ERα-ligand complexes can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome in vivo, the mechanisms by which they are targeted for proteolysis appear to be different. Specifically, for agonist-activated ERα, an inverse relationship between transcriptional activity and receptor stability was observed. This relationship does not extend to selective estrogen receptor modulators and pure antagonists. Instead, it appears that with these compounds, the determinant of receptor stability is the ligand-induced conformation of ERα. We conclude that the different conformational states adopted by ERα in the presence of different ligands influence transcriptional activity directly by regulating cofactor binding and indirectly by modulating receptor stability.

Upon binding its cognate ligand estradiol, the receptor undergoes an activating conformational change permitting it to interact with specific cofactors and bind DNA response elements within target gene promoters (1Beekman J.M. Allan G.F. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1266-1274PubMed Google Scholar, 2Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The DNA-bound receptor-ligand complex is then capable of either activating or repressing target gene transcription, depending on both the cell and the promoter context. The classical model of ERα action suggests that the role of agonists, such as estradiol, is that of a switch converting the receptor from an inactive to an active form. It now appears that ERα pharmacology is more complex, since it has been observed that different ERα-ligands induce different changes in receptor conformation and that target cells can distinguish between these complexes (3Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Gron H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T. McDonnell D.P. Fowlkes D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For instance, the anti-estrogen tamoxifen opposes estrogen action in the breast, whereas it manifests estrogenic activities in bone, the cardiovascular system, and the uterus. Reflecting its complex pharmacology, tamoxifen has recently been reclassified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Additional SERMs have been identified, such as raloxifene, GW5638, TSE424, lasofoxifene, and arzoxifene, each of which has distinct agonist/antagonist profiles (6Xiaodong L. Huebner V. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2000; 3: 383-398PubMed Google Scholar). The challenge, therefore, has been to understand the mechanism(s) underlying SERM-mediated action and evaluate why these compounds distinguish themselves from pure agonists like estradiol. Analysis of the crystal structure of ERα revealed that the conformation of the agonist-receptor complex is distinct from that formed in the presence of antagonists (7Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar, 8Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M.

Furthermore, we have used combinatorial phage display to identify a series of peptides whose ability to interact with ERα is regulated by the nature of the bound ligand. Using these probes, we have been able to show that, even among the SERMs, there are significant differences in the overall structure of the receptor (3Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Gron H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T. McDonnell D.P. Fowlkes D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These findings lend support to the hypothesis that conformation is a primary regulator of ERα-coactivator interactions. One of the first coactivators identified, SRC-1, has been shown to enhance estrogen-activated ERα transcriptional activity when overexpressed in target cells (9Onate S.A. Tsai S. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). In addition, it was observed that overexpression of SRC-1 enhances the partial agonist activity of 4OH-tamoxifen, whereas it has no effect on the antagonist activity of ICI 182,780 (10Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The importance of transcription corepressors in ERα action was demonstrated in studies that showed that the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen could be suppressed by overexpressing N-CoR and SMRT in cultured cells (10Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 11Jackson T.A. Richer J.K. Bain D.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tamoxifen resistance in breast tumor explants (propagated in mice), has been shown to be correlated with a decrease in the expression level of N-CoR (12Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.M. Schiff R. Del-Rio A.L. Ricote M. Ngo S. Gemsch J. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Rose D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Clearly, cofactor expression is a primary determinant of a cell's ability to distinguish among different classes of ligands. Ligand binding, in addition to altering the conformation of the receptor, has been shown to influence the stability of the receptor. In particular, it has been shown that in the absence of ligand, the half-life of ERα is about 4–5 h, whereas estradiol binding accelerates receptor degradation, reducing its half-life to ∼3–4 h (13Eckert R.L. Mullick A. Rorke E.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Monsma F.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Miller M.A. Ziegler Y.S.

A. 1992; 89: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In addition to estradiol, tamoxifen has been shown to stabilize ERα following long term treatment (5Wijayaratne A.L. Nagel S.C. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Norris J.D. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5828-5840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ERα-pure antagonist ICI 182,780 has been shown to decrease the half-life of the mouse ERα (17Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. White R. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Given these results, it seems likely that receptor degradation may be an important event that regulates the duration of response to an activating ligand. The turnover of many short lived transcription factors has been shown to be mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), and the rate of degradation of these proteins appears to directly correlate with their transcriptional activity (19Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Salghetti S.E. Muratani M. Wijnen H. Futcher B. Tansey W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2000; 5: 939-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Although human ERα has been shown to be a substrate for ubiquitination in the presence of estradiolin vitro (22Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), in vivo evidence is still lacking. However, several studies have demonstrated that in the intact cell, estradiol-mediated ERα degradation occurs through the 26 S proteasome pathway (23El Khissiin A. Leclercq G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Alarid E.T. Bakopoulos N. Solodin N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been speculated that recruitment of coactivators like SRC-1 may be a rate-limiting step in this pathway (21Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 939-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) by which estradiol-activated ERα is recognized by the 26 S proteasome remains to be determined. Furthermore, the observation that in addition to the agonist estradiol, the pure antagonist ICI 182,780, which when bound to ERα is unable to recruit any known coactivators, can induce a rapid degradation of ERα clearly indicates that other factors besides coactivator recruitment regulate ERα degradation. At variance with observations made in studies of other transcription factors, it appears therefore, that either transcriptional activity and ERα stability are not linked or that the mechanisms by which agonist- and antagonist-activated ERα are degraded are not the same. Consequently, in this study, we have performed a series of experiments to 1) evaluate the influence of ERα agonists, antagonists, and SERMs on the stability of the human ERα and 2) probe potential correlations between ligand-induced receptor stability and the relative agonist/antagonist activity of an individual compound. Information of this nature will help us to define the mechanisms underlying the agonist/antagonist activity of ERα-ligands and will be useful in the design of screens for ERα-ligands with unique pharmacological attributes.

MCF-7 cells were maintained in phenol red-free medium containing 8% charcoal-filtered serum for at least 24 h prior to induction with ligand. When HeLa cells were used for the expression of proteins, cells were transiently transfected as described below. All cell types were induced with ligand in phenol red-free culture media containing 8% charcoal-filtered serum for 4 h, and whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Approximately 15 μg of total protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with monoclonal antibody H222. The amount of protein loaded has been normalized to ERK-1 protein in an endogenous setting andEscherichia coli β-galactosidase in an exogenous setting. Complexes were detected using ECL. Densitometric quantitation of ERα levels, relative to β-galactosidase levels or ERK-1, were performed using the ImageQuant software program (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). MCF-7 cells were maintained in phenol red-free medium for at least 24 h prior to starvation for 1 h in growth medium lacking phenol red and methionine. Cells were radiolabeled with 200 μCi of35S-labeled methionine/cysteine for 4 h in the same medium used for starvation. Under conditions where cells had to be pretreated with lactacystin (20 μm) or chloroquine (100 μm), reagents were added into the labeling medium for incubation periods of 2.5 h or 30 min, respectively. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 or 4 h in the presence of 10 nmsolvent or ligand in phenol red-free normal culture medium containing 1 mm methionine and cysteine. Cells were lysed with 0.3 ml of buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors as described previously (17Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. White R. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The amount of protein in each supernatant was measured by BCA protein assay and normalized for immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of cell lysates were precleared by incubating with the corresponding IgG, which had been preincubated with Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a further incubation with the beads alone for another 40 min. Following each of these incubations, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After the preclearing, lysates were incubated with specific primary antibody prebound to agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in high and low salt buffers (lysis buffer with 150 mm NaCl), resuspended in loading buffer, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HeLa cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated in 64-mm plates (for Western blots) or 24-well plates (for the measurement of transcription) 24 h prior to transfection. DNA was introduced into cells by transient transfection using Lipofectin. Briefly, 64-mm plate transfections were performed using 7.5 μg of total DNA. For standard transfections, 250 ng of pCMV-βGAL (normalization vector), 2500 ng of reporter (ERE3-TATA-Luc), and 2500 ng of receptor (pRST7-hERα (27Dana S.L. Hoener P.A. Wheeler D.L. Lawrence C.L.

Cells were transfected for 3 h, at which time medium was replaced with phenol red-free culture medium containing 8% charcoal-filtered serum. Forty-eight h following transfection, cells were induced with ligand for 1 or 4 h and lysed as described above under Western blot analysis. When performing transient transfection assays in 24-well plates to measure transcriptional activity, triplicate transfections were performed using 3 μg of total DNA as described previously (5Wijayaratne A.L.

Forty-eight h following transfection, cells were treated with ligand for 4 h followed by lysing in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors as described previously (31Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The protein concentration of the supernatants was measured, and equal amounts of protein were taken and denatured by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 2% SDS. The samples were then diluted with 11 volumes of lysis buffer, followed by the addition of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, with which they were rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads containing the His6-ubiquitin-tagged proteins were washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole). Bound proteins were recovered by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and electrophoresis and detected by immunoblotting with the H222 antibody. The linearity of these ECL responses was measured by constructing a standard curve with increasing concentrations of purified ERα and determining that all experimental densitometric values were in the linear range of the standard curve densitometric values. When calculating the ratios of ubiquitinated ERα, input ERα, the first ERα ubiquitin conjugate, was selected for calculations because it was the only degradation product that appeared consistently under the treatment conditions used. Previous studies that examined the dynamics of ERα turnover have shown that the half-life of this receptor in both breast and uterine tissue, in the absence of ligand, is about 4–5 h (13Eckert R.L. Mullick A. Rorke E.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Monsma F.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Miller M.A. Ziegler Y.S.

Additionally, it has been established that upon binding estradiol or ICI 182,780, the half-life of mouse ERα decreases to ∼3 and 0.5 h, respectively (17Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. White R. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, a direct comparison of the influence of ligands on the stability of human ERα has not yet been performed. As an initial step, therefore, we evaluated the effect of short term treatment (4 h) with a variety of ERα ligands on the relative expression level of endogenous ERα within MCF-7 cells (human breast carcinoma), using Western immunoblot analysis. The ligands chosen for this study have been shown to have distinct ERα pharmacologies exhibiting a range of activities from pure agonist to pure antagonist activity (5Wijayaratne A.L. Nagel S.C. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Norris J.D. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5828-5840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, at physiologically relevant ligand concentrations (10 nm), we were able to demonstrate that endogenous ERα expression levels are differentially affected by the nature of the bound ligand (Fig. 1, A andB). It was observed, for instance, that treatment with either 17-β-estradiol, GW7604, or ICI 182,780 leads to a decrease in ERα levels, with ICI 182,780 being the most effective in this regard (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–8). In contrast, treatment with tamoxifen appears to stabilize ERα and increases intracellular receptor levels above the basal level (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2 andlanes 9 and 10). It is likely that the ligands under study influence both the stability of ERα and the activity of the ERα promoter. Therefore, in order to separate the transcriptional from post-translational effects of exposure to ligands, we performed a pulse-chase analysis of ERα stability in MCF-7 cells. Endogenous ERα in MCF-7 cells was radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and subsequently chased in medium containing unlabeled methionine/cysteine and either solvent or 10 nm ligand for the indicated period. The relative levels of ERα protein were measured by immunoprecipitation followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, relative to the unliganded receptor, estradiol, ICI 182,780, and GW7604 enhanced the rate of degradation of ERα within 1–4 h of treatment, whereas 4OH-tamoxifen decreased this rate of degradation. We conclude that ERα stability is influenced by the nature of the bound ligand following short term treatment, a finding that may explain the different pharmacological activities of the known ERα ligands. Recent studies have provided evidence for a link between the relative transcriptional activity of transcription factors and their rate of degradation; more activity equates with decreased protein stability (36Phillips A. Chalbos D. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14103-14108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Imhof M.O. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been shown that by altering the potency of transcriptional activity of c-Myc, its stability can be regulated (36Phillips A. Chalbos D. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14103-14108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we evaluated whether the ability of an ERα-ligand complex to activate transcription is integrally linked to receptor stability. In addition, we addressed whether this relationship held for SERM- and ICI 182,780-activated ERα, since these ligands have distinct ERα pharmacologies. As a first step, we compared the ligand-induced changes in the stability of ERα-wt and a transcriptionally inactive ERα-LL mutant (6Xiaodong L. Huebner V. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2000; 3: 383-398PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The ERα-LL protein contains two mutations within helix 12 of the ligand binding domain, which have been shown to disrupt the p160 coactivator binding pocket within the receptor (Fig.2 A). The hormone- and DNA-binding properties of this mutant are the same as those of the wild type receptor; however, it is unable to activate transcription in the presence of estradiol (28Mak H.Y. Hoare S. Henttu P.M.A. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Norris J.D. Fan D., M.R., S. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this mutation provides a starting point from which to evaluate the relationship between transcriptional activity and receptor stability. The transcriptional activity and stability of the ERα-LL and ERα-wt proteins were assayed in transiently transfected HeLa cells, an ERα-negative cell line. We chose to transiently overexpress ERα under the control of a heterologous SV40 promoter to rule out the potential influence of the ligands on the ERα promoter. The influence of ligands on the stability of these proteins was assayed using Western immunoblot analysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 C, we were able to reconstitute the same pattern of ligand-induced ERα degradation in this system as was observed in the endogenous MCF-7 system (Fig. 1 A). In the HeLa cell background, ERα-LL displayed a minimal amount of transcriptional activity in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 2 B). Under these conditions, although estradiol induced the degradation of the wild type ERα, it was unable to induce the degradation of transcriptionally inactive ERα-LL (Fig.2, C and D, lanes 1 and2). These observations suggest the existence of a correlation between the ability to activate transcription and a decrease in receptor stability. This link, however, was not apparent when the analysis was extended to other ligands. In particular, although 4OH-tamoxifen exhibited minimal agonist activity on both ERα and ERα-LL, the impact of these ligands on the two proteins was not identical. Most notably, 4OH-tamoxifen-bound ERα-LL was less stable than 4OH-tamoxifen-bound ERα (Fig. 2, C and D,lanes 1 and 5). Similarly, a relationship between ICI 182,780 or GW7604 transcriptional activity and their relative impact on stability could not be observed. The data presented here clearly indicate that the processes that regulate the stability of the ERα-estradiol complex are different from those that affect pure antagonist- or SERM-bound ERα. This is an important result that suggests that other factors, in addition to the ability to activate transcription, are able to trigger the degradation of ERα. It was important to determine whether the observed differences in the degradation patterns of ERα-LL and ERα-wt, in the presence of both estradiol and 4OH-tamoxifen, are due to 1) structural alterations conferred by the mutations in helix 12 or 2) the inability of this mutant to interact with specific cofactor complexes as described above. For this purpose, we used VP16-ERα or VP16-ERα-LL, chimeric receptors in which one of the transcriptional activation regions of the herpes simplex virus (VP16 domain) has been inserted into the amino terminus of full-length receptor (Fig.3 A). Previous studies have shown that the ERα-VP16 chimera is able to constitutively activate transcription when delivere"
https://openalex.org/W2155482026,"A series of natural and synthetic cationic antimicrobial peptides from various structural classes, including α-helical, β-sheet, extended, and cyclic, were examined for their ability to interact with model membranes, assessing penetration of phospholipid monolayers and induction of lipid flip-flop, membrane leakiness, and peptide translocation across the bilayer of large unilamellar liposomes, at a range of peptide/lipid ratios. All peptides were able to penetrate into monolayers made with negatively charged phospholipids, but only two interacted weakly with neutral lipids. Peptide-mediated lipid flip-flop generally occurred at peptide concentrations that were 3- to 5-fold lower than those causing leakage of calcein across the membrane, regardless of peptide structure. With the exception of two α-helical peptides V681n and V25p, the extent of peptide-induced calcein release from large unilamellar liposomes was generally low at peptide/lipid molar ratios below 1:50. Peptide translocation across bilayers was found to be higher for the β-sheet peptide polyphemusin, intermediate for α-helical peptides, and low for extended peptides. Overall, whereas all studied cationic antimicrobial peptides interacted with membranes, they were quite heterogeneous in their impact on these membranes.

Scand. J. Immunol. 1996; 43: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The naturally occurring peptides are generally 12- to 50-amino acids-long and folded into a variety of different structures, including α-helices, β-sheets, extended helices, and loops (3Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Despite this structural variation and extensive sequence variability, most antimicrobial cationic peptides share two unique features, in that they are polycationic, with a net positive charge of more than +2, and fold into amphipathic structures, with both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic domain (3Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). These characteristics allow them to interact with the negatively charged surface molecule lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria and to interact with and insert into the negatively charged cytoplasmic membranes of most bacteria. Antimicrobial peptides exhibit rapid killing, often within minutes in vitro, and a broad spectrum of killing activity against various targets, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses, parasites, and even tumor cells (4Maloy W.L. Kari U.P. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 5Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Therefore, improved variants of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides may provide a feasible alternative to conventional antibiotics, especially because of the emergence of resistant bacterial strains worldwide (6Hancock R.E.W. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2000; 9: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Hancock R.E.W. Drugs. 1999; 57: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although there are many studies addressing the issue, the molecular mechanism underlying antimicrobial peptide-mediated cell death is still a matter of debate. A considerable body of data indicates that most antimicrobial peptides interact with the cytoplasmic membrane rather than by interacting with a specific protein receptor (8Epand R.M. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). For example, certain membrane-active peptides, such as cecropins, magainins, and melittins, etc., have been demonstrated to permeabilize model membrane systems, cause leakage of fluorescent dyes from unilamellar liposomes, or induce ion transport across lipid bilayers (9Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 10Cafiso D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This has lead to the general conclusion that lysis or leakage of essential molecules due to formation of channels in the cytoplasmic membrane is the mechanism of killing. However, such model membrane experiments can sometimes be criticized, because they use very high peptide/lipid ratios. Consistent with this, intact cell experiments are generally inconsistent with the concept of peptide lysis of bacteria (11Friedrich C.L. Moyles D. Beveridge T.J. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and even the breakdown of the cytoplasmic membrane permeability barrier at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)1 has been questioned (11Friedrich C.L. Moyles D. Beveridge T.J. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 12Wu M. Maier E. Benz R. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7235-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that if a high enough concentration of virtually any cationic peptide is used, the cytoplasmic membrane does become leaky, but no formal relationship between killing and permeabilization has been established for many peptides. Although some reports have shown that peptides can become oriented perpendicular to the bilayer at very high peptide/lipid ratios, most studies from NMR, Raman, and fluorescence measurements indicated that cationic peptides initially bind parallel to the lipid bilayer, probably around the interface of head groups and fatty acyl chains (13Bechinger B. Zasloff M. Opella S.J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 14Bechinger B. Zasloff M. Opella S.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 981-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Matsuzaki K. Nakayama M. Fukui M. Otaka A. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Bessho K. Miyajima K.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus it has been proposed that such interfacial peptides might enhance membrane permeabilization by disrupting lipid organization and packing instead of forming a formal pore (17Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Conversely it has been suggested that peptides form informal “aggregate channels” containing lipid and peptide and that using this as an intermediate, some peptides can translocate across the cytoplasmic membrane (16Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokuda H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Hancock R.E.W. Chapple D.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and/or protein biosynthesis has also been proposed as an alternative mechanism resulting in cell death (11Friedrich C.L. Moyles D. Beveridge T.J. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 19Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin.

Regardless of this debate, it is agreed by all researchers that the interaction of most peptides with the membrane, involving charge/charge and hydrophobic interactions, is a necessary precursor to cell death (21Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The interactions of antimicrobial cationic peptides with model phospholipid membranes have been extensively studied for more than two decades. However, the molecular mechanism of peptide-membrane interaction is still controversial. Studies on the frog skin peptide magainin 2 indicate that this peptide causes lipid flip-flop, coupled with pore formation and peptide translocation across the bilayer (22Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11361-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). This finding is interesting and has shed some light on the molecular mechanism of peptide-membrane interaction. Unfortunately, such studies have been largely limited to magainin and structurally related peptides, and most experiments were carried out using high peptide/lipids ratios of 1:10 to 1:50 (22Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11361-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 23Kobayashi S. Takeshima K. Park C.B. Kim S.C. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8648-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the present study we have tried to work at lower peptide/lipid ratios and asked whether peptides with different structures and activities have the same mechanism of action. To provide structural diversity we have selected peptides from two previous structure-activity relationship studies. One group included α-helical peptides derived from a cecropin-melittin hybrid without proline or with one or two prolines, represented here by V681n, V25p, and V8pp, respectively (24Zhang L. Benz R. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8102-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The other group included the extended, boat-shaped, bovine neutrophil peptide indolicidin and its two structural variants CP11CN and CP10A, with improved Gram-negative and broad spectrum activity, respectively (11Friedrich C.L. Moyles D. Beveridge T.J. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar,25Rozek A. Friedrich C.L. Hancock R.E.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19298-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To broaden the structural variety of peptides in this study, we have added the β-sheet crab-derived peptide polyphemusin I (27Zhang L. Scott M.G. Yan H. Mayer L.D. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14504-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the cyclic bacterium-derived peptides, gramicidin S and polymyxin B (28Zhang L. Dhillon P. Yan H. Farmer S. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) to this study. Our results show considerable heterogeneity in the effectiveness of these peptides in their ability to interact with model membranes. All peptides, except for gramicidin S and polymyxin B, were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis using a model 432A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) at the University of British Columbia Nucleic Acid/Protein Service.

Open table in a new tab Lipid monolayers were formed by applying the appropriate lipids dissolved in hexane or chloroform onto water contained in a circular Teflon trough (diameter = 4.5 cm, total volume of 11.5 ml). Monolayers were allowed to equilibrate until a stable surface pressure was obtained (<0.2 mN/m drift in surface pressure Δπ). A small port in the side of the trough enabled injection of reagents into the subphase without disruption of the monolayer. The subphase was gently mixed with a magnetic stir bar at 45 rpm. Surface pressure measurements were obtained by using the Whilhelmy plate method (29Mayer L.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Brockman H.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The plate was cleaned with methanol three times and thoroughly rinsed with double-distilled water prior to each surface pressure measurement. The experiments were run at 23 °C. Symmetrically labeled unilamellar liposomes were made from an equimolar mixture of PC and PG containing 0.5 mol % C6-NBD-PC. The lipid mixture was dissolved in chloroform and was dried under a stream of nitrogen followed by 2 h of vacuum drying. The lipid film was rehydrated with TSE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5), freeze-thawed for 5 cycles and extruded 10 times through two stacked filters with a pore size of 100 nm. For inner-leaflet exclusively labeled liposomes, the symmetrically labeled unilamellar liposomes were mixed with 1 m sodium dithionite in 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated for 15 min at 23 °C. The NBD groups in the outer leaflet of the bilayers were chemically quenched by the water-soluble dithionite. The liposomes were immediately separated from dithionite by gel filtration using Bio-Gel A 1.5m (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA; 1.5 × 10 cm) at 23 °C. For making calcein-encapsulated unilamellar liposomes, a lipid film containing PC/PG (1:1) was rehydrated with 5 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm calcein. The liposome suspension was freeze-thawed for five cycles and extruded ten times through two stacked polycarbonate filters (100-nm pore size). The free calcein was removed by passing the liposome suspension through a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1.5 × 10 cm) at 23 °C and eluting with a buffer containing 20 mmsodium HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium EDTA, pH 7.5. This elution buffer was used for the calcein release experiment. Calcein-free PC/PG (1:1) unilamellar liposomes made in the same elution buffer were added to adjust final liposome concentrations in the calcein release experiment. α-Chymotrypsin-entrapped unilamellar liposomes (ePC/ePG/DNS-PE, 50:45:5) were made using 200 μm enzyme solution in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, according to Kobayashi et al. (23Kobayashi S. Takeshima K. Park C.B. Kim S.C. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8648-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (Sigma), at a final concentration of 200 μm, was added to the liposomes to inactivate the α-chymotrypsin outside the unilamellar liposomes. Excitation of tryptophan residues at 280 nm lead to fluorescence transfer to the dansyl group in DNS-PE leading to an emission recorded at 510 nm. A decrease in fluorescence after peptide addition implied digestion of the internalized peptide by the enzyme within the liposomes. Lipid monolayers at an air/water interface provide a simple, sensitive model for mimicking biological membranes, and many studies have shown that the monolayer technique is a powerful tool to assess membrane insertion of proteins and peptides. The primary phospholipids of Escherichia coli cells comprise a mixture of the neutral lipid phosphatidylethanolamine and the anionic lipids phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, at the ratio of 78:4.7:14.4, in addition to various minor lipid species (30Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24224-24233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We prepared monolayers from PE/ePG/CL (78:4.7:14.4) to mimic the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane and tested the ability of the peptides to interact with such monolayers. Molecules that interact only with the head groups of monolayer lipids typically induce minimal changes in surface pressure. In contrast, insertion into the hydrophobic region of the lipid monolayer can cause a significant increase in monolayer surface pressure. Thus when a protein or peptide is injected into the aqueous subphase bathing a monolayer, the degree of surface pressure change (Δπ) can be used to resolve whether peptide-membrane interactions include insertion and disturbance of the fatty acyl core of the membrane. Fig. 1 A shows the variation in surface pressure as a function of peptide concentration. A significant penetration of peptides into the hydrophobic portion of the monolayer was indicated by Δπ values of >2 mN/m (31Oishi O. Yamashita S. Nishimoto E. Lee S. Sugihara G. Ohno M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4352-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As observed previously for polyphemusin I (27Zhang L. Scott M.G. Yan H. Mayer L.D. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14504-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), all peptides induced increases in surface pressure that were a sigmoidal function of peptide concentration, a result consistent with a cooperative interaction of the peptide molecules with the monolayer. CP10A appeared to be a very effective peptide at modulating the surface pressure increase as indicated by a plateau Δπ value of ∼13 mN/m (Fig. 1 A), only surpassed by gramicidin S, which gave a maximal Δπ of 16 mN/m (28Zhang L. Dhillon P. Yan H. Farmer S. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). V681n, V25p, and indolicidin appeared to be slightly less effective at modulating surface pressure increase resulting in maximal Δπ values between 10 and 12 mN/m, whereas V8pp showed modest activity with a maximal Δπ of 9 mN/m (Fig. 1 A). CP11CN showed a plateau Δπ around 7.5 mN/m (Fig. 1 A), which is nearly identical to the surface pressure increase induced by polyphemusin I (27Zhang L. Scott M.G. Yan H. Mayer L.D. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14504-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These experiments were repeated at least three times and were very reproducible with differences that did not exceed 1 mN/m from experiment to experiment. The lipid avidity of each peptide was monitored by the extent of the surface pressure change upon addition of 1 μg/ml of peptide to the subphase bathing monolayers of pure PC, PE, ePG, or CL. As shown in Fig.2 B, all peptides selectively interacted with negatively charged phospholipids ePG and CL and generally had a greater effect on PG than CL monolayers. Most peptides (including polymyxin B; see Ref. 28Zhang L. Dhillon P. Yan H. Farmer S. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) were not able to penetrate monolayers composed entirely of neutral lipids such as PE or PC, except indolicidin (CP10CN) and its helical variant (CP10A), which, like gramicidin S (28Zhang L. Dhillon P. Yan H. Farmer S. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), displayed modest surface pressure increases of nearly 4mN/m upon binding to PE and PC monolayers (Fig.1 B). The spontaneous flip-flop rate of the fluorescent zwitterionic lipid probe, C6-NBD-PC, has been shown to be extremely small, and no measurable transfer from one monolayer to the other occurred even after 48 h of incubation in asymmetrically labeled liposomes (22Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11361-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Peptide-induced lipid flip-flop was measured here using unilamellar PG/PC liposomes that were asymmetrically labeled with 0.5 mol % C6-NBD-PC in the inner leaflet. Peptides were added to unilamellar liposomes, followed by the water-soluble quencher sodium dithionite (20 μl of 1m dithionite solution in 2 ml of total volume). The extent of peptide-mediated lipid flip-flop was indicated by the percentage of the NBD groups being transposed from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet where they would then be quenched by dithionite. The peptide-induced flip-flop of the fluorescent lipid was thus recorded as a decrease of fluorescence intensity of the NBD group within the 10-min observation time period. We assessed lipid flip-flop on the time scale of 0–10 min to avoid errors because of the possible slow permeation of the quencher (dithionite) through the membrane that might occur over longer reaction times. The percent flip-flop value was defined by the following equation: percent flip-flop = 100 × (F0 −FP)/(F0 −FT), where F0,FP, and FT represent the fluorescence intensity in asymetrically labeled unilamellar liposomes without the peptide, with peptide, and with Triton X-100, respectively. Fig. 2 demonstrates the kinetics of increase in flip-flop for three peptides. The two α-helical peptides, V25p and V681n, were the most active at mediating lipid flip-flop. The flip-flop kinetics were similar for both peptides and depended on both concentration and time. At low peptide concentrations the flip-flop rate was slow, but as the peptide concentration increased the rate of increase in flip-flop also increased. V25p caused more than 95% lipid flip-flop within 300 s at 3 μg/ml (Fig.2 A), whereas V681n caused nearly 90% within 300 s at 4 μg/ml (data not shown). Conversely, the kinetics of flip-flop caused by CP10A (Fig. 2 C) and polyphemusin I (data not shown) were similar being relatively slower at any given concentration than observed for V25p and V681n. For example, CP10A resulted in only 70% flip-flop within 600 s at 5 μg/ml (Fig. 2 C), whereas polyphemusin I caused around 70% flip-flop at 3–5 μg/ml. In contrast, indolicidin, CP11CN, gramicidin S, the double-bend α-helical peptide V8pp, and polymyxin B were totally inactive at concentrations of 1–5 μg/ml at mediating lipid flip-flop when 180 μm liposomes were used (e.g. see Fig. 2 E). The extent of flip-flop after 10 min was plotted as a function of peptide concentration for eight different peptides at a range of peptide/lipid ratios, averaged over three independent experiments (Fig.3). Individual results were quite consistent, with standard errors of around 10%. In general the helical peptides V25p and V681n, the β-hairpin peptide, polyphemusin I, and the short helical indolicidin variant CP10A showed very good activity, at low peptide concentrations (peptide/lipid ratios of 1:100 to 1:400), in mediating lipid exchange between the two leaflets of a bilayer membrane (Fig. 3,A–D). This activity was clearly concentration-dependent in an apparent sigmoidal fashion. None of the other peptides, including the double-bend α-helical peptide V8pp, the extended structured peptides indolicidin and CP11CN, and the cyclic peptides gramicidin S and polymyxin B, induced any detectable lipid flip-flop at peptide/lipid ratios less than 1:100 (data not shown).Figure 3Relationship between ability of peptides to induce lipid flip-flop and membrane leakiness. The lipid composition was PC/PG (1:1). For lipid flip-flop measurements, 0.5 mol % C6-NBD-PC was included. Dotted andsolid lines represent lipid flip-flop and calcein release, respectively. Data shown are the average of three independent experiments. A–D, peptide-induced calcein release and lipid flip-flop were performed using 180 μm lipids.A, V681n; B, V25p;C, CP10A; D, polyphemusin I. E–H, similar experiments were performed using 40 μm lipids.E, gramicidin S; F, V8pp;G, CP11CN; H, indolicidin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To see whether this represented an intrinsic difference between these groups of peptides or a weaker response for the latter group, the peptide/lipid ratio was increased above 1:50, and lipid flip-flop rates were reassessed. Gramicidin S initiated lipid flip-flop at peptide/lipid ratios of 1:50 and reached a maximum (more than 90%) at peptide/lipid ratios above 1:15 (Fig. 3 E). The double-proline peptide V8pp and indolicidin induced about 50 and 40% lipid flip-flop at peptide/lipid ratios of 1:15 and 1:25, respectively (Fig. 3 F, 3H). Neither polymyxin B (data not shown) nor the indolicidin variant CP11CN (Fig.3 G) caused any detectable level of lipid flip-flop even at a peptide/lipid ratio below 1:10. To see whether lipid flip-flop was because of bilayer disruption, membrane leakage was assessed by dequenching of calcein fluorescence (which is self-quenched at the high calcein concentrations inside liposomes) after release from unilamellar PG/PC liposomes. The maximum fluorescence intensity corresponding to 100% leakage was determined by the addition of 10% (w/v) Triton X-100. The percent leakage was calculated as follows: % leakage = 100 × (FP −F0)/(FT -F0), where F0 andFP denote the fluorescence intensity before and after peptide addition, and FT represents the fluorescence intensity after addition of Triton X-100. The kinetics of calcein release is shown in Fig. 2 for three peptides using 180 μm liposomes. Both V25p (Fig.2 B) and V681n (data not shown) demonstrated similar kinetics of calcein release. At concentrations of 1–2 μg/ml, there was an immediate minor increase in peptide-mediated calcein release, but this did not increase over time. At high peptide concentrations of 4–5 μg/ml, a clearly time-dependent increase was observed (Fig. 2 B) after an initial rapid release. Neither CP10A (Fig. 2 D) nor polyphemusin I (data not shown) were effective at causing calcein release from unilamellar liposomes, and only at 5 μg/ml was any more than 20% calcein release observed (Fig. 2 D). Indolicidin, CP11CN, V8pp, gramicidin S, and polymyxin B were unable to induce calcein release at the tested concentrations using 180 μm liposomes (e.g. see Fig. 2 F). These results were summarized for eight peptides at several peptide/lipid ratios for three independent experiments (Fig. 3). Calcein release induced by most peptides demonstrated a sigmoidal dependence on peptide concentration. There was little calcein release at low peptide concentrations, indicating that there was a threshold peptide concentration for stimulating calcein release, although the threshold concentrations differed among the peptides. Both V681n and V25p induced significant membrane damage at peptide/lipid ratios above 1:260 (Fig. 3, A andB). Nevertheless, for V681n and V25p, the concentration resulting in 50% calcein release was 2.5- and 5-fold higher than the concentration that"

Furthermore, in some brain regions they are expressed in the same cells, suggesting that differences between the two receptors might lie in other properties such as their regulation. In this study we investigated, using COS-7 and HEK-293 cells, the mechanism underlying the intracellular trafficking of the D2R and D3R. Activation of D2R caused G protein-coupled receptor kinase-dependent receptor phosphorylation, a robust translocation of β-arrestin to the cell membrane, and profound receptor internalization. The internalization of the D2R was dynamin-dependent, suggesting that a clathrin-coated endocytic pathway is involved. In addition, the D2R, upon agonist-mediated internalization, localized to intracellular compartments distinct from those utilized by the β2-adrenergic receptor. However, in the case of the D3R, only subtle agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation, β-arrestin translocation to the plasma membrane, and receptor internalization were observed. Interchange of the second and third intracellular loops of the D2R and D3R reversed their phenotypes, implicating these regions in the regulatory properties of the two receptors. Our studies thus indicate that functional distinctions between the D2R and D3R may be found in their desensitization and cellular trafficking properties.

Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). The three major central dopaminergic pathways include the nigrostriatal, mesocorticolimbic, and tuberoinfundibular pathways that coordinate movement, affect cognition/emotion, and regulate secretion of prolactin from the pituitary. The importance of proper dopaminergic function is evident when any of these systems become compromised such as in Parkinson's disease (2Lee T. Seeman P. Rajput A. Farley I.J. Hornykiewicz O. Nature. 1978; 273: 59-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), schizophrenia (3Seeman P. Synapse. 1987; 1: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), or hyperprolactinemia (4Cunnah D. Besser M. Clin. Endocrinol. 1991; 34: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the dopamine receptor family has revealed five receptor subtypes, D1 through D5. They have been classically divided into two groups based on ligand specificity and effector coupling. D1 receptor (D1R)1 and D5R are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the G protein Gs, whereas the D2R, D3R, and D4R inhibit this enzyme (5Kebabian J.W. Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol. 1978; 19: 131-154PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sibley D.R. Monsma Jr., F.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 61-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The D2R and D3R, which are major potential targets for antipsychotic drugs, differ in pharmacological profiles and in brain distribution. D3R displays much higher affinity for endogenous dopamine, and its distribution in the brain is predominantly localized to the limbic area (7Sokoloff P. Giros B. Martres M.P. Bouthenet M.L. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). The architectures of the D2R and D3R are similar, with the two sharing 46% overall amino acid homology and 78% identity in the transmembrane domains (8Giros B. Martres M.P. Sokoloff P. Schwartz J.C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1990; 311: 501-508PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly D2R and D3R share many signaling properties when they are expressed in mammalian cells. For example, both regulate adenylyl cyclase (9Chio C.L. Lajiness M.E. Huff R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 51-60PubMed Google Scholar, 10Freedman S.B. Patel S. Marwood R. Emms F. Seabrook G.R.

Although it was reported that D3R is exclusively expressed in specific limbic areas such as the islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens (7Sokoloff P. Giros B. Martres M.P. Bouthenet M.L. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar), more recent studies in monkey and human brain have shown that D3R is also expressed in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons (20Diaz J. Pilon C. Le Foll B. Gros C. Triller A. Schwartz J.C. Sokoloff P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8677-8684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and seems to be co-expressed with D2R in the same cells (21Gurevich E.V. Joyce J.N. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999; 20: 60-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The question arises why two structurally and functionally similar receptor proteins are expressed in both the same and distinct regions of the brain. Unless one of these receptors utilizes an uncharacterized and unshared signaling pathway, one speculation would be that different brain regions require different regulatory properties of the receptors. A common paradigm of G protein-coupled receptor desensitization is that agonist-induced receptor signaling is rapidly attenuated via G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated receptor phosphorylation and arrestin binding (22Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The arrestin family of proteins to which the β-arrestins belong initiates receptor internalization through clathrin-coated pits (sequestration) (23Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S.

The sequestration of the D2R involves GRKs and dynamin molecules and seems to be a slow cellular process taking 2 h to plateau (29Itokawa M. Toru M. Ito K. Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Arinami T. Hamaguchi H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ito K. Haga T. Lameh J. Sadee W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Iwata K. Ito K. Fukuzaki A. Inaki K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast to the D2R, the sequestration of the D3R has not yet been described. Considering that the D2R and D3R have similar structural features and signaling pathways but incompletely colocalize in the brain, it became of interest to determine whether properties of desensitization and trafficking of these receptors are similar. We have conducted a series of comparative studies of the cellular processes involved with the receptor sequestration for D2R, D3R, and chimeras made by interchanging the second and third cytoplasmic loops of each receptor. Our data show that significant differences exist in both desensitization and trafficking properties of these receptors. The swapping of cytoplasmic loops interchanges their phenotypes for phosphorylation, β-arrestin binding, and intracellular trafficking.

The D2R was tagged at the amino terminus with the M2-FLAG epitope with the eight-residue sequence of the epitope (DYKDDDDA) inserted after Met1; D3R was tagged at the amino terminus with the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA). In addition, the D2R and D3R were fluorescently tagged at the carboxyl terminus using a mutant GFP (33Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

For the internalization assay, HEK-293 cells were transfected with D2R-GFP or D3R-GFP in the absence or presence of GRK2 or GRK3. One day after transfection, cells were seeded onto 35-mm dishes containing a centered, 1-cm well formed from a glass coverslip-sealed hole in the plastic and allowed to recover for 1 day. Cells were incubated with 2 ml of minimum essential medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and viewed on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope. Three different strategies were used. The total receptor level was assessed using [3H]spiperone, a hydrophobic ligand able to label both the intra- and extracellular complements of a receptor. Intracellular receptor levels were measured by displacing the extracellular binding with a high concentration of the hydrophilic ligand sulpiride. The intracellular and extracellular proportions of the D2R or D3R were then calculated before and after cell stimulation and used to calculate the percentage of sequestration. HEK-293 or COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. The following day cells were transfected with D2R or D3R in the absence or presence of GRKs and/or β-arrestins (as indicated in the figure legends) using the calcium phosphate method or LipofectAMINE® (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48–72 h, cells were rinsed once with warm medium containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 μm ascorbic acid (anti-oxidant) at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with 1–10 μm dopamine (DA) for 0–120 min as indicated. Stimulation was terminated by quickly cooling the dishes on ice, washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS, and rinsing the cells from the plate in 2 ml of ice-cold PBS/EDTA. Cell aliquots (200 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of [3H]spiperone (final concentration, 3 nm) in the absence and presence of unlabeled competitive inhibitor. The hydrophobic properties of [3H]spiperone allowed the measurement of total cellular levels of D2R or D3R (i.e. intra- and extracellular), while displacement of extracellular (i.e. plasma membrane-associated) [3H]spiperone with unlabeled, hydrophilic sulpiride (3 μm) allowed direct measurement of internalized receptor. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm spiperone. Assays to measure total, intracellular, and nonspecific binding were performed in triplicate for each time point. Binding assays were incubated for 3 h at 14 °C to prevent receptor recycling and terminated by washing three times with vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters using ice-cold Wash Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). Samples were mixed with 5 ml of Lefkofluor scintillation fluid and counted on a Packard 1900TR liquid scintillation analyzer. Sequestration of D2R was measured according to Itokowa et al. (29Itokawa M. Toru M. Ito K. Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Arinami T. Hamaguchi H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar) using the hydrophilic properties of sulpiride. HEK-293 or COS-7 cells overexpressing D2R in the absence or presence of GRKs and/or β-arrestins were seeded 1 day after transfection at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. The following day, cells were rinsed once and preincubated for 15 min with 0.5 ml of prewarmed serum-free medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with 10 μm DA for 0–120 min as indicated. Stimulation was terminated by quickly cooling the plates on ice and washing the cells three times with ice-cold serum-free medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated with 250 μl of [3H]sulpiride (final concentration, 2.2 nm) at 4 °C for 150 min in the absence and presence of unlabeled competitive inhibitor (10 μm haloperidol). Cells were washed two times with the same medium, and 1% Triton X-100 was added. Samples were mixed with 5 ml of Lefkofluor scintillation fluid and counted on a Packard 1900TR liquid scintillation analyzer. Sequestration of D2R or D3R was measured using flow cytometry by incubation of plated cells with anti-FLAG M2 IgG or anti-HA antibody (1:500 dilution) for 1 h on ice. Wells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS followed by incubation with Fc-specific, fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:250 dilution) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed three times, rinsed from the plate with 400 μl of PBS/EDTA, and fixed in 3.6% formaldehyde. Samples were analyzed within 24 h on a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer. Baseline fluorescence was determined from a sample of HEK-293 cells transfected with empty vector and was subtracted from each sample. Binding studies to characterize agonist and antagonist binding properties were performed with cell membranes prepared from HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the wild-type D2R, the amino-terminally tagged FLAG-D2R, or the carboxyl-terminally conjugated D2R-GFP. In the presence of increasing concentrations of the D2R-selective antagonist spiperone,Ki values for displacement of [125I]iodosulpride from D2R, FLAG-D2R, and D2R-GFP were 0.35, 0.71, and 0.11 nm, respectively (Fig.1A). Similarly, DA and the D2R-selective agonist quinpirole (data for DA is not shown), demonstrated the following Ki values for the three receptors: DA: 4.49, 6.52, and 1.35 μm; quinpirole: 0.59, 0.72, and 0.37 μm for D2R, FLAG-D2R, and D2R-GFP, respectively. These values are similar to those previously reported for cloned D2R (38Bunzow J.R. Van Tol H.H. Grandy D.K. Albert P. Salon J. Christie M. Machida C.A. Neve K.A. Civelli O.

Server A.C. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9762-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), suggesting that these constructs retain characteristic D2R ligand binding properties. Pharmacological properties of HA-tagged D3R and six different D2/D3 chimeric receptors in which the second or third cytoplasmic loop or both loops were replaced with those of the other receptor are described in detail in our previous studies (32Robinson S.W. Jarvie K.R. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 352-356PubMed Google Scholar, 40Robinson S.W. Caron M.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As an initial step to investigate the roles played by GRKs in the regulation of D2R and D3R, whole-cell phosphorylation assays were conducted in HEK-293 cells overexpressing receptors and/or kinases (Fig.1B). The major phosphorylated protein in D2R- and D3R-expressing cells runs as a broad band of 55–80 kDa and is not present in immunoprecipitates of mock-transfected cells (data not shown). As revealed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads for FLAG-D2R, moderate agonist-induced phosphorylation of D2R was evident in the absence of exogenous GRK2 or GRK3 and could be enhanced by co-expression of GRKs (Fig. 1B, upper panel). D2R-GFP was also phosphorylated by endogenous kinase (Fig.1B, lower panel), and overexpression of GRK2 with D2R-GFP increased the agonist-induced phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of D3R was different from that of D2R. D3R was not phosphorylated by agonist stimulation in the absence of exogenous GRK (data not shown), and overexpression of GRK caused only a subtle increase in the level of phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, left panel). When the second and third cytoplasmic loops of D3R were replaced with those of D2R, D3-(IL23-D2), phosphorylation properties of D3R became similar to those of D2R (Fig. 1C, right panel). These results suggest that the pattern of receptor phosphorylation is determined by cytoplasmic loops of the receptor. The involvement of β-arrestins in the regulation of D2R and D3R was investigated using a GFP-conjugated β-arrestin (β-arrestin-GFP) translocation assay (33Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Prior to agonist addition, cells expressing D2R or D3R and β-arrestin-GFP in the absence or presence of GRKs displayed a uniform distribution of fluorescence throughout the cytosol. In D2R-expressing HEK-293 cells, translocation of β-arrestin2-GFP was observed in response to agonist stimulation regardless of the co-transfection of additional GRKs (Fig.2A, left panel). As expected from the phosphorylation profiles, D3R caused only a subtle translocation of β-arrestin2-GFP to the plasma membrane only in the presence of overexpressed GRKs (Fig. 2A, right panel). Consistently GRK2 caused more reliable β-arrestin translocation of the D2R, while GRK3 was the more effective enzyme for the D3R, although quantitative studies were not conducted. As reported for the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (41Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), β-arrestin2-GFP showed a better translocation than β-arrestin1-GFP to activated D2R and D3R activation (data not shown). In the case of the D3R, β-arrestin1-GFP did not translocate regardless of overexpression of GRKs. For both the D2R and D3R, translocated β-arrestins co-localized with the receptors and remained on the membrane even when receptors were stimulated for 1 h indicating that they belong to class A G protein-coupled receptors (41Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, it was demonstrated that the second and third cytoplasmic loops of D2R and D3R are involved with the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (40Robinson S.W. Caron M.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Considering that G proteins and β-arrestins usually compete for the same region in the cytoplasmic loops of G protein-coupled receptors, it is likely that both loops are involved in β-arrestin binding. We used chimeric D2/D3 receptors (40Robinson S.W. Caron M.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to determine which regions are involved with the translocation of β-arrestins in the presence of overexpressed GRK3. The stepwise replacement of loops in the D2R with those of D3R converts it to a D3R phenotype for β-arrestin translocation (Fig.2B1), and conversely the removal of D3R loops from the D3R and replacement by loops from the D2R converts it to a D2R phenotype (Fig.2B2). The same pattern was observed in the absence of exogenous GRK2 except that the translocations of β-arrestin2 were less intense for all the chimeric receptors in response to agonist activation (data not shown). Using confocal microscopy the cellular distribution and trafficking of the D2R-GFP and D3R-GFP were visually assessed in HEK-293 cells. The fluorescence distributions of the receptors were almost exclusively localized to the plasma membrane in unstimulated cells, and this was not altered by co-expression of GRKs (Fig. 3,A and B). Stimulation of D2R-GFP with DA resulted in a time-dependent redistribution of fluorescence from the plasma membrane to cytosolic compartments. As shown in Fig.3A, sequestration of D2R was evident in the absence of overexpression of GRK but was significantly enhanced by exogenous GRKs. In contrast, the internalization of D3R was very subtle even in the presence of overexpressed GRKs (Fig.3B). The sequestration of D2R and D3R was compared using the [3H]spiperone in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, dopamine induced a low extent of sequestration of the D2R in the absence of exogenous GRKs, and this was enhanced by co-expression of GRK2 or GRK3. Unlike D2R, a subtle sequestration of the D3R was observed only in the presence of exogenous GRK. In the absence of GRK overexpression, no sequestration of receptor was observed. The sequestration experiments were also conducted for chimeric receptors and for two wild-type receptors using [3H]sulpiride in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig.3C, the chimeric receptors showed the sequestration patterns that might be predicted from the β-arrestin2-GFP translocation assay. The D3R chimeric receptor whose second and third cytoplasmic loops were replaced with those of D2R (D3-(IL23-D2)) had a similar extent of sequestration to wild-type D2R. These results clearly demonstrate that the second and third cytoplasmic loops of D2R regulate the translocation of β-arrestins and sequestration of the receptor. Effects of GRKs and β-arrestins on the sequestration of the D2R were studied in HEK-293 cells using the hydrophobic radioligand [3H]spiperone method, which provided detailed information regarding the receptor proportions present inside the cell or on the cell surface. Table I shows the levels of sequestered D2R (proportion of intracellular D2R in the basal state) and maximal agonist-induced sequestration levels above basal sequestration in cells transfected with GRKs and/or β-arrestins. Co-expression of GRK2 or GRK3 significantly enhanced both the internalization rate (the half-time was 86 ± 11 and 28 ± 11 min for control and GRK2/β-arrestin1 group, respectively) and maximal sequestration level (about 4-fold). Although co-expression of β-arrestins alone also demonstrated a modest enhancement in both the rate and maximally sequestered receptor levels, the overexpression of GRK was sufficient to elicit maximum sequestration of D2R, a situation different from that observed in COS-7 cells. It should also be noted that no change in the total cellular complement of receptor was observed during the 2-h time course for these experiments indicating that down-regulation of receptor did not contribute to decreases in cell surface receptor levels (data not shown).Table IEffects of GRK and β-arrestin expression on the sequestration of the D2R in HEK-293 cellsBasal intracellular receptorMaximal sequestration above basal level%Mock16.8 ± 1.59.3 ± 1.4GRK219.1 ± 1.331.6 ± 4.2GRK320.9 ± 2.119.7 ± 3.0β-Arrestin122.4 ± 1.518.1 ± 1.8β-Arrestin215.1 ± 1.012.8 ± 1.7GRK2/β-arrestin125.0 ± 1.933.8 ± 3.6GRK2/β-arrestin216.5 ± 1.922.9 ± 1.7GRK3/β-arrestin118.6 ± 2.325.8 ± 3.9 Open table in a new tab The sequestration of the D2R in COS-7 cells was assessed by measuring the disappearance of [3H]sulpiride binding sites from the cell surface after agonist stimulation. As shown in Fig.4A, the sequestration of D2R was essentially GRK-/β-arrestin-dependent, and the greatest potentiation was achieved by the combination of GRK2 and β-arrestin2 (Fig.4A). It is now well established that many G protein-coupled receptors internalize via a clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytic pathway (42Tan P.K. Davis N.G. Sprague G.F. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1707-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 43Moore R.H. Sadovnikoff N. Hoffenberg S. Liu S. Woodford P. Angelides K. Trial J.A. Carsrud N.D. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and that the GTPase dynamin is a major component and marker for this pathway (46Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 47Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 48van der Bliek A.M.

Cell. 1996; 84: 13-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Co-expression of K44A-dynamin markedly inhibited the GRK-/β-arrestin-dependent sequestration of D2R (Fig. 4B), suggesting that functional dynamin is required for sequestration of D2R and implicating the clathrin-coated endocytic pathway in D2R internalization. In the case of the D3R, the extent of receptor sequestration was very low, and it was not possible to determine a role for dynamin using analogous approaches to D2R. As discussed in Fig. 2A, D3R caused a subtle agonist-activated translocation of β-arrestin2-GFP only in the presence of exogenous GRKs. This is probably because the affinity of β-arrestin2-GFP for the D3R is weak, and translocation is not robust enough for a substantial amount to accumulate at the plasma membrane in the absence of exogenous GRK. If this were the case, the blockade of receptor sequestration would increase the accumulation of translocated β-arrestin2-GFP on the plasma membrane. Therefore, HEK-293 cells were transfected with K44A-dynamin in the absence of exogenous GRK with D3R and β-arrestin2-GFP. As shown in Fig. 4C, K44A-dynamin did not affect the distribution of β-arrestin2-GFP in the resting state; however, translocation of β-arrestin2-GFP was obvious when cells were treated with dopamine. This result suggests that, although it is very subtle, D3R utilizes a clathrin-coated endocytic pathway for sequestration that can be enhanced by exogenous GRKs. Since the endocytic characteristics of the D2R were similar to those of β2AR, it would be interesting to further test whether D2R uses the same endocytic vesicles as the β2AR. HEK-293 cells were transfected with D2R-GFP and β2AR-RFP in the presence of overexpressed GRK2 and stimulated with DA and isoproterenol (1 μm each). Both receptors formed clusters on the membrane within 5 min (data not shown); thereafter, sequestration of β2AR was a fast process and reached maximum in 20 min. Sequestration of D2R, however, continued to increase over the 1-h time course. β2AR-RFP and β2AR-GFP colocalized on the plasma membrane, in small endocytic vesicles, and in large endosomes as reported previously (50Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Internalized D2R-GFP could be found on the plasma membrane and in small vesicles but did not co-localize with the β2AR-RFP (Figs.3A and 5). Therefore, although biochemical studies show that β2AR and D2R both sequester in a clathrin-dependent manner, they are not sorted to the same population of endocytic vesicles when simultaneously activated by their respective ligands. The same studies were repeated for the D3R, however, few small-sized sequestered vesicles were observed, and we could not reach a clear conclusion whether they co-localize with β2AR-RFP. The D2R and D3R have long cytoplasmic loops but very short carboxyl tails (10 amino acids) unlike the β2AR that has a long carboxyl tail and short cytoplasmic loops. The tail of the β2AR is known to undergo GRK phosphorylation and regulate recruitment of β-arrestins. Since the short carboxyl tails of the D2R and D3R are unlikely to be capable of regulating these processes, we tested whether their second and third cytoplasmic loops, which are involved in agonist binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (32Robinson S.W. Jarvie K.R. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 352-356PubMed Google Scholar, 40Robinson S.W. Caron M.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), could be responsible for these regulatory events. The phosphorylation, arrestin translocation, and sequestration assays clearly show that the intracellular trafficking properties of the D2R and D3R are mediated by the composition of their second and third cytoplasmic loops. There seems to be some uncertainty regarding the role of clathrin pathways in mediating D2R endocytosis that may have arisen from the methodology used to assess sequestration (31Iwata K. Ito K. Fukuzaki A. Inaki K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 51Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In our experiments the sequestration of the D2R was significantly increased by co-expression of GRK and β-arrestin but significantly reduced by dominant-negative dynamin (29Itokawa M. Toru M. Ito K. Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Arinami T. Hamaguchi H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar, 51Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the D2R internalizes in a clathrin-dependent manner in agreement with previous studies (31Iwata K. Ito K. Fukuzaki A. Inaki K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) despite the fact it does not co-localize with the β2AR in large endosomes. The characteristics of D2R sequestration varied with cell type. In COS-7 cells the sequestration of the D2R was observed only in the presence of exogenous GRKs or β-arrestins. In contrast, in HEK-293 cells we could observe a moderate degree of sequestration of the D2R without overexpression of GRK or β-arrestins. This cellular difference is most likely due to higher levels of GRKs and β-arrestin expression in HEK cells as reported previously (52Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Differences in the signaling or brain distribution of the D2R and D3R could ultimately affect their physiological roles. Numerous unsuccessful efforts have been made to identify a difference in G protein signaling between the D2R and D3R. If signaling behavior is not responsible for differences in their physiological roles, perhaps differences in their regulation are. We have observed that the D3R has a much reduced ability to translocate β-arrestin to the plasma membrane and sequesters much less than the D2R. Thus, upon agonist stimulation a proportionally larger fraction of D2R would desensitize and disappear from the plasma membrane compared with the D3R. Perhaps their dissimilar distributions in the brain are necessary consequences of these differences and could have therapeutic implications. For example, the D3R is found mainly in the limbic system where antipsychotic drugs target dopamine signaling. Our results showing a difference in their regulatory properties may provide a new rationale for the development of selective antipsychotic drugs."

The mechanism of the suppression is not well understood. In present study, we show that activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a critical event leading to the suppression ofcyp1a1 gene expression, thus providing an underlying mechanism for the TNF-α- and LPS-induced cyp1a1suppression. We demonstrated that: (i) inducible RelA expression down-regulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activated reporter gene; (ii) the suppressive effects of LPS and TNF-α on the AhR-activated reporter gene could be blocked by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, which is known to inhibit NF-κB action; and (iii) TNF-α and LPS-imposed repression could be reversed by the NF-κB super repressor (SRIκBα), thus demonstrating the specific involvement of NF-κB. Furthermore, nuclear receptor coactivators p300/CBP and steroid receptor coactivator-1 act individually as well as cooperatively to reverse the suppressive effects by NF-κB on the AhR-activated reporter gene, suggesting that these transcriptional coactivators serve as the common integrators for the two pathways, thereby mediating the cross-interactions between AhR and NF-κB. Finally, using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that AhR ligand induces histone H4 acetylation at the cyp1a1promoter region containing the TATA box, whereas TNF-α inhibits this acetylation, suggesting that AhR/NF-κB interaction converges at level of transcription involving chromatin remodeling.

Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Upon ligand activation, the AhR translocates into the nucleus and binds to another basic helix-loop-helix PAS protein called the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) (14Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric protein complex then binds to the enhancer sequence (xenobiotic response element (XRE)) located in the promoter region of AhR-controlled genes, such as cyp1a1 (15Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Receptor binding to the XREs results in conformational changes in the chromatin structure in the cyp1a1 promoter leading to the subsequent transcriptional events (6Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). LPS and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1β are known to induce NF-κB. NF-κB is a pleiotropic transcription factor playing an important role in regulation of physiological processes including immune responses, inflammatory reactions, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and developmental processes (reviewed in Ref.16Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). The classic inducible NF-κB heterodimer typically consists of a p65 (RelA) and a p50 (NF-κB-1) subunit, with RelA being the subunit conferring strong transcription activation. We have recently demonstrated a mutually inhibitory interaction between the AhR and NF-κB signaling pathways (17Tian Y. Ke S. Denison M.S. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These led us to hypothesize that the NF-κB plays an important role in mediating the suppression ofcyp1a1 expression by inflammatory agents. In this study, we demonstrated that NF-κB plays a direct role in TNF-α- and LPS-induced down-regulation of cyp1a1 expression. Furthermore, our results suggest that the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) (18Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12101-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and the transcription coactivator p300/CBP (19Eckner R. Arany Z. Ewen M. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) are common coactivators shared by the NF-κB and AhR pathways. These coactivators are known to have histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity that contributes to activation of transcription of target genes. In support of the role of coactivators SRC-1 and p300 in mediating AhR/NF-κB interaction, we demonstrated by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that NF-κB induced suppression of cyp1a1 expression by inhibiting ligand-induced histone H4 acetylation at the promoter region ofcyp1a1. These results thus provide a mechanistic explanation for the long standing observation that the proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial endotoxin cause down-regulation of the expression of cytochromes P-450 1A1/1A2 and alter xenobiotic metabolism. pTIPGFP-RelA-GST was created by subcloning the RelA fragment into the BglII and NarI sites of the pTIPGFP-GST vector (21Medina D. Moskowitz N. Khan S. Christopher S. Germino J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E61Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The RelA fragment was created by PCR amplification using a p65 plasmid (22Ruben S.M. Dillon P.J. Schreck R. Henkel T. Chen C.H. Maher M. Baeuerle P.A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) as the template. The primers used in the reaction were YE1 (GGGCGGATCCGCACCATGGACGAACTGCCCCTC) and YE2 (GGGCCCTCGAGA-TTAGGAGCTGATCTGACTCAGCAG). pGudLuc6.1, a reporter plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene under control of four XRE segments, was kindly provided by M. A. Denison (23Garrison P.M. Tullis K. Aarts J.M. Brouwer A. Giesy J.P. Denison M.S. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1996; 30: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). SRIκBα, which contains serine to alanine mutation in amino acid 32 and 36, was described previously by other investigators (24Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 25Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). SRIκBα was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNAs used for transfection were purified using the Qiagen Maxi-Prep DNA isolation system (Qiagen). The cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For transient transfection, Hepa1c1c7 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes, and transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) when cell density reached 80% confluence. pSV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (Promega) was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. Six hours after transfection, the cells were treated with AhR ligands (TCDD) or Me2SO (solvent control) for 18 h before harvest for determination of luciferase activity. For stable transfection to create the tetracycline-inducible RelA expression cells, the HeLa Tet-On cells (CLONTECH Laboratories) were transfected with the pTIPGFP-RelA-GST by lipofection. The transfected cells were then grown under the selection of puromycin (1 µg/ml). Selected colonies were picked and expanded in the presence of puromycin. Hepa1c1c7 cells were maintained in 6-well plates, and when growth reached 80% confluency, the cells were treated with TCDD, TNF-α, and LPS. Twelve hours after treatment, total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions. The conditions for reverse transcription and PCR reaction were described by Lai et al.(26Lai Z.W. Hundeiker C. Gleichmann E. Esser C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PCR primers for mouse cyp1a1 were CCCACAGCACCACAAGAGATA and AAGTAGGAGGCAGGCACAATGTC; HPRT (house-keeping gene) primers were GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT and CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC (26Lai Z.W. Hundeiker C. Gleichmann E. Esser C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. The collected cells were lysed directly in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS/8% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins on the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and the membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies at 37 °C for 2 h. The blots were then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of immunoaffinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase. Blots were washed three times with TBST with subsequent color development using nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt (Sigma) as the substrate. Luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Briefly, the transfected cells were lysed in the culture dishes with reporter lysis buffer, and the lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Ten µl of the supernatant fraction were incubated with 100 µl of luciferase substrate, and the relative luciferase activity was determined with a luminometer (Turner Designs). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a small scale procedure as described (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for EMSA were commercially synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.) and included κB (wild type; GGCAGGGGAATTCCCC) and κB (mutation; GGCAGCTCAATTGAGCT) corresponding to a consensus NF-κB binding site (used as the probe for EMSA) and a mutant in the 5′-GGG sequence that disrupts binding (used for competition assay in EMSA). These oligonucleotides can self-anneal and κB (wild type) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using Klenow enzyme (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The oligonucleotides used for EMSA of AhR binding were GGAGTTGCGTGAGAAGAGCC and GGCTCTTCTCACGCAACTCC. The mutant oligonucleotides were CCTCCAGGCTCTTCTCAATCAACTCCGGGGCAC and GTGCCCCGGAGTTGATTGAGAAGAGCCTGGAGG. In EMSA for NF-κB, 3 µg of nuclear extract protein was incubated for 30 min in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm KCl, 1 nmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, and 4% Ficoll (400 K) and ∼30000 cpm of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. For EMSA of the AhR-XRE binding, 10 µg of nuclear extract protein was used in the same reaction conditions as described above. For supershift assays, the antibodies were added to the reaction mixture for an additional 30 min. After incubation, the reaction mixture was then separated by electrophoresis through a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the results were recorded by autoradiography. The procedure for ChIP assay was performed as described (28Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) with modifications. Hepa1c1c7 cells were maintained in 10-cm plates under standard cell culture conditions. At 95% confluency formaldehyde was added directed to tissue culture media to a final concentration of 1% for cross-linking, and the plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature on a rocker. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a finial concentration of 0.125 m. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The plates were then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped off the plates and collected into 50-ml conical tubes by centrifugation (600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm PMSF. The cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of cell lysis Chro-IP lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated with gentle agitation for 10 min on ice. The crude nuclei were collected by centrifugation (600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and then resuspended in 10 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 5 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated again for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 400 µl of 1× RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 5 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). The samples were then sonicated into DNA fragment of 0.3–1.5 kB. 20 µl of Staph A cells (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to each sample to preclear the sample for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at top speed in microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube, appropriate antibodies (1 µg) were added to the supernatant, and then protein A/G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to each tube. The mixtures were incubated on the rotating platform at 4 °C for at least 3 h. After the incubation, the beads were centrifuged at 600 × g for 1 min, and the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of RIPA containing high salt (500 mm NaCl). The final wash was with 1 ml of RIPA. After the wash, 200 µl of digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 100 µg/ml proteinase K) was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated at 55 °C for 3 h followed by 6 h at 65 °C to reverse cross-linking. The samples were extracted once with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and once with chloroform and then ethanol precipitated overnight. The precipitated pellet was collected by microcentrifugation at top speed, and the pellets were resuspended in 20 µl of TE buffer. Aliquots from each tube were used for PCR amplification. The primer pairs for PCR of cyp1a1 promoter region were: −821 to −343, ATCCTTCCTCCACCCTTTCCTC and CCTTTTCACTATTTTTGCACCC; −285 to +66, TTTCCTCAAACCCCTCCCTC and GAAGTGAAGAGTGTTCTCTAGGAC. TNF-α and LPS have been previously shown to suppress xenobiotic metabolism mediated by cytochrome P-450 1A1/1A2 (Refs. 3Abdel-Razzak Z. Loyer P. Fautrel A. Gautier J.C. Corcos L. Turlin B. Beaune P. Guillouzo A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 707-715PubMed Google Scholar and4Muntane-Relat J. Ourlin J.C. Domergue J. Maurel P. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 29Morgan E.T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 122-207Google Scholar). A common denominator for the action of TNF-α and LPS is the induction of NF-κB. To investigate the role of NF-κB in cyp1a1 regulation, we tested the effects of TNF-α and LPS on cyp1a1 expression. For this purpose, the murine hepatoma cells (Hepa1c1c7) were transiently transfected with pGudLuc6.1, which is a luciferase reporter gene directed by enhancer sequences from the murine cyp1a1gene. The TCDD-induced activation of the reporter gene was markedly suppressed by the treatment with TNF-α and LPS (Fig. 1,A and B) in a dose-dependent manner, with almost complete repression of reporter gene activity at the highest doses. To test the effects of TNF-α and LPS on the endogenouscyp1a1expression, we used a semiquantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the levels of cyp1a1 mRNA after the TNF-α and LPS treatment. In agreement with the transfection results, the TCDD-induced cyp1a1 mRNA was also suppressed by treatment with either TNF-α or LPS as determined by the RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1 C), indicating that endogenouscyp1a1 gene expression was suppressed by these inflammatory agents. These results are consistent with those obtained by other investigators using either Western or Northern blot analysis or detection of the products from enzymatic reactions showing that LPS and TNF-α suppress the levels of cytochromes P-450 1A1/1A2 (3Abdel-Razzak Z.

Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further test the specific suppressive effects of RelA subunit of NF-κB on the cyp1a1 promoter, we created a controlled expression system by inserting RelA into the expression vector pTIP-GST-EGFP. This vector allows the inserted RelA to be expressed as a fusion protein (GST-RelA-EGFP) under the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter and contains a puromycin-resistant gene (21Medina D. Moskowitz N. Khan S. Christopher S. Germino J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E61Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably transfected with the pTIP-GST-RelA-EGFP were selected with puromycin. The HeLa cells were then transiently transfected with pGudLuc 6.1, and the transfected cells were treated with TCDD. The addition of doxycycline to the cell culture medium caused a dose-dependent increase of the expressed fusion protein (Fig. 2C) with concomitant decreases in the pGudLuc6.1 reporter gene activity (Fig.2 B). Expression of GST-EGFP alone did not affect the pGudLuc6.1 reporter gene activity, indicating that the suppressive effects are due to the RelA moiety of the fusion protein (Fig.2 A). To demonstrate that NF-κB is directly involved in the cyp1a1 suppression by TNF-α and LPS, we first treated pGudLuc 6.1 transfected Hepa 1c1c7 cells with TNF-α or LPS, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). PDTC is an antioxidant that has been widely used as a chemical inhibitor of NF-κB (30Muller J.M. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Methods. 1997; 11: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays with Hepa1c1c7 cells, PDTC treatment reversed the LPS-induced suppression of the pGudLuc6.1 reporter gene activity and significantly attenuated TNF-α-induced suppression of the reporter gene activity (Fig.3), suggesting that NF-κB plays an important role in the suppression of cyp1a1 expression by TNF-α and LPS. To further demonstrate that NF-κB is specifically involved in the suppression of cyp1a1 expression, we used the NF-κB repressor, SRIκBα, to inhibit the TNF-α and LPS induced NF-κB activity. SRIκBα is a mutant of IκBα with a serine to alanine mutation at residues 32 and 36. These mutations render the SRIκBα unable to be phosphorylated at serines 32 and 36 and resistant to degradation through the proteosome pathway, thereby causing constitutive inhibition of NF-κB (24Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 25Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays, Hepa1c1c7 cells were cotransfected with pGudLuc 6.1 and increasing amounts of SRIκBα expression plasmid. Activation of NF-κB by either TNF-α or cotransfection of RelA expression plasmid caused suppression of the reporter gene activity. However, the TNF-α- or RelA-induced suppression of pGudLuc 6.1 was reversed by coexpression of SRIκBα (Fig. 4). As can be observed in Fig. 4, expression of SRIκBα actually enhanced the TCDD-induced pGudLuc 6.1 reporter gene activity. We believe that this is due to the suppression of the AhR by the endogenous level of NF-κB activity. Endogenous NF-κB activity is readily observable in untreated Hepa1c1c7 cells by EMSA (Fig.5A, lane 1). These results taken together with those of the PDTC experiment indicate that NF-κB is an important factor in the TNF-α-induced suppression ofcyp1a1 gene expression.Figure 5TNF -α and LPS treatments activate NF-κB but do not alter the binding of AhR bind to XRE. Hepa1c1c7 cells were treated with TNF-α (1 and 5 ng/ml), LPS (1 and 5 µg/ml), and TCDD (10 nm) for 2 h. Nuclear extracts from these treated cells were used for detection of activations of NF-κB and AhR by EMSA.A, to detect activation of NF-κB, radiolabeled κB probe was used in EMSA. B, EMSA supershift experiment to identify the p65/p50 heterodimer and p50/50 homodimer that bind to κB probe.Abs, antibodies against p65, p50, and ARNT. C, to detect AhR binding to XRE, end-labeled XRE probes were used in EMSA. The double arrows indicate the specific binding of AhR complex to XRE. N.S., nonspecific binding. For bothA and C, to show binding specificity, 200-fold of the unlabeled probes of wild type sequence (wt) and mutated sequence (mt) were used to compete with the radiolabeled probes in EMSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the potential mechanisms for NF-κB-induced suppression of cyp1a1 transcription is for AhR and NF-κB to form an inactive complex, incapable of binding to the XRE sequences. To test this hypothesis, we performed an EMSA assay using nuclear extracts of TCDD-, TNF-α-, and LPS-treated Hepa1c1c7 cells. NF-κB activities were markedly induced by TNF-α and LPS as determined by EMSA with radiolabeled κB probe (Fig. 5 A). The activated NF-κB proteins were the p65/50 heterodimer and p50/50 homodimer as determined by the EMSA supershift experiments (Fig.5 B). However, despite the strong activation of NF-κB, the binding of AhR-ARNT to the XRE consensus sequence was not affected by either TNF-α or LPS treatment at 2 h (Fig. 5 C). These observations are in interesting contrast with the results of transient transfection results and RT-PCR, showing TNF-α and LPS significantly suppressed the AhR-driven luciferase gene activity (Fig. 1), suggesting that TNF-α and LPS suppress cyp1a1 transcription at step(s) downstream from AhR-XRE binding. The transcriptional activity of the AhR and NF-κB are known to be modulated by transcriptional coactivators. Among the coactivators, p300/CBP and SRC-1 are known to be involved in the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. p300/CBP has been shown to be able to coactivate the AhR pathway (31Kobayashi A. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Using transient transfection assays, we tested the effects of p300/CBP and SRC-1 on the AhR/NF-κB interactions. Transient expressions of either SRC-1 (Fig.6A) or p300 (Fig.6 B) caused enhancement of pGulLuc 6.1 reporter gene activity in Hepa1c1c7 cells, which is consistent with the coactivator functions of transcriptional coregulators (31Kobayashi A. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32Kumar M.B. Perdew G.H. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286PubMed Google Scholar). We further tested the effects of these coactivations on the NF-κB-induced suppression of AhR driven reporter gene activity. In transient transfection assays, cotransfection of p65 with pGudLuc6.1 caused suppression of TCDD-induced reporter gene activity. Cotransfection of p300 and SRC-1 individually attenuated the suppressive effects of p65, and when transfected in combination, p300 and SRC-1 completely overcame the p65-induced suppression of pGudLuc6.1 reporter gene activity (Fig.6 C). The common transcription coactivators p300/CBP and SRC-1 are known to possess intrinsic HAT activity that is involved in chromatin remodeling and leads to gene activation. Their involvement in AhR/NF-κB interactions strongly suggests that NF-κB activation affects the chromatin remodeling of the cyp1a1 promoter. To investigate this potential effect, we used the ChIP assay to test the effects of TNF-α treatment on the TCDD-induced AhR binding on thecyp1a1 promoter and to study the acetylation of histones in native chromatin of the cyp1a1 promoter in Hepa1c1c7 cells. In these experiments, we found that ligand (TCDD) treatment induced AhR binding to the −821 to −343 region of cyp1a1 gene, which contains XRE sequences (33Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16478-16482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.7A). AhR binding to this region was associated with a concomitant increase in histone H4 acetylation (Fig. 7 A). Histone acetylation is even more pronounced in the region containing the TATA box (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that active chromatin remodeling activity is also occurring in this region. Consistent with the EMSA results, the effects of AhR binding to −821 to −343 is not affected by TNF treatment. Strikingly, TNF-α treatment inhibits the TCDD-induced H4 acetylation in the −821 to −343 region of the cyp1a1 gene, and the suppressive effect is most clearly observed in the region containing the TATA box (−285 to +66) (Fig. 7 B). Alteration of expression of cytochromes P-450 by proinflammatory cytokines, LPS, and double-stranded RNA (from certain viral infections) has important physiological implications as the metabolism of many drugs, xenobiotic detoxification, as well as homeostasis maintained by endogenous steroid hormones all depend on cytochromes P-450 action. Although there are some cytochromes P-450 that have been reported to be induced by TNF-α and LPS, the recurring findings are that inflammatory cytokines and LPS predominantly suppress the gene expression of cytochromes P-450 (reviewed in Ref. 29Morgan E.T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 122-207Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest a mechanistic explanation for the long standing observation that inflammatory cytokines and LPS suppress the expression of the gene encoding cytochrome P-450 1A1. Based on the results of our earlier studies, which show a direct interaction between the AhR and NF-κB pathways, we postulated that the inducers of NF-κB would down-regulate the cyp1a1 expression. Most of the reports have been largely consistent with this hypothesis. Indeed, it has recently been shown that H2O2 treatment suppresses cyp1a1 expression (34Morel Y. Barouki R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 35Morel Y. Mermod N. Barouki R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6825-6832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the investigators suggested that H2O2-inducedcyp1a1 suppression is due to down-regulation of NF1, based on the fact that H2O2 is well known to induce NF-κB activity, it is highly likely that NF-κB activation plays a role in the observed H2O2-inducedcyp1a1 suppression. In our current studies, the important role of NF-κB in suppression ofcyp1a1 expression is demonstrated based on the following results: (i) AhR activated luciferase reporter gene is down-regulated by RelA subunit of NF-kB under the control of tetracycline-regulated expression system; (ii) the suppressive effects of LPS and TNF-α on the AhR-activated reporter gene can be blocked by PDTC, which is known to inhibit NF-κB action; and (iii) TNF-α and LPS-imposed repression of cyp1a1 promoter activity could be reversed by the NF-κB super repressor (SRIκBα), thus demonstrating the specific involvement of NF-κB. The results of the above experiments establish the role of NF-κB in suppression of cyp1a1 expression. To further investigate the mechanism of NF-κB-induced cyp1a1 suppression, we studied the roles of common transcriptional coactivators in mediating the suppression. It is known that transcriptional coregulators such as the p300/CBP and SRC-1 function as coactivators for both the AhR and the NF-κB pathways. These coactivators have been shown to possess HAT activity (36Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L.

McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). HAT activity is involved in the chromatin remodeling, which is a key step in transcriptional activation (39Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, 40Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar, 41Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Because p300/CBP and SRC-1 are found to be the coregulators for both AhR and NF-κB pathways, it is conceivable that there may be a competition such that when one pathway is activated, the other pathway will be repressed through competition for coactivator availability: a “squelching” mechanism. The results of this study support this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 6 C, expression of p300/CBP or SRC-1 alleviate the suppression imposed by activation of NF-κB. Coexpression of p300 and SRC-1 totally abolished the suppressive effect of NF-κB on the AhR-mediated reporter gene. We have previously demonstrated a physical association between the AhR and the RelA subunit of NF-κB. It is intriguing to speculate about how this association causes the observed down-regulation ofcyp1a1 expression. One possibility is that the AhR and RelA form an inactive complex, thereby preventing the AhR from binding to the enhancer sequences. We do not believe that this is the explanation, however, because we observed that activation of NF-κB by either TNF-α or LPS does not hinder the AhR-ARNT complex from binding to the XRE DNA sequences (Fig. 5 C). Furthermore, the results of ChIP assays demonstrated that TCDD treatment causes binding of the AhR to the regions of the cyp1a1 gene containing XREs in 2 h and that cotreatment with TNF-α has no effects on the binding of AhR to this region (Fig. 7 A). These results are in agreement with the in vitro EMSA results (Fig. 5 C). In interesting contrast to the lack of effects of TNF-α to AhR binding to XRE, histone H4 acetylation is markedly inhibited by TNF-α treatment especially at the promoter region around TATA box within 2 h of TNF-α treatment (Fig. 7). These results suggest that ligand-induced activation of cyp1a1 expression is a series of interconnected yet distinct events. The activator (AhR) binding to the enhancer sequences is separable from the subsequent assembly of the preinitiation complex, which includes the recruitment of coactivators bearing HAT activities. These observations also imply that binding by an activator to an enhancer sequence is necessary but not sufficient for transcriptional activation. Our results are consistent with the two-stage model of steroid receptor gene activation proposed by Jensteret al. (42Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The involvement of p300/CBP and SRC-1 in the AhR/NF-κB functional interactions suggest an important role for histone acetylation in the AhR-mediated gene regulation. This view is clearly supported by the results in this study. We demonstrated, by using ChIP and EMSA, that activation of AhR with ligand causes AhR-ARNT complex to bind to the XRE sequences with concomitant increase in the histone H4 acetylation in the TATA box region of cyp1a1. Histone acetylation is associated with transcriptional activation (41Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). TNF-α treatment abolishes the acetylation of H4. Histone acetylation of the chromatin is an important initial step for gene activation, followed by the assembly of the preinitiation complex. Hypoacetylated chromatin is silenced in gene transcription. Therefore, TNF-α-induced inhibition of histone acetylation suggests inactivation of the cyp1a1promoter. It is noteworthy that the status of histone acetylation is an outcome of two opposing processes, i.e. acetylation and deacetylation; therefore the observed inhibition of H4 acetylation at the cyp1a1 promoter could be the result of either the reduced HAT activity or increased deacetylation brought about by histone deacetylases. In summary, we have demonstrated that NF-κB plays an important role in cyp1a1 suppression caused by TNF-α and LPS. We further demonstrated that p300/CBP and SRC-1 act individually, as well as cooperatively, to reverse the suppressive effects by TNF-α and LPS on the AhR-activated reporter gene. These observations suggest that these transcriptional coactivators serve as the common integrators for the two pathways, thereby mediating the cross-interactions between AhR and NF-κB. By using ChIP assay, we demonstrated the NF-κB/AhR interaction converges at the level of transcription, in that NF-κB activation suppresses cyp1a1 expression by inhibiting histone H4 acetylation at cyp1a1 promoter. Whether the inhibited histone acetylation at cyp1a1 promoter is brought about by reduced HAT or increased histone deacetylase activity or both remains to be investigated. We thank J. P.

Protein phosphatase (PP) 2A is a major phosphatase implicated in tau dephosphorylation in vitro. Dephosphorylation of tau can be blocked in vivo by okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP2A. Moreover, activity of PP2A is reduced in AD brains. To elucidate the role of PP2A in tau phosphorylation and pathogenesis, we expressed a dominant negative mutant form of the catalytic subunit Cα of PP2A, L199P, in mice by using a neuron-specific promoter. We obtained mice with high expression levels of Cα L199P in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar neurons. PP2A activity in brain homogenates of transgenic mice was reduced to 66%. Endogenous tau protein was hyperphosphorylated at distinct sites including the AT8 epitope Ser-202/Thr-205, a major AD-associated tau phosphoepitope. AT8-positive tau aggregates accumulated in the soma and dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells and co-localized with ubiquitin. Our data establish that PP2A plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation. Our results also show that reduced PP2A activity is associated with altered compartmentalization and ubiquitination of tau, resembling a key pathological finding in AD."
https://openalex.org/W1989819921,"In C2C12 myoblasts, endogenous histone deacetylase HDAC4 shuttles between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, supporting the hypothesis that its subcellular localization is dynamically regulated. However, upon differentiation, this dynamic equilibrium is disturbed and we find that HDAC4 accumulates in the nuclei of myotubes, suggesting a positive role of nuclear HDAC4 in muscle differentiation. Consistent with the notion of regulation of HDAC4 intracellular trafficking, we reveal that HDAC4 contains a modular structure consisting of a C-terminal autonomous nuclear export domain, which, in conjunction with an internal regulatory domain responsive to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), determines its subcellular localization. CaMKIV phosphorylates HDAC4in vitro and promotes its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttlingin vivo. However, although 14-3-3 binding of HDAC4 has been proposed to be important for its cytoplasmic retention, we find this interaction to be independent of CaMKIV. Rather, the HDAC4·14-3-3 complex exists in the nucleus and is required to confer CaMKIV responsiveness. Our results suggest that the subcellular localization of HDAC4 is regulated by sequential phosphorylation events. The first event is catalyzed by a yet to be identified protein kinase that promotes 14-3-3 binding, and the second event, involving protein kinases such as CaMKIV, leads to efficient nuclear export of the HDAC4·14-3-3 complex.

McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The repression of transcription is manifest at the level of chromatin structure where histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 are recruited to deacetylate histones and create a repressive chromatin structure (reviewed in Ref. 2Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Of the ten human HDACs identified so far (3Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), 2A. Guardiola, A. Ito, and T.-P. Yao, unpublished. 2A. Guardiola, A. Ito, and T.-P. Yao, unpublished. HDAC4 and its closely related family member HDAC5 have been specifically implicated in regulating muscle differentiation ((1) and see below). The functional link between HDAC4/5 and muscle differentiation was first uncovered by the cloning of MITR, a transcriptional repressor identified as an interactive partner for myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) transcription factor family members, which are important for muscle differentiation (4Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). MITR shows extensive homology to the non-catalytic N terminus of HDAC4 and -5 (4Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Indeed both HDAC4 and HDAC5 interact with MEF-2. It was reported that overexpression of HDAC4 or HDAC5 represses MEF-2 transcriptional activity (5Youn H.D. Grozinger C.M. Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22563-22567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and suppresses C2C12 myoblast differentiation (1Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). It was also found that the HDAC4/5·MEF-2 interaction and the effect of this complex on muscle differentiation could be reversed by a constitutively active form of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) (6Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which CaMK regulates HDAC4 and HDAC5 is not entirely clear. When ectopically expressed, HDAC4 can be found in either the nucleus or cytoplasm whereas the closely related HDAC5 is predominantly a nuclear protein ((7) and see Fig. 1). The observed localization patterns of different HDACs support the idea that the deacetylase activity of HDAC4 and HDAC5 might be controlled by their differential distribution in subcellular compartments and suggest that subcellular trafficking may be dynamically regulated. Indeed, inhibition of the nuclear export machinery leads to nuclear accumulation of HDAC4, indicating that its subcellular localization is controlled by active nuclear export (7Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, nuclear export activity alone is not likely sufficient to explain the intracellular trafficking of HDAC4, because not all cells expressing HDAC4 show identical distribution. This suggests the presence of other regulatory mechanisms required for the control of HDAC4 subcellular localization. One such mechanism may involve members of the 14-3-3 protein family, which bind a consensus motif that contains specific phosphorylated serine residues (8Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). HDAC4 binds 14-3-3 family members, and the mutation of three serine residues that abolishes 14-3-3 binding leads to nuclear accumulation of HDAC4. Based on such studies, it was proposed that 14-3-3 traps HDAC4 in the cytoplasm (9Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 10Wang A.H. Kruhlak M.J. Wu J. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Posner B.I. Bazett-Jones D.P. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6904-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). More importantly, the association with 14-3-3 is sensitive to phosphatase inhibitors, suggesting that this interaction, and therefore the subcellular distribution of HDAC4, is regulated by reversible phosphorylation (9Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the observation that the ability of HDAC4 to repress transcription can be inhibited by active forms of CaMK (6Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest the possibility that subcellular localization of HDAC4 might be regulated by CaMK-dependent phosphorylation. Although the analysis of ectopically expressed HDAC4 suggests that its subcellular localization is regulated by nuclear export, this has not been shown for the endogenous protein. In this report, we present evidence that endogenous HDAC4 shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments during muscle differentiation, suggesting a dynamic regulation of HDAC4 by differential subcellular localization. Furthermore, we show that subcellular localization of HDAC4 is controlled by both a C-terminal autonomous export domain and a central regulatory domain. We further show that the expression of an active form of CaMKIV mobilizes HDAC4 from nucleus to cytoplasm and that HDAC4 can be phosphorylated by CaMKIV in vitro, suggesting that CaMKIV-dependent phosphorylation can control HDAC4 subcellular localization. We present evidence that HDAC4 constitutively binds 14-3-3 and this interaction is necessary for HDAC4 to respond to CaMKIV. However, CaMKIV promotes HDAC4 nuclear export without stimulating HDAC4·14-3-3 interaction. These results suggest the existence of two separate phosphorylation events in which HDAC4 is first phosphorylated by a yet to be identified kinase that creates an HDAC4·14-3-3 complex, followed by secondary phosphorylation events, catalyzed by kinases such as CaMKIV that activate HDAC4 nuclear export. FLAG-tagged PBJ5-HDAC4 and HDAC5 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. S. Schreiber (Harvard University). pBJ5-HDAC4-S467A/S632A (2S/A) mutant was generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Constitutively active and inactive CaMKIV constructs were previously described (11Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 3X MEF-2 luciferase reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr. Eric Olson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4DBD)-HDAC4 fusion constructs were generated in pCMX-Gal4 vector (12Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Retrovirus HDAC4 and HDAC5 plasmids were made in CR-Neo retroviral vector. Anti-HDAC4 antibodies were made by injecting rabbits with recombinant HDAC4 (amino acids 453–654) followed by affinity purification. Anti-MHC (MF20) was used as described previously (13Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Anti-Gal4DBD and anti-14-3-3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (13Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2 except for C2C12, which is maintained in DMEM with 20% FBS in 5% CO2. To establish C2C12 stable cell lines, retroviruses expressing HDAC4, HDAC5, or the neomycin-resistance gene were packaged in phoenix cells. Viral supernatants were used to infect C2C12 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene followed by G418 (600 μg/ml) selection for 5 days in DMEM-20% FBS to obtain pools of stable cell lines. Differentiation was induced when cells became 80% confluent by replacing medium with DMEM containing 2% horse serum for 72 h. All transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (14Yao T.P. Segraves W.A. Oro A.E. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, 170 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. A 200-μg aliquot of protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG (M2) antibody-conjugated beads for 4 h followed by immunoblotting using anti-14-3-3 antibody. U2OS cells were transfected in 24-well plates with plasmids encoding 3XMEF-2 Luc reporter (0.25 μg), internal control pCMX-βGal (0.25 μg), MEF-2D (0.25 μg), HDAC4 and its S/A mutants (0.15 μg), and active or inactive CaMKIV (0.15 μg). 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and luciferase activity was measured and normalized by β-galactosidase activity as previously described (14Yao T.P. Segraves W.A. Oro A.E. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). HDAC4 fragment (453) and its S/A (S467A/S632A) mutant were cloned into pGEX-4T1 vector. Recombinant proteins were purified by the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GlutathioneS-transferase-CaMKIV (200 ng) and maltose-binding protein-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (500 ng) were mixed in “cold mix” containing 50 mmTris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, and 250 μm ATP and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Then substrates (750 ng) and “hot mix” (cold mix containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added into reaction tubes, which were then incubated at 30 °C for another 10 min. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were analyzed overnight in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Previous studies of ectopically expressed HDAC4 indicate that the subcellular localization of HDAC4 is regulated (7Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To begin to address the physiological importance of this regulation, we first examined the localization of endogenous HDAC4 in C2C12 myoblasts, because the HDAC4·MEF-2 complex has been suggested to play a role in muscle differentiation (1Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Using a highly specific antibody raised against HDAC4 (Fig. 1 N), endogenous HDAC4 in cycling C2C12 cells is found mainly in the cytoplasm, although a portion of the cells demonstrate nuclear staining (Fig. 1 A). Treatment of cycling C2C12 myoblasts with a nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB), results in an exclusively nuclear staining, demonstrating that endogenous HDAC4 also shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus via a manner that is regulated by nuclear export (Fig. 1 B). We next examined the localization of HDAC4 in terminally differentiated myotubes. As shown in Fig. 1 C(arrowheads), many differentiated C2C12 myotubes stained with HDAC4 antibody show strong nuclear signals. These data indicate that at least a portion of HDAC4 is transported into the nuclei of the differentiated myotubes, which also stain positively for the muscle differentiation marker myosin heavy chain (MHC) (Fig. 1 D). Our results suggest that the subcellular localization of HDAC4 is dynamic and that a population of HDAC4 molecules resides in the nucleus upon terminal differentiation. To further evaluate the subcellular localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 during muscle differentiation, we established C2C12 cell lines that stably express FLAG-tagged HDAC4 or HDAC5. We stably introduced HDAC4 or HDAC5 by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and analyzed pools of infected C2C12 cells to avoid potential artifacts that might be associated with a small number of selected clones. We then followed the subcellular distribution of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in infected C2C12 myoblasts by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against HDAC4, HDAC5, or the FLAG epitope. C2C12 cells that stably express ectopic HDAC4 or HDAC5 display no gross abnormalities. As shown in Fig. 1 E, HDAC4 is found to be more concentrated in the cytoplasm of the dividing undifferentiated myoblasts. This cytoplasmic population of HDAC4 responds to LMB treatment and is retained in the nucleus (data not shown). In contrast, a majority of HDAC5 is already localized in the nucleus of the cycling C2C12 cells (Fig. 1 H). This result suggests that the subcellular localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 may be regulated differently. To determine if HDAC4 translocates into nuclei upon terminal differentiation, we induced differentiation of myoblasts stably expressing HDAC4 or HDAC5. As shown in Fig. 1 (F andG), strong nuclear staining of HDAC4 is observed in the differentiated myotubes (arrowheads). Similar results were obtained using anti-FLAG antibody or an HDAC4-GFP fusion protein stably expressed in C2C12 cells (data not shown). These observations support the idea that a portion of HDAC4 accumulates in the nucleus upon differentiation. In fact, in some C2C12 cells, nuclear accumulation of HDAC4 can be observed 24 h after the differentiation stimulus (data not shown). On the other hand, HDAC5 remains concentrated in the nuclear compartment in the differentiated myotubes (Fig. 1,I and J). Together, our results demonstrate a relocation of HDAC4 from cytoplasm to nucleus during muscle cell differentiation, whereas the majority of HDAC5 appears to reside in the nucleus in both cycling and differentiated myotubes. To our surprise, ectopic expression of HDAC4 or -5 does not block C2C12 differentiation. The C2C12 cells containing elevated concentrations of HDAC4 or -5 form multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1, G,J, L, and M) that express the appropriate terminal differentiation marker MHC (Fig. 1, Gand J). In fact, C2C12 cells that stably express HDAC4 or -5 differentiate into large myotubes that contract vigorously. This contraction often leads to their dislodgment from the culture dishes, and the partially detached myotubes become ball-like structures (Fig.1 M, arrowheads). Such structures were never observed in control C2C12 myotubes (data not shown). These observations not only suggest that a portion of HDAC4 translocates to the nucleus in response to differentiation but also raise the possibility that nuclear HDAC4 and/or HDAC5 may play roles in facilitating certain aspects of muscle differentiation. The analysis of HDAC4 subcellular localization in C2C12 cells demonstrates that the movement of HDAC4 occurs during muscle differentiation. To examine the structural basis and potential factors that might regulate this movement, we turned to U2OS cells, which are more amenable to structure-function analysis of HDAC4 expressed by transfection. When U2OS cells are cultured in 10% CO2, transfected HDAC4 is localized in nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments while transfected HDAC5 is exclusively localized in the nucleus (Fig.2 A). Similar to endogenous HDAC4 in myoblasts, treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor LMB leads to nuclear accumulation of the transfected HDAC4 (Fig.2 A, right panel). Thus, this assay system allows us to study the regulation of intracellular HDAC4 shuttling. We first investigated which region of HDAC4 is required for nuclear export. We fused a series of HDAC4 truncation mutants to the DNA binding domain of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor (Gal4DBD, Fig. 2 B), which contains an intrinsic nuclear localization signal and itself localizes to the nucleus (data not shown). Analysis of the subcellular localization of these Gal4DBD-HDAC4 fusion proteins shows that amino acids 859–1084 at the C terminus of HDAC4 are sufficient to confer nuclear export activity and redistribute a significant amount of nuclear Gal4DBD to the cytoplasm (Figs. 2 C, middle left panel and 2 D,upper panel). Upon LMB treatment, this fusion protein again accumulates in the nucleus demonstrating that the intrinsic export activity resides in fragment 859–1084 (Figs. 2 C,middle right panel and 2 D, lower panel). Supporting this conclusion, deletion of the C terminus, which encompasses this domain, induces the nuclear localization of HDAC4 and abrogates the LMB response (data not shown). In addition, Gal4DBD fused with the N-terminal portion of HDAC4 (amino acids 1–223 or 222–630) is also not LMB-responsive (data not shown and Fig.2, C and D, lower panel). Thus, the C terminus of HDAC4 contains a domain that mediates nuclear export. The observation that phosphatase inhibitors can affect the subcellular distribution of HDAC4 suggests that the localization of HDAC4 should be regulated by protein phosphorylation (9Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). An active form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) has been shown to be capable of regulating the dissociation of MEF-2 from HDAC4 in vitro (6Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Because CaMKIV is present in the U2OS cells, 3S. M. Lemrow and A. R. Means, data not shown. we asked whether ectopic CaMKIV could regulate HDAC4 subcellular localization. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected HDAC4 with either a constitutively active form of CaMKIV or its corresponding kinase-inactive version into U2OS cells (11Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A (b andc), co-expression of active CaMKIV, but not the kinase-inactive mutant, mobilizes nuclear HDAC4 and leads to its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Importantly, the ability of CaMKIV to mobilize HDAC4 is completely abrogated by LMB treatment demonstrating that CaMKIV functions by influencing export rather than inhibiting nuclear import of HDAC4 (Fig. 3 A (d)). To map the regulatory domain in HDAC4 that is responsive to CaMK, we determined the ability of active CaMKIV to mobilize a series of HDAC4 deletion mutants fused to Gal4DBD. As shown in Fig. 3 B, deletion of amino acids 1–221 (fragment Gal4-(222–1084)) does not affect CaMKIV responsiveness. A further deletion to amino acid 629 (fragment Gal4-(629–1084)) eliminates the CaMKIV response, although this fragment contains the nuclear export domain (Fig. 2). This result indicates that amino acids in the 222–630 fragment of HDAC4 might be regulated by CaMKIV. Consistent with the idea that CaMKIV mobilizes HDAC4 by activating its nuclear export (Fig. 3 A), this fragment (222) alone without the C-terminal export domain (629–1084) is not responsive to CaMKIV. Together, our results suggest that the subcellular localization of HDAC4 is regulated by two separate domains, one of which confers autonomous export activity while the other confers CaMKIV responsiveness. To determine if CaMKIV might modulate HDAC4 subcellular localization by direct phosphorylation, we tested whether HDAC4 is a substrate of CaMKIV. As shown in Fig.4 A, the incubation of purified CaMKIV with a recombinant HDAC4 fragment (453) that contains part of the putative CaMK-responsive domain results in HDAC4 phosphorylation. A previous study identified three phosphoserine residues mediating HDAC4 and 14-3-3 interaction (9Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Two of these serine residues (Ser-467, Ser-632) are located in this domain, and they fit the consensus phosphorylation sequence for CaMKIV (RXX(S/T) (15Hook S.S. Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar)). Indeed, mutation of these two serine residues to alanine (S/A mutant) reduces but does not abolish the phosphorylation of HDAC4-(453–654) fragment by CaMKIV in vitro (Fig. 4 A). Thus, CaMKIV can phosphorylate HDAC4 at Ser-467 and/or Ser-632 in vitro. To assess whether phosphorylation of Ser-467 and Ser-632 is important for the CaMKIV responsiveness of HDAC4 in cells, we co-transfected an expression plasmid encoding the HDAC4 2S/A (S467A/S632A) mutant with active CaMKIV and determined its subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, the response of the 2S/A mutant to CaMKIV is markedly reduced when compared with wild type or mutant HDAC4 with a single CaMKIV consensus site (serine 467) mutated to alanine (data not shown). To further assess the functional relevance of phosphorylation by CaMKIV on the subcellular distribution of HDAC4, we examined the transcriptional repression activity of wild type HDAC4 and its 2S/A mutant in response to the constitutively active CaMKIV. Overexpression of wild type HDAC4 suppresses MEF-2-dependent transcription (Fig. 4 D), and this repression is reversed by co-expression of CaMKIV. In contrast to wild type HDAC4, the 2S/A mutant effectively represses MEF-2 activity but it is more resistant to CaMKIV (Fig.4 D). Collectively, our results suggest that CaMKIV reverses the transcriptional repression activity of HDAC4 by stimulating the mobilization of HDAC4 out of the nucleus. Serine 467 and serine 632 residues have been shown to be involved in 14-3-3 binding (9Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and appear to be phosphorylated by CaMKIV in vitro (Fig.4 A). We reasoned that CaMKIV might phosphorylate HDAC4 and promote its binding to 14-3-3, resulting in HDAC4 cytoplasmic accumulation. To test this, we determined the interaction between HDAC4 and 14-3-3 in the presence or absence of active CaMKIV. As shown previously, HDAC4 binds 14-3-3 ((9) and Fig. 4 E, lane 1). However, co-expression of CaMKIV does not increase HDAC4 binding to 14-3-3 (lane 2). This result suggests that CaMKIV promotes HDAC4 nuclear export by a mechanism other than direct modulation of HDAC4·14-3-3 interaction. Consistent with this conclusion, both nuclear and cytoplasmic localized HDAC4 is bound to 14-3-3 (data not shown). To further examine the role of 14-3-3 binding in CaMKIV responsiveness, we determined the binding of the 2S/A mutant to 14-3-3. As shown in Fig. 4 E, the 2S/A mutant, which has a much reduced response to CaMKIV (Fig. 4, B and C), also shows reduced binding to 14-3-3 (lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with a critical role of 14-3-3 binding in conferring CaMKIV responsiveness, HDAC4 3S/A mutant (S246A/S467A/S632A), which does not bind 14-3-3 (binding-deficient HDAC4), is completely resistant to CaMKIV in both transcriptional repression and cytoplasmic translocation assays (Fig. 4, B–D). These results suggest that the interaction with 14-3-3 is necessary for HDAC4 to be exported in response to active CaMKIV. In this study, we provide evidence that two functional domains work in concert to determine the subcellular localization of HDAC4. One domain, which is present in the C terminus of HDAC4, provides a constitutive nuclear export signal. This domain is presumed to tether HDAC4 to the nuclear export receptor, Crm-1. The central regulatory region, which confers responsiveness to CaMKIV, constitutes the second domain critical to HDAC4 subcellular localization. Importantly, both the central regulatory domain and the C-terminal export domain are required for CaMKIV responsiveness. Thus, the cooperation of these two modular domains determines the specific subcellular localization of HDAC4. We have identified CaMKIV as one protein kinase that can regulate the subcellular localization of HDAC4, at least in U2OS cells that contain this enzyme. We considered two potential mechanisms that could underlie the effects of CaMKIV on the intracellular trafficking of HDAC4. First, as 14-3-3 binding is critical for HDAC4 subcellular localization and two of the residues that can be phosphorylated by CaMKIV (Ser-467 and Ser-632) also mediate 14-3-3 binding, CaMKIV phosphorylation may result in the interaction of the exported HDAC4 to cytoplasmic 14-3-3, which in turn, retains HDAC4 in the cytoplasm. However, we found no evidence that CaMKIV promotes HDAC4 and 14-3-3 binding despite the fact that the interaction with 14-3-3 appears to be critical for HDAC4 to respond to CaMKIV. Second, CaMKIV-mediated phosphorylation of HDAC4 or its associated proteins may promote active nuclear export of HDAC4. Consistent with this idea, the effect of CaMKIV on HDAC4 subcellular localization can be completely abrogated by the LMB-induced inhibition of nuclear export. The observation that CaMKIV promotes HDAC4 nuclear export without affecting the interaction with 14-3-3 has several implications. First, it argues that, although CaMKIV can phosphorylate HDAC4 on serine residues (467 and 632) that are important for 14-3-3 binding, these are apparently not the major sites phosphorylated by CaMKIV that results in the nuclear export of HDAC4 in cells. Rather, the CaMKIV-independent interaction between HDAC4 and 14-3-3 strongly suggests that HDAC4 is constitutively phosphorylated by one or more yet to be identified kinases. The nuclear HDAC4·14-3-3 complex, which may be the “HDAC4 form” competent to respond to the active CaMKIV, can then be efficiently exported from the nucleus in response to active CaMKIV. Consistent with this idea, both CaMKIV and 14-3-3 can be found in the nucleus (16Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 17McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Importantly, although 14-3-3 binding appears to be essential for HDAC4 to undergo nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking in response to CaMKIV, this binding is clearly not required for the nuclear import of HDAC4 and not essential for HDAC4 to function as a transcriptional repressor (Fig. 4 D). It is possible that a CaMKIV-mediated phosphorylation event may promote the interaction of the HDAC4·14-3-3 complex with the Crm-1 export machinery and lead to efficient nuclear export. If HDAC4 is a direct target of CaMKIV, 14-3-3 binding might play a permissive role to render HDAC4 competent to respond to the nuclear export machinery upon HDAC4 phosphorylation, possibly by functioning as a scaffold protein (reviewed in Ref. 18Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, we note that in vitro, CaMKIV can phosphorylate HDAC4 on the residues other than the two involved in 14-3-3 binding (data not shown). Alternatively, CaMKIV may phosphorylate other proteins important for HDAC4 subcellular localization. For example, it has been reported that CaMKIV can directly phosphorylate MEF-2 (19Blaeser F. Ho N. Prywes R. Chatila T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is possible that this phosphorylation event might be sufficient to dissociate the MEF-2·HDAC4 complex and mobilize HDAC4 out of the nucleus. The identification of the “second” phosphorylation event by CaMKIV will be key to substantiate a two-step phosphorylation model and fully understand how HDAC4 subcellular localization is regulated. Surprisingly, our results reveal a dramatic difference between the subcellular localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 despite their extensive sequence homology. Even though both HDAC4 and HDAC5 can be regulated by nuclear export, the subcellular localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 is clearly distinguishable (Fig. 1). Under the identical experimental conditions, the majority of HDAC5 is localized in the nucleus while a significant portion of HDAC4 is localized in the cytoplasm. Although the exact molecular basis underlying this difference is not clear, we have found that, similar to HDAC4, HDAC5 also contains an autonomous export domain. 4T.-S. Liao and T.-P. Yao, unpublished observation. The regulatory domains of HDAC4 and HDAC5, however, could be differentially phosphorylated, which then determine their ability to associate with 14-3-3 and ultimately their respective subcellular localization. Consistent with this hypothesis, although HDAC4 binds 14-3-3 constitutively, it has been reported that ectopically expressed HDAC5 does not ((17), Fig. 4 E and data not shown). Recently, it was reported that an active form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) is capable of promoting HDAC5·14-3-3 binding and leads to HDAC5 export in cultured cells (17McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Based on the two-step phosphorylation model that we proposed for HDAC4, it is possible that active CaMKI can play both roles for HDAC5 and induce both 14-3-3 binding as well as nuclear export. Regardless of the details, the different subcellular localization of HDAC4 and -5 suggests that these two closely related proteins may be regulated by different mechanisms and consequently may be involved in different biological functions. By studying both endogenous and stably, ectopically expressed HDAC4 in C2C12 cells, we have obtained evidence that subcellular localization of HDAC4 is uniquely and dynamically regulated during muscle differentiation. The analysis of HDAC4 and HDAC5 subcellular localization during C2C12 myoblast differentiation yielded another surprise in which we observed HDAC4 and HDAC5 to be present in nuclei of the terminally differentiated myotubes. We have found that C2C12 cells stably producing a high level of HDAC4 or HDAC5 can differentiate, express differentiation markers such as myogenin (data not shown) and MHC, and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1,F–G, I–J, and L–M). In fact, we routinely see high levels of HDAC5 and myogenin co-expressed in the same nuclei as early as 24 h after the differentiation process is initiated (data not shown). Importantly, the nuclear translocation (or retention) of HDAC4 seems unlikely to be an event secondary to cell cycle arrest, as HDAC4 remains predominantly in the cytoplasm of serum-starved, quiescent NIH3T3 cells. 5T. A. Bolger and T.-P. Yao, unpublished observation. Rather, we speculate that HDAC4 and HDAC5 must reside in the nucleus during certain stages of myogenesis to facilitate terminal differentiation. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that C2C12 cells overexpressing HDAC4 tend to form large myotubes, which often contract vigorously in contrast to control C2C12 cells (Fig. 1, K–M, and data not shown). We note that our result is not in agreement with that reported by Lu et al. (1Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) in which nuclear HDAC4 and HDAC5 were shown to suppress C2C12 differentiation. This discrepancy could be due to the levels of ectopically expressed HDAC4 and HDAC5. Because only a single copy of infected gene is stably integrated per cell by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer while typically multiple integration events are achieved by transfection, it is possible that HDAC4 or -5 is expressed at much higher levels in the transfection system used by Luet al. Extremely high levels of HDAC4 or -5 may dominantly inhibit C2C12 differentiation. In any case, the presence of nuclear HDAC4 and -5 in terminally differentiated muscle cells is not consistent with the simple model that nuclear HDAC4 or -5 suppresses myogenesis. It is possible that nuclear HDAC4 is required to suppress the expression of certain genes for terminal muscle differentiation to proceed normally. Alternatively, nuclear HDAC4 might catalyze the deacetylation of non-histone proteins important in regulating C2C12 differentiation (20Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although further studies will be needed to address these intriguing possibilities, our observations suggest a complex mode of regulation of the subcellular localization of HDAC4, which might play an important role in muscle differentiation. In summary, we have shown that differential subcellular localization of HDAC4 can be controlled by a series of specific phosphorylation events. Based on our results, we propose a model (Fig. 4 F) in which HDAC4 is constitutively phosphorylated by an unknown kinase. This phosphorylation leads to 14-3-3 binding. The nuclear HDAC4·14-3-3 complex but not HDAC4 alone can then respond to additional phosphorylation events mediated by other kinases, such as CaMKIV, in response to the initiation of specific signaling cascades. The second phosphorylation event may allow the interaction of HDAC4·14-3-3 with the Crm-1 export machinery, resulting in its efficient export from the nucleus.

S1P activates the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), associated with eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179, a site phosphorylated by protein kinase Akt. We explored the proximal signaling pathways that mediate Akt activation and eNOS regulation by S1P/EDG receptors. Akt is regulated by the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K). We found that bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) express both α and β isoforms of PI3-K, while lacking the γ isoform. S1P treatment led to the rapid and isoform-specific activation of PI3-Kβ in BAEC. PI3-Kβ can be regulated by G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ). The overexpression of a peptide inhibitor of Gβγ attenuated S1P-induced eNOS enzyme activation, as well as S1P-induced phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt. In contrast, bradykinin, a classical eNOS agonist, neither activated any PI3-K isoform nor induced eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179, despite activating eNOS in BAEC. Vascular endothelial growth factor activated both PI3-Kα and PI3-Kβ via tyrosine kinase pathways and promoted eNOS phosphorylation that was unaffected by Gβγ inhibition. These findings indicate that PI3-Kβ (regulated by Gβγ) may represent a novel molecular locus for eNOS activation by EDG receptors in vascular endothelial cells.

The enzyme activity of PI3-K in BAEC was determined in vitro essentially as described previously (28Hayashi K. Saga H. Chimori Y. Kimura K. Yamanaka Y. Sobue K. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells in a 100-mm dish were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer comprising Tris (20 mm, pH 7.5), Nonidet P-40 (1% v/v), Na3VO4 (1 mm), NaF (50 mm), NaCl (137 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm) and CaCl2 (1 mm), supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (as described in Ref. 31Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Harvested cells were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with rocking and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The protein concentration in the resulting supernatant was determined, and the samples were adjusted to an equal amount of cellular protein (750 μg) in a volume of 500 μl with lysis buffer. The cell lysate was then pre-cleared with 1.5 μg of the corresponding non-immune IgG plus protein A (or G)-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the pre-cleared lysate was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 1 h with 1.5 μg of antibody, followed by the addition of protein A (or G)-agarose beads. After being incubated further for 1 h, immunoprecipitates were extensively washed as described (28Hayashi K. Saga H. Chimori Y. Kimura K. Yamanaka Y. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28860-28867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine (Sigma) were dissolved in chloroform together and dried under nitrogen. The sample was then resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4), sonicated for 15 min and stored at −20 °C under nitrogen (PI/PS vesicle (28Hayashi K. Saga H. Chimori Y. Kimura K. Yamanaka Y.

The agarose beads containing immunoprecipitates (prepared as above) were mixed with an enzyme reaction solution (40 μl) containing HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.4), 20 μg of PI/PS vesicle, MgCl2 (5 mm), NaCl (40 mm), and EGTA (0.4 mm). G protein βγ subunit was diluted into a buffer containing Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.4), EGTA (1 mm), NaCl (100 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), and sodium deoxycholate (0.9% w/v). An aliquot (5 μl) of diluted Gβγ (or its vehicle) was added to the reaction mixture. The enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 20 μm ATP supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min with vigorous shaking, enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold 1 m HCl (100 μl) and chloroform/methanol (200 μl, 1:1 in v/v). After mixing and brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the upper (aqueous) phase was discarded. The resulting lower (organic) phase (35 μl/lane) was applied to a Whatman LK6D TLC plate that had been pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate as described (29Arcaro A. Volinia S. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.

The plate was then developed with a solvent system comprising chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:7, v/v). After being air-dried, the TLC plate was subjected to autoradiography. The RF value of lipid spots corresponding to phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PI(3)P, the principal product of PI3-K enzyme reaction) was ∼0.8 in this TLC system (30Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Van Obberghen E. Wymann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of autoradiograms were performed using a ChemiImager 4000 (Alpha Innotech). The degree of PI3-K activation was expressed as the fold increase of PI(3)P formation over basal. The preparation of cell lysates and immunoprecipitation of HA epitope-tagged eNOS protein were performed as described previously (13Bernier S.G. Haldar S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30707-30715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Protein expression and the degree of protein phosphorylation were assayed by Western blot analysis as described (6Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells labeled withl-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml) were stimulated by various concentrations of S1P (or vehicle) at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then scraped into 2 ml of solution containing 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mml-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mmEGTA, pH 5.5, followed by sonication. The sample was applied to Dowex 50WX8–400 column to separatel-[3H]citrulline. The flow-through fraction was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting;l-[3H]citrulline formation in the cells was expressed as femtomoles of l-[3H]citrulline produced per mg of cellular protein/min. Statistical differences were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's Ftest using STATVIEW II (Abacus Concepts). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In exploring the proximal signaling pathways that couple S1P-mediated activation of EDG receptors to the regulation of eNOS in BAEC, we first studied the expression of PI3-K isoforms in these cells. To enhance the sensitivity of detecting PI3-K isoforms, we used isoform-specific antibodies to immunoprecipitate PI3-Kα, PI3-Kβ, or PI3-Kγ, and then we performed lipid kinase activity assay using the immunoprecipitated enzymes (20Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12069-12073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Bony C. Roche S. Shuichi U. Sasaki T. Crackower M.A. Penninger J. Mano H. Puceat M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Note that the antibodies used in the present study have been shown to recognize specifically each PI3-K isoform by immunoprecipitation when used in lipid kinase activity assays but that the levels of PI3-K isoform expression are typically below the limit of detection by standard protein immunoblot techniques (20Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12069-12073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We used phosphatidylinositol as substrate for the PI3-K assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Following enzyme reaction, lipid products were separated by TLC and detected with autoradiography. When BAEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PI3-K isoforms PI3-Kα or PI3-Kβ, we detected significant formation of 32P-labeled PI(3)P, the principal PI3-K enzyme product (Fig. 1), demonstrating that these antibodies led to the immunoprecipitation of enzymatically active PI3-K molecules. When non-immune rabbit IgG was used for immunoprecipitation instead of anti-PI3-K antibodies, there was no PI(3)P formation (Fig.1). When BAEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-PI3-Kγ antibody, no PI(3)P formation was detectable. In order to avoid a false negative conclusion with the PI3-Kγ antibody, we transfected COS-7 cells with plasmid cDNA encoding PI3-Kγ, and we analyzed PI3-Kγ activity. We detected marked PI3-Kγ activity in the COS-7 cells transfected with PI3-Kγ but not in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that BAEC contain significant PI3-K enzyme activity associated with the PI3-Kα and PI3-Kβ isoforms but not with PI3-Kγ. Previous studies (15Vanhaesebroeck B.

Since BAEC lack the activity of PI3-Kγ isoform (Fig. 1), we speculated that S1P would activate PI3-Kβ in this cell type. To test this possibility, we performed time course and dose-response experiments using S1P in BAEC and then analyzed lipid kinase assays following immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to the PI3-Kβ isoform. S1P (100 nm) induced a marked increase in PI3-Kβ activation within 2 min, reaching a maximum ∼3-fold after 5 min (Fig.2A). PI3-Kβ activity gradually returned to base line by 60 min following S1P addition. Fig.2B shows the dose response of PI3-Kβ activity in immunoprecipitates derived from BAEC lysates prepared from cells treated with increasing concentrations of S1P for 5 min. The degree of PI3-Kβ enzyme activation elicited by S1P was dose-dependent with an apparent EC50 value of ∼30 nm (Fig. 2B), in good agreement with the EC50 of other responses elicited by S1P in endothelial cells (6Igarashi J.

These experiments establish that S1P induces rapid, reversible, and dose-dependent activation of PI3-Kβ in BAEC with an EC50 value in the physiologic range. Dihydro-S1P, an analogue of S1P that solely acts through EDG receptors (34Im D.S. Heise C.E. Ancellin N. O'Dowd B.F. Shei G.J. Heavens R.P. Rigby M.R. Hla T. Mandala S. McAllister G. George S.R. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14281-14286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), induced a similar degree of PI3-Kβ activation as did S1P (Fig. 2C). Conversely, when S1P was added not to cells, but only included in the reaction mixture of PI3-K activity assayin vitro (shown as “S1P post-hoc”), PI3-Kβ activity was not altered (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that PI3-Kβ activation by S1P is mediated by cell-surface (EDG) receptors, rather than by intracellular S1P targets (35Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). PI3-Kβ activation by S1P was abolished both by pertussis toxin and by the calcium chelator BAPTA (Fig. 2D), indicating that this pathway is dependent upon pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein pathways and involves an agonist-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration. In contrast, PI3-Kβ activation by S1P was insensitive to genistein, an inhibitor of a wide spectrum of tyrosine kinases, suggesting that S1P activates PI3-Kβ independently of genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase pathways (Fig. 2D). These results (Fig. 2D) implicate pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in the S1P-mediated regulation of PI3-Kβ. As the G protein βγ subunit, rather than Gα, may play a major role in the activation of PI3-Kβ (17Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T. J. Biol.

The reductase domain, similar to NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, can be further divided into two different flavin-containing domains: (a) the N terminus, FMN-containing portion, and (b) the C terminus FAD- and NADPH-binding portion. The crystal structure of the FAD/NADPH-containing domain of rat neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, complexed with NADP+, has been determined at 1.9 Å resolution. The protein is fully capable of reducing ferricyanide, using NADPH as the electron donor. The overall polypeptide fold of the domain is very similar to that of the corresponding module of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) and consists of three structural subdomains (from N to C termini): (a) the connecting domain, (b) the FAD-binding domain, and (c) the NADPH-binding domain. A comparison of the structure of the neuronal NOS FAD/NADPH domain and CYPOR reveals the strict conservation of the flavin-binding site, including the tightly bound water molecules, the mode of NADP+ binding, and the aromatic residue that lies at the re-face of the flavin ring, strongly suggesting that the hydride transfer mechanisms in the two enzymes are very similar. In contrast, the putative FMN domain-binding surface of the NOS protein is less positively charged than that of its CYPOR counterpart, indicating a different nature of interactions between the two flavin domains and a different mode of regulation in electron transfer between the two flavins involving the autoinhibitory element and the C-terminal 33 residues, both of which are absent in CYPOR.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 91-104Google Scholar). Three isoforms of NOS have been identified in mammals; neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) are constitutively expressed, and their activities are Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, whereas inducible NOS (iNOS) is independent of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Although the three isoforms share 50–60% sequence identity, they differ in size, intracellular location, and regulation. nNOS has a molecular mass of 165 kDa, is located in neurons in the brain and at neuromuscular junctions, and is involved in neurotransmission. eNOS has a molecular mass of 133 kDa, is present in vascular endothelial cells, and is involved in vascular homeostasis. iNOS has a molecular mass of 130 kDa, is located in macrophages, and is expressed only in response to endotoxin or inflammatory cytokines. A distinguishing feature of NOS is that the N-terminal half of the enzyme is the heme-binding domain (or oxygenase domain), similar to the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, and also contains pterin- and arginine-binding sites. The C-terminal half is the flavin-binding or reductase domain containing FAD-, FMN-, and NADPH-binding sites, as found in NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) (3Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). At the junction between these two domains is a calmodulin (CaM)-binding region. Due to the reversible binding of CaM, the constitutive isoforms (nNOS and eNOS) display Ca2+dependence in their enzymatic activities (4Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reductase domain can be further divided into two subdomains, each of which contains one of the two flavins. The FMN-containing subdomain is situated at the N terminus, and its amino acid sequence is similar to that of flavodoxin, whereas the C-terminal portion contains FAD- and NADPH-binding sites and is homologous to ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR). From the sequence alignments, Salerno et al. (7Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q.

It was proposed that this additional sequence of about 40 residues acts as an autoinhibitory element in the constitutive NOS isoforms that is released upon binding of Ca2+/CaM, as seen in other Ca2+/CaM-activated proteins, such as myosin light chain kinase.

In addition, removal of this insert greatly enhances the maximal activity of eNOS, which is the least active of the three isozymes. Another significant difference between NOS and CYPOR is that the NOS isozymes contain an additional 21–42-amino acid tail in the C terminus, not present in CYPOR and FNR, which shares about 42% sequence homology with the FAD/NADPH-binding domains of CYPOR and NOS. Roman et al. (11Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de La Garza M.A. Kim J.J.P. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Roman L.J.

Raman, manuscript in preparation.have been determined. All three structures are very similar to one another but have no similarities to known cytochrome P450 structures. The remarkable similarities among the structures of different NOS isoforms indicate that isoform-specific regulation of NO production is not obvious from the crystal structures of the heme domains alone. Furthermore, it emphasizes the role of the reductase domain in regulation of NO production in each of the three isoforms. To further investigate the isoform-specific modulation of NO production and its mechanism, knowledge of the structure of the reductase domain of all three isoforms is imperative. Although the structure of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, a close homolog of the NOS reductase domain, has been determined (16Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), structural determination of the NOS reductase domain has not been successful, presumably due to proteolysis during the crystallization process. To circumvent this problem, we initiated the x-ray structure determination of its most stable domain from proteolysis, which includes the FAD- and NADP(H)-binding subdomains. Here, we report the crystal structure of the FAD/NADPH-binding domain of rat nNOS (referred to hereafter as nNOS-FAD/NBD (nNOS FAD- andNADP+-binding domain that includes residues 963–1407)) obtained by limited trypsin treatment of the Escherichia coli-expressed holo protein. Rat nNOS was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (17Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, the procedure involved centrifugation of crude cell extract and affinity chromatography on a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was eluted with a buffer solution containing 2 mm 2′-AMP and 0.5 m NaCl. The heme-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated, and l-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin were added to final concentrations of 1 mm and 200 μm, respectively. The enzyme was further purified on a gel filtration column (Superose 6HR 10/30;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and peak fractions corresponding to nNOS dimers were collected. The purified holo nNOS was treated with immobilized trypsin (Sigma), and the cleaved nNOS protein was further purified on a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column. The flow-through fraction containing the heme domain (red) was saved for other uses. The material bound to the column (yellow; FAD/NADPH-binding domain) was eluted with 2′-AMP and further purified on a gel filtration chromatography column. The purified protein, nNOS-FAD/NBD, was subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The ability of nNOS-FAD/NBD to reduce cytochrome c and ferricyanide was studied as described previously (18Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Martasek P. Miller R.T. Roman L.J. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with the exception that all assays were performed in the presence of 0.25 m NaCl. The protein concentration was estimated based on the flavin content using an extinction coefficient of 21,600 m−1. Because of the effect of ionic strength on the reduction rates, parallel determinations were carried out in the presence and absence of 250 mm NaCl. Recombinant rat NADPH-CYPOR was prepared as described previously (20Djordjevic S. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Shea T. Camitta M.G. Masters B.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3214-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing (Beckman Porton LF 3000) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis (Voyager DEPRO; Applied Biosystems) were performed at the Protein Nucleic Acid Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The purified nNOS-FAD/NBD protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 30 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.3 mmNADP+. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C by mixing 1.5 μl of the protein solution with 1.2 μl of a precipitant solution (9% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.4 m sodium formate) and equilibrating against the precipitant solution. Small thin plate crystals appeared within 24 h and grew to their maximum size over 2 weeks. Crystals of size 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.01 mm were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (20% glycerol in 11% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.3 m sodium formate) for about 3 min before flash-freezing under a liquid nitrogen stream. The diffraction data were collected at 100K on a charge-coupled device detector (CCD Quantum 4) at beamline BioCARS 14BM-C at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL. The crystal-to-detector distance was 160 mm, and the oscillation angle for the data collection was 0.5°. A total of 360 frames were recorded covering 180° oscillation range, and the exposure time was 8 s/frame. The crystal diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution, and the data were processed with the DPS-MOSFLM (21Steller I. Bolotovsky R. Rossmann M.G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 30: 1036-1040Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and CCP4 (22Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Assuming one molecule/asymmetric unit, the calculated Matthews coefficient is 3.13 Å3/Da, corresponding to ∼60.7% solvent content. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table I. For biochemical characterization of the crystalline protein, several crystals from the crystallization dips were collected, washed with the reservoir solution, and dissolved in a buffer solution. This crystalline protein was analyzed for N-terminal sequencing and also subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis to determine the C-terminal sequence.Table IData collection statisticsDiffraction dataResolution range (Å)32.0–1.9 (2.0–1.9)1-aNumbers in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.No. of observations233747No. of unique reflections41327Data completeness (%)84.7 (69.7)〈I/ς〉17.5 (3.6)Rsym1-bRsym = ΣhΣi(‖Ihi − 〈Ih〉‖/ΣhΣi‖Ihi‖, where h are unique reflection indices, and iindicate symmetry equivalent indices.0.067 (0.405)Crystal parametersUnit cell dimensions (Å)a = 59.07, b = 64.37, c = 159.43Space groupP212121No. of molecules/asymmetric unit1Vm(Å3/Da)3.13Solvent content (%)60.651-a Numbers in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.1-b Rsym = ΣhΣi(‖Ihi − 〈Ih〉‖/ΣhΣi‖Ihi‖, where h are unique reflection indices, and iindicate symmetry equivalent indices.

The initial rotation/translation search gave an R value of 52.4% and a correlation coefficient of 18.4 for the data between 10.0 and 4.0 Å resolution. The subsequent rigid body refinement lowered theR value to 51.4% and increased the correlation coefficient to 31.4. This model was subsequently refined using the CNS program package (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Each cycle of refinement included maximum likelihood simulated annealing, conjugate-gradient minimization, and individual B-factor refinement. Bulk solvent correction was applied throughout the refinement process. All data within the resolution range of 30 to 1.9 Å were used for the refinement, excluding 8% of reflections randomly extracted for cross-validation (Rfree) purposes. After each round of refinement, the model was rebuilt using the TURBO-FRODO program (25Roussel A. Inisan A.G. Knoop-Mouthuy A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo, Version OpenGL:1. CNRS/Université-Marseille, Marseille, France1999Google Scholar). Simulated annealing omit maps were used to locate the peptide regions that have different conformations from the CYPOR structure. After six rounds of refinement and rebuilding, refinement converged with an Rfree of 20.9% and an Rwork of 18.8% for all data lying between the 32.0 and 1.9 Å resolution range. The final model contains 435 amino acid residues, a FAD and a NADP+, 462 water molecules, and 4 glycerol and 4 formate molecules. A Ramachandran plot showed that 89.7% of all residues lie in the most favored regions, with 9.3% in additionally allowed regions and 1.1% in generously allowed regions.

Open table in a new tab Purified nNOS-FAD/NBD protein is bright yellow in color and exhibits a spectrum typical of flavoproteins (Fig. 1). The protein was at least 95% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, with an estimated molecular mass of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1, inset). The N-terminal sequence is Ser-Trp-Lys-Arg-Asn … , suggesting that trypsin cleavage occurred at the Arg962-Ser963bond of the rat neuronal NOS holoenzyme. The crystalline protein has the same N-terminal sequence, indicating that no further proteolysis had occurred, at least at the N terminus, during the crystallization process. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry result shows that the crystalline protein has a mass of 50,838 atomic mass units, indicating that the C terminus of the protein is Arg1407. This suggests that the C-terminal 22 amino acids have been cleaved, presumably by proteolysis during the limited trypsin treatment or possibly (but less likely) during the crystallization process. The ability of nNOS-FAD/NBD to reduce electron acceptors of different sizes was studied and compared with that of rat CYPOR (TableIII). The ability of nNOS-FAD/NBD to reduce cytochrome c is very low, but it is reproducible. To address this residual activity, diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH- and flavin-mediated electron transport, was employed (26Tew D.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10209-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); a 100–200 times molar excess of inhibitor over the enzyme results in only 20–25% inhibition of cytochrome c reduction (data not shown). On the other hand, the reaction was inhibited by 80% in the presence of both superoxide dismutase and catalase, suggesting that the low rate of cytochrome c reduction observed with nNOS-FAD/NBD is primarily superoxide-mediated. The ferricyanide activity of nNOS-FAD/NBD is about 20% higher than that of CYPOR, 33% lower than the reductase domain of nNOS, about the same as the full-length nNOS protein in the absence of CaM (data not shown), and about 57% and 67% of those for the nNOS full-length enzyme and the reductase domain of nNOS, respectively, in the presence of CaM. These results indicate that nNOS-FAD/NBD retains its ability to accept reducing equivalents from NADPH and to transfer them to FAD and to ferricyanide.Table IIInNOS-FAD/NADPH-binding domain-mediated activities with artificial electron acceptorsTurnover numbers (min−1)Cytochrome cFerricyanidenNOS-FAD/NBD97641nNOS (full-length)3-aData from Refs. 11 and 19.505013500nNOS-Red3-aData from Refs. 11 and 19., 3-bnNOS-Red, nNOS reductase domain containing the CaM-binding region.489811430CYPOR244062803-a Data from Refs. 11Roman L.J.

Open table in a new tab The final model of nNOS-FAD/NBD contains 435 residues starting from Ser963 to Val1397, and the last 10 C-terminal residues are disordered, suggesting the flexible nature of this terminus. The overall polypeptide fold is, as expected, essentially the same as that of the corresponding domain of CYPOR. The structure is composed of three subdomains, as in the case of the CYPOR structure (16Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and these subdomains, from N to C termini (Fig. 2, from bottom to top), are as follows: (a) the connecting domain, (b) the FAD-binding domain, and (c) the NADP(H)-binding domain. The connecting domain is not contiguous in the linear amino acid sequence, as it is in the CYPOR structure. The root mean square (rms) difference for the Cα atoms in the FAD-binding and NADP+-binding domains is 1.3 Å between the structures of the two enzymes, excluding the insertion/deletion regions and the entire connecting domain. Fig. 3 shows a ribbon diagram of a superposition of the two structures. The NADP+-binding domain is shown on the right, the FAD-binding domain is shown in the middle, and the connecting domain is shown on the left. The connecting domain shows the most difference from the structure of the corresponding domain of CYPOR (rms difference, 3.9 Å), reflecting the lower sequence homology in this part of the molecule. The structure of the two nucleotide-binding domains, the FAD- and NADP(H)-binding domains, is also very similar to that of FNR (27Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R.

Two regions in the nNOS-FAD/NBD structure that differ significantly from CYPOR are marked: the N-terminal β-loop-helix (residues 963–989) is indicated by an asterisk, and the β-finger (residues Asn1070-Lys1080) is indicated by anarrow. Both of these regions most likely provide the interactions with the FMN domain that differ from the CYPOR structure. This figure was prepared with Molscript (34Kraulis J. J. Appl.

The N terminus of the only α-helix in this subdomain (α1 in Fig. 4) caps one end of the β-barrel, and its N terminus is pointing to the pyrophosphate group of FAD, stabilizing the negative charge with its helix dipole (Fig. 2). The FAD has an extended conformation, and its pyrophosphate group also makes a hydrogen bond to the positively charged Arg1173 (figure not shown). The isoalloxazine ring of FAD is bound at the interface between the FAD and NADPH domains (Fig. 2). Just as in the structure of CYPOR, the pyrimidine side of the isoalloxazine ring has extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with the polypeptide and with two tightly bound water molecules (Fig.5). The O2 atom of the isoalloxazine ring makes hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of Ala1193(amide nitrogen) and Thr1191 (carbonyl oxygen), the latter of which, in turn, makes a hydrogen bond with the N3 atom of FAD. The N1 atom of the FAD ring is involved in this hydrogen-bonding network via a water molecule (W1 in Fig. 5) to the carbonyl oxygen of Ala1193, the O2 atom, and the 4′-OH group of the ribityl chain. The O4 atom of the isoalloxazine ring is also linked to Thr1191 via another water molecule (W2). This intricate network of hydrogen bonds must play an important role in FAD binding/orientation and is likely to be crucial in stabilizing semiquinone/hydroquinone forms of FAD during electron transfer from NADPH to FAD and from FAD to FMN. The residues implicated in the hydride transfer reaction in CYPOR (30Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) are also structurally conserved in nNOS-FAD/NBD; the hydroxyl group of Ser1176(corresponding to Ser457 of CYPOR) makes hydrogen bonds to Asp1393 (Asp675 of CYPOR) and the O4 atom of the flavin ring, is located near the N5 atom of FAD (3.7 Å), and is coplanar with the isoalloxazine ring. The carboxylate of Asp1393 makes a hydrogen bond with His1032 (2.8 Å; His319 in CYPOR) and is near Cys1349(3.7Å; Cys630 in CYPOR). On the other hand, the xylene ring side of FAD is exposed to the surface of the molecule, strongly suggesting that in the holoenzyme, the FMN domain would interact through this side and receive the reducing equivalents from FAD. The FAD ring is sandwiched between two aromatic rings, Phe1395at its re-face and Tyr1175 at thesi-face, serving as stacking residues. Similar to the NADP+ d"
https://openalex.org/W1989314193,"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a newly discovered oxygen-binding heme protein that is primarily expressed in the brain of humans and other vertebrates. To characterize the structure/function relationships of this new heme protein, we have used resonance Raman spectroscopy to determine the structure of the heme environment in Ngb from mice. In the Fe2+CO complex, two conformations of the Fe–CO unit are present, one of which arises from an open conformation of the heme pocket in which the CO is not interacting with any nearby residue, and the other arises from a closed conformation where a positively charged residue near the CO group stabilizes the complex. For the Fe2+O2 complex, we detect a single νFe-OO stretching mode at a frequency similar to that of oxymyoglobins and oxyhemoglobins of vertebrates (571 cm−1). Based on the Fe-C-O frequencies of the closed conformation of Ngb, a highly polar distal environment is indicated from which the O2 off-rate is predicted to be lower than that of Mb. In the absence of exogenous ligands, a heme pocket residue coordinates to the heme iron, forming a six-coordinate complex, thereby predicting a low on-rate for exogenous ligands. These structural properties of the heme pocket of Ngb are discussed with respect to its proposed in vivo oxygen delivery function.

It is believed to be used as a short term reservoir of oxygen in working muscles and also to facilitate oxygen diffusion to the mitochondria for respiration (1Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Another function was recently proposed for Mb as a scavenger of nitric oxide (NO). This reaction might be important to avoid the inhibition of the respiratory chain in skeletal and cardiac muscles by NO (2Brunori M. Trends Biochem.

Recently, a new gene encoding a globin, different from Mb and Hb, was cloned from mouse and human cDNA libraries (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Since the gene is expressed primarily in the brain, the corresponding protein was termed neuroglobin (Ngb). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ngb forms a class distinct from the Mbs and Hbs of vertebrates, showing that it is an ancient protein that was present long before the divergence of the genes encoding Mb and Hb. The closest relative of Ngb today appears to be the globins of the annelid Aphrodite, which are also expressed in nerve cells in this animal. The affinity for oxygen of mouse recombinant Ngb is moderate, 2 torrs, about 2-fold lower than that of Mb but higher than that of Hb. It was proposed that Ngb could have a function similar to Mb and serve to diffuse oxygen to the mitochondria in order to increase the oxygen availability to the neurons (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar).The primary amino acid sequence of Ngb is only 21–25% identical to that of Mb and Hb (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, according to multiple sequence alignment, key amino acid residues that are required for the function of these proteins and are conserved among a great variety of globins are present in the primary amino acid sequence of Ngb: namely a proximal histidine residue that coordinates to the heme (helical position F8), a distal histidine residue that might be involved in interactions with heme-bound ligands (E7), and a phenylalanine residue at CD1 that is involved in π-π interactions with the heme (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The environment experienced by heme-bound ligands is critical for the function of globins as it controls the kinetics of ligand association and dissociation from the heme and also the kinetics of oxidation/reduction reactions occurring at the heme site. We present here a detailed characterization of the heme environment in Ngb using Raman spectroscopy, which is a very powerful technique that provides information about the axial ligands of the heme and the overall environment of the heme pocket. We discuss our results with respect to the kinetic properties of Ngb and the proposed function of this heme protein.DISCUSSIONWe report here the first detailed characterization of the heme pocket structure of mouse Ngb and discuss our results with respect to the proposed oxygen carrying function of this protein that is primarily expressed in the brain. The elucidation of the mode of ligand binding of Ngb is important to understand the role of this protein in the vertebrate nervous system.Axial Ligands to the HemeWe have shown that the ferric and ferrous forms of Ngb differ from those of Mb as an endogenous ligand coordinates to the heme iron, making the heme six-coordinate and low spin. This ligand, most probably an amino acid residue of the polypeptide chain, remains coordinated to the iron over a wide range of pH values, from 5 to 10. The His64 residue of Ngb, predicted to occupy the distal position (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), might be involved in the formation of the six-coordinate structures of the ferric and ferrous heme. Globins of vertebrates, like Mb and Hb, are normally six-coordinate and high spin in the ferric state, with a water molecule coordinated to the iron and five-coordinate in the ferrous form, which leaves the sixth position empty and ready for the binding of exogenous ligands such as CO and oxygen. However, hexacoordinate low spin forms of ferric and ferrous globins are frequently observed for the globins of invertebrates (12Couture M. Das T.K. Savard P.Y. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J.B.

As might be expected, for several of these hexacoordinate heme proteins, the presence of a sixth ligand to the iron interferes with exogenous ligand binding (8Das T.K. Lee H.C. Duff S.M. Hill R.D.

Ngb is not an exception, and the exogenous ligand on-rate would be expected to depend on the dissociation of the endogenous sixth ligand. However, our tentative assignment of the Fe–His stretching mode of 225 cm−1 is consistent with very little strain on the Fe–His bond and would suggest a high on-rate for exogenous ligands in the five-coordinate form.Recently, kinetic studies of O2 and CO binding to human Ngb were reported by two groups. In the studies by Trent et al.(16Trent III, J.T. Watts R.A. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the on-rate for both O2 and CO in the five-coordinate heme was reported to be very high (130 μm−1s−1 for O2 and 38 μm−1 s−1 for CO as compared with 17 and 0.51 μm−1 s−1 for Mb, respectively). Similar values were found by Dewilde et al. 2S. Dewilde, L. Kiger, T. Burmester, T. Hankeln, V. Baudin-Creuza, T. Aerts, M. C. Marden, R. Caubergs and L. Moens, submitted for publication. for both human and mouse Ngb. These on-rates for Ngb are consistent with the conclusions drawn from our Raman results based on the absence of strain in the Fe–His bond. The equilibrium constant for the endogenous ligand binding to the ferrous heme was reported by Trent et al.(16Trent III, J.T. Watts R.A. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to be close to 1, thereby predicting nearly equal populations of the five- and six-coordinate forms and a very high overall affinity. In contrast, Dewilde et al.2 found that in both mouse and human Ngb, the endogenous ligand off-rate is much smaller than the on-rate, resulting in the predominance of a six-coordinate species. Our Raman data, in which we find only a six-coordinate low spin form in the exogenous ligand-free ferrous preparation, is consistent with the observations of Dewilde et al.2A confirmation of histidine as the proximal ligand is revealed by the analysis of the Fe2+CO complex. It is well known that there is an inverse correlation between the frequencies of the νFe-CO stretching modes and the frequencies of the νC-O stretching modes of heme proteins and heme model compounds (17Park K.D. Guo K.M. Adebodun F. Chiu M.L. Sligar S.G. Oldfield E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2333-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Ray G.B. Li X.Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As a result of this relation, which arises from the π-electron back-donation from the dπ(dxz,dyz) orbitals of Fe to the empty π* orbitals of CO, the bond order between iron and CO increases as the bond order between the carbon and oxygen atoms of CO decreases and vice versa. Depending on the nature of the proximal ligand or the absence of a fifth ligand, different correlation lines are observed due to differences in the charge on the iron atoms that are reflected in the strength of the Fe–CO bond (20Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4595-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on the νFe-CO versus νC-O correlation of many heme proteins, shown in Fig. 6, we propose that the νFe-CO stretching mode at 523 cm−1 for Ngb is associated with the νC-Ostretching mode at 1933 cm−1 and that the νFe-CO stretching mode at 492 cm−1 is associated with the νC-O stretching mode at 1969 cm−1. When plotted on a νFe-COversus νC-O correlation curve, these frequencies fall on the line observed for heme proteins having a histidine residue as their proximal ligand (Fig. 6). This shows that in Ngb, the fifth ligand to the heme is the imidazole side chain of a histidine residue. According to sequence alignment (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), this residue is most probably His96 of the polypeptide chain predicted to occupy position F8.Fe2+COCO is a particularly suitable probe to study the environment of the heme, since it is very sensitive to electrostatic and steric interactions with surrounding groups (21Phillips G.N.J. Teodoro M.L. Li T. Smith B. Olson J.S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 8817-8829Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of CO to electrostatic interactions arises from its lone pair of electrons that is delocalized when CO is near charged groups. When CO is near a positively charged group, a Fe=C=O–X+ structure is stabilized, in which the Fe–CO and C–O bonds have a double bond character while near a negatively charged group, a Fe–C≡Oδ+–X− structure is stabilized, in which the Fe–CO bond tends toward a single bond character, and the C–O bond tends toward a triple bond character (21Phillips G.N.J. Teodoro M.L. Li T. Smith B. Olson J.S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 8817-8829Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For Ngb, a form of the Fe2+CO complex, with νFe-CO and νC-O at 523 and 1933 cm−1, respectively, is assigned to a closed conformation, where a positively charged group(s) near the CO stabilizes a (Fe=C=O–X+) structure. The frequency of the νFe-CO stretching mode for this closed conformation (523 cm−1) is higher than that of Mb (507 cm−1), suggesting that the polarity of the environment of the distal side in Ngb is greater than in Mb. One residue interacting more strongly with CO (as in barley Hb, where a strong hydrogen bond between the distal histidine residue and the CO is responsible for the very high frequency of the νFe-CO stretching mode (8Das T.K. Lee H.C. Duff S.M. Hill R.D. Peisach J. Rousseau D.L. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4207-4212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Table II)) or more than one residue interacting with CO (as in Ascaris Hb, where the B10 tyrosine and E7 glutamine residues provide hydrogen bonds to the heme-bound CO (19Das T.K. Friedman J.M. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Table II)) may explain the higher frequency of the νFe-CO stretching mode in Ngb as compared with Mb. This residue(s) stabilizing CO in the heme pocket of Ngb may be the imidazole side chain of His64 predicted to occupy the distal (E7) position and/or Lys67 that is predicted to occupy the E11 position. Two other charged residues, Asp63and Arg66, predicted to occupy the E6 and E9 positions with respect to the structure of Mb, respectively, are not expected to point toward the iron and stabilize heme-bound ligands. Our results show that the distal residue(s), giving rise to the closed conformation of the Fe–CO complex, remains in proximity to the heme-bound CO in the pH range 4.5–12, since there is no significant change in the ratio of the relative intensity of the two νFe-CO stretching modes in this pH range. For other heme proteins in which two conformations of the CO complex were observed, such as the flavohemoglobin of E. coli (22Mukai M. Mills C.E. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and barley Hb (8Das T.K. Lee H.C. Duff S.M. Hill R.D. Peisach J. Rousseau D.L. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4207-4212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), changes in the ratio of the two conformations of the Fe2+CO complexes were shown to accompany changes of pH due to the protonation/deprotonation of distal groups. In Ngb, the polar interactions with the CO molecule are not modified in the pH 4.5–12 range.The second Fe2+CO form in Ngb has a νFe-COstretching mode at 492 cm−1 and a νC-Ostretching mode at 1969 cm−1. By analogy to Mb at low pH, where the distal histidine becomes protonated and swings out of the pocket (νFe-CO at 488 cm−1 and νC-O at 1967 cm−1; Table I) and the H64G mutant of Mb (νFe-CO at 492 cm−1 and νC-O at 1965 cm−1; Table I), the form of Ngb with νFe-CO at 492 cm−1 and νC-O at 1969 cm−1 is assigned to an open structure where no group is close enough to the CO to affect the electronic structure of the Fe–C–O unit. The presence of this second, open conformation of the CO complex in Ngb indicates that the distal residue(s) close to the CO group, which give rise to the conformation with a high frequency of the νFe-CO stretching mode, can adopt either of two orientations, one of which is pointing away from the heme, or that there are two orientations of the Fe–C–O unit with respect to the distal residues. This latter possibility is less likely, however, since the Fe–C–O moiety generally adopts a near linear orientation.Fe2+O2 ComplexThe strong interaction of the CO group with a surrounding residue in a large fraction of Ngb suggests that this residue may also help stabilize the oxygen molecule of the Fe2+O2 complex. Our resonance Raman studies revealed that the frequency of the νFe-OOstretching mode of Ngb is similar to that of Mb (Table II). It is known that oxygen is less sensitive than CO to electrostatic interactions. Because electron density from the reduced iron is delocalized toward the oxygen so that the structure of the oxy complex has a Fe3+O2− character (23Hirota S. Li T. Phillips Jr, G.N. Olson J.S. Mukai M. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7845-7846Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the presence or absence of a hydrogen bond between a distal residue and the terminal oxygen of the heme-bound oxygen molecule does not change significantly the frequency of the νFe-OO stretching mode (23Hirota S. Li T. Phillips Jr, G.N. Olson J.S. Mukai M. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7845-7846Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, for Ngb, the identification of the νFe-OOstretching mode by itself cannot reveal if the oxygen is stabilized through hydrogen bonding interactions. However, it reveals that the oxygen is most probably not stabilized through hydrogen bonding interactions with the proximal oxygen atom, since the frequency of the νFe-OO stretching mode would appear at a much lower frequency such as for the Hbs of Chlamydomonas eugametos (24Das T.K. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Paramecium caudatum (25Das T.K. Weber R.E. Dewilde S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14330-14340Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), andMycobacterium tuberculosis (26Yeh S.R. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on our characterization of the CO complex, which reveal a strong interaction between a distal residue and CO, we propose that in Ngb, the heme-bound oxygen is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the terminaloxygen atom.Phillips et al. (20Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4595-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have shown that the Fe–C–O vibrational frequencies can be correlated with the electrostatic properties of the distal pocket and used to predict the stabilization of other ligands such as oxygen. Based on this correlation, we predict that the O2 off-rate of Ngb is lower than that of Mb and could differ by as much as an order of magnitude. This is consistent with the measured off-rates reported by Dewilde et al.2 and Trent et al. (16Trent III, J.T. Watts R.A. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), in which the O2 off-rates are lower than that of myoglobin by over an order of magnitude. On the other hand, the on-rate will depend on the rate of the displacement of the sixth ligand in the ferrous state and thus is predicted to be low, although the kinetic measurements of the endogenous ligand binding are not in agreement as discussed above. Ngb was proposed to help maintain an adequate supply of oxygen to the neurons in localized areas of the brain (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). We propose that if Ngb molecules are present in sufficiently high local concentration in neurons or surrounding cells, they could act as local reservoirs (27Wittenberg J.B. Mangum C.P. Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology. 13. Springer-Verlag, New York1992: 59-85Google Scholar) to augment oxygen supply to meet the increased oxygen demand that might occur during neural activity. The small rate of oxygen dissociation that we predict for Ngb may help establish and maintain the oxygenated state of the protein, thus ensuring the availability of oxygen for utilization by mitochondria under conditions of high oxygen demand. Myoglobin (Mb)1 is a protein of conserved structure and function that is found in the skeletal and heart muscles of vertebrates. It is believed to be used as a short term reservoir of oxygen in working muscles and also to facilitate oxygen diffusion to the mitochondria for respiration (1Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Another function was recently proposed for Mb as a scavenger of nitric oxide (NO). This reaction might be important to avoid the inhibition of the respiratory chain in skeletal and cardiac muscles by NO (2Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 21-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3Flögel U. Merx M.W. Gödecke A. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This reaction could also contribute to the overall homeostasis of NO in the body (3Flögel U. Merx M.W. Gödecke A. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recently, a new gene encoding a globin, different from Mb and Hb, was cloned from mouse and human cDNA libraries (4Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Since the gene is expressed primarily in the brain, the corresponding protein was termed neuroglobin (Ngb). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ngb forms a class distinct from the Mbs and Hbs of vertebrates, showing that it is an ancient protein that was present long before the divergence of the genes encoding Mb and Hb. The closest relative of Ngb today appears to be the globins of the annelid Aphrodite, which are also expressed in nerve cells in this animal. The affinity for oxygen of mouse recombinant Ngb is moderate, 2 torrs, about 2-fold lower than that of Mb but higher than that of Hb.

The presence of even one unrepaired break can lead to death of the cell (1Game J.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 73-83PubMed Google Scholar). TheRAD50 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of several genes from the RAD52 epistasis group required for recombinational repair of DSBs during vegetative growth (2Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for initiation of meiotic recombination (3Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Rad50 forms a complex with two other proteins, Mre11 and Xrs2, and this complex is involved in DSB formation and processing (4Johzuka K. Ogawa H. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Usui T. Ohta T. Oshiumi H. Tomizawa J. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1998; 95: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The core of this complex is thought to be Rad50·Mre11, as these two proteins are well conserved and have identifiable homologs in species from archaea to humans (6Connelly J.C. Kirkham L.A. Leach D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D. Fairley C. Tainer J.A. Carney J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6036-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Xrs2 and its human counterpart, NBS-1, are not significantly homologous except at their N terminus, and no corresponding protein has been found in prokaryotes. In both yeast and humans, Rad50·Mre11 are known to participate in detection of DSBs, activation of cell cycle checkpoints (through Xrs2/NBS-1), and repair of DSBs (8Petrini J.H. Bressan D.A. Yao M.S.

In mammals, both Rad50 and Mre11 are essential for life. A Rad50 knockout mouse is embryonic lethal, with early embryonic cells showing hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (10Luo G. Yao M.S. Bender C.F. Mills M. Bladl A.R. Bradley A. Petrini J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7376-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cre-LoxP conditional deletion of Mre11 in mouse embryonic stem cells shows that it is also essential (11Xiao Y. Weaver D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and conditional Mre11-null chicken DT40 cells accumulate chromosome breaks and die rapidly (12Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Morrison C. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita Y.M. Yagi T. Takata M. Price C. Kakazu N. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6619-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Mutations in members of this complex in humans are also associated with several disease states. Mutations in NBS-1 cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome, characterized by chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition, immunodeficiency, and hypersensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation (13Varon R. Vissinga C. Platzer M. Cerosaletti K.M. Chrzanowska K.H. Saar K. Beckmann G. Seemanova E. Cooper P.R. Nowak N.J. Stumm M. Weemaes C.M. Gatti R.A. Wilson R.K. Digweed M. Rosenthal A. Sperling K.

Mutation of hMre11 has been shown to be responsible for an ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder, similarly characterized by chromosomal instability, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, and radioresistant DNA synthesis (14Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Specific biochemical activities have been identified for members of the Rad50·Mre11·Xrs2(NBS-1) complex. Rad50, a coiled-coil protein (153 kDa in yeast), binds ATP and shows ATP-dependent DNA binding (15Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 16Raymond W.E. Kleckner N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3851-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mre11 (78 kDa in yeast) is known to have 3′-5′ exonuclease and single-stranded endonuclease activities (17Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 18Furuse M. Nagase Y. Tsubouchi H. Murakami-Murofushi K. Shibata T. Ohta K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6412-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The related complex in Escherichia coli, SbcCD, has been shown to have similar activities, although the exonuclease activity of SbcD is ATP-dependent (6Connelly J.C. Kirkham L.A. Leach D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These nuclease functions are relevant to the generation of 3′ single-stranded DNA tails, which act as intermediate species in homologous recombination. Biochemical activities of Xrs2 (96 kDa in yeast) and NBS-1 are not known, but NBS-1 is essential for Mre11 phosphorylation in the human complex and enhances DNA unwinding and endonuclease cleavage of fully paired hairpins by hRad50·hMre11 (19Dong Z. Zhong Q. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19513-19516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Rad50, E. coli SbcC, and archaeal Rad50 are distantly related members of the SMC protein family and share the same predicted structural features: a globular N terminus, two long coiled-coil segments with a hinge domain between them, and a C-terminal globular domain. SMC proteins are known to form antiparallel dimers (21Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). Walker A and B ATP-binding motifs (22Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) are found in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, which are brought together by the antiparallel dimer structure. The C-terminal domain has been shown to be important for DNA binding activity (23Saleh A.Z.M. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Ogura T. Yamazoe M. Hiraga S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 211-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Akhmedov A.T. Frei C. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Kemper B. Gasser S.M. Jessberger R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 38216-38224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An important difference in Rad50-related proteins is that the hinge domain is predicted to be much smaller than in SMCs: ∼30 aa in the case of ScRad50 compared with ∼150 aa for SMCs (Fig. 1C). There are also marked differences in the conserved sequence elements in the hinge. SMC proteins have several conserved glycines in the hinge domain, which have been shown to be important for structure and function (26Hirano M. Anderson D.E. Erickson H.P. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3238-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Rad50-related proteins do not have these glycines, but they have a distinct CPXC motif, which is not found in SMCs (Fig. 1C). We wanted to determine if these differences affect the structural organization of the Rad50 dimer. Structural properties of Rad50 and Mre11 homologs from the archaeonPyrococcus furiosus have recently been described in great detail. The crystal structure of a complex of the Rad50 N and C termini was determined by x-ray diffraction (15Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the Mre11 homolog was also determined (27Hopfner K. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These studies showed that, when coexpressed, the globular N and C termini of Rad50 fold into a single catalytic domain, supporting the hypothesis that Rad50 has an antiparallel structure like SMCs. A 1:1 stoichiometry was demonstrated for the Rad50·Mre11 complex, and their probable sites of interaction were identified. EM studies of SMC proteins have shown two basic conformations: the open-V, where the catalytic domains are up to 100 nm apart, and the heads together conformation, where the catalytic domains are in contact and the coiled-coils are either apart forming an elliptical shape or together in a straight, folded rod (21Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Bacterial and archaeal Rad50/SbcC have also been visualized by EM (6Connelly J.C. Kirkham L.A. Leach D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Alone, theE. coli SbcC and Pyrococcus Rad50 dimers showed predominantly an open-V, or “headphone,” conformation. However, in the most recent study of archaeal Rad50, electron microscopy showed that Rad50 bound to Mre11 was mostly in the folded rod conformation. Here we provide an EM study of a eukaryotic Rad50, with a particular emphasis on the hinge and the conformation of the molecule. We also map the binding location of the nuclease Mre11 along the Rad50 dimer. Similarities and differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic Rad50s are noted. Plasmids pR50.1 and pM11.1 were generated by subcloning the RAD50 andMRE11 genes, respectively, into pPM231 (2μ, GAL-PGK, LEU-2d). Upon introduction of these plasmids into the protease-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, BJ5464 (MAΤα ura3–52 trp1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prbΔ1.6R can1), large scale cultures were grown to stationary phase using fresh transformants in −Leu omission media, followed by a 12–24-h induction period in starvation media containing 2% galactose. After induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and checked for expression by SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting versus cells harboring pPM231. The purification procedures will be described in greater detail elsewhere. 2K. Trujillo and P. Sung, submitted for publication. Yeast harboring pR50.1 were broken by French press and subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g; 90 min). The resulting soluble fraction was then subject to precipitation by ammonium sulfate at a concentration of 0.28 g/ml. After resuspending the precipitate in K buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 5.0 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors aprotinin, pepstatin A, chymostatin, leupeptin, PMSF, and benzamidine), Rad50 was purified to near homogeneity by column chromatography, including a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column, an Affi-Gel Blue column, a Macro-Hydroxyapatite (MHAP) column, a Sepharose 6B gel filtration column, and a Mono-Q column. Approximately 10 mg of purified Rad50 was obtained from 50 g of yeast paste using this procedure. Similarly, yeast harboring pM11.1 were lysed and centrifuged, and the resulting soluble fraction was precipitated with ammonium sulfate to a concentration of 0.28 g/ml. Mre11 was then purified to near homogeneity by column chromatography using a combination of Q-Sepharose, MHAP, Sephacryl-300, and Mono-S columns. Approximately 20 mg of purified Mre11 was obtained from 50 g of yeast paste using this procedure. Approximately 15 mg of Rad50 from the MHAP step was concentrated in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator and mixed on ice with a 2× molar excess (∼15 mg) of concentrated Mre11 protein from the Sephacryl-300 step. The mixture was placed on ice for 5 h to allow for complex formation. The resulting Rad50·Mre11 complex was then isolated from free Mre11 by gel filtration in a large Sepharose-6B column (200 ml), followed by fractionation on a Mono-S column. A fusion protein comprising an N-terminal FN7–10 (the 40-kDa cell adhesion domain of fibronectin) connected to the Rad50 coils (deleting the N- and C-terminal globular domains) was constructed as described by Melby et al. (21Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), except that it was cloned into pET15b to add an N-terminal His6 tag. Expression of the protein was induced in E. coli strain BL21. The expression level of the Rad50coils-FN construct was quite low, but Western blot analysis using anti-FN antibodies confirmed expression of the chimeric molecule (data not shown). Following purification on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), the peak fractions were concentrated ∼10-fold using a Centricon-100 device (Amicon), then passed over a Sephacryl HR-500 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0. The peak fractions were again concentrated in a Centricon-100 before loading onto glycerol gradients. Samples were centrifuged through ∼5-ml, 15–40% glycerol gradients in order to estimate sedimentation coefficients, provide further purification, and to transfer the proteins to a solution of high glycerol content, which is required for high quality rotary shadowing. After sedimentation at 38,000 rpm for 16 h at 20 °C (model SW55.1 rotor; Beckman Instruments), gradient fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Sedimentation coefficients were determined by linear interpolation of standard curves (28Erickson H.P. Briscoe G. Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Extracellular Matrix: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 187-198Google Scholar), constructed using proteins of known sedimentation coefficient (e.g. bovine serum albumin, 4.6 S; catalase, 11.3 S; thyroglobulin, 19 S), which were included in the same centrifugation run. Peak fractions from the glycerol gradients were identified by SDS-PAGE, and rotary-shadowed specimens were prepared as described previously (29Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Specimens were viewed under a transmission electron microscope (model 301; Philips Electron Optics) and photos taken at magnification of ∼50,000. Negatives were scanned at 600 dpi using an Agfa Arcus II scanner and imported into the program NIH Image, for measurement and analysis of the molecules. Images of rotary-shadowed Rad50 are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the Rad50 dimer appears to be a symmetrical molecule, with a globular domain at either end, separated by a long coiled-coil (Fig. 2A). The Rad50 coils are generally curved with the two arms of the dimer separated over their entire length; they do not adopt the folded rod conformation that was common for SMC and MukB (21Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and was also reported for archaeal Rad50 bound to Mre11 (27Hopfner K. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, the globular termini are often seen in close proximity, closing the arms of the dimer into an approximately elliptical structure (Fig. 2, Band C). Thus, the two catalytic domains appear to have an affinity for each other even in the absence of ATP. Two variations of the ends-together conformation are shown in rows B and C of Fig. 2. In B the catalytic domains are shadowed as a single globular structure, whereas inC they are resolved into individual domains. The separation in C may be due to the domains falling apart slightly as they attach to the mica surface after spraying (30Schürmann G. Haspel J. Grumet M. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1765-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Finally, the Rad50 molecules lack a prominent globular hinge domain, which was expected because of its short length (Fig. 1). The hinge does appear to be flexible, however, as most of the molecules are bent sharply at the center. This is in contrast to SbcC from E. coli and the Rad50 homolog from P. furiosus, which have been shown to adopt a more evenly curved “headphone” shape as uncomplexed dimers (6Connelly J.C. Kirkham L.A. Leach D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The globular termini of Rad50 appeared of equivalent size (Fig.2), consistent with Rad50 being an antiparallel dimer and thus a symmetrical molecule, like SMCs. To confirm that the coiled-coils of Rad50 are antiparallel, we fused the 40 kDa cell-adhesion domain of fibronectin (FN7–10) to the N terminus of a Rad50 coils-only construct where the N- and C-terminal globular domains were deleted (aa 180–1112, QAMKFTK … IEKNYHK). Rotary-shadowed images of this protein, expressed in E. coli, are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, the FN7–10 segment, which appears as a short, thick rod (∼15 nm × 3 nm) can be seen at either end of the dimer. If the coiled-coils were parallel, we would have seen two FN7–10 segments at one end and nothing at the other end of the coils. Thus, the coiled-coils of Rad50 must be antiparallel, as seen previously for MukB (21Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). With the EM structure of Rad50 alone established, we then attempted to investigate the structure of the Rad50·Mre11 DNA repair complex. However, the complex dissociated under our standard glycerol gradient conditions (0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH ∼8.3, 15–40% glycerol) (Fig. 4, top panel). After several trials, two factors important for maintenance of the complex were identified: solution pH and the addition of manganese (Mn2+). Manganese is an essential cofactor for Mre11 and all of its homologs for nuclease activity and is also a crucial factor in stabilizing the SbcCD complex from E. coli (31Connelly J.C. de Leau E.S. Okely E.A. Leach D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19819-19826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that it might play a similar role for the Rad50·Mre11 complex. When the pH of the glycerol gradient solution was greater than 8.0 (Fig. 4, top panel), only a partial affinity between Rad50 and Mre11 was observed, and the two components separated in the gradient. The partial affinity above pH 8.0 was indicated by a shift of both species to higher S values (7.2 and 5.7 S for Rad50 and Mre11, respectively) compared with those obtained when the individual subunits were run alone on gradients (6.3 and 4.7 S, respectively). At neutral pH (7.0) and with 1 mm MnCl2 the complex was maintained during the 16-h gradient run and the two proteins perfectly cosedimented (Fig. 4, bottom panel). The MnCl2 was not necessary to stabilize the complex at pH 7, but it did stabilize the complex above pH 8 (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the two extremes of gradient conditions: pH 8.3 with no Mn2+ where the subunits separate (top panel), and pH 7.0 with 1 mmMn2+ where the complex is maintained (bottom panel). The fact that the complex is unstable at high pH is consistent with the single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity of Mre11 and Rad50·Mre11. Even in the presence of manganese, Mre11 activity is highly sensitive to pH >7.2, and Rad50 provides some stabilization up to pH 7.6. 3K. Trujillo and P. Sung, unpublished observations. Having identified gradient conditions that maintained the Rad50·Mre11 complex, we could then rotary-shadow the samples and look for new structural features along the Rad50 dimers that might indicate the binding site of the Mre11 subunit. The location of the Mre11 was remarkably clear and consistent. In some molecules a third, large globular domain can be seen between the globular termini of Rad50 (Fig.5A, first row). Alternatively, when the terminal domains are not separately resolved, they are greatly enlarged in the Rad50·Mre11 complex compared with Rad50 alone (Fig. 5A, third row). Thus, Mre11 is closely associated with the ATPase and DNA-binding domains of Rad50. No binding of Mre11 was observed either at the hinge or along the coiled-coils of Rad50, and the overall structure of the Rad50 dimer appears unchanged in the complex. From the rotary-shadowed images, it is difficult to determine how many Mre11 subunits are bound at the Rad50 catalytic domains. We took two different approaches to address the relative stoichiometry of Rad50 and Mre11 in the complex. The first was by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels stained by Coomassie Blue. Both analysis of mean intensities and of integrated intensities gave a Rad50:Mre11 molar ratio of 1:1.1 (± 0.1, n = 4), indicating that a dimer of Mre11 is bound to each Rad50 dimer. Second, we compared the frictional ratio (smax/s) of unbound Rad50 to that of the complex (Table I). This approach is described in the next section.Table IHydrodynamic properties of Rad50, Mre11, and their complexProteinM(aa)ssmax/skDaSRad5023066.32.6Mre11784.71.4R2·M24628.42.6(R2·M ?)3848.42.3M (aa) is the predicted mass in kilodaltons for the stoichiometry indicated, based on the amino acid sequence. sis the sedimentation coefficient in Svedbergs, determined by glycerol gradient sedimentation. smax/s is the ratio of the maximum sedimentation coefficient, calculated for an unhydrated sphere of the same mass, to the observed sedimentation coefficient and is an empirical measure of how elongated a protein is. Open table in a new tab M (aa) is the predicted mass in kilodaltons for the stoichiometry indicated, based on the amino acid sequence. sis the sedimentation coefficient in Svedbergs, determined by glycerol gradient sedimentation. smax/s is the ratio of the maximum sedimentation coefficient, calculated for an unhydrated sphere of the same mass, to the observed sedimentation coefficient and is an empirical measure of how elongated a protein is. Gradient sedimentation analysis is a useful method for estimating molecular shape, as the sedimentation coefficient obtained can indicate the conformation of molecules in solution. The hydrodynamic parameter that we find most useful issmax/s, wheresmax is the maximum possible sedimentation coefficient for a protein of the given mass, corresponding to a sphere of the minimum diameter to contain the given mass of protein and with no water of hydration. The ratiosmax/s is the same as the frictional ratio, f/fmin, where f is the actual frictional coefficient of the hydrated protein, andfmin is the frictional coefficient of the unhydrated minimal sphere (32Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961Google Scholar). smax is calculated from the Svedberg equation, using the density and viscosity of water and a partial specific volume for the protein of 0.73 cm3/g. Globular proteins typically havesmax/s of 1.2–1.3 (for example, our standard proteins catalase and serum albumin havesmax/s = 1.20 and 1.29), and the ratio rises to 2.0 or more for highly elongated proteins such as tropomyosin or fibrinogen (30Schürmann G. Haspel J. Grumet M. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1765-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the hydrodynamic properties we observe for Rad50 alone are consistent with a dimer: calculating smax/s using the mass of a dimer (306 kDa) and the observed sedimentation coefficient gives a value of 2.6, which is typical of a highly extended molecule such as we see in the EM. Calculating smax/sfrom the observed s value but using the mass of a monomer (153 kDa) would give a value of only 1.6, indicative of a fairly compact globular structure, which is not what we observe in the EM. As a second approach to determine the Rad50·Mre11 complex stoichiometry, we assumed that the frictional character of Rad50 is determined primarily by the long coiled-coils, and specifically that the frictional coefficient is not affected by the binding of Mre11 in the complex. Thus, the complex should havesmax/s very similar to that of Rad50 alone. smax/s calculated for the complex with two Mre11s is approximately equal to that of Rad50 alone, whereas the value with a single Mre11 is significantly smaller (TableI). This confirms the 1:1 stoichiometry obtained by densitometric analysis. In the absence of Rad50, Mre11 sedimented at 4.7S which is consistent with a globular monomer. If it were a dimer, thesmax/s ratio would be 2.2 indicating an elongated molecule, which is inconsistent with our EM images of Mre11 alone. Thus, in our hands, dimerization of Mre11 appears dependent upon formation of the Rad50·Mre11 complex. TableII lists lengths and diameters of different domains from these proteins, measured from the electron micrographs. Fig. 6 shows the predicted coiled-coil segments and provides the basis for an interesting calculation. The length of the coiled coil, 120 nm from one globular domain to the other, includes two coiled coil segments and the hinge (Fig. 1). Fig. 6 shows that the predicted coiled coils have several gaps, especially in the N-terminal segment. Are these gaps actually continued segments of coiled coil, just not well predicted, or do they loop out from the coiled coil? The total length of the predicted C-terminal coiled coil is 412 aa, including small gaps of 1, 9, and 2 aa. An α helix of 412 aa would be 62 nm long (calculating 0.15 nm/aa), which is very close to half the 120 nm measured for the two coiled coils. The predicted N-terminal coil is significantly longer, 505 aa total, but this includes 95 aa in predicted gaps. We suggest that these gaps are actually looped out from the coil. If the gaps are eliminated, the N-terminal coil would be 410 aa, which matches exactly the 412-aa C-terminal coil with which it must pair (Fig. 1) and our measured length. The functional significance of these gaps, which vary among species, has yet to be addressed.Table IIMeasured dimensions of Rad50 and Rad50·Mre11MoleculeDimensionMeasured ValuenmRad50Length of coils120"
https://openalex.org/W2038536045,"Receptor-activated Ca2+ entry is usually thought to occur via capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ channels. However, at physiological levels of stimulation, where Ca2+ store depletion is only transient and/or partial, evidence has suggested that an arachidonic acid-dependent noncapacitative Ca2+ entry is responsible. Recently, we have described a novel arachidonate-regulated Ca2+-selective (ARC) conductance that is entirely distinct from store-operated conductances in the same cell. We now show that these ARC channels are indeed specifically activated by low agonist concentrations and provide the predominant route of Ca2+entry under these conditions. We further demonstrate that sustained elevations in cytosolic Ca2+, such as those resulting from activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry by high agonist concentrations, inhibit the ARC channels. This explains earlier failures to detect the presence of this noncapacitative pathway in experiments where store-operated entry had already been fully activated. The result is that the respective activities of ARC and store-operated Ca2+ channels display a unique reciprocal regulation that is related to the specific nature of the [Ca2+]i signals generated at different agonist concentrations. Importantly, these data show that at physiologically relevant levels of stimulation, it is the noncapacitative ARC channels that provide the predominant route for the agonist-activated entry of Ca2+.

Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 3Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Such entry is usually thought to occur via capacitative or store-operated Ca2+(SOC) channels whose activation is dependent on the emptying of agonist-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores (4Putney Jr., J.W.

Direct electrophysiological measurements of such a Ca2+-selective conductance activated by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores were originally made in mast cells and in Jurkat lymphocytes (8Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 9Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 10Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6259-6299Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar), where the measured current was namedI CRAC (for calciumrelease-activated calcium current). CRAC channels therefore represent an archetypal SOC channel. As such, the capacitative entry of Ca2+ appears to be a virtually ubiquitous feature of cells and has been demonstrated to play a key role in determining the amplitude of the sustained elevations in ([Ca2+]i) seen after maximal stimulation with appropriate agonists, and in the refilling of agonist-sensitive stores on the termination of such signals. Responses to low agonist concentrations, however, are typically characterized by the generation of an oscillatory [Ca2+]i signal in which intracellular Ca2+ stores are only transiently and/or partially depleted (11Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thomas A.P. Bird G. St J. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, the receptor-activated entry of Ca2+ typically modulates the frequency of such signals (13Rooney T.A. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 674-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Girard S. Clapham D. Science. 1993; 260: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals are not associated with the sustained depletion of agonist-sensitive intracellular Ca2+stores that appears necessary to activate CRAC channels, it has been questioned whether the capacitative mechanism can operate to regulate Ca2+ entry under these circumstances (16Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Instead, in a variety of different cell types, Ca2+ entry during such oscillatory Ca2+ signals has been shown to be independent of the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (i.e. noncapacitative) and dependent on the generation of arachidonic acid (17Shuttleworth T.J.

Broad L.M. Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5613-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recently, using HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m3-HEK cells), we reported the presence of a small inward Ca2+-selective current that was activated by the exogenous addition of low concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA) (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This AA-dependent current (named I ARC forarachidonate-regulated calcium current) shares many features with the endogenous store-operated Ca2+-selective current (I SOC) recorded in the same cells. These include a similar whole-cell current magnitude, high selectivity for Ca2+, marked inward rectification, inhibition by La3+, and development of a monovalent permeability upon the removal of extracellular divalent cations (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, despite these superficial similarities, several lines of evidence demonstrate that I ARC andI SOC represent entirely distinct conductances. Critically, activation of I ARC is absolutely dependent on the generation or addition of arachidonic acid and is entirely independent of store depletion. Moreover,I ARC and I SOC are additive in the same cell, and I ARC can be readily activated in cells whose Ca2+ stores have been maximally depleted (e.g. by treatment with thapsigargin) (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Unlike both I CRAC and the endogenousI SOC, I ARC shows no Ca2+-dependent fast inactivation and is largely insensitive to reductions in extracellular pH (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Other marked differences include the ratio of the magnitudes of the Ca2+-selective currents seen under normal conditions to the larger monovalent ion (Na+) currents that develop in the nominal absence of external divalent cations (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and the effects of substitution of internal Cs+ with Na+ on the magnitude of the Ca2+ current (see below). Interestingly, a recent study in Chinese hamster ovary cells has indicated that whileI SOC is severely impaired in cells expressing a mutant presenilin gene, I ARC is unaffected (25Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T-W. Neuron. 2000; 27: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Finally, while Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases have been shown to be uniquely sensitive to Ca2+ entering via the capacitative pathway (26Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), they fail to respond to Ca2+entering via the ARC channels (27Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31174-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Importantly, this eliminates the possibility that arachidonic acid merely modifies the properties of the endogenous SOC channels and shows that the two conductances must represent entirely physically distinct and spatially separate entities. There is therefore a variety of biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacological data to indicate that these two conductances represent the activities of distinct channels. I ARCtherefore represents a novel Ca2+ entry pathway that is entirely distinct from those activated by store depletion and probably accounts for the AA-dependent noncapacitative entry of Ca2+ seen in a variety of cells at low agonist concentrations. Importantly, this novel conductance is not unique to HEK cells, since its presence has also been demonstrated in Chinese hamster ovary cells (25Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T-W. Neuron. 2000; 27: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and in RBL cells. 2J. L. Thompson and T. J. Shuttleworth, unpublished data. Moreover, its presence is not limited to immortalized cells, since we have recently observed an identical current in acutely isolated mouse parotid cells. 3O. Mignen, J. Bruce, and T. J. Shuttleworth, unpublished data. Significantly, the parotid cell is a tissue that played a key role in the original establishment of the capacitative model of Ca2+ entry (28Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we attempt to identify and define the specific role of this novel conductance in Ca2+ signaling in cells and, in particular, its relationships with the more widely studied store-operated conductance represented byI SOC. Arachidonic acid and isotetrandrine were purchased from BioMol, and adenophostin A was purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were from Sigma. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human m3 muscarinic receptor were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 (19Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The day before experimentation, cells were plated onto glass coverslips that formed the bottom of a perfusion chamber (Warner, Hamden, CT). Patch clamp recordings in the whole-cell mode were performed as previously described (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, internal solutions contained 140 mm Cs+acetate, 10 mm NaCl, 1.22 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Where required, CaCl2 was added to this solution to achieve the desired free Ca2+ concentration as computed with Maxchelator (29). Extracellular solutions contained 140 mmNaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mm CsCl, 10 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) unless otherwise specified. Both MgCl2 and CaCl2 were omitted from this solution for the experiments involving divalent-free external solutions, and the osmolarity (320 mosmol/liter) was maintained with additional d-glucose. The experiments involving perforated patch protocols used amphotericin B (200 μg/ml) in the pipette solution as previously described (30Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After stable macroscopic currents were obtained in this mode, the “classic” whole-cell configuration was achieved by rupturing the patch with brief application of negative pressure to the inside of the pipette. Leak currents (mean value = 0.03 ± 0.03 pA/pF at −80 mV, n = 50) were determined from the average of five voltage ramps obtained at 2-s intervals on initially going whole-cell and were subtracted from the recorded current-voltage traces as appropriate. The simultaneous single cell measurements of changes in [Ca2+]i and Mn2+ quench were carried out essentially as previously described (17Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with the fluorescent probe indo-1 by incubation in indo-1/AM (4 μm for 12 min), washed in saline, and then further incubated in saline (30 min at 37 °C) to allow for complete hydrolysis of the acetoxymethylester. [Ca2+]i was determined as the ratio of the emitted fluorescence, measured as photon counts, at 405 and 485 nm using excitation at 350 nm. Simultaneous determination of the rate of Mn2+ quench used the adjusted total fluorescence protocol described previously (17Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The external Mn2+concentration used was 0.05 mm, a concentration that we have shown has no detectable effect on Ca2+ entry. Determinations of arachidonic acid generation were as described previously (17Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that I ARCand AA-dependent Ca2+ entry can be activated by addition of 3–8 μm of exogenous arachidonic acid (17Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,19Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These concentrations are within the typical range of theK m for the intracellular cyclo-oxygenases and lipoxygenases responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid (32Meves H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that cytosolic levels of arachidonic acid are likely to achieve such concentrations in vivo. We have also demonstrated that low concentrations of agonist activate a type IV phospholipase A2, resulting in the increased generation of arachidonic acid (33Osterhout J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8248-8254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the cytosolic concentration of arachidonic acid resulting from such an activation is uncertain, particularly since a large proportion of the fatty acid will undoubtedly partition into the membrane. Consequently, despite the considerable evidence that I ARC underlies the noncapacitative entry of Ca2+ seen at low concentrations of agonists, direct activation of I ARC by agonists has not yet been demonstrated. Moreover, it has recently been suggested that the effects of exogenous addition of the fatty acid may not accurately reflect the behavior of the same molecule generated endogenously within the cell as a result of receptor activation (22Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5613-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out, however, that this conclusion was based on experiments utilizing very high concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid (>30 μm), a concentration that is some 4–5 times the reported critical micellar concentration for arachidonic acid in saline (34Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that has been shown to cause significant changes in membrane fluidity in other cells (35Denson D.D. Wang X.P. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1211-C1219Crossref Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the key question remains: do appropriate concentrations of agonists generate sufficient arachidonic acid to actually activate the ARC channels? To address this, we used a protocol based on our demonstration of the additive nature of the two Ca2+-selective conductances (I ARC and I SOC) in the same cell (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents in m3-HEK cells were recorded using standard patch clamp techniques and hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to −80 mV applied from a holding potential of 0 mV.I SOC was first maximally activated by using a Ca2+-free pipette solution containing the high affinity InsP3-receptor agonist adenophostin A (2 μm) (36Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenophostin A has previously been shown to be particularly effective at depleting the internal Ca2+stores and activating store-operated Ca2+ entry in a variety of different cell types (37Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Huang Y. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32881-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, inward currents measured at −80 mV developed rapidly after going whole-cell (Fig. 1 A). Experiments showed that this current remained stable for periods of at least 4–5 min after reaching a steady state (not shown). These currents showed all of the features characteristic of the previously described endogenous I SOC of m3-HEK cells including current density (0.64 ± 0.06 pA/pF, n = 12), inward rectification, and reversal potentials significantly more positive than +30 mV (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Similar magnitude currents were obtained by pretreating the cells with thapsigargin (1 μm for 15 min), confirming that the above protocol resulted in a maximal activation of I SOC (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The subsequent addition of a low concentration (0.5 μm) of the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh) resulted in the development of an additional inward current at −80 mV (Fig. 1 A). The observed increase in inward current was entirely dependent on activation of muscarinic receptors, since no increase in current was seen when CCh was added in the presence of atropine (Fig. 1 B). Examination of the current/voltage relationship for this additional current after subtraction of the underlying I SOC (see Fig.1 C) revealed that the current displayed marked inward rectification and a positive reversal potential (>+30 mV) (Fig.1 D). The absolute dependence of this current on muscarinic receptor activation and the characteristic features of theI/V curve, together with the stability of the underlyingI SOC (see above), argue against the possibility of any changes in nonspecific leak currents contributing significantly to the development of the observed current. To investigate the identity of this CCh-activated current, we first examined its dependence on arachidonic acid generation using the biscoclaurine alkaloid isotetrandrine, which inhibits the receptor activation of arachidonic acid generation but does not affect the simultaneous stimulation of phospholipase C (19Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In cells exposed to 10 μm isotetrandrine, the magnitude ofI SOC was unaffected (0.59 ± 0.04 pA/pFversus 0.62 ± 0.04 pA/pF, n = 7 and 14, respectively). In contrast, the subsequent CCh-activated current was almost completely, but reversibly, inhibited (from 0.39 ± 0.02 to 0.08 ± 0.02 pA/pF, n = 8 and 9, respectively) (Fig. 2, A andB). Moreover, this inhibition of the CCh-activated current was readily reversed upon washing out the isotetrandrine. This indicates that the current activated by CCh under these conditions is dependent on the generation of arachidonic acid and is therefore likely to be I ARC. Such data are consistent with our previous findings that the oscillatory [Ca2+]isignals produced at these same low agonist concentrations are acutely dependent on an isotetrandrine-sensitive entry of Ca2+(19Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we examined the CCh-activated current for certain of the key features mentioned above that critically distinguishI ARC from the endogenousI SOC observed in the same cells. First, we examined the CCh-activated current for the presence of fast inactivation. Such fast inactivation is a characteristic feature of both the archetypal store-operated conductanceI CRAC (40Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and the endogenousI SOC in m3-HEK cells, but it is absent inI ARC (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Measurement of the change in the CCh-activated current during 250-ms pulses to −80 mV revealed the complete absence of any fast inactivation (Fig.3 A), a response that is essentially identical to the response seen inI ARC activated by the exogenous addition of arachidonic acid. In marked contrast, similar measurements ofI SOC revealed a characteristic fast inactivation. We next used a protocol involving substituting Na+ for Cs+ in the pipette solution. Although the underlying reasons are unclear, preliminary experiments had indicated that this substitution markedly enhanced the store-operated currents in the m3-HEK cells. Consistent with these preliminary observations, replacing Cs+ in the pipette solution with Na+ increased the magnitude of the measuredI SOC by ∼70% from 0.62 ± 0.04 to 1.0 ± 0.11 pA/pF (mean ± S.E., n = 14 and 10, respectively). However, the same maneuver was completely without effect on the magnitude of I ARC when activated by the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (0.60 ± 0.07 and 0.61 ± 0.09 pA/pF, n = 9 and 4, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, the same substitution also failed to affect the magnitude of the CCh-induced current activated after maximal activation of I SOC (0.39 ± 0.02 and 0.41 ± 0.05 pA/pF, n = 8 and 5, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that the CCh-activated current represents a conductance distinct from I SOC and is consistent with it being I ARC. Finally, like CRAC channels (9Hoth M. Penner R. J.

Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), both ARC and SOC conductances display a monovalent (Na+) permeability in the nominal absence of external divalent cations (23Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 24Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21365-21374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, whereas the Na+/Ca2+ current ratio for SOC channels is <20, the corresponding value for ARC is ∼40 (Fig. 3 D; see also Ref. 24Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol.

To examine this parameter for the CCh-activated current, the protocol illustrated in Fig. 1 A was repeated in the nominal absence of external divalent cations. Under these conditions, the monovalent (Na+) current through the SOC channels activates rapidly upon removal of external divalent cations and then spontaneously inactivates (Fig. 3 C; see also Ref. 24Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21365-21374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A similar response has been reported in the CRAC channels of Jurkat cells (41Lepple-Wienhues A. Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 7: 787-794Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 42Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with the only significant difference being that the inactivation of the current in m3-HEK cells is not dependent on the absence of internal Mg2+ ions (24Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21365-21374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 Cshows that the subsequent addition of CCh (0.5 μm) after spontaneous inactivation of the monovalent SOC current is complete, induces the development of a new monovalent current whose magnitude is significantly larger than the corresponding SOC current in the same cell. The magnitude of this CCh-activated monovalent (Na+) current was 18.3 ± 1.1 pA/pF (mean ± S.E.,n = 3), giving a Na+/Ca2+conductance ratio for this current of 45.7 ± 9.0, a value not significantly different from that obtained forI ARC and more than twice that seen forI SOC (Fig. 3 D). In conclusion, the CCh-activated current is entirely dependent on the generation of arachidonic acid, shows no fast inactivation, is unaffected by substituting internal Cs+ with Na+, and has a Na+/Ca2+ current ratio (the former measured in the nominal absence of divalent cations) greater than 40. Moreover, it can be activated after maximal activation ofI SOC (i.e. the two currents are additive). All of these features lead us to conclude that the observed CCh-activated current reflects the activity of the ARC channels.Figure 3Comparison of the properties of the CCh-activated current, with I SOC and withI ARC. A, comparison of fast inactivation in the carbachol-activated current and inI SOC and I ARC. Shown are representative recordings of the change in the current measured during 250-ms pulses to −80 mV for the current activated by 0.5 μm CCh, maximally activated I SOC(SOC), and I ARC activated by 8 μm exogenous arachidonic acid (ARC).B, SOC, ARC, and CCh-activated currents determined at −80 mV with cesium (open columns) and sodium (filled columns) as the main internal cation.

In this study, we identify an Rbm3 mRNA with a complex 5′ leader sequence containing multiple upstream open reading frames. Although these are potentially inhibitory to translation, monocistronic reporter mRNAs containing this leader were translated relatively efficiently. In addition, when tested in the intercistronic region of dicistronic mRNAs, this leader dramatically enhanced second cistron translation, both in transfected cells and in cell-free lysates, suggesting that the Rbm3 leader mediates cap-independent translation via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Inasmuch asRbm3 mRNA and protein levels are both increased in cells exposed to mild hypothermia, the activity of this IRES was evaluated at a cooler temperature. Compared to 37 °C, IRES activity at 33 °C was enhanced up to 5-fold depending on the cell line. Moderate enhancements also occurred with constructs containing other viral and cellular IRESes. These effects of mild hypothermia on translation were not caused by decreased cell growth, as similar effects were not observed when cells were serum starved.

Mammalian cells exposed to conditions of mild hypothermia continue to be metabolically active; however, there is a general inhibition of protein synthesis (1Wassmann H. Greiner C. Hulsmann S.

Some of these changes appear to protect cells, enabling them to more effectively tolerate hypothermic or other stressful conditions (reviewed in Refs. 2Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin.

In addition, some of these molecular changes may be physiologically relevant, for example, in testis and skin, where cell temperatures are typically 30–34 °C and ∼33 °C, respectively (3Fujita J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 243-255PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the mRNAs induced in cells exposed to mild cold stress encode Rbm3 and the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirp), also known as A18 (4Nishiyama H. Higashitsuji H. Yokoi H. Itoh K. Danno S.

These are two highly homologous members of the glycine-rich RNA-binding protein family, and both proteins are thought to affect the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, perhaps functioning as RNA chaperones that facilitate translation at colder temperatures (4Nishiyama H.

The focus of this study is the 5′ leader of the mRNA encoding mouse Rbm3, which affects its translation at 37 °C and under conditions of mild cold stress. The Rbm3 cDNA identified in this study contains a 720-nucleotide 5′ leader that appears to be a longer variant of that described by Danno et al. (7Danno S. Itoh K. Matsuda T. Fujita J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1685-1692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This longer variant contains 12 upstream open reading frames (uORFs)1 that should, in the absence of other mechanisms, block translation of the main open reading frame (9Geballe A.P. Sachs M.S. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 595-614Google Scholar, 10Meijer H.A. Dictus W.J. Keuning E.D. Thomas A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30787-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, when tested in the 5′-UTR of a reporter gene, the Rbm3 leader sequence mediated a higher level of translation than expected both in transfected cells and in cell-free lysates. This suggested that Rbm3 mRNA might contain sequences that enable the translation machinery to bypass these potentially inhibitory uORFs. This notion was supported by showing that the Rbm3 5′ leader could internally initiate translation in a cap-independent manner. The sequence or sequences that mediate this activity will be referred to as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The induction of Rbm3 mRNA in cells exposed to mild cold stress prompted an investigation of the relative efficiency of its IRES at a lower temperature. The results showed that the activity of theRbm3 IRES was enhanced in some cell lines when cells were cultured at 33 °C compared with cells cultured at 37 °C. Moderate enhancements of internal initiation were also observed with the c-myc and poliovirus (PV) IRESes, but not with the encephalomyocarditis (EMCV) IRES. These effects of mild hypothermia on IRES activity did not appear to be caused by decreased cell growth, as similar effects were not observed under conditions of serum starvation. This study suggests that internal initiation of translation may be an important component of the cold shock response in mammalian cells, ensuring the translation of particular proteins even though overall protein synthesis is inhibited. Rbm3 cDNA clones were selected in the course of another study 2G. C. Owens, unpublished results. that used a PCR-based screen to identify novel RNA-binding proteins that might affect post-transcriptional events in the mammalian nervous system as they do in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis (11Robinow S.

Degenerate PCR primers modeled on the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 1 and RNP2 sequences in the first RNA-binding domain of theDrosophila musashi gene product were used to amplify cDNA fragments (∼140 base pairs) containing a RNP consensus sequence type RNA-binding domain (15Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) or an RNA recognition motif (16Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). PCR products amplified from postnatal day 14 mouse C57BL/6 brain poly(A)+ mRNA were cloned and used to screen a postnatal day 1 mouse brain cDNA library in λZAP II (Stratagene) to identify a larger Rbm3 cDNA clone. As the 5′ leader of this cDNA clone appeared to be a longer variant of those described previously, its authenticity was confirmed by nested PCR of cDNA from different sources: poly(A)+ mRNAs derived from adult mouse brain and total RNA extracted from mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells. Primer sets used for amplification were based on sequences contained within the Rbm3 cDNA identified in this study. PCR reactions using mouse brain cDNA as a template were carried out using primer set 1 (sense primer, 5′-CGAGGCATTACCCAGTAGACTCTTAC-3′; antisense primer 5′-CGTTTTAGCTATTATTTCTCTTGCTATT-3′). After a first round of PCR, an aliquot of the reaction was reamplified with the same primer set. PCR reactions were also carried out with cDNA from both mouse brain and fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells as templates using nested primers. The initial amplification was carried out using primer set 2 (sense primer, 5′-AATAGCAAGAGAAATAATAGCTAAAACG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CTCTCCATTCATAGCTCTCATC-3′). Nested amplification was carried out using primer set 3 (sense primer, 5′-GACTGAAGGCAGTCAACAACGG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTCAGAGGACGGCAGAGACGAC-3′). Products obtained after two rounds of PCR were inserted into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. All Rbm3 constructs described in this study utilized this 5′ leader. Sequence comparisons to GenBank™ were performed using the BLAST sequence comparison algorithm (Genetics Computer Group). The BESTFIT program (Genetics Computer Group) was used to compare theRbm3 sequence to segments of the mouse 18 S rRNA (accession no. X00686). The significance of the sequence matches was evaluated by comparing BESTFIT quality scores with those obtained when the sequence matches were randomly shuffled 100 times and compared with 18 S rRNA. To determine its effect on translation, the Rbm3 5′ leader was tested in the 5′-UTR of the firefly (Photinus) luciferase coding region. This construct (Rbm3/P(EMCV)CAT), derived from the pGL3-control plasmid (Promega), contained the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (Promega) as a second cistron, expressed via the EMCV IRES (nucleotides 286–860, accession no. X74312). Expression of the CAT enzyme should reflect dicistronic mRNA levels and allows estimation of the translation efficiency of the Photinus cistron. To test whether the Rbm3 5′ leader contained an IRES, this sequence was tested in the intercistronic region of the RP and RPh (hairpin) dicistronic reporter vectors, which were kindly provided by Dr. Anne E. Willis (University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom). These constructs encode dicistronic mRNAs with the sea pansy (Renilla) luciferase coding region as the first cistron andPhotinus luciferase coding region as the second cistron. The initiation codon of the Photinus luciferase gene is contained within an NcoI restriction site and this restriction site was used to clone the Rbm3 5′ leader immediately upstream of the Photinus luciferase coding region. Other inserts cloned into the RP and RPh vectors were: the EMCV IRES; the human PV (Mahoney strain) IRES, nucleotides 1–743 (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Sarnow, Stanford University, Stanford, CA); the human c-myc IRES (nucleotides 2501–4519 contained within the c-myc gene, accession no.J00120); and the mouse β-globin 5′-untranslated region (UTR), nucleotides 1–52 (nucleotides 2666–2717 in β-globin gene, accession no. J00413). The reporter constructs (0.5 μg) were transfected into 1 × 105 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Where indicated, transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection with the pCMVβ vector (CLONTECH). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and luciferase, CAT, and β-galactosidase activities determined (17Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). IRES activities in this study refer to the Photinus:Renillaluciferase expression ratio. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (18Owens G.C. Chappell S.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using total RNA prepared from transiently transfected cells. For cell-free translation studies, constructs were linearized usingBamHI, and capped RNA was transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit (Ambion). C6 cell-free lysates were prepared as described previously (19Hu M.C.-Y. Tranque P. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of GTP or the cap analogue (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G) as indicated. For cold stress studies, cells were transfected and assayed as described above, except that, following transfection, cells were recovered for 24 h at 37 °C, medium was changed, and cells were incubated at 33 °C for an additional 48 h. Parallel controls were similarly treated but maintained at 37 °C throughout. For serum deprivation studies, cells were also recovered for 24 h following transfection. After 24 h, medium was removed, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Parallel controls were treated similarly but incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum throughout. A PCR-based screen to identify novel RNA-binding proteins that might mediate mRNA processing in the brain identified a cDNA fragment designated U9, the predicted amino acid sequence of which corresponds exactly to that of the mouse Rbm3 protein (7Danno S. Itoh K. Matsuda T. Fujita J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1685-1692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein. This protein is closely related toCirp and to the predicted translation product of a human sequence found on chromosome 1q24–1q25 (accession no. Z98751). All three of these protein sequences are distantly related to that of heteronuclear RNP G (4Nishiyama H. Higashitsuji H. Yokoi H. Itoh K. Danno S. Matsuda T. Fujita J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 208: 115-120Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Soulard M. Valle V.D. Siomi M. Pinol-Roma S. Codogno P. Bauvy C. Bellini M. Lacroix J.-C. Monod G. Dreyfuss G. Larsen C.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4210-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Rbm3 cDNA fragment U9 was used as a probe to isolate an approximately 1.4-kilobase pair Rbm3 cDNA clone from a mouse neonatal brain cDNA library (GenBank™ accession no.AY052560). The 5′ leader contained within this cDNA is 720 nucleotides long, and is considerably longer than the mouse and human sequences that have been described previously (6Danno S. Nishiyama H.

Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1685-1692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Comparison of the leader sequence identified in this study to the published leader sequences revealed a match of 59 nucleotides immediately upstream of the initiation codon when compared with the other mouse sequence (7Danno S. Itoh K. Matsuda T. Fujita J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1685-1692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and of 107 nucleotides when compared with the human sequence (6Danno S. Nishiyama H. Higashitsuji H. Yokoi H. Xue J.-H. Itoh K. Matsuda T. Fujita J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the 720-nucleotide 5′ leader identified in this study was confirmed by nested PCR and sequencing of the PCR products. In independent experiments, sequences containing the 5′ leader and coding sequences were amplified using cDNA templates prepared from two different sources: adult mouse brain and mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells. The sequences of the PCR products obtained with both cDNA templates matched those of the isolated Rbm3 cDNA clone. The Rbm35′ leader sequence is 720 nucleotides long and contains 13 uORFs, none of which overlap the Rbm3 coding sequence. Seven of the upstream AUGs contain a purine at position −3 and might therefore be in good context to function as initiation codons (21Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). In addition, sequence comparisons of the Rbm3 5′ leader sequence to those contained within GenBank identified several matches. These included a reverse complementary match to a segment of the p84 gene, as well as to numerous different ESTs, which may indicate that there are several alternatively spliced variations of the Rbm3 5′ leader. A striking feature of the Rbm3 5′ leader sequence is that it contains numerous complementary matches to 18 S rRNA. Fifteen of these sequence matches, ranging from ∼80 to 100% over 8–20 nucleotides, are documented in Table I.Table IComplementary sequence matches between Rbm3 5′ leader and mouse 18 S rRNARbm3 5′ leaderSimilarity to 18 S rRNAp by chance −19 to −3192.3% in 13 nucleotides at 1816–1828<0.01 −70 to −8581.3% in 16 nucleotides at 75–90<0.05−164 to −173100% in 10 nucleotides at 142–151<0.01−217 to −22890.9% in 11 nucleotides at 78–88<0.01−285 to −29892.9% in 14 nucleotides at 1619–1632<0.01−301 to −310100% in 10 nucleotides at 1010–1019<0.05−371 to −38090% in 10 nucleotides at 1821–1830<0.05−429 to −437100% in 9 nucleotides at 1360–1368<0.01−493 to −50685.7% in 14 nucleotides at 1526–1538<0.01−532 to −539100% in 8 nucleotides at 1242–1249<0.01−543 to −56285% in 20 nucleotides at 1001–1020<0.01−603 to −61491.7% in 12 nucleotides at 889–900<0.01−648 to −655100% in 8 nucleotides at 217–224<0.01−659 to −67292.9% in 14 nucleotides at 50–62<0.01−677 to −69388.2% in 17 nucleotides at 1718–1734<0.01 Open table in a new tab To determine the effect on translation of the Rbm3 leader sequence, it was tested in the 5′-UTR of a dicistronic mRNA with thePhotinus luciferase reporter gene as the first cistron and the CAT gene, driven by the EMCV IRES, as the second cistron (Rbm3/P(EMCV)CAT, Fig. 1). Although the presence of numerous uORFs within the 5′ leader ofRbm3 mRNA might be expected to completely block translation of the Photinus reporter gene (10Meijer H.A. Dictus W.J. Keuning E.D. Thomas A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30787-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), this was not the case. When tested in the rat glioma C6 cell line, the translation efficiency of the Rbm3/P(EMCV)CAT mRNA was 28% of the efficiency of the P(EMCV)CAT mRNA (Fig. 1). When tested in three other cell lines, human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH (SK), mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3, and mouse neuroblastoma N2a, the translation efficiency of the Rbm3/P(EMCV)CAT mRNA was 64, 16, and 72% of the efficiency of the P(EMCV)CAT mRNA, respectively. A similar monocistronic mRNA containing theRbm3 5′ leader in the 5′-UTR of the Photinusluciferase gene was transcribed in vitro and translated in a cell-free lysate prepared from the C6 cell line and compared with the parent construct. The translation efficiency of this full-length transcript was ∼30%, which was similar to the 28% efficiency obtained when the Rbm3/P(EMCV)CAT construct was transfected into C6 cells, indicating that the Rbm3 5′ leader affected the translation efficiency of the monocistronic mRNAs. These results are consistent with the notion that other mechanisms such as internal initiation, leaky scanning, or reinitiation (21Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) might be involved in the translation mediated by the Rbm3 5′ leader. A consistent observation in all four cell lines was that the expression of the second cistron (CAT driven by the EMCV IRES) was lower from the construct containing the Rbm3 5′ leader compared with the control construct. This suggested that the presence of this 5′ leader decreased mRNA levels, perhaps by affecting mRNA stability. To determine whether the Rbm3 5′ leader could internally initiate translation, it was cloned in the intercistronic region of a dicistronic mRNA and tested in transfected cells (Fig.2). The dicistronic mRNAs used in these studies contain Renilla and Photinusluciferases as the first and second cistrons, respectively (RP; Ref. 22Stoneley M. Paulin F.E.M. Le Quesne J.P.C. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The presence of the Rbm3 5′ leader in the intercistronic region of this dual luciferase dicistronic mRNA (Rbm3/RP) enhanced expression of the downstream Photinus luciferase gene ∼22-fold over background when expressed in the N2a cell line (Fig. 2A). The presence of the Rbm3 5′ leader in the dicistronic mRNA resulted in decreased translation of the first cistron (Fig.2A, compare Renilla luciferase activities forRP versus Rbm3/RP). This may indicate that the stability of this mRNA was decreased compared with the control, which is consistent with the results obtained with monocistronic mRNAs containing the Rbm3 5′ leader. To begin to evaluate whether the enhanced translation of the second cistron mediated by the Rbm3 5′ leader was independent of the translation of the first cistron, a stable hairpin-forming structure (h) was used to block its translation. Hairpin structures can inhibit translation by physically blocking scanning ribosomes (see Ref.23Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and in the present studies, this sequence appeared to inhibit expression of the upstream Renilla luciferase cistron by >80% in N2a cells. This inhibition ranged from 67–93% in other cell lines. In contrast, the expression of the downstreamPhotinus luciferase cistron remained high in the construct containing the Rbm3 5′ leader (Rbm3/RPh). Indeed, inhibiting the translation of the Renilla cistron resulted in an apparent increase in the expression of the Photinusluciferase cistron (Fig. 2A). To evaluate whether the enhanced translation of the downstream cistron resulted from shorter monocistronic mRNAs generated by weak promoter activity, RNA fragmentation, or unusual splicing events, the dicistronic mRNA was analyzed using Northern blots. The results indicated that the construct was expressed as a full-length dicistronic mRNA (Fig. 2B). Although these results are consistent with the Rbm3 5′ leader functioning as an IRES, Northern analyses have limited sensitivity, so the Rbm3 5′ leader was further evaluated for its ability to mediate internal initiation in an intact full-length mRNA in cell-free lysates. Capped dicistronic mRNAs that lack (RP) or contain the Rbm3 5′ leader (Rbm3/RP) were transcribed in vitro and translated in lysates prepared from C6 cells (Fig. 3). Translation of the parent RP mRNA yielded Photinus luciferase activities that were indistinguishable from the background obtained from control reaction mixtures that lacked Photinusluciferase mRNAs. In contrast, an equimolar concentration of theRbm3/RP mRNA consistently yielded Photinusluciferase activities that were ∼15-fold higher than background. To evaluate if the translation mediated by the Rbm3 leader was cap-independent, in vitro transcribed and cappedRbm3/RP mRNAs were translated in the presence of an increasing concentration of m7GpppG, a cap analogue that blocks cap-dependent translation by binding to initiation factor eIF4E (24Cai A. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Centers A. Chlebicka L. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). With the RP mRNA, translation of theRenilla luciferase cistron was blocked by ∼90%, but was not affected by similar concentrations of non-methylated GTP, which was tested as a control (data not shown). Translation of thePhotinus luciferase cistron remained unchanged at a background level in the absence or presence of the cap analogue. With the Rbm3/RP mRNA, the presence of the cap analogue also blocked translation of the first cistron by ∼90%; however, translation of the Photinus luciferase cistron increased ∼2-fold. The enhanced translation of the second cistron in this experiment was consistent with the results obtained in transfected cells when expression of the first cistron was blocked by a stable stem-loop structure. Taken together, the results of the transfection and cell-free translation studies support the notion that theRbm3 5′ leader contains an IRES. The activity of the Rbm3 IRES was compared with that of another cellular IRES from the c-myc mRNA, and to two picornaviral IRESes: PV, an enterovirus IRES, and EMCV, a cardiovirus IRES. The 5′-UTR of the β-globin mRNA served as a negative control for these experiments, as the translation of this mRNA is cap-dependent (e.g. Refs. 25Hickey E.D. Weber L.A. Baglioni C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 27Keiper B.D. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These constructs were transiently transfected into four cell lines, N2a, NIH-3T3, C6, and SK, and luciferase activities were measured after 24 h (Fig. 4). The results showed that the activity of the Rbm3 IRES ranged from ∼10- to 40-fold over background depending on the cell line. These activities were generally higher than those of the c-myc, PV, and EMCV IRESes in these cell lines (28Stoneley M. Subkhankulova T. Le Quesne J.P. Coldwell M.J. Jopling C.L. Belsham G.J. Willis A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 29Borman A.M. Le Mercier P. Girard M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Expression of Rbm3 mRNA and protein are induced by mild hypothermia (7Danno S. Itoh K. Matsuda T. Fujita J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1685-1692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); the activity of this IRES was therefore assessed in cells exposed to this condition. Dicistronic constructs containing the Rbm3 5′ leader were transfected into cells, and IRES activities were determined when cells were cultured at 37 °C or at 33 °C. The results showed that in NIH-3T3 and C6 cell lines, the Rbm3 IRES was up to 5-fold more active in cells cultured at the lower temperature (Fig.5), but in N2a or SK cell lines, there was no significant difference associated with culture temperature (data not shown). To determine if the enhanced activity of theRbm3 IRES under conditions of mild cold stress was a specific property of this IRES, three other IRESes: c-myc, PV, and EMCV, were also tested in this assay. At the cooler temperature, the activity of the c-myc IRES was enhanced in NIH-3T3 cells, whereas that of the PV IRES was enhanced in both NIH-3T3 and C6 cells. In contrast, the activity of the EMCV IRES showed no significant difference in cells cultured at 37 °C or at 33 °C. To test whether the effects on IRES activity at 33 °C might be related to decreased cell growth at this temperature, IRES activities were also determined in cells in which cell growth was restricted by serum starvation (Fig. 6). Exposure to mild cold stress and serum starvation both appear to decrease cell growth by prolonging the G1 phase of the cell cycle (8Nishiyama H. Itoh K. Kaneko Y. Kishishita M. Yoshida O. Fujita J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,30Panet R. Fromer I. Alayoff A. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were used for this analysis because they showed the most dramatic effects on IRES activity under conditions of mild hypothermia. In serum-deficient medium, the activity of theRbm3 IRES was slightly enhanced and that of the PV IRES was unaffected compared with cells cultured in rich medium. In contrast, the activities of the EMCV and c-myc IRESes were both enhanced ∼2.7-fold in cells grown in serum-deficient compared with serum-rich medium. The results suggest that, for Rbm3 and PV, decreased cell growth is unlikely to account for the effects on IRES activity observed at 33 °C. In the case of the c-mycIRES, however, activity was increased both by mild hypothermia and by serum starvation; therefore, decreased cell growth cannot be ruled out as a factor affecting its activity. In this study, we have demonstrated that a 5′ leader of theRbm3 mRNA contains a potent IRES that was more active in some cell types when exposed to mild cold stress. Even at 37 °C, however, the Rbm3 IRES was relatively more active than the c-myc, PV, and EMCV IRESes when tested in the same dicistronic system in these cells. Sequence analysis of theRbm3 5′ leader revealed a number of uORFs, a feature that has also been noted in other 5′ leaders that contain IRESes (e.g. Refs. 31Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control.

At present, however, it is unknown if any of the uORFs in the Rbm3 leader are translated or if other mechanisms, in addition to internal initiation, such as leaky scanning, reinitiation, or shunting affect the translation of theRbm3 cistron. In addition to uORFs, the Rbm3 5′ leader contains numerous segments with complementarity to 18 S rRNA. In previous studies we showed that complementary sequence matches in other mRNAs could bind to 40 S ribosomal subunits by interacting with the 18 S rRNA, and affect translation (19Hu M.C.-Y.

A. 1998; 95: 12238-12243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Complementary sequence matches to 18 S rRNA have also been identified in other cellular IRESes and in short nucleotide sequences that function as IRES modules (e.g. Refs. 17Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Owens G.C. Chappell S.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, complementarity to 18 S rRNA appears to be a defining feature of some IRES modules (Refs.17Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 18Owens G.C. Chappell S.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; data not shown). Thus far, several short nucleotide sequences have been identified within the Rbm3 IRES that facilitate or affect internal initiation. 3S. A. Chappell and V. P. Mauro, manuscript in preparation. Whether any of these cis-acting sequences directly bind to 40 S ribosomal subunits by interacting with 18 S rRNA is the focus of ongoing investigations. Internal initiation during cold stress resembles several other cellular situations in which IRESes seem to facilitate the translation of some mRNAs even though overall translation is reduced, as occurs during picornaviral infection, hypoxia, apoptosis, and the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (33Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 39Stein I. Itin A. Einat P. Skaliter R. Grossman Z. Keshet E. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). During poliovirus infection, for example, cap-dependent translation is reduced; however, the poliovirus IRES and some cellular IRESes enable the production of particular proteins (33Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Under conditions of mild cold stress, the activities of theRbm3, c-myc, and PV IRESes were enhanced in some of the cell lines tested. In contrast, the relative efficiency of the EMCV IRES was not enhanced in any of these cell lines. This variation in the ability of individual IRESes to initiate translation under conditions of mild cold stress may reflect differences in the stability of higher order RNA structures at colder temperatures, which might affect ribosome recruitment or subsequent movement of the translation machinery to the initiation codon. Alternatively, variations in the efficiency of these IRESes during mild hypothermia in different cell types may reflect differential expression of trans-acting factors that affect these IRES activities. There is evidence that the molecular changes that accompany mild hypothermia can protect cells from subsequent hypoxia-induced damage (1Wassmann H. Greiner C. Hulsmann S. Moskopp D. Speckmann E.J. Meyer J. Van Aken H. Neurol. Res. 1998; 20: S61-S65Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), an observation that has been exploited in the treatment of patients with certain types of brain injury (e.g. Ref. 43Marion D.W. Penrod L.E. Kelsey S.F. Obrist W.D. Kochanek P.M. Palmer A.M. Wisniewski S.R. DeKosky S.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The expression properties of Rbm3 and the closely relatedCirp genes suggests that the Rbm3 and Cirp proteins may therefore contribute to the physiological changes that accompany mild hypothermia. This has been demonstrated for murine Cirp in studies showing that expression of this protein prolongs the G1phase of the cell cycle and is responsible for slow cell growth during mild cold stress (8Nishiyama H. Itoh K. Kaneko Y. Kishishita M. Yoshida O. Fujita J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Cirp and Rbm3 function as RNA chaperones and might facilitate translation at colder temperatures by binding to single-stranded RNA and disrupting secondary structures that become more stable at these temperatures. This raises the possibility that the efficiency of some IRESes during mild hypothermia may be affected by Rbm3, Cirp, or by other related protein(s). The expression properties and possible protective role of the Rbm3 protein during exposure to cold stress may be similar to that of another stress-induced gene, that for the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, which after γ-irradiation or serum withdrawal is translated via an IRES, and which protects cells from apoptosis (40Holcik M. Lefebvre C. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to investigate the possible role of the Rbm3 protein during mild cold stress, to determine if other mRNAs induced by mild hypothermia, such as Cirp, also contain IRESes, and to understand how internal initiation is differentially regulated under these conditions.

The addition of sulfate is temporally and spatially regulated, indicating that the presence of sulfate in many cases confers biological function to these saccharides (1Hooper L.V. Manzella S.M.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans consist of repeating units of (GlcUAβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4)n1that are sulfated on the 4-hydroxyl of GalNAc (chondroitin sulfate A), the 6-hydroxyl of GalNAc (chondroitin sulfate C), or both the 4- and 6-hydroxyls of GalNAc (chondroitin sulfate E). Variable amounts of GlcUA in chondroitin are converted to IdoUA by glucuronylC5-epimerase to produce dermatan sulfate, also referred to as chondroitin sulfate B, a glycan consisting of (IdoUAα1,3GalNAcβ1,4)n and (GlcUAβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4)n disaccharides (4Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 5Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of IdoUA and GlcUA in dermatan varies considerably in tissues and is influenced by the level of free sulfate in the medium of cultured cells (6Silbert J.E. Palmer M.E. Humphries D.E. Silbert C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13397-13400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to sulfation of the GalNAc on the C-4 hydroxyl, the GalNAc in dermatan can also be sulfated at the C-6 hydroxyl (7Nadanaka S. Fujita M. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the IdoUA can be sulfated at the C-2 hydroxyl (8Cheng F. Heinegard D. Malmstrom A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). While chondroitin and dermatan glycans are selectively expressed on a number of proteoglycans, many aspects of the regulation of their synthesis remain to be elucidated. In light of the many functions attributed to proteoglycans bearing dermatan and chondroitin oligosaccharides (9Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar,10Bovolenta P. Fernaud-Espinosa I. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), developing an understanding of the regulation of their synthesis will yield information about the biologic significance of these complex sulfated structures. Two groups independently reported the cloning of a GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase (C4ST-1) that selectively adds sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of GalNAc when adjacent to GlcUA in both chondroitin and dermatan (11Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A second GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase (C4ST-2), which is 36% identical to C4ST-1, was also cloned (12Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The preferential addition by C4ST-2 of sulfate to GlcUA-GalNAc in both chondroitin and dermatan led to the speculation that sulfation may precede the epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA in dermatan (12Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 are both homologous to the HNK-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1 ST), a 3-O-glucuronylsulfotransferase that is responsible for synthesis of the HNK-1 epitope SO4-3-GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R (13Ong E.

Two additional GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferases, GalNAc-4-ST1 and GalNAc-4-ST2, that add sulfate to terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc in the sequence GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc-R on N-linked oligosaccharides such as are present on the glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin were cloned and also found to be homologous to HNK-1 ST. The intracellular forms of GalNAc-4-ST1 and GalNAc-4-ST2 that are located in the Golgi do not add sulfate to the nonterminal GalNAc residues in either chondroitin or dermatan (15Xia G. Evers M.R.

We now report the cloning of an additional GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase, dermatan-4-sulfotransferase (D4ST-1) that adds sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of GalNAc in the sequence IdoUA-GalNAc but not GlcUA-GalNAc. Like C4ST-1, C4ST-2, GalNAc-4-ST1, and GalNAc-4-ST2, D4ST-1 is homologous with HNK-1 ST. The specificity of D4ST-1 indicates that a distinct sulfotransferase mediates the addition of sulfate to adjacent GalNAc residues in dermatan following epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA. A 1131-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a novel sulfotransferase, designated D4ST-1, was identified using FGENES (version 1.6) (17Salamov A.A. Solovyev V.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). A single exon gene on the genomic clone RP11-64K12 with the GenBankTM accession numberAC013356 (see “Results”) was predicted. PCR was used to amplify this 1131-bp ORF from human brain cDNA (see below). Filtering of repetitive elements (Repeat Masker, version 07/16/00, University of Washington Genome Center) and BLASTN (version 2.1.3) searches against the databases of GenBankTM, EMBL, and DDBJ expressed sequence tag divisions (dbEST) at the NCBI were carried out on this genomic clone to verify exonic sequences of D4ST-1 and to locate exons of neighboring genes. CpG islands as defined by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer (18Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar) were located in genomic sequences 5′ of the D4ST-1 exon using the WWWCPG program (19Milanesi L. D'Angelo D. Rogozin I.B. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using Marathon ReadyTM cDNA (adult kidney; BD Biosciences-CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) as a template was performed to obtain a full-length sequence. The 3′-region was obtained by amplifying the cDNA using a primer consisting of nucleotides 130–153 (D4ST-1-GSP1; 5′-ATG CTG ATG TTT GCG GTG ATC GTG-3′) and the AP1 anchor primer (CLONTECH), followed by a nested PCR (30 cycles) using a primer consisting of nucleotides 473–499 (D4ST-1-NGSP1; 5′-CCT GCT CTA ACT GGA AGC GGG TGA TGA-3′) and the AP2 anchor primer (CLONTECH). The DNA products were gel-purified (Life Technologies, Inc.), cloned into pCR-TOPO 2.1 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and sequenced on both strands. Amplified sequences were assembled using the Lasergene (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) software suite. The 5′-UTR could not be amplified using a number of different primer combinations. The protein sequences of HNK-1 sulfotransferase family members were analyzed using the ClustalW (version 1.4) algorithm (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar) implemented in the Bioedit suite to perform multiple alignments. Pairwise alignments were executed using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (21Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6972) Google Scholar) implemented in the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite at the European Bioinformatics Institute. The ORF of D4ST-1 was amplified from a SuperScriptTM human fetal brain cDNA library (Life Technologies) by PCR using 1) the 5′-specific primer 5′-ATA TGA ATT CGC CAC CAT GTT CCC CCG CCC GCT GAC CC-3′ containing a EcoRI site, the consensus Kozak sequence GCCACC (22Kozak M.

PCRs were carried out using PfuTurbo® HotStart polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with an initial denaturation for 2 min at 96 °C, followed by 35 cycles of a reaction consisting of 30-s denaturation at 96 °C, 60-s annealing at 60 °C, and 120-s of elongation at 72 °C. The PCR fragment containing the ORF with the expected length of 1131 bp was directionally subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), completely sequenced on both strands, and designated pcDNA3.1-D4ST-1. The ORF of human C4ST-1 was amplified from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (LLNL) cDNA clone, ID 2388199 (GenBankTM accession number AJ289133; IMAGp998J085931.1 obtained from RZPD, Berlin, Germany) (23Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B.

PCRs were carried out withPfuTurbo® polymerase (Stratagene) using the forward primer 5′-AGC TAA GCT TGC CAC CAT GAA GCC AGC GCT GCT GGA AG-3′, containing a HindIII site and the consensus Kozak sequence, and the reverse primer 5′-TGC TCT AGA TTA TTC CAA TTT CAG GTA GCT-3′, containing an XbaI restriction site. The PCR product was directionally subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), completely sequenced on both strands, and designated pcDNA3.1-C4ST-1. Based on the sequence of GenBankTM entry AJ289131, the primers 5′-CCC GGG GCA GGA TGA CCA-3′ and 5′-TCC AGG CAC GCG AGA AAA AG-3′ were used to amplify (40 cycles) the complete ORF of human C4ST-2 including adjacent untranslated regions from Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) derived from human adult testis. The DNA product was gel-purified (Life Technologies) and used as a template for a nested PCR with the primers 5′-ATA TGA ATT CGC CAC CAT GAC CAA GGC CCG GCT GTT-3′ and 5′-ATA TCT CGA GTC AGT CTC GGA GGA GGT TTT CGG-3′, containing restriction enzyme sites (EcoRI andXhoI, respectively) and, in the case of the forward primer, the consensus Kozak sequence in front of the start codon. The amplified sequence was directionally subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), completely sequenced on both strands, and designated pcDNA3.1-C4ST-2. CHO/Tag cells were transfected with 13 μg of pcDNA3.1-D4ST-1, pcDNA3.1-C4ST-1, pcDNA3.1-C4ST-2, or pcDNA3.1 using 35 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) in serum-free medium for 6 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sixty hours after transfection, the cells and medium were collected separately for analysis. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 175 mm KCl, 2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (23 millitrypsin inhibitor units of aprotinin and 4 μg each of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin) per 100-mm diameter culture plate. The homogenate was mixed by rotation for 1 h and sedimented at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was designated as the cell extract. The culture medium was pooled and sedimented at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The culture supernatant was adjusted to a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors were added as noted above. Chondroitin- and dermatan-4-sulfotransferase activities were assayed as described (12Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Each reaction (50 μl) contained 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 × 105 cpm of 35S-labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), 2 μm PAPS, protamine (0.005% (w/v) for chondroitin or 0.05% (w/v) for dermatan), and protease inhibitors (see solubilization buffer above). Desulfated chondroitin (Seikagaku America, Inc.) and desulfated dermatan from porcine intestine (Sigma) (24Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were used as acceptors. Incorporation was determined to be linear for 3 h under these conditions. Assays were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C and terminated by boiling for 3 min. The [35S]SO4-labeled chondroitin and dermatan product was precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 4m potassium acetate and 3 volumes of ethanol. After sedimentation, the precipitates were dissolved in 140 μl of H2O and separated from any remaining [35S]PAPS and degradation products by passage over Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad).

[35S]SO4-dermatan and [35S]SO4-chondroitin products were digested with 50 milliunits of chondroitinase AC I (Calbiochem) in 100 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.3, for 16 h at 37 °C or 25 milliunits of chondroitinase B (Calbiochem) in 100 mmTris acetate buffer, pH 8.0, for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestion products were analyzed by HPLC on a 4.6 × 250-mm MicroPak AX-5 column (Varian) using a linear gradient of 10 mmKH2PO4 to 450 mmKH2PO4 over 40 min with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (26Baenziger J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Standards were detected by absorbance at 210 or 234 nm, and fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals for determination of radioactivity. [35S]SO4-labeled products separated on a Micro Pak AX-5 column were pooled separately and further characterized by gel filtration on a 16 × 500-mm SuperdexTM 30 preparative grade gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted at 1.0 ml/min in 100 mmNH4HCO3. Oligosaccharides were reduced as indicated by the addition of 50 mm NaBH4, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Reductions were terminated by placing the samples on ice and adding acetic acid until the borohydride was discharged. The reduced samples were dried under vacuum, resuspended in 1 ml of methanol, and dried under vacuum until excess borate was removed. Terminal unsaturated uronic acid was removed by treatment with 35 mm mercuric acetate, pH 5.0, for 30 min at 25 °C (27Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Kuberan B., Yu, G. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Residual mercury was removed by passage over a Dowex 50W-X8 H+ column and washing with H2O. Digestion with 30 milliunits of β-N-acetylhexosaminidasef (New England BioLabs) was carried out in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. Digestion with 0.2 milliunits of α-l-iduronidase (Glyko) was carried out in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. All products were analyzed by HPLC on a MicroPak AX-5 column as described above. Human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN®) blots and Human Multiple Tissue Expression (MTETM) arrays were purchased fromCLONTECH. They were hybridized with 5–15 × 106 cpm of a specific α-32P-labeled cDNA probe ([α-32P]dCTP and MegaprimeTM labeling kit purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed according to the manufacturer's specifications. The membranes were exposed to Biomax MS films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2–5 days at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The 425-bp probe used for the labeling reactions corresponds to nt 673–1097 of the D4ST-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF401222). We recently identified and characterized two human GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferases, GalNAc-4-ST1 (15Xia G. Evers M.R. Kang H.-G. Schachner M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38402-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and GalNAc-4-ST2 (16Kang H.G. Evers M.R. Xia G. Baenziger J.U. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10861-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), based on their homology to the HNK-1 ST. HNK-1 ST produces the HNK-1 epitope SO4-3-GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R by transferring sulfate to the acceptor GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R (13Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Bakker H. Friedmann I. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Nifant'ev N. Schachner M. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29942-29946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, GalNAc-4-ST1 and GalNAc-4-ST2 both transfer sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc present onN-linked oligosaccharides such as those found on the glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin (28Baenziger J.U. Green E.D. Ginsberg V. Robbins P.W. Biology of Carbohydrates. 3. JAI Press Ltd., London1991: 1-46Google Scholar). C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 are also GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferases that are homologous to HNK-1 ST; however, C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 transfer sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of internal β1,4-linked GalNAc moieties within the repeating disaccharide sequences found in chondroitin and dermatan (11Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E.

Further screening of the nonredundant data base at the NCBI using the deduced amino acid sequence of human HNK-1 ST (GenBankTMaccession no. AF033827) identified a 177-kilobase pair genomic clone, GenBankTM accession number AC013356, that included a sequence related to HNK-1 ST (E value 1e−23). We identified an ORF with a length of 1131 bp encoded by a single predicted exon in the region displaying homology. This ORF was amplified from human brain cDNA and sequenced (Fig. 1A). 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was carried out to obtain a full-length sequence of D4ST-1 but only succeeded in elongation of the 3′-end (see “Experimental Procedures”). The amplified sequences contained the 3′-UTR with a polyadenylation signal and a poly(A) tail. Fig. 1A shows the 1960-bp cDNA that includes the 1131-bp ORF encoding a protein of 376 amino acid residues with two potentialN-glycosylation sites and a calculated molecular mass of 43 kDa. The deduced protein, designated D4ST-1 (GenBankTMaccession number AF401222) is a typical type II transmembrane protein with a transmembrane region close to the N terminus (see the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity profile (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (16895) Google Scholar) in Fig. 1B). Multiple alignment of the protein sequence of D4ST-1 with other members of the HNK-1 sulfotransferase family was performed using the ClustalW algorithm (Fig. 2). The alignment indicates that D4ST-1 is 27.3% identical to C4ST-1, 22.8% identical to C4ST-2, 24.7% identical to GalNAc-4-ST1, 21.0% identical to GalNAc-4-ST2, and 21.4% identical to HNK-1 ST (all of the protein sequences shown are of human origin). The regions with the highest degree of identity are the putative 5′-phosphosulfate binding site (5′-PSB), the putative 3′-phosphate binding site (3′-PB), and three regions of unknown function designated III, IV, and V that are carboxyl-terminal to the 3′-phosphate binding site (Fig. 2). Identical and similar amino acids are shaded if they occur at a specific position in at least five of the six sequences shown in the multiple sequence alignment in Fig. 2. While this emphasizes key features of a protein family, relationships between individual members are underemphasized, especially in the highly variable N-terminal regions of this particular enzyme family. Pairwise alignments using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, however, confirmed that D4ST-1 is more closely related to C4ST-1 (32.2% identical amino acids) and GalNAc-4-ST1 (31.1% identical amino acids) than to C4ST-2 (28.7% identical amino acids), HNK-1 ST (26.1% identical amino acids), and GalNAc-4-ST2 (24.6% identical amino acids). The human D4ST-1 cDNA sequence was used to query the nonredundant data base at the NCBI. A mouse cDNA clone 2600016L03 (GenBankTM accession number AK011230) was identified, and the predicted ORF with the identical length as the ORF of the human counterpart of 1131 bp (nt 93–1223) was amplified by PCR from adult mouse lung and kidney cDNA (data not shown). The mouse ortholog of D4ST-1 is 92.7% identical to human D4ST-1 at the protein level (89% identical at the nucleotide level). In contrast to the coding regions, the 3′-UTRs of human and mouse D4ST-1 show a decreased level of identity (59%). The 92 nts upstream of the start codon of the mouse D4ST-1 transcript, probably a part of the 5′-UTR, were used as a query sequence to search the nonredundant and High Throughput Genomic Sequences data bases at the NCBI. Regions showing significant homology to this stretch could not be detected in human genomic DNA, although most of the sequences of chromosome 15 have been released and the complete sequence of the gap between the D4ST-1 and theKIAA0945 (see below) locus is known. Since coding regions are typically more highly conserved between orthologs than their UTRs, the absence of human genomic sequences homologous to the 5′-end of the mouse cDNA clone indicates that the query sequence represents the murine 5′-UTR and that we have cloned the complete human ORF. The genomic BAC clone RP11-64K12 (GenBankTMaccession number AC013356) initially identified as encoding D4ST-1 is annotated to be mapped on human chromosome 15q14. Comparison of the genomic sequence with the amplified D4ST-1 cDNA indicates that the ORF and the 3′-UTR of D4ST-1 are encoded by a single exon (Fig.3). Only 2.96 kilobase pairs of sequence separate the 3′-UTR of the gene encoding the KIAA0945 protein (GenBankTM accession number AB023162) (30Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) from the start codon of the D4ST-1 gene. Downstream of the D4ST-1 locus, we identified a copy of the gene encoding the ribosomal protein L9 (GenBankTM accession number BC004156) that probably represents a pseudogene (31Mazuruk K. Schoen T.J. Chader G.J. Iwata T. Rodriguez I.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1305: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An analysis of splice sites directly upstream of the start codon of D4ST-1 with a minimum score of 0.9 determined the nearest 3′/acceptor splice site to be 532 bp upstream (analysis performed with Splice Site Prediction as available at the Berkeley Drosophila Genome project Web site). The start codon of the 1131-bp D4ST-1 ORF in Fig. 1 is the first potential site of initiation downstream of the nearest potential splice site in the genomic sequence that is in the correct reading frame and preceded by a stop codon. We were not, however, able to amplify the predicted sequences upstream of the start codon from any human cDNA. The genomic sequence was also examined for the presence of CpG islands as defined by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer (18Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar). A CpG island was identified extending from 620 bp upstream to 880 bp downstream of the D4ST-1 start codon. Such CpG islands have been detected in 82% of analyzed genes showing widespread expression and are indicative of the presence of a promotor region (32Jones P.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 34-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 33Larsen F. Gundersen G. Lopez R. Prydz H. Genomics. 1992; 13: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The high G + C content of this region may have contributed to the difficulty of amplifying the complete cDNA. While D4ST-1 is homologous to HNK-1 ST, C4ST-1, C4ST-2, GalNAc-4-ST1, and GalNAc-4-ST2 and the highest percentage of identical residues are located within the regions that are characteristic of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases, it was not possible to predict the saccharide specificity of D4ST-1 based on its peptide sequence. Initial experiments using D4ST-1 expressed by CHO/Tag cells demonstrated that D4ST-1 was not able to transfer sulfate to either terminal glucuronic acid in GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R or terminal GalNAc in GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man-R but did transfer sulfate to dermatan and chondroitin (not shown). The specificity of D4ST-1 was examined in greater detail and compared with that of C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 as summarized in TableI. CHO/Tag cells were transfect"
https://openalex.org/W2094730070,"Numerous fundamental biological processes involve the NFκB family of transcription factors. The mechanisms by which this family of proteins is regulated are therefore of widespread importance. In most cells, NFκB is bound to inhibitory IκB proteins and sequestered in the cytoplasm. NFκB-inducing signals result in activation of a large multisubunit kinase complex, IKK, which phosphorylates IκB. IκB is subsequently degraded, releasing NFκB, which translocates to the nucleus. We previously reported that inhibitors of the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) prevent phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of IκB. Here we show that KN93, an inhibitor of CaM-dependent kinases (CaMKs), also inhibits the phosphorylation of IκB. The effect of both CaM and CaMK inhibitors on IκB phosphorylation is due to the inhibition of the activity of CaMK II because neither drug has any effect when a derivative of CaMK II that is insensitive to these inhibitors is expressed. When CaMK II is inhibited, phorbol ester is no longer able to activate IKK, placing CaMK II in the signaling pathway that leads to IKK activation. CaM and CaMK inhibitors also block T cell receptor/CD3-induced activation but have no effect on the ability of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α or the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A to induce degradation of IκB. Finally we show that expression of a constitutively active CaMK II results in the activation of NFκB. The results identify CaMK II as a mediator of IKK activation specifically in response to T cell receptor/CD3 and phorbol ester stimulation.

IκB kinase complex tumor necrosis factor α calmodulin-dependent kinase calmodulin phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein kinase C T cell receptor NFκB is a family of eukaryotic transcription factors that is expressed in virtually all cell types and implicated in the regulation of numerous genes (for review, see Ref. 1Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar). Fundamental processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, and development are regulated by NFκB, and NFκB is a central mediator of immune, inflammatory, and stress responses (1Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar, 3Barkett M.

NFκB is primarily regulated by a family of inhibitory IκB proteins (6May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). IκB binds to NFκB and masks its nuclear localization sequence, preventing it from being transported to the nucleus. NFκB-activating signals result in the rapid destruction of IκB, exposing the nuclear localization sequence of NFκB, which directs NFκB to the nucleus where it can act on its target genes. The destruction of IκB is initiated by its phosphorylation on specific serine residues, labeling it for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (7Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). This initiating phosphorylation of IκB is mediated by a large kinase complex termed IKK.1 IKK is composed of a heterodimer of two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, an undefined number of the non-kinase protein IKKγ (also denoted NEMO or IKKAP1), and possibly other components (7Karin M.

IKKγ is required for the assembly of the large complex and is indispensable for its activity (10Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ can both directly phosphorylate IκB (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although there is genetic and biochemical evidence that these two kinases have distinct roles. IKKβ mediates NFκB activation in response to proinflammatory cytokines (12Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), a process that does not require IKKα (13Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that a number of proteins have been identified that either directly or indirectly activate IKK (for reviews, see Refs. 8Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar and 9Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are a large family of structurally related proteins that are dependent on the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) for their activation (20Lukas T.J. Mirzoeva S. Watterson D.M. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 65-168Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of a CaMK is followed by a CaM regulatory domain, which is comprised of an autoinhibitory and a CaM binding domain. The catalytic site is normally sequestered by the autoinhibitory domain through an intramolecular interaction, keeping the kinase in an inactive state. When intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels rise, Ca2+ binds to and induces a conformational change in CaM that allows it to bind to, among a diversity of other targets, the CaM binding domain of the CaMK. This disrupts the interaction between the autoinhibitory and catalytic domains, activating the kinase. One of the best characterized CaMKs is the multifunctional CaMK II (20Lukas T.J. Mirzoeva S. Watterson D.M. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 65-168Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Means A.R. Mol.

CaMK II contains in its C terminus an association domain through which it forms multimers of 8–12 kinase subunits (20Lukas T.J. Mirzoeva S. Watterson D.M. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 65-168Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Upon activation by Ca2+/CaM, CaMK II phosphorylates not only exogenous substrates but also a threonine residue (Thr-286) in the autoinhibitory domain of the neighboring subunit of the CaMK II multimer (20Lukas T.J. Mirzoeva S. Watterson D.M. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 65-168Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Means A.R. Mol.

This phosphorylation prevents the autoinhibitory domain from reassociating with the kinase domain and results in Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase activity. CaMK II is eventually inactivated by removal of this phosphate by a CaMK-dedicated phosphatase (24Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Kitani T. Ishida A. Okuno S. Takeuchi M. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem.

We previously reported that activation of transcription by NFκB in response to phorbol ester is blocked by inhibitors of CaM and that this inhibition is due to the prevention of IκBα phosphorylation (26Hughes K. Antonsson Å. Grundström T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether a CaMK is involved in the signals leading to IκB phosphorylation. We report here that this is indeed the case and identify CaMK II as a mediator of IKK activation specifically in response to T cell receptor/CD3 and phorbol ester stimulation. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), W7, and human recombinant TNFα were purchased from Sigma; calyculin A and GF109203X were purchased from Calbiochem; and KN93 and KN92 were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. Unless otherwise indicated, drugs and antibodies were added to cells at final concentrations of 25 ng/ml PMA, 10 μg/ml W7, 10 ng/ml TNFα, 50 ng/ml calyculin A, 100 ng/ml OKT3 anti-CD3, and 80 μmKN93 and KN92. The eukaryotic expression plasmids for human wild type and T286D mutated CaMK IIγB and the parental expression plasmid pSRα.BKS have been described previously (27Nghiem P. Saati S.M. Martens C.L.

Brodin P. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2117-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pET-20b+His (29Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmid by electroporation as described previously (26Hughes K. Antonsson Å. Grundström T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested or treated with drugs for the indicated times and then harvested. His6-tagged IκBα was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m NaCl, and IκBα was purified from the soluble fraction by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The purified preparation was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitation and analysis of IKK activity was based on the protocol of Trushin et al. (30Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mmEDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets without EDTA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Lysates were adjusted to 0.5m NaCl, and 200 μg of protein were incubated with 2 μg of anti-MKP1 M-18 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. This antibody has been used to purify IKK (18Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar) and was more efficient at immunoprecipitating IKK than the anti-IKKα M-280 antibody (data not shown). The mixture was then incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and washed once with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) buffer containing 40 mm NaCl. The Sepharose was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ATP, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets without EDTA. 18 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μg of IκBα were added to each reaction incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling the samples at 95 °C. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed using Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Reactions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bottom part of the gel was Coomassie-stained to confirm an equal amount of IκB in each lane (data not shown), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The top part of the gel was analyzed for IKKα by Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis of IκBα from cytoplasmic extracts was as described previously (26Hughes K. Antonsson Å. Grundström T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated IKKα was detected using the anti-IKKα M-280 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). After transient transfection, cells were incubated for 4 h and then subjected to Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma) to remove dead cells. After 20 h of further incubation, cells were harvested onto slides by cytocentrifugation or treated with PMA for 30 min and then harvested. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated over night at +4 °C with the primary antibodies anti-IκBα (C-15) and anti-CaMKIIγ (C-18) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were rinsed and incubated for 4 h at room temperature with the secondary antibodies fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Rhodamine Red X-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (both from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were rinsed and mounted in a medium containing Citifluor (Chemical Laboratory, The University of Kent, Kent, UK) as an antifading agent. Cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope equipped with an argon and a HeNe laser (Leica Laser Technik). Images were acquired sequentially using the 488 and 546 nm laser lines to excite fluorescein isothiocyanate and Rhodamine Red dyes, respectively, with an ×63 oil immersion PL APO objective. Data presented in the same figure were registered with the same laser and multiplier settings. We previously reported that phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα induced by the phorbol ester mitogen PMA was blocked by a number of CaM inhibitors including W7 (26Hughes K. Antonsson Å. Grundström T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To investigate whether this was due to the involvement of a CaMK, we analyzed the effect of the CaMK II inhibitor KN93 on the ability of PMA to activate NFκB. Like W7, KN93 prevented the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα in Jurkat T cells (Fig.1 B and data not shown). An inactive analogue of KN93, KN92, had no effect (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the inhibitory effect of KN93 is due to its interaction with CaMK II. These results suggest that CaM inhibitors block IκBα phosphorylation because CaMK II is involved. CaMK II is normally present in an inactive conformation due to an intramolecular interaction between its catalytic domain and its autoinhibitory domain (Fig.2 A). Ca2+/CaM activates the kinase by binding near the autoinhibitory domain and releasing the catalytic domain (Fig. 2 A). W7 binds directly to CaM and prevents it from interacting with its targets (31Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B, top left). KN93 binds to the CaM binding domain of CaMK II and prevents Ca2+/CaM from binding to and activating the kinase (32Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 33Hidaka H. Ishikawa T. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, top left). However, once CaMK II is activated it becomes autophosphorylated on threonine 286 and is no longer dependent on CaM for its activity (34Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 35Schulman H. Heist K. Srinivasan M. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 105: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A) and will therefore not be inhibited by KN93 or W7. A constitutively active kinase resembling the autophosphorylated form is generated by mutating Thr-286 to aspartic acid (T286D) (27Nghiem P. Saati S.M. Martens C.L. Gardner P. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5471-5479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, top right). We used this information to address the specificity of KN93 and W7. We argued that if KN93 and W7 are acting on CaMK II, then transient expression of CaMK II T286D would override their ability to inhibit IκBα degradation. A sufficiently high proportion of the cells would have to be transfected to detect any effect on IκBα degradation in the cell extract. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses of Jurkat cells transfected with different green fluorescent protein fusion constructs revealed that indeed most of the cells (>80%) had taken up DNA and expressed the fluorescent proteins, although at varying levels (data not shown). When the Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with CaMK II T286D expression plasmid, we found that KN93 and W7 no longer had any effect on PMA-induced degradation of IκBα, whereas the inhibitors displayed the expected effect in cells transfected with an empty expression vector or wild type CaMK II plasmid (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that expression of CaMK II T286D is sufficient to override the effect of the inhibitors and thus that CaMK II is a critical component of the pathway leading to IκB degradation. There are numerous stimuli that activate NFκB, and although most of these result in the activation of IKK and consequent phosphorylation of IκB, the early events of their signaling pathways are often quite different. To determine the specificity of the requirement of CaMK II, we examined the effect of W7 and KN93 on stimuli that activate NFκB through distinct signaling pathways. Neither drug had any effect on IκBα degradation induced by the cytokine TNFα or the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (Fig.3). This suggests that CaMK II acts in the phorbol ester signaling pathway before a step that is common to different NFκB inducers. W7 and KN93 also blocked PMA- but not TNFα-induced degradation of IκBα in the early erythroleukemia cell line K562 (data not shown) suggesting that CaMK II is a general, rather than cell-type specific, requirement of phorbol ester-induced activation of NFκB. PMA binds to and activates protein kinase C (PKC), but PMA can also have PKC-independent effects in some systems. To analyze if PMA induction of IκB degradation in Jurkat cells was dependent on PKC activity, we analyzed the effect of the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X (36Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that PMA-induced degradation of IκBα in Jurkat cells is blocked by the PKC inhibitor. Since inhibition occurs already at 50 nm, a concentration at which GF109203X has been reported not to act on any other kinase (36Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that PMA induction of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα is dependent on a PKC-initiated pathway in Jurkat cells. GF109203X had no effect on the ability of TNFα or calyculin A to induce degradation of IκBα, showing that these stimuli activate NFκB independently of PKC (Fig.4 B). Taken together, these data suggest that CaMK II is specifically required for the activation of NFκB in response to mitogenic stimulation and that it acts downstream of PKC. Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex activates PKC- and Ca2+-dependent pathways that synergistically activate NFκB by inducing the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB (30Trushin S.A.

We therefore asked if induction of degradation of IκBα by stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex is blocked by inhibitors of CaM or CaMK II. Jurkat T cells were stimulated by cross-linking the TCR/CD3 complex with anti-human CD3 antibody in the absence or presence of W7 or KN93. Both the CaM and CaMK II inhibitor resulted in a complete block of TCR/CD3-induced degradation of IκBα (Fig.5 A). Induction of degradation of IκBα by cross-linking the TCR/CD3 complex was as sensitive as PMA induction to the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (Fig. 5 B). Like most analyzed NFκB-activating signals, PMA-induced phosphorylation of IκB is mediated by IKK (30Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Nature. 2000; 404: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The activity of IKK can be measured by immunoprecipitating it from cells and analyzing its ability to phosphorylate exogenous IκB in an in vitro kinase assay. When immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated with PMA, IKK showed an increased ability to phosphorylate IκBα compared with IKK immunoprecipitated from unstimulated cells (Fig.6 A). However, both W7 and KN93 inhibited this induction of IKK activity (Fig. 6 A). None of these drugs affected the efficiency of IKK immunoprecipitation because each sample contained the same amount of IKKα, one of the components of the IKK complex (measured by Western blot analysis, Fig.6 B). CaMK II is therefore part of a PMA-induced PKC-dependent signaling pathway that leads to activation of IKK. One of the target genes activated by NFκB is IκBα. Newly synthesized IκBα can enter the nucleus, remove NFκB from DNA, and export the complex back to the cytoplasm to restore the original inactive state of NFκB in the cell (42Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further highlight the role of CaMK II in the signaling pathway leading to NFκB activation, the intracellular localization of IκBα in CaMK II-overexpressing cells was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with different CaMK II expression vectors or empty vector and stained for IκBα (green) and CaMK II (red). In cells transfected with empty expression vector, IκBα was localized mainly to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7 A). Stimulation with PMA resulted in a dramatic decrease in cytoplasmic IκBα and the appearance of IκBα in the nucleus (Fig.7 B). This is presumably the result of PMA-induced degradation of IκBα, activation of NFκB, NFκB-induced resynthesis of IκBα, and the subsequent transport of the newly synthesized protein to the nucleus. Overexpression of wild type CaMK II resulted in a more even distribution of IκBα throughout the cell with a slight predominance in the nucleus (Fig. 7 C). This could be because overexpression of a wild type CaMK II, although Ca2+/calmodulin- dependent, can enhance the ability of the cell to respond to present amounts of Ca2+and calmodulin (and perhaps other inducing factors). When expressing the constitutively active T286D mutant of CaMK II, we observed a dramatic increase in nuclear IκBα (Fig. 7 D) that was even more pronounced than that observed in PMA-stimulated cells (Fig.7 B). This nuclear redistribution can be blocked by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (data not shown), supporting that the action of CaMK II is through direct activation of NFκB. The effect of CaMK II T286D expression was present in most cells in the transfected culture and not only in the cells that are most heavily expressing the constitutively active CaMK (Fig. 7 D). As mentioned above, most (>80%) of the cells in the transiently transfected cell cultures were expressing protein from the transfected plasmid, albeit at varying levels, possibly explaining why an effect is seen in most cells. Furthermore, Jurkat cells treated with conditioned medium from CaMK II T286D-expressing cells showed a nuclear distribution of IκBα similar to that seen in Fig.7 D (data not shown), implying that the constitutively active kinase leads to expression and secretion of NFκB-activating products. A likely explanation is the known NFκB induction of a number of genes whose products also are NFκB activators (1Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar).

Low serum levels of SHBG are also inherited within families (6Meikle A.W. Stanish W.M. Taylor N. Edwards C.Q. Bishop C.T. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 6-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,7Jaquish C.E. Blangero J. Haffner S.M. Stern M.P. MacCluer J.W. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 988-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and associations between abnormal serum SHBG levels and disease processes may therefore be obscured by genetic differences that contribute to variations in human SHBG gene expression. We have recently characterized two binding sites for HNF-4 and COUP-TF within the human SHBG proximal promoter, which influence its transcriptional activity in human HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In particular, binding of HNF-4 to a TA-rich sequence close to the transcription start site in liver cells appears to substitute for the TATA-binding protein in the initiation of transcription (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The possible function of the second HNF-4 binding site in theSHBG proximal promoter is not as clear, but it may contribute to phylogenetic differences in the temporal and tissue-specific expression of SHBG because it lies within a region that is absent in the corresponding region of SHBGgenes in other mammalian species (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Apart from this obvious difference in SHBG promoter sequences between species, the human and rodent SHBG promoters show a remarkable degree of sequence conservation, which only begins to diverge at the boundary of several alu sequences located at about −700 nt from the human SHBG transcription start site (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This likely represents a functional boundary within the promoter sequence because human SHBG gene sequences containing only 803 nt of promoter sequence are expressed in a spatially and temporally appropriate manner when introduced as transgenes into the mouse genome (9Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Jänne M. Hogeveen K.N. Deol H.K. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the significance of repetitive elements within promoter sequences is unclear, they may contain nuclear factor binding sites that contribute to the regulation of transcription (11Sharan C. Hamilton N.M. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Norris J. Fan D. Aleman C. Marks J.R. Futreal P.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8229-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By characterizing the upstream region of the human SHBGpromoter, we have now found that a (TAAAA)6 repeat within an alu sequence binds a 46-kDa liver enriched nuclear protein and acts to silence transcription. More importantly, the number of TAAAA repeats at this location is highly variable between individuals within the general population, and the transcriptional activity of the SHBG promoter and the binding of nuclear protein to this element are both directly related to the number of TAAAA repeats. In vitrofootprinting templates of human SHBG promoter upstream regions were produced by digesting a human SHBG fragment (14Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with XhoI and XbaI. This released a 504-base pair region of the SHBG promoter corresponding to −803/−299 nt relative to the transcription start site in the liver (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This fragment was further digested with HaeIII orHinfI, and the products (−803/−656 ntXhoI-HaeIII, −735/−587 ntHinfI-HinfI, −587/−362 ntHinfI-HinfI, −541/−298 ntHaeIII-XbaI) were cloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the correct orientation to permit labeling of the sense strand after digestion with HindIII. The HindIII-digested constructs were end-labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and purified using a NICK™ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Québec, Canada). Radiolabeled probes were released from the plasmids by digestion with EcoRI and purified by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The DNase I footprinting reactions with mouse liver nuclear extracts were carried out as described previously (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hydroxy-radical footprinting with the same extracts was also performed using the −803/−656 ntXhoI-HaeIII region of the human SHBGpromoter (15Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E.A. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 16O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mouse liver nuclear extracts were used in these and other experiments to characterize and study the regulation of humanSHBG promoter activity because human SHBGtransgenes are expressed efficiently in mouse hepatocytes postnatally (9Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Jänne M. Hogeveen K.N. Deol H.K. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Human SHBG promoter deletion constructs were generated by amplifying a region from anSHBG fragment (14Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This was done using a common reverse primer containing anXbaI site (−299) and forward primers (containing anXhoI site) corresponding to various positions in the 5′ promoter region (Table I). These PCR products were digested with XhoI and XbaI and then subcloned into a pSP72 vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) containing the −299/+60 nt region of the human SHBGproximal promoter. The entire promoter sequences were then excised withHindIII and XhoI and inserted into a pGL2 Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega).Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used for deleting (A) or mutating (B) human SHBG promoter sequence in the context of luciferase reporter gene constructsA.

Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using a pSELECT vector containing the −803/−299 nt region of the human SHBGpromoter, according to the Altered Sites manual (Promega). Mutated sequences in pSELECT were removed by XhoI andXbaI digestion and subcloned into the pSP72 vector containing the −299/+60 nt region of the human SHBGpromoter, and the entire promoter sequences were then inserted into pGL2 Basic, as described above. All PCR-generated and mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a commercially available kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Canada). Human HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and were transiently transfected with human SHBG promoter-pGL2 reporter constructs (1.2 μg) and pCMV LacZ (0.2 μg) using LipofectAMINE® reagent (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h following transfection, and cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing for analysis of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase units were divided by readings obtained from a β-galactosidase assay to correct for efficiency of transfection. Mouse liver nuclear protein extracts (4 μg) were prepared (17Sierra F. BioMethods: A Laboratory Guide to In Vitro Transcription. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar), and then incubated in EMSA buffer (2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 6.25% glycerol, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC)) on ice for 10 min in the presence or absence of double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides (Table II). The corresponding end-labeled oligonucleotide probes were then added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. For antibody supershift assays, radiolabeled probe was incubated with nuclear extract on ice for 15 min prior to addition of either normal rabbit serum, or an antiserum specific to SP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Reactions were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature before electrophoresis. Nuclear proteins bound to radiolabeled oligonucleotides were separated from free probe by 5% PAGE, and the gel was dried and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) against an intensifying screen at −80 °C.Table IISequences of oligonucleotides used in South-western blotting, UV cross-linking experiments, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)DescriptionEMSA oligonucleotides6xTAAAA5′-gTC(TAAAA)6TGGGT3′- AG(ATTTT)6ACCCAg7xTAAAA5′-gTC(TAAAA)7TGGGT3′- AG(ATTTT)7ACCCAg8xTAAAA5′-gTC(TAAAA)8TGGGT3′- AG(ATTTT)8ACCCAg9xTAAAA5′-gTC(TAAAA)9TGGGT3′- AG(ATTTT)9ACCCAg10xTAAAA5′-gTC(TAAAA)10TGGGT3′- AG(ATTTT)10ACCCAgFP125′-gAAAAGACTGGGGGAGGAGTTCAGAC3′- TTTTCTGACCCCCTCCTCAAGTCTGgFP12 mutant5′-GAAAAGACTGGGTTAGGAGTTCAGAC3′- TTTTCTGACCCAATCCTCAAGTCTGgSP15′-GCTGAGGGCGGGACCGCATC3′-CGACTCCCGCCCTGGCGTAGHNF-4/COUP-TF5′-tcgaCTGGGCAGGGGTCAAGGGTCAGTGCCC3′- GACCCGTCCCCAGTTCCCAGTCACGGGagctLowercase letters indicate additional sequences that were filled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP (17Sierra F.

Binding reactions of nuclear protein extracts to double-stranded oligonucleotides comprising various TAAAA repeats (Table II) were carried out under the same conditions used for EMSAs. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, samples were exposed to UV light (302 nm) at a distance of 10 cm for 15 min at 0 °C. Equal volumes of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer were added, and samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE with 4 and 10% acrylamide in the stacking and resolving gels, respectively. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film, as described above. Nuclear proteins extracted from MSC-1 mouse Sertoli cells and human HeLa cervical cancer cells (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), as well as mouse liver (17Sierra F. BioMethods: A Laboratory Guide to In Vitro Transcription. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar), were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred by electrophoresis onto a Hybond™ ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was washed three times for 45 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% milk powder, and 0.1 mm DTT. It was then rinsed twice in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 8% glycerol, and 0.125% milk powder). A radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (250,000 cpm/ml) spanning the (TAAAA)6 sequence in theSHBG upstream promoter (Table II) was added to the binding solution containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and was incubated with the membrane for 16 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and exposed to Biomax MR film, as described above. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of healthy human volunteers (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Amplification of the TAAAA repeat region was accomplished using PCR with a forward primer (5′-GCTTGAACTCGAGAGGCAG) within an alu sequence in the humanSHBG promoter (14Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and a reverse primer (5′-CAGGGCCTAAACAGTCTAGCAGT) corresponding to a sequence at −651/−673 nt within the upstream promoter sequence. Amplified products were separated by 10% PAGE followed by staining with ethidium bromide. The number of TAAAA repeats was quantified by cloning PCR products in the pCR®-BluntII-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) for sequencing. Serum samples from the same individuals were also taken for measurements of SHBG concentrations using a commercially available immunoradiometric assay kit (Orion Diagnostica, Oulunsalo, Finland). Putative binding sites for nuclear proteins in the human SHBG upstream promoter were demonstrated by in vitro footprinting using mouse liver nuclear extracts (Fig. 1). One of these footprints (FP17) contains a sequence (5′-TGATAGAGCAAGAC), which resembles a CEBPβ binding site when examined by homology searches using MatInspector (20Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar) release 2.1. In addition, a sequence (5′-GGGGGAGGAGT) within FP12 (nt −527/−517) resembles a consensus SP1 binding site (5′-GGGGCGGGG(C/T)) by analysis using the TRANSFAC data base (21Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Prüß M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). A region containing six TAAAA repeats, which is resistant to DNase I digestion in the presence or absence of nuclear protein, lies between FP16 and FP17 (Fig. 1), and the boundary of the footprint within the TAAAA repeat region was confirmed by hydroxy-radical footprinting with a mouse liver nuclear protein extract (Fig.2).Figure 2Hydroxy-radical footprinting of the TAAAA repeat within the upstream region of the human SHBGpromoter. A radiolabeled −803/−656 fragment of the humanSHBG promoter was incubated in the absence (lane 2) or presence of 1 μg (lane 3) or 5 μg (lane 4) of mouse liver nuclear protein extract (NE) and was then subjected to hydroxy-radical DNA cleavage. The products were purified and separated on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel, alongside the products of a Maxam-Gilbert (G/A) sequencing reaction as size marker (lane 1). The (TAAAA)6 region and FP17 were protected from cleavage and are shown in brackets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interaction between SP1 and a double-stranded oligonucleotide that included FP12 (nt −536/−510) was confirmed by EMSA (Fig.3A). The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by inhibition of DNA-protein complexes using an oligonucleotide containing a known SP-1 binding site (TableII). In addition, the major DNA-protein complex formed in an EMSA reaction was supershifted with an SP1-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). The activity associated with the nuclear factor binding sites identified by DNase I footprinting (represented byboxes in Fig. 4A) was investigated by adding them sequentially to a human SHBGproximal promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (8Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These constructs were used for transcriptional activity measurements in a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) that produces SHBG (22Khan M.S. Knowles B.B. Aden D.P. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 448-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This revealed that upstream sequences markedly reduce transcriptional activity when compared with the activity of the proximal promoter (Fig.4A). In particular, addition of sequences that include FP16, as well as a putative CEBPβ-binding site within FP17 and the intervening (TAAAA)6 sequence resulted in progressive and significant reductions of promoter activity (Fig. 4A). The reduction of transcription by sequences at the 5′ boundary of the upstream promoter appeared to be associated specifically with the (TAAAA)6 sequence because a 6-fold increase in transcription was observed when it was removed from the full-length promoter (Fig. 4B). It was also noted that mutation of the SP1 binding site (Table II) within FP12, which prevents its interaction with liver nuclear extracts in an EMSA (data not shown), also resulted in a similar increase in the transcriptional activity of the full-length promoter (Fig. 4B). However, recovery of the transcriptional activity of the full-length promoter was not further enhanced by removal of TAAAA pentanucleotide repeat in combination with a mutant SP1 binding site within FP12 (Fig. 4B). It is also important to note that the presence of FP12 appears to have a negative effect on transcription only in the context of upstream sequences within the full-length promoter (Fig. 4A). When tested in an EMSA, a radiolabeled oligonucleotide comprising the (TAAAA)6 sequence interacted with nuclear factor extracted from mouse liver and could be competed for by unlabeled oligonucleotides spanning this repeat region, but not with an unrelated DNA sequence (Fig. 5). To further characterize the nuclear factor(s) binding at this pentanucleotide repeat, a radiolabeled (TAAAA)6 repeat oligonucleotide sequence (Table II) was used as a probe for a Southwestern blot (Fig. 6). The radiolabeled probe recognized a nuclear protein with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, which is enriched in mouse liver nuclear extracts when compared with nuclear extracts from mouse MSC-1 Sertoli cells or HeLa cells (Fig. 6). By contrast, a nuclear protein with a molecular mass of ∼67 kDa was recognized in all nuclear extracts and likely represents a ubiquitous nuclear factor, which binds to this sequence (Fig. 6).Figure 6Southwestern blotting of nuclear factors binding to the (TAAAA)6 repeat element. Nuclear proteins from adult mouse liver, a mouse Sertoli cell line (MSC-1), and HeLa cells were separated on a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was incubated with a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the six TAAAA pentanucleotide repeats in the 5′ region of the human SHBGpromoter. Migration of standards of known molecular mass is shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of reports that the number of TAAAA repeats in the promoters of other human genes varies among individuals (23Durocher F. Morissette J. Simard J. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we amplified the region of the SHBGupstream promoter containing the TAAAA repeat sequence from eight healthy male volunteers. The sizes of the PCR products indicated that the number of TAAAA repeats is highly variable both within and between individuals (Fig. 7A), and we demonstrated that the repeat number ranges from 6 to 10 by sequencing them (Fig. 7B). The serum SHBG concentrations in these individuals (with respect to their (TAAAA)n allele genotypes) were as follows: 13 nmol/liter (6/10), 14 nmol/liter (6/6), 15 nmol/liter (7/7), 25 nmol/liter (7/8), 24 nmol/liter (6/8), 24 nmol/liter (6/7), 15 nmol/liter (6/8), and 23 nmol/liter (9/7). Although there was no obvious relationship between serum SHBG concentrations and the number of TAAAA repeats on each allele, an individual with two (TAAAA)6 containing SHBG alleles had a relatively low serum SHBG level. However, the number of individuals we have studied is small, and no attempt was made to control for factors that might otherwise influence serum SHBG levels, such as body mass index. The influence of this polymorphism on transcription was tested in the context of the full-length human SHBG promoter. We found that the activity of human SHBG promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in HepG2 cells increased 5-fold as the number of TAAAA repeats was increased from six to seven. As additional repeat sequences were added, little if any further increases in promoter activity were observed (Fig. 8). These increases in promoter activity associated with increasing repeats is strikingly similar to the increase observed when the (TAAAA)6 sequence is removed from the full-length promoter (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data suggest that the silencing activity is associated specifically with the presence of only six TAAAA repeats. This was confirmed by performing similar experiments using full-lengthSHBG promoter sequences containing only four or five TAAAA repeats, which also provided ∼5-fold higher levels of transcriptional activity when compared with the promoter sequence containing six repeats (Fig. 8). To further examine nuclear factor binding in relation to the number of TAAAA repeats, we performed a UV cross-linking experiment with radiolabeled oligonucleotides representing the various numbers (6Meikle A.W. Stanish W.M. Taylor N. Edwards C.Q. Bishop C.T. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 6-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Jaquish C.E. Blangero J. Haffner S.M. Stern M.P. MacCluer J.W.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) of TAAAA repeats observed in the general population (Fig. 7), in the presence of mouse liver nuclear protein extracts (Fig.9). This clearly demonstrated that the radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing six TAAAA repeats preferentially binds nuclear proteins, and the major complexes formed were 55–60 kDa in size (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the relative abundance of these complexes declined markedly when oligonucleotides containing more than six repeats were used, and this is consistent with the marked increase in transcriptional activity of promoters containing more than six TAAAA repeats (Fig. 8). The specificity of the complex formed using the TAAAA repeat oligonucleotide sequence was demonstrated by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide, and the lack of complex formation in the presence of nuclear protein without exposure to UV light. In addition, exposure of radiolabeled oligonucleotides to UV did not result in the formation of any high molecular weight complexes in the absence of nuclear protein (data not shown). The size of the major UV cross-linked complexes is consistent with a complex between the oligonucleotide containing the six TAAAA repeats and the 46-kDa liver enriched protein identified as the TAAAA-binding protein by Southwestern blotting (Fig. 6). Blood levels of SHBG in humans are highly variable even between healthy individuals (6Meikle A.W. Stanish W.M. Taylor N. Edwards C.Q. Bishop C.T. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 6-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine if this variability can be explained by a genetic polymorphism, we sequenced the first 300 nt of the human SHBG promoter from normal individuals and patients with various reproductive and endocrine disorders in a separate study, but found no significant deviations between sequences. 2G.

By contrast, our studies of human SHBG promoter activity in HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells alerted our attention to a (TAAAA)6repeat located within an alu-Sx sequence close to the 5′ boundary of the transcription unit expressed in hepatocytes (9Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This particular pentanucleotide repeat has been found to vary in number within the human cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzymeCYP11A1 promoter (23Durocher F. Morissette J. Simard J. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and there is a strong association between alleles with this polymorphism and total serum testosterone levels in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and hyperandrogenism (24Gharani N. Waterworth D.M. Batty S. White D. Gilling-Smith C. Conway G.S. McCarthy M. Franks S. Williamson R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Since this (TAAAA)6 repeat appeared to have a silencing effect on SHBG promoter activity, we focused our attention on the possible factor(s) that might bind to it, and how it might function in concert with other elements in the upstream region of the human SHBG promoter to influence transcription. The upstream region of the human SHBG promoter silences transcription in HepG2 cells, and most of this activity is associated with a region between FP16 and FP17, which includes the (TAAAA)6 repeat element. We have demonstrated that the (TAAAA)6 repeat is responsible for this silencing activity by removing it or by increasing the number of repeats according to the number observed in the general population. It is also clear that this activity is dependent on downstream promoter elements and appears to involve an SP1 nuclear factor-binding site within FP12. Although SP1 is generally considered to be an activator of transcription, it can participate in transcriptional silencing through interactions with other transcriptional regulators in a context-dependent manner (25Talianidis I. Tambakaki A. Toursounova J. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10298-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Shou Y. Baron S. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5716-5726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This might explain why FP12 only appears to regulateSHBG promoter activity in association with upstream elements (FP16-FP17) within the promoter. Although our EMSA supershift data indicate that SP1 binds to FP12, we also observed that a second protein complex forms with a FP12 oligonucleotide, and this complex does not appear to be supershifted with an SP1-specific antiserum. It is therefore possible that FP12 interacts with another SP1-related factor, such as SP3 (27Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 28Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), and this might be relevant because SP3 often acts as a negative regulator of transcription (29De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, competition between SP3 and other SP1-related factors for a common site within promoter sequences alters their transcriptional activity (28Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Variations in the number of polynucleotide repeats within several other promoters have been reported to modulate transcription (31Yamada N. Yamaya M. Okinaga S. Nakayama K. Sekizawa K. Shibahara S.

A. 1998; 95: 8170-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Although the number of (TAAAA)n repeats in the CYP11A1promoter is closely associated with serum testosterone levels and might therefore reflect variations in the expression of the gene (24Gharani N. Waterworth D.M. Batty S. White D. Gilling-Smith C. Conway G.S. McCarthy M. Franks S. Williamson R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), it is not known whether this is due to an effect at the level of transcription. Differences in the number of an inverted (TTTTA)n repeat in the apolipoprotein(a) gene (APO(a)) promoter have also been associated with individual variations in plasma Lp(a) levels (33Mooser V. Francesco P.M. Bopp S. Petho-Schramm A. Guerra R. Boerwinkle E. Muller E. Joachin H. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34Valenti K. Aveynier E. Leaute S. Laporte F. Hadjian A.J. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 147: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, anAPO(a) promoter containing nine TTTTA repeats is associated with low plasma Lp(a) levels, and has a 5-fold lower transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells, when compared with a promoter sequence containing eight TTTTA repeats from an individual with relatively high plasma levels of Lp(a) (35Wade D.P. Clarke J.G. Lindahl G.E. Liu A.C. Zysow B.R. Meer K. Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The (TAAAA)n repeat found within the 5′ region of the human SHBG promoter occurs frequently within the human genome (36Kim H.-S. Crow T.J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 54-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and is a common feature of repetitive elements such as alu sequences (37Millar D.S. Paul C.L. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24893-24899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and LINE elements (36Kim H.-S. Crow T.J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 54-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Close inspection of the pentanucleotide repeats in theCYP11A1 and APO(a) promoters by RepeatMasker (www.genome.washington.edu/uwgc/analysistools/repeatmasker.htm) indicates that they also flank Sp/q and Sgsubfamilies of human alu sequences, respectively, and differences in the number of these repeats between individuals likely reflect an inherent instability of alu repetitive elements (38Mighell A.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Unlike the (TA)n dinucleotide repeat in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) promoter, where increasing numbers of repeats are associated with decreased promoter activity (32Beutler E. Gelbart T. Demina A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8170-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), the activity of the human SHBG promoter is not linear with respect to TAAAA repeat number. Differences in the number of TTTTA repeats in the APO(a) promoter influence its transcriptional activity, but this has not been studied in any great detail (35Wade D.P. Clarke J.G. Lindahl G.E. Liu A.C. Zysow B.R. Meer K. Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In particular, there is no information concerning the identity of proteins that might interact with these types of repeats, or how they influence gene transcription. In experiments presented here, silencing of the human SHBG promoter was only observed in the presence of six TAAAA repeats, and this correlated with the preferential binding of a liver-enriched 46-kDa nuclear factor to the (TAAAA)6 repeat element. Although alleles containing less than six TAAAA repeats were not observed in the limited group of individuals we examined, the activities of SHBG promoters containing four or five TAAAA repeats also lacked the silencing properties associated with the presence of six repeats. These data suggest that the 46-kDa factor that binds six TAAAA repeats with high affinity acts in concert with downstream elements within the humanSHBG promoter to alter its transcriptional activity. In summary, a (TAAAA)n repeat polymorphism within the human SHBG promoter has a marked effect on its transcriptional activity in vitro in HepG2 cells. This could contribute to individual differences in plasma SHBG levels and thereby influence the access of sex steroids to their target tissues. Furthermore, variations in the number of TAAAA repeats within regulatory regions of other human genes may contribute to inter-individual differences in gene expression. The genomic DNA samples we examined were from healthy male volunteers of various ethnic backgrounds, and the number of TAAAA repeat elements ranged from 6 to 10 in this limited group of subjects. Although there was no obvious relationship between the number of TAAAA repeat elements and the serum SHBG concentrations, the number of individuals examined is too small to draw any conclusions, especially as almost all of them were all bi-allelic for different numbers of TAAAA repeats. It is, however, important to appreciate that the ability of the (TAAAA)n polymorphism to influence the transcriptional activity of the human SHBG promoter as naked DNA in transient transfection experiments may not necessarily reflect its activity in the context of genomic DNA within a chromatin structure. It will therefore be important to conduct a carefully controlled clinical study to determine whether this polymorphism is associated with differences in plasma SHBG levels, and to determine whether specific alleles are associated with sex steroid hormone-dependent diseases and/or correlate with responses to various hormone treatments that influence plasma SHBG levels.

https://openalex.org/W1495083514,"We have used the photosystem II reaction center D1 protein as a model to study the mechanisms of targeting and insertion of chloroplast-encoded thylakoid membrane proteins. The unusually high turnover rate and distinct pausing intermediates during translation make the D1 protein biogenesis particularly suitable for these purposes. Here we show that cpSecY, a chloroplast homologue of bacterial essential translocon component SecY, interacts tightly with thylakoid membrane-bound ribosomes, suggesting its involvement in protein translocation and insertion. Co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments indicated that cpSecY resides in the vicinity of D1 elongation intermediates and provided evidence for a transient interaction of cpSecY with D1 elongation intermediates during the biogenesis of D1. After termination of translation, such interactions no longer existed. Our results indicate that, in addition to a well characterized role of cpSecY in posttranslational translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins, it seems to be also involved in cotranslational membrane protein translocation and insertion in chloroplasts."

LCFAs are taken up across the plasma membrane of these cells efficiently despite low physiologic concentrations of unbound free LCFAs in human serum (low nanomolar range) (1Stremmel W. Strohmeyer G. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83 (2588): 3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Richieri G. Kleinfeld A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental and pathophysiologic regulation of fatty acid utilization in a variety of tissues in accordance with nutritional and hormonal signals suggests that protein-mediated mechanisms exist for regulated movement of LCFAs across the plasma membrane. Experiments demonstrating that LCFA uptake is saturable and inhibited by prior protease treatment of the cell surface are consistent with a protein-mediated mechanism of LCFA transport (3Abumrad N.A.

Although biophysical and cellular studies show that LCFAs are capable of traversing the membranes by simple flip-flop (7Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 8Hamilton J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stump D.D. Fan X. Berk P.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such a mechanism is likely to contribute significantly to fatty acid permeation primarily at high concentrations of fatty acids, such as may occur in pathophysiologic states. On the other hand, protein-mediated permeation is likely to be important under conditions of low LCFA concentrations. In previous work we identified the 63-kDa fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) as a protein that facilitates the import of LCFAs when expressed in mammalian cells (10Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Although CD36 and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase were identified on the basis of their ability to bind LCFAs and subsequently shown to participate in fatty acid transport, FATP1 was isolated in an expression cloning screen for functional fatty acid import. FATP1 is expressed at high levels in adipose and muscle tissues and is a member of a large family of related proteins that are expressed in different tissues. Thus far, six human FATPs and numerous orthologs in organisms as diverse asCaenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been identified on the basis of sequence conservation (11Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 95: 8625-8629Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). FATPs share no significant sequence identity with other proteins that play a role in lipid transport across membranes such as CD36, mitochondrial aspartate amino transferase, and ABC transporters (e.g. Pat1p or Pat2p). The mechanism of action of FATP1 is not well understood. FATP1 is an integral membrane protein that localizes to the plasma membrane of adipocytes, where it co-distributes with long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (10Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 12Gargiulo, C. E., Stuhlsatz-Krouper, S. M., and Schaffer, J. E. (1999) J. Lipid Res.40, in pressGoogle Scholar). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that transport of LCFAs into mammalian cells is coupled to esterification of imported LCFAs at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This proposed mechanism is analogous to the well characterized fatty acid transport system in Escherichia coli (13Azizan A. Sherin D. DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in which the outer membrane protein, FadL, binds and transports LCFAs. Imported substrates are esterified upon transport across the inner membrane by a membrane-associated acyl-CoA synthetase, FadD. The combined actions of FadL and FadD transport and metabolically trap the imported LCFAs, creating a concentration gradient favorable for LCFA import. Whether FATP1 functions as a transporter or a protein that binds fatty acids at the plasma membrane remains unresolved. FATP1 contains an AMP-binding motif that is essential for transport function (14Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Bennett N.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28642-28650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and has 40% overall sequence identity with a purified peroxisomal very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (15Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A number of studies have suggested that FATP1 has very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity (16Watkins P.A. Lu J.-F. Steinberg S.J. Gould S.J. Smith K.D. Braiterman L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18210-18219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Choi J. Martin C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, knockout and overexpression experiments may be complicated by compensatory metabolic regulation. In the absence of purified FATP1, it is also not possible to rule out co-fractionation of a distinct esterification enzyme because of physical association of transport and esterification proteins. The observation that FATP1 facilitates import of long chain substrates, whereas very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase has no activity toward these shorter fatty acids has led to the proposal that FATP1 may have independent transport and esterification functions (19DiRusso C. Connell E. Faergeman N. Knuddsen J. Hansen J. Black P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies of FATP will help elucidate the mechanism of action of this protein in LCFA import. The amino acid sequence of FATP1 contains many hydrophobic stretches, consistent with multiple (four to six) membrane spanning domains (Fig.1). However, the topology of FATP1 is difficult to predict from the primary sequence, given that hydrophobic domains in this protein may indicate regions of FATP1 that interact with LCFAs instead. The goal of the present study is to characterize the membrane topology of FATP1, which will assist in understanding the structure and function of this protein. Using a combination of approaches, we show that FATP1 is oriented such that the extreme amino terminus faces the extracellular space, whereas the carboxyl terminus faces the cytosol with several intervening membrane-associated domains. These results are discussed in the context of FATP1 function.

Sealed membrane vesicles (50 μg of protein) were incubated with freshly prepared proteinase K (final concentration, 0.008–0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mm PMSF and 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and immediately separated by SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis of protein expression in FATPnHA- and FATPcFLAG-expressing cells, total post-nuclear membranes were isolated as described (22Chiu H. Kovacs A. Ford D. Hsu F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J. Schaffer J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 107: 813-822Crossref Scopus (616) Google Scholar). For subcellular fractionation, transfected Cos7 cells were disrupted using a glass/Teflon homogenizer in sucrose homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mmsucrose, 1 μm PMSF, 1× Protease Complete) or carbonate buffer (100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, 1 μm PMSF, 1× Protease Complete) (10Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Membrane and soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 356,000 ×g for 30 min. Proteins were quantified by BCA. Proteins were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell; 0.2-μm pore). Primary antibodies for Western analysis were used at the following dilutions: anti-FATP 628–640 (1:2500), anti-FATP 455–470 (1:2500), anti-HA (1:2000), and anti-PDI (1:1000). Detection was performed using HRP-coupled IgG and Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Proteins were synthesized byin vitro transcription/translation using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) and [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a control for glycosylation, a parallel transcription/translation of CD36 was performed in all experiments. The proteins were digested overnight with N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fluorographed and analyzed by autoradiography. For live cell immunofluorescence, all staining was performed at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA), blocked by incubation with normal goat IgG in PBS-BSA (200 μg/ml), and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h (20 μg/ml). The cells were washed with PBS, incubated with ALEXA-coupled secondary antibody (5 μg/ml), washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and mounted on glass slides using Prolong anti-fade mounting solution (Molecular Probes). For fixed cell immunofluorescence, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 or 20 μg/ml saponin for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS, blocked with PBS-BSA containing normal goat IgG (200 μg/ml), and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-HA, 1:250; anti-FLAG, 1:1000; anti-BiP, 1:250; anti-tubulin, 1:1000; and anti-FATP (455), 1:1000). The cells were washed, incubated with secondary antibody (1:250), washed, and mounted using Prolong anti-fade mounting solution. Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and digital images were obtained on a Spot camera (Advanced Spot software, Diagnostic Instruments). The cells were removed from culture dishes with 5 mm EDTA, washed in PBS, pelleted, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2) at room temperature for 2 h. Cell pellet was embedded in 10% gelatin and processed for ultramicrotomy (23Haney P.M. Levy M.A. Strube M.S. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were labeled with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:100) for 2 h, followed by 18-nm gold, goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. After washing, the sections were stained with uranyl acetate and embedded in methyl cellulose (23Haney P.M. Levy M.A. Strube M.S. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Specimens were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. To define the topology of the amino and carboxyl termini of FATP1, we generated FATP1 constructs in the ΔU3 retroviral vector with either an HA tag at the amino terminus (FATPnHA) or a FLAG tag at the carboxyl terminus (FATPcFLAG) (Fig.2A). These constructs were used to generate retrovirus and transduce NIH 3T3 cells. As a control, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transduced in parallel with a retroviral construct for wild-type FATP1. Each tagged construct produces a protein of the expected molecular mass (Fig. 2B). The levels of expression of these constructs are comparable with the levels of wild-type FATP1. To demonstrate that the tagged constructs are functional, we assayed parental and transduced cells for LCFA uptake. Both epitope-tagged constructs function to facilitate fatty acid import (Fig. 2C). Although FATPnHA function is comparable with wild-type FATP1 in this assay, the addition of a FLAG tag at the carboxyl terminus diminishes fatty acid import 35% compared with wild-type FATP1. To determine the orientation of these terminal epitope tags in the membrane, we performed indirect immunofluorescence studies of fibroblasts expressing FATPnHA or FATPcFLAG. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were selectively permeabilized with saponin or Triton X-100 (Figs.3 and 4). In each experiment, control staining for a cytosolic protein, tubulin, and for a resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal protein, BiP, demonstrate that treatment of cells with saponin at 20 μg/ml permeabilizes the plasma membrane but not the ER, whereas treatment with 0.25% Triton X-100 permeabilizes the plasma membrane and the ER. To evaluate the orientation of the carboxyl terminus of FATP1, FATPcFLAG-expressing cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with an antibody to the FLAG epitope tag (Fig. 3). FATPcFLAG-expressing cells show staining in an ER and reticular pattern after saponin or Triton X-100 permeabilization. A similar pattern of staining is observed using antibody directed against FATP1 residues 628–640 in NIH 3T3 cells expressing untagged FATP1 (data not shown). These findings are consistent with a cytosolic orientation of the FLAG epitope and the FATP1 carboxyl terminus. The prominent ER pattern observed when FATP1 is overexpressed in cultured cells likely reflects inefficient targeting of the overexpressed protein to the plasma membrane. To evaluate the orientation of the amino terminus of FATP1, FATPnHA-expressing cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with an antibody to the HA epitope tag (Fig. 4). FATPnHA cells show little to no staining of the amino-terminal HA tag after saponin permeabilization, whereas a comparable exposure of cells stained after Triton X-100 permeabilization shows abundant reticular staining. These findings are consistent with a lumenal orientation of the HA epitope tag and the amino terminus of FATP1.Figure 4Orientation of the amino terminus of FATP1 as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy of fixed cells. NIH 3T3 cells expressing FATPnHA (A–F) and parental NIH 3T3 cells (G) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 (A, C, E, and G) or 20 μg/ml saponin (B, D, and F). For staining, primary anti-HA (A, B, andG), anti-BiP (C and D), or anti-tubulin (E and F) antibodies were used with ALEXA488-coupled secondary antibodies. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, we stained live FATPnHA- and FATPcFLAG-expressing cells to further evaluate the location of the amino and carboxyl termini of FATP1 (Fig. 5). Although the FLAG-tagged FATP1 is abundantly expressed, αFLAG antibody does not stain in live cells, consistent with a cytosolic orientation of the FATP1 carboxyl terminus. By contrast, HA staining is observed on the surface of live FATPnHA cells, consistent with an orientation of the amino-terminal residues toward the extracellular space. The intensity of plasma membrane staining of live FATPnHA cells is small compared with the staining of fixed permeabilized cells, consistent with inefficient trafficking of the overexpressed protein to the plasma membrane. Localization of FATPnHA at the plasma membrane of these cells is also observed by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig.6). Gold particles are associated with the outer aspect of the plasma membrane, consistent with localization of the HA epitope at the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane. Staining was also observed on intracellular membranes in FATPnHA cells (data not shown). The staining in these cells was specific because it was not observed in the parental NIH 3T3 cells.Figure 6Immunoelectron micrographs of plasma membrane FATP1. NIH 3T3 cells expressing FATPnHA were fixed, embedded in gelatin, infused with sucrose, and sectioned. The sections were immunolabeled using primary αHA and secondary 18-nm gold-coupled anti-mouse IgG. Shown is the periphery of two representative cells with distinct labeling at the extracellular aspect of the plasma membrane (arrows). Bars, 200 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the orientation of the termini of FATP1, we carried out protease protection studies on sealed membrane vesicles from cells expressing FATPnHA (Fig. 7). These microsomes are closed vesicles with a cytoplasmic-side-out orientation (24Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protease treatment selectively digests proteins that face the cytosol. Protein epitopes that reside within the membrane, the ER lumen (in the secretory pathway), or the extracellular space (at the plasma membrane) are protected from digestion in the absence of detergent. Upon trypsin treatment of the vesicles, full-length FATP1 is digested to yield a 37-kDa protected polypeptide. This fragment is detected by Western blot analysis using an HA antibody, but not antibodies directed against FATP1 residues 628–40 that lie close to the carboxyl terminus. Control Western blots using an antibody to the lumenal PDI show that vesicles remain sealed at the trypsin concentrations used. The HA epitope and PDI are not inherently protease-resistant, because they are digested when membrane are disrupted with detergent prior to trypsin treatment. We have also observed similar patterns of protease sensitivity in 3T3L1 adipocytes expressing FATPnHA (data not shown). These results are consistent with a topology model in which the amino terminus of FATP1 is either imbedded within the membrane or faces the extracellular/vesicular space, and the carboxyl terminus faces the cytosol. To evaluate an internal region of FATP1 between the amino and carboxyl termini, we performed protease protection and immunofluorescence studies of FATPnHA-expressing cells using an antiserum raised against FATP1 amino acid residues 455–470. Western blot analysis of trypsin-treated membrane vesicles shows that this epitope is readily degraded by treatment with trypsin at concentrations that leave the lumenal PDI intact (Fig. 7). These results suggest a cytosolic location for residues 455–470. We also affinity-purified the antiserum directed against FATP1 residues 455–470 and used it to stain fixed permeabilized cells (Fig. 8). A reticular pattern of staining is observed, consistent with FATP1 membrane association. Because this antiserum stained cells permeabilized with either saponin or Triton X-100, amino acids 455–470 are likely to face the cytosol. These findings are in agreement with selective permeabilization immunofluorescence studies. In another approach to map the topology of FATP1, we evaluated the glycosylation status of native and inserted asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation sites in FATP1. Glycosylation of such sites would indicate an orientation toward the lumenal/extracellular space. The native FATP1 sequence contains potential N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 330, 393, and 518. We examined FATP1 produced by in vitrotranscription/translation (in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and dog pancreatic microsomes), FATP1 overexpressed in fibroblasts, and FATP1 natively expressed in adipocytes. When treated with N-glycosidase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, FATP1 shows no shift in electrophoretic mobility compared with nonglycosidase treated samples (data not shown). Thus potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the native FATP1 sequence are not utilized. Additionally, w"

The β integrin subunit cytoplasmic domain is essential for transmission of many of these signals and overexpression of an unpaired β tail in cultured cells inhibits endogenous integrins. Unlike vertebrates, which have at least nine β subunit genes, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans expresses only one β subunit (βpat-3), and a null mutation in this gene causes embryonic lethality. To determine the functions of integrins during larval development and in adult tissues, we have taken a dominant negative approach by expression of an HA-βtail transgene composed of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag extracellular domain connected to the βpat-3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Expression of this transgene in muscle and gonad, major sites of integrin expression, caused a variety of phenotypes dependent on the level of transgene expression. Abnormalities in body wall and sex muscles led to uncoordinated movement and egg-laying defects. Significant anomalies in migration and pathfinding were caused by tissue-specific expression of HA-βtail in the distal tip cells (DTC), the cells that direct gonad morphogenesis. A pat-3gene with Tyr to Phe mutations in the cytoplasmic domain was able to rescue pat-3 null animals but also showed DTC migration defects.

Mechanical and chemical signals provided by the ECM are transduced primarily through integrin adhesion receptors (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Integrins are transmembrane heterodimers composed of α and β subunits that play a central role in integrating bidirectional information between the ECM and the inside of the cell. Binding of integrins to ECM ligands leads to receptor clustering at focal adhesions where connections to the actin cytoskeleton are formed (4Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In vitro binding studies and expression of mutant integrins have implicated specific β cytoplasmic tail sequences in the linkage to actin filaments (5LaFlamme S.E. Homan S.M. Bodeau A.L. Mastrangelo A.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two α (PAT-2 and INA-1) integrins and one β (PAT-3) integrin are expressed in many tissues, including muscles, neurons, and gonad (6Gettner S.N. Kenyon C.

In body wall muscles, βpat-3 integrins are localized to muscle attachment sites called dense bodies (9Hresko M.C. Williams B.D. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Attachment of muscle cells to the nearby hypodermis is essential for muscle filament assembly and function and attachment defects caused by αpat-2 and βpat-3 loss-of-function alleles give a paralyzed andarrested at two-fold (Pat) embryonic phenotype (10Williams B.D. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition to integrins, many cytoskeletal and signaling molecules such as DEB-1/vinculin (11Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), talin (12Moulder G.L. Huang M.M. Waterston R.H. Barstead R.J. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) are colocalized to muscle dense bodies showing their similarity to vertebrate focal adhesions. α and β cytoplasmic tails appear to regulate each other's activities and, in the absence of ligand, the β integrin tail is unable to interact with cytoskeletal components (14Briesewitz R. Kern A. Marcantonio E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the β integrin cytoplasmic domain alone contains sufficient information for focal adhesion localization of single subunit chimeric proteins consisting of the β cytoplasmic domain attached to a heterologous extracellular and transmembrane domain (15LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, known non-lethal mutations in C. elegansintegrin genes reside in the extracellular domains (7Baum P.D. Garriga G.

In this study, we have disrupted integrin functions by expression of the PAT-3 cytoplasmic tail and by rescue of pat-3 embryonic lethality with various mutantpat-3 alleles. Phenotypes were characterized in C. elegans larvae and adults. We find that integrin cytoplasmic domain function is important for development and function of multiple nematode tissues throughout the life cycle. Primers homologous to positions 2228–2245 and 2445–2464 and spanning the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the βpat-3 cDNA (6Gettner S.N. Kenyon C. Reichardt L.F. J.

The primers introduced anNheI site at the 5′-end and a PstI site at the 3′-end. The resulting 289-bp NheI-PstI PCR product, which includes a 53-bp intron between 2388 and 2389, was ligated to the 3′-end of a 96-bp XbaI fragment containing three tandem hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags (26Wilson I.A.

TheXbaI-PstI fragment was completely sequenced and inserted along with a PstI-XbaI fragment containing the unc-54 3′-UTR and transcription termination sequences (27Fire A. Harrison S.W. Dixon D.

Site-directed mutagenesis ofost-1::HA-βtail to generate plasmids encoding HA-βΔ and HA-βΔ15 used degenerate oligonucleotide primers to insert TAA termination codons at the indicated positions (see Fig. 1). HA-βYYFF, HA-βY792F, and HA-βY804F were produced using degenerate primers with TAC to TTC codons changing tyrosine to phenylalanine. HA-βtail cDNA was also inserted downstream of thelag-2 promoter in the plasmid pJK590 (gift of Dr. Judith Kimble). Forward and reverse primers, 5′-ATGGTACCTCATTCGCCGTCCAAGATGCG3-′ and 5′-AGGGTACCTTTTTTTCTAGAGCACGTACG3-′, respectively, were used in PCR amplification of the N-terminal HA tag, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of βpat-3, and unc-54 3′-UTR and transcription termination sequences using pOST-HAβ as a template. The primers introduced KpnI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends. This PCR product was ligated into a KpnI site between thelag-2 promoter and the GFP coding sequence. The resulting construct, pLAG-HAβ, does not express GFP. Transgenic lines were established by microinjecting mixtures of pRF4 carrying rol-6 co-injection marker (100 μg/ml) and pOST-HAβ plasmids (2 μg/ml) or pLAG-HAβ (10 μg/ml) into the gonads of N2 wild type hermaphrodites (30Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). F1 transgenics were picked and F2 progeny were scored for the presence of HA-βtail-dependent phenotypes other than Rol. F2 transgenics from two independent injections were analyzed and counted. Two integrated transgenic lines, JE0025 mwIs25 and JE0034 mwIs34, were established by X-irradiation of JE1224 N2;mwEx1224[ost-1::HA-βtail] as described previously (31Mello C. Fire A. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Methods in Cell Biology. 48. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 452-482Google Scholar). Forlag-2::HA-βtail, F2–F8 progeny from two independent injections were scored for defects in gonad migration. Nematodes were cultivated on nematode growth medium agar plates with OP50 bacteria according to standard techniques (32Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize phenotypes caused by transgene expression, F2 progeny of F1 Rol transgenic hermaphrodites were scored. For each injected plasmid, progeny from two or more F1 Rol adults were scored for transgenic phenotypes. Phenotypes included Pat (paralyzed arrested at two-fold) embryos, Unc (uncoordinated) animals, which became paralyzed during larval or adult stages, Egl (egg-laying defective) animals with the “bag of worms” phenotype, and Emb eggs, which did not hatch and were arrested before the two-fold stage. To analyze gonad morphology, young adult transgenic hermaphrodites were mounted in a drop of M9 buffer containing 0.25 mmlevamisole (Sigma Chemical Co.) on a coverslip coated with 2% agarose and examined using a Nikon Diaphot microscope with DIC optics. Images were captured with an NEC video camera using IMAGE (version 1.61, National Institutes of Health) software. DNA organization in the gonads was monitored by staining transgenics with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml) and visualizing them with a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Images were captured using an Optronics cooled charge-coupled device camera and Adobe PhotoShop (version 5.0). DTC migration defects and oocyte accumulation in the proximal gonads were identified using DIC microscopy of young adult hermaphrodites. Defects such as inappropriate or extra turns, migration in the wrong direction, or aberrant stops were counted as DTC migration anomalies. Oocyte accumulation was scored when oocytes were present in a non-linear arrangement in the proximal gonad. A 12-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the entire pat-3 gene plus 4.8 and 1.7 kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequence, respectively, was excised from cosmid ZK1058 withPstI and BsrB1 restriction enzymes and cloned between PstI and SmaI sites of pSP73 to generate pPAT3-PB12K. Site-directed mutagenesis of pPAT3-PB12K to generate pPAT3-Y804F and pPAT3-YYFF was performed using the overlap extension method. Briefly, pOST-HAβY804F and pOST-HAβYYFF were used as templates for PCR amplification of the segment encoding the mutant cytoplasmic tails. A second PCR product encoding the 3′-UTR ofpat-3 was amplified. After overlap extension, the product was digested with MscI and EcoRI, and the resulting 754-bp MscI-EcoRI fragment was inserted into pPAT3-PB12K. Rescue of pat-3(st564) was performed by injecting 10 μg/ml pPAT3-PB12K, pPAT3-Y2F, or pPAT3-YYFF into RW3600pat-3(st564)/qC1 dpy-19(e1259) glp-1(q339)III heterozygotes with 100 μg/ml pTG96sur-5::GFP (a gift of Dr. Min Han) (33Gu T. Orita S. Han M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4556-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as a co-injection marker. Viable green fluorescent progeny were identified as rescued lines if they segregated non-Dpy, non-green Pat, and viable green progeny. Three rescued lines, designated JE0443RW3600; mwEx443[pat-3, sur-5::GFP], JE0031 RW3600; mwEx31[pat-3(Y804F), sur-5::GFP], and JE0032 RW3600; mwEx32[pat-3(YYFF), sur-5::GFP], were generated and used for further analysis. To determine the level of transgene expression, five transgenic adults from each phenotypic category (Unc, Egl, and Rol) were lysed in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Ascites fluid containing 12CA5 anti-HA antibodies was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagents (Pierce). To localize HA-βtail, N2 and transgenics were frozen on poly-l-lysine-coated slides and fixed with methanol and acetone (−20 °C) for 5 min. Fixed animals were stained with 12CA5 anti-HA antibodies (1:400 dilution) or MH25 (1:250 dilution) anti-PAT-3 antibodies (34Francis R. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) for 4 h at room temperature followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:750 overnight at 4 °C. Cytoskeletal organization of muscle cells was examined by staining fixed animals with 0.2 unit/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature. HA-βtail, PAT-3, and actin filaments were visualized with a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped for epifluorescence. To determine the tissue-specific functions of βpat-3 cytoplasmic domain interactions in C. elegans, a chimeric transgene was prepared containing the PAT-3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains connected to a heterologous hemagglutinin extracellular domain. The transgene was inserted into ost-1in-frame with and immediately following the first exon, which encodes the signal sequence and first five amino acids of the extracellular matrix protein SPARC (29Schwarzbauer J.E. Spencer C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). SPARC is expressed at high levels in nematode gonads and body wall and sex muscles in embryonic, larval, and adult animals (28Fitzgerald M.C. Schwarzbauer J.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1285-1288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schwarzbauer J.E. Spencer C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These tissues are also major sites ofpat-3 expression (6Gettner S.N. Kenyon C. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, this system will allow us to examine the transdominant effects of HA-βtail transgene expression on endogenous integrin functions. In addition to HA-βtail, we also generated HA-βΔ lacking the entire βpat-3 cytoplasmic domain and HA-βΔ15 missing the C-terminal 15 amino acids of the tail (Fig.1). Transgenic nematodes were generated by co-injection of individual HA-βtail constructs with pRF4 containing rol-6(su1006dm) as dominant marker into N2 wild type nematodes. Transgenic F1 animals were allowed to self-fertilize, and F2 progeny were examined for phenotypes associated with expression of the HA-βtail transgene. Phenotypes of varying severity were observed in more than half of the transgenics (Fig.2, TableI). In the most severe defect, embryos showed a Pat phenotype with arrested elongation at about the 2-fold stage (Fig. 2A). The Pat phenotype paralleled the defects observed in pat-3 animals indicating that overexpression of the transgene has a dominant negative effect on the function of endogenous integrins. More than a quarter of the transgenics were uncoordinated (Unc) and developed a progressive dystrophy and adult paralysis with significantly reduced mobility throughout larval and adult stages. The least severe overt phenotype was an egg-laying (Egl) defect. Sex muscles appeared properly formed and localized as viewed by fluorescent phalloidin staining but were dysfunctional in that egg laying was not increased after stimulation with serotonin. Pat, Unc, and Egl phenotypes result from defects in tissues coexpressing endogenous integrins and the HA-βtail transgene. Mutations in other integrin-associated proteins such as vinculin (11Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), perlecan (35Rogalski T.M. Williams B.D. Mullen G.P. Moerman D.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and laminin (36Kramer J.M. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II.

Open table in a new tab To verify the specificity of the defects, HA-βΔ and HA-βΔ15 F2 animals were also analyzed. More than half of the HA-βtail transgenic nematodes had either Unc or Egl phenotypes with a lesser number of Pat. In the complete absence of a β cytoplasmic domain, HA-βΔ transgenic animals showed no significant phenotypes (Table I). In cultured cells, deletion of the C-terminal 15 amino acids of the β1 subunit results in decreased localization to focal adhesions (37Marcantonio E.E. Guan J.L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 106: 1765-1772Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A lower percentage of HA-βΔ15 animals displayed Pat, Unc, and Egl phenotypes compared with HA-βtail F2 progeny (TableI). These results demonstrate a requirement for the cytoplasmic tail in development of these phenotypes and show that a deletion that can affect integrin subcellular localization yields less dramatic effects. The relationship between transgene expression and phenotype was determined by examining the level of HA-βtail protein in animals with different phenotypes. Equal numbers of Unc, Egl, Rol, and wild type N2 animals were picked, lysed in SDS gel sample buffer, and used for immunoblots with an anti-HA antibody. Fig. 2Bshows that Unc animals had the highest level of HA-βtail protein whereas lower levels were found in Egl and still lower in Rol animals. Thus the severity of the phenotype correlates with the level of transgene expression. Two HA-βtail-integrated lines were established by gamma irradiation,mwIs25[ost-1::HA-βtail] andmwIs34[ost-1::HA-βtail]. AlthoughmwIs25 animals had a low penetrance of overt phenotypes,mwIs34 transgenics showed reduced fecundity and severe defects in morphogenesis and locomotion, typical of Unc animals. The expression levels of HA-βtail in these established lines also corresponded with phenotype severity, because mwIs34 had a significantly higher level of HA-βtail protein than mwIs25(not shown). HA-βtail protein was distributed throughout the body wall muscle in alignment with parallel muscle filaments in mwIs34 Unc animals (Fig.3A). Although some diffuse staining was apparent, there was also a dotted pattern indicative of localization to dense bodies. A regularly repeated pattern of dense body staining was also observed in wild type nematodes stained for endogenous integrins with the MH25 monoclonal antibody against the PAT-3 extracellular domain (Fig. 3B). In HA-βtail transgenic muscle, endogenous βpat-3 localization appeared more irregularly spaced and less well ordered than in wild type (Fig. 3,B and C) suggesting an effect of the transgene product on dense body organization. mwIs34 muscles also had severely disorganized and unevenly distributed actin filaments (Figs.4, A and B). Together, these results show that the HA-βtail protein disrupts endogenous integrin and body muscle filament organization, at least in part through co-localization to dense bodies.Figure 4Actin filament organization in N2 andHA-βtail transgenic animals.Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was used to stain actin filament structures in N2 (A) and HA-βtail transgenic (B) animals. Compared with wild type, actin filaments are disorganized in HA-βtail transgenics.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The adult hermaphrodite gonad consists of two U-shaped tubular arms surrounded by sheath cells and connected proximally to the spermathecae (38Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). At the distal end of each arm, the distal tip cell (DTC) navigates gonad migration during development and determines germ cell polarity from proliferative in the distal arm through meiosis to oocyte formation in the loop region (39Blelloch R. Newman C. Kimble J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig.5A). Comparison of gonads frommwIs34 nematodes with wild type N2 and HA-βΔ animals demonstrated that HA-βtail expression induced significant defects in gonad morphology. In one-third of HA-βtail hermaphrodite gonad arms, misdirected DTC migration along the dorsal trajectory was observed (Fig. 5, B and C, TableII). Typical pathfinding defects included extra turns, dorsal to ventral migration, looping back, and posterior instead of anterior migration. Gonad elongation along the ventral body wall in response to UNC-6 cues appeared normal as did the change in trajectory from ventral to dorsal.Table IIPercent of gonad arms with migration defectsStrainTotal gonad armsaThe percentage of total gonad arms showing DTC migration defects. 70 to 106 hermaphrodite gonad-arms were scored for each line.Anterior armPosterior armHA-βtail341717lag-2∷HA-βtail331617HA-βΔ633ina-1(gm144)512031ced-10(n1993)411724pat-3 wild-type1468pat-3(YYFF)493316pat-3(Y804F)522329a The percentage of total gonad arms showing DTC migration defects. 70 to 106 hermaphrodite gonad-arms were scored for each line. Open table in a new tab DTC pathfinding defects could arise from disruption of integrin functions within the DTC or from effects on the cells that form the DTC migratory path. To determine whether the HA-βtail effects on DTC migration are cell autonomous, transgenic animals were prepared with the HA-βtail transgene under control of the DTC-specific promoter from lag-2. lag-2::HA-βtail animals also showed a significant proportion of DTC migration defects (Table II, Fig.5D). Together, these results indicate that endogenous integrin function is required in the DTC for pathfinding along the dorsal body wall during gonad morphogenesis. Gonad migration defects have also been attributed to certain mutant alleles of ina-1, which encodes an α integrin subunit (7Baum P.D. Garriga G. Neuron. 1997; 19: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and ced-10, which encodes an Rac GTPase (40Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Comparison of gonad morphologies of ced-10 (not shown) andina-1 mutant hermaphrodites (Fig. 5E) tomwIs34 animals showed similar pathfinding defects along the dorsal body wall. Furthermore, similar percentages of defective gonad arms were counted for transgenic and mutant hermaphrodites (Table II). The similarities in gonad morphology between ina-1 mutants and the HA-βtail overexpression phenotype indicate that integrins are important for normal DTC pathfinding. Furthermore, perturbation of either ligand binding, as in the ina-1 mutant, or integrin-mediated intracellular signaling with HA-βtail expression caused similar defects. Gonad function was also compromised by blocking endogenous integrins. More than 80% of mwIs34 animals showed oocyte accumulation in the proximal gonad (Fig.6A). A corresponding defect in DNA organization was observed in these oocytes by DAPI staining. Wild type germ nuclei in the pachytene stage showed the characteristic DNA staining pattern (38Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) and mwIs34 germ cell DNA appeared normal in the distal gonad arm (Fig. 6, B and C). In sharp contrast, proximal arms were filled with clumped nuclear staining (Fig. 6C) typical of polyploid nuclei that result from failure of oocytes to progress through the spermatheca during ovulation (41Schedl T. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 241-270Google Scholar).

We have demonstrated previously that mitochondrially derived glutamate participates directly in the stimulation of insulin exocytosis. The aim of the present study was to impose altered cellular glutamate levels by overexpression of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) to repress elevation of cytosolic glutamate. INS-1E cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding GAD65 showed efficient overexpression of the GAD protein with a parallel increase in enzyme activity. In control cells glutamate levels were slightly increased by 7.5 mm glucose (1.4-fold) compared with the effect at 15 mm (2.3-fold)versus basal 2.5 mm glucose. Upon GAD overexpression, glutamate concentrations were no longer elevated by 15 mm glucose as compared with controls (−40%). Insulin secretion was stimulated in control cells by glucose at 7.5 mm (2.5-fold) and more efficiently at 15 mm(5.2-fold). INS-1E cells overexpressing GAD exhibited impaired insulin secretion on stimulation with 15 mm glucose (−37%). The secretory response to 30 mm KCl, used to raise cytosolic Ca2+ levels, was unaffected. Similar results were obtained in perifused rat pancreatic islets following adenovirus transduction.

Initially, mitochondrial metabolism generates ATP, which promotes the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and, as a consequence, the depolarization of the plasma membrane (4Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This leads to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and a rise in cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]c)1triggering insulin exocytosis (4Rorsman P.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the Ca2+signal alone is not sufficient to reproduce the complete and sustained secretion elicited by glucose (7Gembal M.

Therefore, glucose metabolism must generate other factors participating in the stimulation of insulin secretion. Such metabolites may be generated in different compartments, the mitochondrion being the most likely source (10Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. Prentki M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130 (suppl.): 299S-304SCrossref Google Scholar, 11Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 49-56Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Schuit F.C. Huypens P. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In permeabilized INS-1 cells, mitochondrial activation is associated with a marked stimulation of insulin release, which depends both on activation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and on provision of carbons for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (13Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B.

Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This was deduced from the finding that in permeabilized cells under conditions of permissive, clamped [Ca2+]c, glutamate directly stimulated insulin exocytosis (14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). It was concluded that glutamate acts downstream of mitochondrial function, participating in the coupling of glucose metabolism to insulin secretion (11Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 49-56Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Glutamate can be formed in the mitochondria from the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase (17Hudson R.C. Daniel R.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 106: 767-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the beta cell, we have shown that glutamate is generated by the mitochondria during glucose stimulation (14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Wollheim C.B. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although such changes have not been observed by others (18MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34025-34027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The inherent problem in studies on cellular glutamate contents is the absence of methods allowing determination of glutamate levels in the relevant cellular compartment,i.e. the cytosol. Hence, because the net cellular changes are still controversial (11Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 49-56Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34025-34027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), further substantiation of the role of glutamate requires modulation of its cytosolic levels, which is the aim of the present study. Results obtained with a transgenic mouse model have indirectly highlighted the putative role of intracellular glutamate in insulin secretion. In these mice, overexpression of the glutamate-decarboxylating enzyme GAD65 in the beta cells resulted in glucose intolerance without any sign of insulitis or loss of beta cells. Their islets showed impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas the response to the Ca2+-raising agent KCl was preserved (19Shi Y. Kanaani J. Menard-Rose V. Ma Y.H. Chang P.-Y. Hanahan D. Tobin A. Grodsky G. Baekkeskov S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E684-E694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the authors have not measured the glutamate levels in the pancreatic islets of these transgenic mice, they discussed the possibility of reduced cellular glutamate levels as one possible explanation for the diminished response to glucose. Hence, the decrease in cellular glutamate levels can theoretically be achieved by overexpression of glutamate decarboxylase. Upon appropriate expression, this cytosolic enzyme decarboxylates glutamate produced by the mitochondria after its release into the cytosol. Consequently, cytosolic glutamate could be specifically reduced even during glucose stimulation without affecting major metabolic pathways. The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) thus formed is not believed to affect insulin secretion (20Gilon P. Bertrand G. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Remacle C. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2521-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study the smaller isoform of glutamate decarboxylase, GAD65, predominantly expressed in rat pancreatic islets (21Kim J. Richter W. Aanstoot H.J. Shi Y. Fu Q. Rajotte R. Warnock G. Baekkeskov S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been overexpressed in rat insulinoma INS-1E cells and rat pancreatic islets. To control the expression of GAD65 a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding GAD65 was prepared. Overexpression of GAD65 in beta cells resulted in reduced glutamate levels and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Clonal INS-1E cells (22Janjic D. Maechler P. Sekine N. Bartley C.

Adenovirus amplification was performed in HEK-293 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Adherent cultured INS-1E cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus for 90 min at 37 °C, washed once, and further cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 18–20 h before experiments were performed. Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion from male Wistar rats weighing 200–250 g (24Pralong W.F. Spat A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

The recombinant human 65-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) was used for the adenovirus construct (25Karlsen A.E. Hagopian W.A. Grubin C.E. Dube S. Disteche C.M. Adler D.A.

Following BamHI-XbaI digestion, the insert with blunt ends was subcloned in a cosmid pAdCAG (27Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The presence and right orientation of the insert was checked by restriction enzyme digestions using ClaI andBglII. The cosmid containing hGAD65 (pAd-CAG-hGAD65) and the adenovirus type 5 DNA terminal protein complex were co-transfected using the calcium phosphate method (CellPhect, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in HEK-293 cells, which were seeded in 96-well plates. Ten days after transfection the cell lysate was used to infect 24-well plates, and the adenoviral DNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed by DNA digestion with ClaI and XhoI to check for the presence of hGAD65. The cell lysate containing the virus with full-length hGAD65 (AdCA-GAD65) was used to infect two 138-mm dishes of HEK-293 cells. The virus was purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation. AdCA-lacZ, which expresses bacterial β-galactosidase, was used as a control adenovirus. Cultured INS-1E cells were infected with different clones of recombinant adenovirus (from HEK-293 cell homogenates) for 90 min in a tissue culture incubator the day prior to analysis. Immunoblotting was performed following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10-μg proteins of INS-1E cell extract per lane on an 11% gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of rabbit anti-GAD polyclonal antibody (1:2000) raised against human GAD65 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the GAD protein was revealed by chemiluminescence (Pierce). The adenovirus clone 11 was selected, purified, and used for the following experiments. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on polyornithine-treated glass coverslips for 3 days prior to infection with AdCA-LacZ or AdCA-GAD (∼100 PFU/cell) for 90 min. The next day, cells were fixed as previously described (29Maechler P. Jornot L. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) before incubation with anti-GAD (1:1000) and then goat anti-rabbit IgG rhodamine (1:200) antibodies (Chemicon). Cells were viewed using a Zeiss laserscan confocal 410 microscope. INS-1E cells were cultured 2–3 days in 6-well plates, infected with AdCA-GAD65 or AdCA-lacZ in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium for 90 min at ∼40 PFU/ml, and thereafter supplemented with fresh medium. After 18 h the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected with a rubber policeman in 50 μl of a lysis buffer (0.5 mHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmaminoethylisothiouronium bromide hydrobromide, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Triton X-100), and kept on ice for 1 h in 1.5-ml tubes. Cells were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to eliminate cellular membranes. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and diluted 1:10 in lysis buffer without Triton before protein determination (Bradford's assay). Aliquots (100 μl) of this protein sample were injected into cups containing 100 μl of a glutamate mixture (0.5 mHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 2 mm glutamate, 0.1 μCi ofl-[1-14C]glutamate (ARC, St. Louis, MO)), and placed in sealed vials. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 7% perchloric acid, and CO2 was captured by the addition of 300 μl of benzethonium hydroxide. Diluted lysis buffer was used as a blank. After 5 h the cups were removed and 10 ml of scintillation liquid was added to the vials. After 24 h the radioactivity was measured in a β counter (LS6500, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). For cellular glutamate determination INS-1E cells were cultured 2–3 days in 10-cm Petri dishes, infected with AdCA-GAD65 or AdCA-lacZ for 90 min, and supplemented with fresh medium. After 18 h the cells were preincubated for 2 h in glucose- and glutamine-free RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH) containing (in mm): 135 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 NaHCO3, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, and 2.5/7.5 or 15 glucose. The stimulation period was stopped by putting the cells on ice. After discarding the incubation buffer 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CDTA, 0.2% Tween 20) was added to the cells. Glutamate levels were measured in cell homogenates by monitoring NADH fluorescence as previously described (14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). INS-1E cells were cultured 2–3 days, infected with AdCA-GAD65 or AdCA-lacZ for 90 min at ∼40 PFU/ml, and used for experiments the next day. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured as described (13Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using rhodamine-123. Cells were used as a suspension in KRBH buffer, gently stirred in a fluorimeter cuvette at 37 °C, and fluorescence, excited at 490 nm, was measured at 530 nm. Cytosolic ATP levels were monitored in cells expressing the ATP-sensitive bioluminescent probe luciferase following infection with the specific viral construct (30Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Ishihara I. Wollheim C.B Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79 (abstr.): 187Google Scholar). ATP generation was also assessed in 6-well plates following a 2-h preincubation period in glucose-free RPMI 1640. Cells were incubated for 10 min in KRBH with 2.5 mm or 15 mm glucose before the stimulation was stopped on ice by washing with ice-cold KRBH and the addition of 0.4 nHClO4. ATP levels were determined using a bioluminescence assay kit (HS II, Roche Diagnostic, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates were infected over a 90-min period with either AdCA-GAD65 or AdCA-LacZ adenovirus at ∼40 PFU/cell and assayed the next day. Prior to the experiments, cells were maintained for 2 h in glucose- and glutamine-free culture medium. The cells were then washed and preincubated further in glucose-free KRBH, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) added as carrier, before the incubation period (30 min at 37 °C) with different glucose concentrations or KCl. For GABA experiments, cells were cultured and incubated in the same way except for adenovirus infection. Isolated rat islets were infected with either AdCA-GAD65 or AdCA-LacZ adenovirus over a 90-min period the day after isolation and further cultured for 24 h before the secretion assay. Islet perifusions were carried out using 20 islets per chamber of 250 μl volume thermostated at 37 °C (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). The flux was set at 0.5 ml/min, and fractions were collected every minute following a 20-min washing period at basal glucose (2.8 mm). Insulin secretion was determined by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard (14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Where applicable, the results were expressed as means ± S.E., and differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t test. Several clones of adenoviruses were amplified in HEK-293 cells before testing their ability to overexpress GAD65 in target cells. Insulinoma INS-1E cells cultured in 6-well plates for 4 days were infected over a 90-min period with homogenates of HEK-293 cells used to amplify adenovirus. Immunoblotting performed the next day using anti-human GAD65 antibody revealed a band at the expected size of 65 kDa. As shown on one representative immunoblot (Fig.1A), clone 11 gave a clean signal at 65 kDa detected as a likely doublet (32Namchuk M. Lindsay L. Turck C.W. Kanaani J. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1548-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus was further validated by DNA digestion and selected for virus amplification, purification, and use throughout the study. This virus preparation was then referred to as AdCA-GAD65. The control adenovirus, which expresses bacterial β-galactosidase, was called AdCA-LacZ. Cellular localization of GAD65 in control and INS-1E cells infected with AdCA-GAD65 was investigated by immunofluorescence performed the day after a 90-min infection using purified virus preparations. Reetzet al. (33Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) have shown that in pancreatic beta cells GAD is localized around synaptic-like microvesicles, probably without direct connection. Immunofluorescence on control INS-1E cells using anti-GAD65 antibody revealed a punctuate pattern for these cells expressing only basal levels of GAD65, suggesting co-localization with vesicles (Fig.1B). In contrast, cells overexpressing GAD65 following AdCA-GAD65 infection exhibited strong, diffuse fluorescence mainly in the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 1C). INS-1E cells were infected with either AdCA-GAD65 or AdCA-LacZ adenovirus and analyzed the next day. GAD activity in cell extracts was measured as the GAD-mediated decarboxylation ofl-[1-14C]glutamate to14CO2. It was dramatically increased by overexpression of GAD65 (Fig.2A). Infection of INS-1E cells with the control AdCA-LacZ virus did not modify GAD activity, neither at 40 PFU/cell nor at 400 PFU/cell, compared with non-infected cells (0.09 ± 0.03 pmol of CO2/min/μg of protein). On the other hand, infection with AdCA-GAD65 virus resulted in a marked and dose-dependent increase in GAD activity: 26-fold at 40 PFU/cell and up to 102-fold at 400 PFU/cell compared with corresponding AdCA-LacZ controls (p < 0.0001 for both). These arein vitro, optimal enzyme activities from cell lysates, probably higher than the effective cellular activity. For the following experiments we selected an infection titer of 40 PFU/cell, which was sufficient for high GAD activity without noticeable virus-mediated cell toxicity. Next, cellular glutamate contents were determined, because the aim of overexpressing GAD was to affect the cytosolic glutamate levels, especially during glucose stimulation. In control cells (AdCA-LacZ-infected) cellular glutamate content was elevated, as expected, after a 30-min glucose stimulation (Fig. 2B). Compared with 2.5 mm glucose (2.69 ± 0.25 nmol of glutamate/mg of protein), incubation at 7.5 and 15 mmglucose resulted in 1.4-fold (p < 0.05) and 2.3-fold (p < 0.05) glutamate increases, respectively. In cells overexpressing GAD following infection with AdCA-GAD65 virus, the basal levels were reduced by 36% (p < 0.05). Glucose stimulation failed to increase efficiently cellular glutamate contents at both 7.5 and 15 mm glucose. This resulted in a 40% reduction of glutamate levels at 15 mm glucose compared with stimulated control cells (p < 0.02). Using a higher titer of AdCA-GAD65 virus (120 PFU/cell), there was no further decrease of glutamate levels (data not shown). In control cells mitochondrial membrane potential was hyperpolarized by raising glucose from 2.5 to 15 mm and by the addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) resulted in a rapid depolarization. Similar effects were observed in cells overexpressing GAD (Fig. 3A). Activation of the electron transport chain, measured here as the potential of the mitochondrial membrane, leads to the formation of ATP. In accordance with mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP generation was not affected by GAD overexpression. Indeed, cytosolic ATP levels monitored in cells expressing luciferase were elevated to similar extents by raising glucose from 2.5 to 15 mm (Fig. 3B). ATP generation was also measured in cell lysates following a 10-min incubation period at low and high glucose. ATP levels at 15 mm glucose compared with 2.5 mm were elevated by 23.1% (367 ± 5 versus 298 ± 1 nmol/mg of protein, respectively, p < 0.005) in AdCA-LacZ control cells and by 27.9% (413 ± 22 versus 322 ± 14 nmol/mg of protein, respectively, p < 0.05) in AdCA-GAD65 cells (means of three independent experiments). Therefore, GAD overexpression did not alter the activity of the electron transport chain. INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates were infected at ∼40 PFU/cell and assayed the next day. Following a preincubation period and washes in glucose-free buffers, cells were challenged for 30 min with different glucose concentrations. Insulin secretion was also stimulated at basal 2.5 mm glucose with 30 mmKCl, as a Ca2+ raising agent, to assess for anaplerotic effects. In control cells (AdCA-LacZ-infected), raising glucose from basal 2.5 to 7.5 and 15 mm stimulated insulin secretion 2.5-fold (p < 0.05) and 5.2-fold (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 4A). Insulin release at basal (2.5 mm) or intermediate (7.5 mm) glucose concentration was not affected in cells overexpressing GAD (AdCA-GAD65). In contrast, insulin secretion stimulated by 15 mm glucose (2.6-fold versusbasal glucose, p < 0.05) was inhibited by 37% (p < 0.05) compared with the corresponding control at high glucose. The effects of 30 mm KCl on insulin exocytosis were similar in control cells and cells overexpressing GAD. As shown in Fig. 4B, insulin secretion correlated positively with cellular glutamate levels (R2 = 0.8474,p < 0.05), remarkably evident at high glucose concentration. It has been shown that glutamate decarboxylation by GAD forms GABA in pancreatic islets (34Michalik M. Nelson J. Erecinska M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which may be released from synaptic-like microvesicles (35Sorenson R.L. Garry D.G. Brelje T.C. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Smismans A. Schuit F. Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The effect of extracellular GABA on the beta cell is controversial; GABA has been postulated to inhibit insulin secretion (37Kawai K. Unger R.H. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although this effect could not be confirmed (20Gilon P. Bertrand G. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Remacle C. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2521-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing GAD following AdCA-GAD65 infection and stimulation with high glucose could therefore theoretically release significant amounts of GABA with a possible negative feedback on insulin secretion. In this context, it was felt necessary to check for any potential effect of GABA added in the medium during stimulation of insulin secretion. Exposure of INS-1E cells to GABA up to 100 μm did not alter glucose-induced insulin secretion (Fig.5), rendering unlikely a GABA-mediated inhibitory effect on exocytosis in cells overexpressing GAD. Cultured rat islets infected with the control AdCA-LacZ virus responded to glucose stimulation by a sustained increased rate of insulin secretion at 8.3 mm glucose, which rose further at 16.7 mm glucose (Fig.6A). Overexpression of GAD65, assessed by immunoblotting, had no significant effects at basal (2.8 mm) or intermediate (8.3 mm) glucose concentrations. In contrast, at 16.7 mm glucose the secretory response was reduced by 31% in islets infected with AdCA-GAD65 compared with controls (area under the curve = 4.43 ± 0.63 versus 6.41 ± 1.23 (insulin release as % content), respectively, p < 0.05). Stimulation of insulin secretion by high potassium-induced membrane depolarization resulted in a transient elevation of the secretory response in control islets (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of GAD did not modify this non-metabolic response. These results are in accordance with those obtained in the clonal beta cell line INS-1E, i.e. inhibition of insulin secretion stimulated by glucose but not by potassium. The role of GAD in the beta cell is under intense study because it has been recognized as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes (38Baekkeskov S. Aanstoot H.J. Christgau S. Reetz A. Solimena M. Cascalho M. Folli F. Richter-Olesen H. De Camilli P. Nature. 1990; 347: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). GAD65 is the form predominantly expressed in rats and humans, localized mainly in brain and pancreatic islets (21Kim J. Richter W. Aanstoot H.J. Shi Y. Fu Q. Rajotte R. Warnock G. Baekkeskov S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to overexpress GAD65 in beta cells to lower the levels of glutamate through decarboxylation during glucose stimulation. This was achieved by the use of a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding human GAD65 in beta cells. Hence, we could substantiate the proposed role for glutamate as a metabolic coupling factor participating in glucose-induced insulin secretion (14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In pancreatic beta cells, GAD was shown to be associated with synaptic-like microvesicles, although GAD was also found in the cytosol (33Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 39Christgau S. Schierbeck H. Aanstoot H.J. Aagaard L. Begley K. Kofod H. Hejnaes K. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21257-21264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Michalik and co-workers (34Michalik M. Nelson J. Erecinska M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in fractions from homogenates of rat pancreatic islets, GAD activity was mainly recovered in the cytosol (51%) with lesser enrichment in the microsomes (17%). In our study, immunofluorescence of GAD65 revealed a punctuate pattern in control cells, whereas INS-1E cells overexpressing GAD65 exhibited strong cytosolic-like fluorescence. Therefore, it would seem that overexpression of GAD65 does not lead to a noticeable increase in vesicle attachment, essentially accumulating freely in the cytosol. This observation is in agreement with the previous proposal for an indirect or labile interaction of GAD with vesicles (33Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The control of insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell is achieved through a complex metabolic cascade converting glucose and other nutrients into signals leading to appropriate insulin release (3Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,12Schuit F.C. Huypens P. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial metabolism is crucial in generating ATP leading to a rise in [Ca2+]c, which is the main and necessary signal triggering insulin exocytosis (4Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6Lang J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, other factors generated by glucose participate in the stimulation of insulin secretion and have attracted much interest over the last years (9Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). In this context, the beta cells of a transgenic mouse model have recently been reported to exhibit impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose but not to KCl, a [Ca2+]c-raising agent (19Shi Y. Kanaani J. Menard-Rose V. Ma Y.H. Chang P.-Y. Hanahan D. Tobin A. Grodsky G. Baekkeskov S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E684-E694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mice overexpressing GAD65 specifically in beta cells exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and inhibition of insulin secretion in response to glucose, without any insulitis or loss of beta cells. Overexpression of the glutamate-decarboxylating enzyme in beta cells could theoretically lead to decreased cellular glutamate levels. The reduced insulin secretion observed in these mice is compatible with the proposal that mitochondrially derived glutamate participates in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (11Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 49-56Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Glutamate levels in control INS-1E cells were increased following glucose stimulation. Overexpression of GAD65 resulted in high GAD activity and reduced cellular glutamate levels, whereas the mitochondrial activation was preserved. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of specifically reducing cellular glutamate levels mediated by controlled GAD overexpression. This leads to an elevated glutamate decarboxylation rate, essentially in the cytosol (34Michalik M. Nelson J. Erecinska M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The decrease in cellular glutamate levels correlated with impaired insulin secretion stimulated by high glucose. It is noteworthy that the major effects were observed above basal and intermediate glucose concentrations, suggesting a threshold phenomenon for glutamate action. This is compatible with a role of a potentiator for glutamate in conditions of permissive [Ca2+]c. Indeed, the effect of the [Ca2+]c-raising agent (30 mm KCl) was not affected by GAD overexpression, also indicating that exocytosis per se was preserved. Very similar results were obtained using isolated rat pancreatic islets overexpressing GAD. This is in good agreement with pancreatic perfusions performed in mice overexpressing GAD65 in the beta cells, although this study did not examine the glutamate pathway (19Shi Y. Kanaani J. Menard-Rose V. Ma Y.H. Chang P.-Y. Hanahan D. Tobin A. Grodsky G. Baekkeskov S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E684-E694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these data argue in favor of a role for glutamate as a factor derived from glucose participating in the stimulation of insulin secretion. One hypothetical mechanism is that glutamate would favor granule priming for exocytosis, a mechanism which might not be restricted to the beta cell. In this context it is of interest that clonal pancreatic alpha cells, secreting glucagon, have recently been shown to accumulate glutamate in their vesicles and to release it upon stimulation (40Yamada H. Otsuka M. Hayashi M. Nakatsuka S. Hamaguchi K. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The high GAD activity resulting from GAD65 overexpression may substantially increase GABA generation and release. During high glucose culture, GABA was shown to be released from pancreatic beta cells (35Sorenson R.L. Garry D.G. Brelje T.C. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,36Smismans A. Schuit F. Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Once in the extracellular space, GABA could act on neighboring islet alpha cells, inhibiting glucagon secretion through activation of GABA-A receptors (41Rorsman P. Berggren P.O. Bokvist K. Ericson H. Mohler H. Ostenson C.G. Smith P.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Although these receptors have not been identified on beta cells, it has been suggested that GABA inhibits insulin secretion in dogs (37Kawai K. Unger R.H. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), an effect that could not be reproduced in mice or rats (20Gilon P. Bertrand G. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Remacle C. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2521-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this context, we checked for any potential effect of GABA on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1E cells derived from a rat insulinoma. There was no effect of GABA added to the medium up to 100 μm, a concentration far above the estimate of GABA release by beta cells (35Sorenson R.L. Garry D.G. Brelje T.C. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Smismans A. Schuit F. Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study the overexpression of GAD65 was used to test the proposed role for glutamate as a coupling factor in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The data support the model in which glutamate would act as a potentiator of insulin release, sensitizing exocytosis to the effect of calcium. Indeed, the effect of elevated glucose concentration was inhibited by high GAD activity, whereas intermediate glucose or KCl stimulation was not affected by GAD overexpression. GAD overexpression could also clarify the role of GABA as a paracrine factor in the islet. We thank G. Chaffard and C. Bartley for excellent technical assistance as well as P. A. Antinozzi and F. C.

In the adult, the proliferation rate of endothelial cells is very low compared with that of many other cell types in the body. Physiological exceptions in which angiogenesis occurs under tight regulation are found in the female reproductive system and during wound healing. Uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation is observed in tumor neovascularization and in angioproliferative diseases (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7209) Google Scholar). Tumors cannot grow larger than a few square millimeters as a mass unless a new blood supply is induced (2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7444) Google Scholar). Hence the control of the neovascularization process may affect tumor growth and may represent a novel approach to tumor therapy (3Keshet E. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is controlled by a balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors (4Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Thus, the angiogenic switch represents the net result of the activity of angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors, suggesting that counteracting even a single major angiogenic factor could shift the balance toward inhibition. Major angiogenic factors include, among several others, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2)1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Heparin-binding FGF2 was one of the first of these factors to be characterized (5Presta M. Moscatelli D. Joseph-Silverstein J. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4060-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It induces cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and protease production in cultured endothelial cells (5Presta M. Moscatelli D. Joseph-Silverstein J. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4060-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 6Gualandris A. Urbinati C. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Presta M. J. Cell.

Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4037) Google Scholar). In situhybridization and immunolocalization experiments have shown the presence of FGF2 mRNA and/or protein in neoplastic cells, endothelial cells, and infiltrating cells within human tumors of different origin (9Schulze-Osthoff K. Risau W. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 85-92PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zagzag D. Miller D.C. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. Burstein D.E.

Antisense FGF2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 cDNAs inhibit neovascularization and growth of human melanomas in nude mice (14Wang Y. Becker D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Also, a secreted FGF-binding protein that mobilizes stored extracellular FGF2 can serve as an angiogenic switch for different tumor cell lines, including squamous cell carcinoma and colon cancer cells (15Aigner A. Butscheid M. Kunkel P. Krause E. Lamszus K. Wellstein A. Czubayko F. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, targeting of the FGF-binding protein with specific ribozymes significantly reduces the growth and vascularization of xenografted tumors in mice (16Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G.J. Wellstein A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), despite the high levels of VEGF produced by these cells (discussed in Ref. 17Rak J. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1083-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data are in keeping with the synergistic action exerted by the two growth factors in stimulating angiogenesis (18Goto F. Goto K. Weindel K. Folkman J. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 508-517PubMed Google Scholar, 19Asahara T. Bauters C. Zheng L.P. Takeshita S. Bunting S. Ferrara N. Symes J.F. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1995; 92: 365-371Crossref Google Scholar) and with the observation that modulation of FGF2 expression may allow a fine tuning of the angiogenesis process even in the presence of significant levels of VEGF (20Konerding M.A. Fait E. Dimitropoulou C. Malkusch W. Ferri C. Giavazzi R. Coltrini D. Presta M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1607-1615PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a recombinant adenovirus expressing soluble fibroblast growth factor receptor has been shown to repress tumor growth and angiogenesis (21Compagni A. Wilgenbus P. Impagnatiello M.A. Cotton M. Christofori G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7163-7169PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a significant correlation exists between the presence of FGF2 in cancer cells and advanced tumor stage in human pancreatic (22Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Buchler M. Beger H.G. Uchida E. Onda M. Kobrin M.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5289-5296PubMed Google Scholar), renal (23Slaton J.W. Inoue K. Perrotte P. El-Naggar A.K. Swanson D.A. Fidler I.J. Dinney C.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and colon (24Takahashi Y. Ellis L.M. Wilson M.R. Bucana C.D. Kitadai Y. Fidler I.J. Oncol. Res. 1996; 8: 163-169PubMed Google Scholar) cancer. Also, interferon-α has been shown to inhibit FGF2 synthesis and to accelerate the regression of vascular tumors (25Chang E. Boyd A. Nelson C.C. Crowley D. Law T. Keough K.M. Folkman J. Ezekowitz R.A. Castle V.P. J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 1997; 19: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point to FGF2 as a target for antiangiogenic therapy in tumors. FGF2 exerts its biological activity on endothelial cells by interacting with high affinity tyrosine kinase FGFRs (26Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) and low affinity proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) as polysaccharide (HSPGs) (27Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The physiological effects resulting from the interaction of FGF2 with cell-associated and free HSPGs are manifold. HSPGs protect FGF2 from inactivation in the extracellular environment and modulate the bioavailability of the growth factor (28Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 29Edelman E.R. Nugent M.A. Karnovsky M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, free and cell-associated HSPGs may play contrasting roles in modulating the dimerization of FGF2 and its interaction with FGFRs. For instance, heparin induces FGF2-FGFR interaction in HS-deficient cells (30Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). This interaction relies on the capacity of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) to form a ternary complex by interacting with both proteins (31Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Dell'Era P. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Valsasina B. Presta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In apparent contrast to these observations, heparin inhibits the binding of FGF2 to FGFRs when administered to cells bearing surface-associated HSPGs (33Ishihara M. Tyrrell D.J. Stauber G.B. Brown S. Cousens L.S. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4675-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is probably due to the competition of soluble GAGs with cell-associated HSPGs and FGFRs for binding to FGF2. Thus, the bioavailability and the biological activity of FGF2 on endothelial cells depend strictly on the extracellular GAG milieu, indicating the possibility of modulating the angiogenic activity of FGF2 in vivo by using exogenous GAGs. The capacity of systemically administered, low molecular weight heparin fragments to reduce the angiogenic activity of FGF2 supports this hypothesis (34Norrby K. Ostergaard P. Int. J. Microcirc. Clin. Exp. 1996; 16: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A further implication of this hypothesis is that synthetic molecules and chemically modified heparins able to interfere with the HSPG-FGF2-FGFR interaction may act as angiogenesis inhibitors. In particular, heparin-mimicking, polyanionic compounds able to compete with HSPGs for growth factor interaction may be expected to hamper the binding of FGF2 to the endothelial cell surface, with consequent inhibition of its angiogenic capacity. Among such compounds are 6-O-desulfated heparin (35Lundin L. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Kanda S. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24653-24660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suramin (36Pesenti E. Sola F. Mongelli N. Grandi M. Spreafico F. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), several suramin analogues (37Firsching A. Nickel P. Mora P. Allolio B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4957-4961PubMed Google Scholar), pentosan polysulfate (38Zugmaier G. Lippman M.E. Wellstein A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1716-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and sulfonic acid polymers (39Liekens S. Leali D. Neyts J. Esnouf R. Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Maudgal P.C. De Clercq E. Presta M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The capsular K5 polysaccharide from Escherichia coli has the same structure (→4)-β-d-GlcA-(1→4)-α-d-GlcNAc-1(1→)nas the heparin precursor N-acetyl heparosan (40Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), in which GlcA is glucuronic acid, and GlcNAc is N-acetyl-glucosamine. Previous studies have shown the possibility of generating K5 derivatives by chemical sulfation in N- and/orO-positions (41Casu B. Grazioli G. Razi N. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Torri G. Oreste P. Tursi F. Zoppetti G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 263: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we synthesized various N-, O-, andN,O-sulfated K5 derivatives with different degrees of sulfation. The compounds were then tested for their FGF2 antagonist activity and antiangiogenic capacity. The results demonstrate that a highly N,O-sulfated K5 derivative binds FGF2 and inhibits formation of the HSPG·FGF2·FGFR ternary complex, prevents 125I-FGF2 binding to endothelial cell surface HSPGs and FGFRs, inhibits FGF2-mediated mitogenesis, sprouting, and morphogenesis in cultured endothelial cells, and blocks angiogenesis in the developing chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Human recombinant FGF2 was from Pharmacia-Upjohn (Milan, Italy). Conventional heparin was obtained from a commercial batch preparation of unfractionated sodium heparin from beef mucosa (1131/900 from Laboratori Derivati Organici S.p.A., Milan, Italy) that was purified of contaminants (purity higher than 95%) according to previously described methodologies (42Andriuoli G. D'Altri G. Galimberti G. Sarret M. Zoppetti G. Casu B. Naggi A.M. Oreste P. Torri G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 556: 416-418Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Selectively desulfated heparins were described previously (43Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. di Magagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and were a generous gift of Dr. B. Casu (Ronzoni Institute, Milan, Italy). Type I HS was from Opocrin (Corlo, Italy). Chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate were a gift of Dr. M. Del Rosso (University of Florence, Florence, Italy). All the K5 polysaccharide derivatives (Table I) were obtained from a single batch of K5 polysaccharide prepared from an E. coli cell culture grown for 16 h at 37 °C in a medium containing 2.0 g/liter defatted soy flour, 9.7 g/liter K2HPO4, 2.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter sodium citrate, 0.11 g/liter MgCl2, 1.0 g/liter ammonium sulfate, and 2.0 g/liter glucose, pH 7.3. Conditioned medium was collected and concentrated five times with a 10,000 Da cut-off ultrafiltration membrane. The polysaccharide was recovered after precipitation with 4 volumes of acetone, and proteins were hydrolyzed by a 90-min incubation at 37 °C with protease II from Aspergillus orizae (Sigma) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.15 m EDTA, and 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0. K5 polysaccharide was finally recovered by ultrafiltration and precipitation.Table IChemical characterization of K5 derivativesSampleSO3−/COO−ratioGlc-NSO3−Glc-6SO3−GlcA-OSO3−1-aGlcA2SO3− or GlcA3SO3−.GlcA2,3SO3−Nonsulfated GlcAMolecular weight(%)(%)(%)(%)(%)K50000010030,000K5-NS1.0010000010015,000K5-OS(L)1.41090<100>9014,000K5-OS(H)3.7701000100011,000K5-N,OS(L)1.7010090<100>9013,000K5-N,OS(H)3.841001003070015,00013C NMR spectrum analysis, sulfate/carboxyl ratio (SO3−/COO−) analysis, and molecular weight determination were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a GlcA2SO3− or GlcA3SO3−. Open table in a new tab 13C NMR spectrum analysis, sulfate/carboxyl ratio (SO3−/COO−) analysis, and molecular weight determination were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One g of K5 polysaccharide was suspended at room temperature in 10 ml of anhydrousN,N-dimethylformamide, and then 15 ml ofN,N-dimethylformamide containing 2.4 or 0.7 g of pyridine-sulfotrioxyde complex were added to generate K5-OS(H) and K5-OS(L), respectively. Samples were incubated for 18 h at room temperature and recovered by precipitation with 16 ml of NaCl-saturated acetone. Pellets were dissolved in water and purified from salts by ultrafiltration. One g of K5 polysaccharide was dissolved in 100 ml of 2.0 nNaOH, incubated for 24 h at 60 °C, and cooled to room temperature, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. The solution was warmed up to 40 °C, added in a single step to 1.6 g of sodium carbonate and 1.6 g of pyridine-sulfotrioxyde complex stepwise for 4 h, and incubated for an additional hour at the same temperature. The solution was then brought to room temperature, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5–8.0. TheN-deacetylated/N-sulfated K5 was purified from salts by ultrafiltration, and the sample was dried under a vacuum. N-Deacetylated/N-sulfated K5 was dissolved in 10 ml of water, run through a cation exchange column (IR-120 H+; Bio-Rad) at 10 °C, and neutralized with 15% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in water. After concentration and freeze drying, the sample was dissolved in 40 ml ofN,N-dimethylformamide, and 0.7 or 3.5 g of pyridine-sulfotrioxyde complex in solid form was added to generate K5-N,OS(L) and K5-N,OS(H), respectively. Samples were incubated at 50 °C for 24 h and cooled to 4 °C, and NaCl-saturated acetone was added until precipitation was complete. After filtration, the precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of water with NaCl added until 0.2 m concentration, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5–8.0 with 2.0 n NaOH. The product was recovered by acetone precipitation and ultrafiltration to obtain a 10% solution. Then, samples were warmed up to 40 °C, added in a single step to 1.6 g of sodium carbonate and 1.6 g of pyridine-sulfotrioxyde complex stepwise for 4 h, and incubated for an additional 24 h at the same temperature. Samples were then purified from salts by ultrafiltration. The 13C NMR spectrum analysis, the sulfate/carboxyl ratio analysis, and the molecular weight determination of the different compounds were performed as described previously (44Casu B. Diamantini G.

Human recombinant FGF2 was labeled with Na125I (37 GBq/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Iodogen (Pierce) as described previously (47Coltrini D. Rusnati M. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Grazioli G. Naggi A. Presta M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Heparin was dissolved at 4.0 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 130 mm NaCl (TBS). Then, the heparin solution (50 μl/well) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in non-tissue culture plastic 96-well plates as described previously (48Rusnati M. Taraboletti G. Urbinati C. Tulipano G. Giuliani R. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Sennino B. Giacca M. Tyagi M. Albini A. Noonan D. Giavazzi R. Presta M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1917-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After washing with TBS, 125I-FGF2 was added at 20 ng/ml in the presence of increasing concentrations of the different K5 derivatives. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, bound radioactivity was collected by a 30-min incubation at 50 °C in 2% SDS and measured. Nonspecific binding to bovine serum albumin-coated wells was measured in the absence of any competitor and subtracted from all values. Adult bovine aortic endothelial cells were provided by M. Pepper (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) and grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Wild-type CHO cells, FGFR1-transfected CHO cells, wild-type CHO-K1 cells (a subclone of CHO cells from which HSPG-deficient mutants were originated (49Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), and A745 CHO cell mutants (kindly provided by J. D. Esko, La Jolla, CA) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. A745 CHO cells harbor a mutation that inactivates the xylosyltransferase that catalyzes the first sugar transfer step in GAG synthesis (49Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). FGFR1-transfected CHO cells and the A745 CHOflg-1A clone, both bearing about 30,000 FGFR1 molecules/cell, were generated in our laboratory by transfection with the IIIc variant of murine FGFR1 cDNA (39Liekens S.

Transformed fetal bovine aortic endothelial GM 7373 cells, corresponding to the described BFA-1c 1BPT multilayered transformed clone (47Coltrini D. Rusnati M. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Grazioli G. Naggi A. Presta M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Human Genetic Mutual Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS, vitamins, and essential and nonessential amino acids. Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells at passage 3 (Clonetics) were grown in complete Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 (Clonetics). This assay was performed as described previously (51Richard C. Liuzzo J.P. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24188-24196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, wild-type CHO-K1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 52,000 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cell monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated with 3% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. Fixation was stopped with 0.1m glycine, and cells were washed extensively with PBS. Then, A745 CHO flg-1A cells (52,000 cells/cm2) were added to CHO-K1 monolayers in serum-free medium plus 10 mm EDTA with or without 30 ng/ml FGF2 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the competitor being tested. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, unattached cells were removed by washing twice with PBS, and A745 CHO flg-1A cells bound to the wild-type CHO monolayer were counted under an inverted microscope at ×125 magnification. Adherent A745 CHO flg-1A cells have a rounded morphology and can be easily distinguished from the confluent wild-type CHO monolayer lying underneath on a different plane of focus. Data are expressed as the mean of the cell counts of three microscopic fields chosen at random. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice with similar results. Twenty-four h after plating in 24-well dishes at a density of 70,000 cells/cm2, bovine aortic endothelial cells or FGFR1-transfected CHO cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in binding medium (serum-free medium containing 0.15% gelatin and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) with 30 ng/ml 125I-FGF2 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the compound being tested. Then, after a PBS wash, cells were washed twice with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) to remove 125I-FGF2 bound to low affinity HSPGs and twice with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) to remove 125I-FGF2 bound to high affinity FGFRs (47Coltrini D. Rusnati M. Zoppetti G. Oreste P. Grazioli G. Naggi A. Presta M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 300 μg/ml suramin and subtracted from all values. GM 7373 cells were seeded at 70,000 cells/cm2 in 24-well dishes. Plating efficiency was higher than 90%. After overnight incubation, cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 0.4% FCS and 10 ng/ml FGF2. After 8 h, increasing concentrations of the K5 derivative being tested were added to cell cultures without changing the medium. Sixteen h later, cells were trypsinized and counted in a Burker chamber. Under our experimental conditions, control cultures incubated in 0.4% FCS with or without 10 ng/ml FGF2 underwent 0.1–0.2 and 0.7–0.8 cell population doubling, respectively. Cells grown in 10% FCS underwent 1.0 cell population doubling (52Rusnati M. Urbinati C. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HUVE cells were seeded at 2,500 cells/well in 96-well plates in complete Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2. After 24 h, all cell cultures were incubated in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 plus 2% FCS without FGF2, VEGF, and heparin. Then 30 ng/ml FGF2 was added to wells in the absence or presence of K5 derivatives. After 3 days, cells were stained with crystal violet, and plates were read with a microplate reader at 595 nm. FGF2-T-MAE cell aggregates, prepared on agarose-coated plates exactly as described previously (53Gualandris A. Rusnati M. Belleri M. Nelli E.E. Bastaki M. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Bonardi F. Parolini S.

Immediately after seeding, 250 μl of calcium-free medium containing fibrinogen (2.5 mg/ml) and thrombin (250 milliunits/ml) were added to each well and allowed to gel for 5 min at 37 °C. Then, 500 μl of culture medium with or without K5 derivatives (all at 100 μg/ml) were added on the top of the gel. In all experiments, the fibrinolytic inhibitor trasylol was added to the gel and to the culture medium at 200 KIU/ml to prevent the dissolution of the substrate (53Gualandris A. Rusnati M. Belleri M.

One, designated MACS1, is a novel protein and the other the product of the Sa gene (Sa protein), which is preferentially expressed in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Based on the murine MACS1 sequence, we also identified the location and organization of the human MACS1 gene, showing that the human MACS1 and Sa genes are located in the opposite transcriptional direction within a 150-kilobase region on chromosome 16p13.1. Murine MACS1 and Sa protein were overexpressed in COS cells, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. Among C4–C16 fatty acids, MACS1 preferentially utilizes octanoate, whereas isobutyrate is the most preferred fatty acid among C2–C6 fatty acids for Sa protein. Like Sa gene transcript, MACS1 mRNA was detected mainly in the liver and kidney. Subcellular fractionation revealed that both MACS1 and Sa protein are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. 14C-Fatty acid incorporation studies indicated that acyl-CoAs produced by MACS1 and Sa protein are utilized mainly for oxidation.

Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). AceCS1 is a cytosolic enzyme that provides acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol (7Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol.

In contrast, AceCS2 is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that produces acetyl-CoAs mainly utilized for oxidation (7Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Both AceCS1 and AceCS2 preferentially utilized acetate, but they exhibit almost no activities toward C4–C8 medium-chain fatty acids (7Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Relatively large amounts of medium-chain fatty acid occur in the milk and urine of patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA deficiency, but the metabolism of these fatty acids, utilized by medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (MACS), is poorly understood. The Sa gene is a proposed candidate gene for essential hypertension that was isolated by virtue of its increased expression in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rat compared with the kidney of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat (10Iwai N. Inagami T. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The Sa gene is highly expressed in the hypertensive kidney (11Patel H.R. Thiara A.S. West K.P. Lodwick D.

However, although recent congenic substitution mapping studies have argued that the Sa gene is a candidate gene locus for hypertension (20Hubner N. Lee Y.A. Lindpaintner K. Ganten D. Kreutz R. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the function of the Sa gene remains unclarified. Based on the amino acid sequence similarity of Sa protein with the ACS/AceCS family (9Karan D. David J.R. Capy P. Gene. 2001; 265: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Sagene encodes a MACS. We therefore isolated a murine cDNA for Sa protein, and its expression, purification, and characterization identified it as a MACS. We also isolated and characterized a novel MACS, designated MACS1, using Sa protein cDNA as a probe. In this paper, we describe structural and functional differences, tissue and subcellular distributions, and the gene organization of these two types of MACS. Standard molecular biology and immunochemical techniques were performed essentially as described by Sambrook and Russell (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and Harlow and Lane (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), respectively. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain-termination method with a Dye-Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction FS kit (PE Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer (model 310, PE Biosystems). Total RNA was prepared using standard guanidinium thiocyanate lysis buffer and centrifugation over a cesium chloride cushion. To analyze RNA in murine tissues, commercially available Northern blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used for Northern blot analysis. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by priming with random hexanucleotides. For immunoblotting, polyclonal antibodies against murine MACS1 and Sa protein were used as first antibodies. Antibody binding was detected with a chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA transfection, subcellular fractionation, and 14C-fatty acid incorporation studies were performed as described previously (7Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A near full-length cDNA for murine Sa protein was isolated from a murine kidney cDNA library (7Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) using a murine Sa protein-specific oligonucleotide, 5′-CAACACTGATGCTAGCTAGCT-3′. A near full-length cDNA for MACS1 was also obtained from the kidney cDNA library using Sa protein cDNA as a probe under reduced hybridization conditions. Human MACS1 cDNAs were obtained by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) with human MACS1-specific primers using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Enzyme activities were determined at 37 °C by either an isotopic method or by the spectrophotometric method as described previously (7Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The latter was used only for the purified enzyme. The standard reaction mixture for the isotopic method contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm CoA, and 10 mm14C-labeled (∼1000 cpm/nmol) isobutyrate (for Sa protein) or octanoate (for MACS1) in a total volume of 0.2 ml: octanoate was dissolved in Triton X-100 (final concentration 1% w/v). After 1 min of preincubation at 37 °C, the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme solution. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 30% (w/v) metaphosphoric acid. The reaction product ([14C]acyl-CoA) was isolated as described previously (7Fujino T. Kondo J. Ishikawa M. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11420-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out within the range where the reaction proceeded linearly with time and the initial rate of reaction was proportional to the amount of enzyme added. The protein content was determined by the Lowry method (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C.

Enzyme activities were measured at 37 °C by the isotopic method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values in parentheses were obtained by the spectrophotometric assay using octanoate and isobutylate for MACS1 and Sa protein, respectively. COS-7 cells (80 dishes, 100-mm diameter) transfected with either murine MACS1 or Sa protein were suspended in 30 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 230,000 ×g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used for purification. For purification of MACS1, the following purification steps were carried out. Protein in the 230,000 × g supernatant was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 at 70% saturation and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting precipitate was suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (w/v)), dialyzed against buffer A and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with buffer A, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.25 m KCl in buffer A. Active fractions were combined, dialyzed against buffer A, and then applied to a Butyl-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 30% (NH4)2SO4. After washing with buffer A containing 30% (NH4)2SO4, the column was eluted with a decreasing liner gradient of 30 to 0% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. Active fractions were collected and dialyzed against buffer A and then applied to a Blue-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.0 × 3 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with an increasing liner gradient of 0 to 1 mKCl in buffer A. The fractions exhibiting enzyme activities were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration with Amicon Centriplus 10 (Amicon Inc.), and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (1.6 × 60 cm). The column was eluted with 150 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. Active fractions were collected, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −80 °C. For purification of Sa protein, a similar procedure was followed except that DEAE-Sepharose FF, Butyl-Sepharose FF, and Sephacryl S-200 HR were replaced by Red-Toyopearl (Toso, Tokyo), Phenyl-Sepharose FF, and Butyl-Sepharose FF, respectively. After (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, the enzyme was dialyzed against buffer A and applied to a Red-Toyopearl column (1.5 × 2 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with an increasing linear gradient of 0 to 0.25 m KCl containing buffer A. Active fractions were combined, dialyzed against buffer A, and applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 30% (NH4)2SO4. After washing with buffer A containing 30% (NH4)2SO4, the column was eluted with a decreasing gradient from 30 to 0% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. Other column chromatography steps were carried out as described above. The purified enzyme from the Butyl-Sepharose FF step was dialyzed against buffer A and stored at −80 °C. To obtain anti-murine MACS1 and Sa protein antibodies, two 15-residue peptides corresponding to the C termini of murine MACS1 (CIKRKELRNKEFGQL) and Sa protein (CVKRNELRKKEWVTT) were synthesized by Nippon Gene Research Laboratories (Sendai, Japan). The amino acid composition and sequences were confirmed by the supplier. The peptides were independently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (3Iijima H. Fujino T. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Kang M.J. Yamamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). IgG fractions were prepared by affinity chromatography on protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify and characterize murine MACS, we initially isolated a murine cDNA for Sa protein, because (i) ∼30% of the amino acids in Sa protein are identical to the previously characterized AceCSs and (ii) it contains a sequence motif common to the ACS/AceCS family. Transfection of Sa protein cDNA into COS cells resulted in the induction of MACS activity (see below), indicating that the Sa gene encodes an MACS. Using the Sa protein cDNA as a probe, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel MACS, designated MACS1, from a murine kidney cDNA library. BLAST searches of the GenBank™ data bases using the murine MACS1 sequence identified a human expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession numberAK025451) encoding a part of human MACS1. 5′- and 3′-RACE with human kidney RNA- and human MACS1-specific primers revealed the nucleotide and protein sequences of human MACS1. Fig.1 A shows the deduced primary amino acid sequences of murine and human MACS1 compared with those of Sa protein of the two species. There is ∼53% amino acid identity between murine MACS1 and Sa protein, and the phylogenetic tree of ACSs/AceCSs of various origins indicates that MACS1 and Sa protein belong to the same group (Fig. 1 B). Human and murine MACS1 protein consist of 577 and 573 amino acids with calculated molecular weights of 65,258 and 64,759, respectively. Sequence analysis by the PSORT program (24Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar) predicted that MACS1 and Sa protein contain a potential mitochondrial targeting signal at the N terminus (Fig.1 A). We also found two proteins in the GenBank™, BAA91273and rat kidney specific (rKS) protein (25Hilgers K.F. Nagaraj S.K. Karginova E.A. Kazakova I.G. Chevalier R.L. Carey R.M. Pentz E.S. Gomez R.A. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1444-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), belonging to the MACS group, suggesting that these proteins also function as MACS. The BLAST search also identified a bacterial artificial chromosome clone encoding the human Sa gene (CI987SK-44M2) and two overlapping clones (CTD-2152G12 and CIT987K-A-923A4) containing the human MACS1 gene. Comparison of the cDNA sequences and the human genome draft sequence revealed the genomic organization of the human MACS1 gene (Fig. 1, C andD). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the human MACS1 andSa genes are located in the opposite transcriptional direction within a 150-kb region on chromosome 16p13.1. The two genes consist of 13 exons, and their exon/intron boundaries are almost identical (Fig. 1 D). The relevant sequence information is available under GenBank™ accession numbers AB062491 throughAB062503. To compare enzymatic properties, cDNAs for murine MACS1 and Sa protein were individually introduced into COS cells, and the resulting enzymes were purified to homogeneity using the 230,000 × g supernatant fractions of the sonicated extracts. The overall purification and yields of MACS1 and Sa protein were 15.3-fold with a yield of 9.7% and 18.7-fold with a yield 17%, respectively (TableI). The specific activities of the purified MACS1 and Sa protein were, respectively, 15.8 and 11.5 μmol/min/mg when assayed with octanoate and isobutyrate, respectively. The two purified enzymes were essentially homogenous when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The molecular masses of the purified MACS1 and Sa protein estimated by SDS-PAGE were ∼62 kDa: ∼3 kDa smaller than the calculated molecular masses deduced from the cDNAs. This suggests that the putative mitochondrial targeting signals are cleaved during the transportation of the enzymes into the mitochondria matrix (see below). Using the purified enzymes, the fatty acid chain-length preferences of MACS1 and Sa protein were determined. As shown in Fig. 3 (A andB), octanoate is the preferred substrate for MACS1 among fatty acids with 4–16 carbon atoms. Sa protein showed a preference for isobutyrate among fatty acids with 2–6 carbon atoms (Fig. 3,C and D): the calculated K mvalue for isobutyrate was 0.05 mm. Both MACS1 and Sa protein require ATP and CoA for their activities (data not shown). When adenylate kinase was omitted from the reaction mixture for the spectrophotometric assay, no oxidation of NADH occurred, indicating that AMP was a reaction product (data not shown). Northern blotting of RNA from various mouse tissues revealed hybridization to major transcripts of 2.3 kb for MACS1, expressed abundantly in the liver and kidney (Fig.4, top panel). A minor transcript of 4.4 kb was also detected in the liver and kidney. This pattern of expression was very similar to that of Sa gene transcripts (middle panel). In contrast to the preferential expression of Sagene transcripts in spontaneously hypertensive rats (13Iwai N. Inagami T. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: 1155-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Iwai N. Kurtz T.W. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Invest. 1993; 92: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the levels of MACS1 transcripts were not increased in transcripts in these hypertensive rats (data not shown). We also analyzed dietary regulation of MACS1 and SamRNAs in the liver by Northern blotting. Neither fasting for 48 h, nor refeeding a high carbohydrate diet after 48 h fasting had any effects on the levels of the two mRNAs in the liver (data not shown). To determine the subcellular distributions of MACS1 and Sa protein, a subcellular fractionation was carried out on mouse kidney homogenate. The tissue homogenate was fractionated into light and heavy mitochondrial, peroxisomal, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions. Among these fractions, anti-MACS1 antibody detected an immunoreactive band of 62 kDa present mainly in the light and heavy mitochondrial fractions (Fig.5, upper panel). Similarly, a 62-kDa protein detected by anti-Sa protein antibody was present mainly in the light and heavy mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 5, middle panel). Together with the solubility in hypotonic buffer of MACS1 and Sa protein in transfected COS cells, the cell fractionation data indicate that both MACS1 and Sa protein are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. To evaluate the role of MACS1 and Sa protein, MACS1- and Sa protein-transfected COS cells were incubated, respectively, with [14C]isobutyrate and [14C]octanoate and analyzed for the incorporation of 14C into CO2and lipids. As shown in Fig.6 A, transfection of MACS1 into COS cells stimulated time-dependent [14C]octanoate uptake approximately 2-fold compared with parental vector-transfected cells. Similarly, Sa protein transfection induced [14C]isobutyrate uptake approximately 4-fold over the relatively low incorporation by parental vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). In both MACS1- and Sa protein-transfected cells, induction of 14C incorporation into CO2occurred, indicating the 14C-fatty acids were degraded by oxidation. These data suggest that the major function of MACS1 and Sa protein is to produce acyl-CoA for oxidation to produce ATP and CO2 in the mitochondrial matrix. In the current study, we have identified and characterized two MACSs, designated MACS1 and Sa protein. Both enzymes have a putative mitochondrial targeting signal at the N terminus of their primary amino acid sequence and are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. A14C-fatty acid incorporation study suggested that they play a similar role in the degradation of medium-chain fatty acids for the production of energy. Although the specificities of the two enzymes toward medium-chain fatty acids differ completely, the tissue expression of their transcripts and exon/intron organization of their human genes are very similar. Furthermore, the human genes for the two proteins consist of similar exon/intron organization and are located close together in the same region on chromosome 16p13.1, although in opposite transcriptional directions. These data may suggest that the two proteins arose from a common ancestor by gene duplication. The Sa gene has been characterized as a proposed candidate gene for essential hypertension (13Iwai N.

Although congenic substitution mapping argued for the Sa gene locus as a candidate for the blood pressure quantitative trait locus (20Hubner N. Lee Y.A. Lindpaintner K. Ganten D. Kreutz R. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the function of the Sa gene product was unclear until now. In this study, we have shown that Sa protein is a unique isobutyrate-preferring MACS. The calculated K m value of Sa protein toward isobutyrate is markedly low (Fig. 3 D), indicating that Sa protein preferentially utilizes isobutyrate in vivo. Although isobutyrate is generated from (S)-isobutyryl-CoA during the catabolism of valine, little is known about its metabolic fate. The abundant expression of Sa protein in the mitochondrial matrix of the liver and kidney suggest the importance of this enzyme in the metabolism of valine-derived isobutyrate for oxidative degradation. In contrast to Sa protein, octanoate is the most preferred fatty acid for MACS1 among C4–C16 fatty acids. Medium-chain fatty acids, including octanoate occur in the liver as a result of chain shortening, by the peroxisomal β-oxidation system from long-chain and very long-chain fatty acids (26Osmundsen H. Bremer J. Pedersen J.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These medium-chain fatty acids are believed to undergo further degradation via the mitochondrial β-oxidation system after transportation into the mitochondrial matrix. Based on the fatty acid specificity and subcellular distribution of MACS1, it is suggested that MACS1 initiates the degradation of medium-chain fatty acids generated by the peroxisomal β-oxidation system from long-chain and very long-chain fatty acids. MACS is also believed to play a role in the conjugation of a series of benzoic acid derivatives with glycine (27Kasuya F. Igarashi K. Fukui M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Kasuya et al. (28Kasuya F. Igarashi K. Fukui M. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1999; 118: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have purified a MACS from murine kidney mitochondria, showing that the purified enzyme effectively utilizes not only medium-chain fatty acids but also benzoic acid derivatives. Although purified MACS1 utilizes benzoic acid (Fig. 3 A), it had almost no preference toward salicylic acid (data not shown), suggesting the presence of other types of mitochondrial MACS, which play a role in the glycine conjugation of xenobiotic carboxylic acids. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the precise function and regulation of Sa protein and MACS1, and to determine the disorders caused by the absence of the two enzymes.

To study the mechanism and structure of the complex, we wanted to recombinantly express IKK in a model organism that lacks IKK. For this purpose, we have recombinantly reconstituted all three subunits together in yeast and have found that it is biochemically similar to IKK isolated from human cells. We show that there is one regulatory subunit per kinase subunit. Thus, the core subunit composition of IKKα·β·γ complex is α1β1γ2, and the core subunit composition of IKKβ·γ is β2γ2. The activity of the IKK complex (α+β+γ or β+γ) expressed in yeast (which lack NF-κB and IKK) is 4–5-fold higher than an equivalent amount of IKK from nonstimulated HeLa cells. In the absence of IKKγ, IKKβ shows a level of activity similar to that of IKK from nonstimulated HeLa cells. Thus, IKKγ activates IKK complex in the absence of upstream stimuli.

Under normal circumstances, NF-κB is tightly regulated so as to prevent inappropriate inflammation while allowing a rapid response to infection or stress. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is found predominantly in the cytoplasm in a complex with IκB proteins (a family of inhibitory subunits including IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, IκBε, and Bcl-3), which sequester NF-κB and prevent its migration to the nucleus (5Baeuerle P.A.

Diverse stimuli, including cytokines, bacterial and viral products, oxidants, and mitogens, lead to phosphorylation of two regulatory serine residues on IκBs, which targets it for polyubiquitination and proteolytic degradation. This frees NF-κB to move to the nucleus, where it binds to and stimulates the transcription of target genes (7Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is catalyzed by a large kinase complex, IκB kinase (IKK) (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M.

IKK is composed of two homologous kinase subunits, IKKα and IKKβ (85 and 87 kDa, respectively) and a 52-kDa regulatory subunit IKKγ (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ each contain an N-terminal protein kinase domain (containing a canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activation loop (9Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A.

Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunits are associated with each other via their leucine zippers (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the helix-loop-helix domains are required for full IKK activation (14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 15Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that intramolecular interaction of the helix-loop-helix with the kinase domain is involved in IKK activation (14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 15Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Studies of recombinant IKKα and IKKβ in insect cells indicate that the catalytic subunits are capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of sequence similarity between IKKα and IKKβ (52% overall identity and 65% identity in the kinase domains (10Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar)), the two proteins differ. Whereas IKKβ is essential for induction of NF-κB by cytokines, IKKα is essential for limb development and skin differentiation (16Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T.

Moreover, IKKβ homodimer has ∼30-fold higher activity toward IκBα than IKKα (19Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H. Rouw S.A. Koboldt C.M. Hall T. Sommers C. Hauser S.D. Pierce J.L. Combs R.G.

Other homologs of IKKα and IKKβ have been isolated, including TBK1/NAK (20Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.-i. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on gel filtration analysis, IKK predominantly forms a 700–900-kDa complex containing IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, but some IKK also elutes at 230 kDa (6Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment. 1999; 5: 1-16Google Scholar, 8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of IKK subunits in the large complex is still not known. The 230-kDa complex appears to be dimers containing only IKKα and IKKβ, because IKKα and IKKβ expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity elute at 230 kDa (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because, in IKKγ-deficient cells, IKKα and IKKβ elute at this size (12Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The large IKK complex contains a roughly stoichiometric amount of IKKα and IKKβ and an unknown amount of IKKγ (6Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment. 1999; 5: 1-16Google Scholar, 8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

IKKγ is required for the stimulation of IKK activity by upstream signals such as TNF, Tax, lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and interleukin 1 (12Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). An α-helical region toward the N terminus of IKKγ interacts with six amino acids at the very C terminus of IKKα and IKKβ (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar); interfering with this interaction by means of a peptide inhibitor in cells diminishes stimulation of IKK by TNFα (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The effect of IKKγ on basal IKK activity is less clear. One report indicated that IKKβ (lacking the C-terminal region, where it binds to IKKγ) was able to activate NF-κB 1.5–2 times more than wild-type IKKβ, and expression of IKKβ that contains point mutations to prevent IKKγ binding was able to activate NF-κB to a greater extent than IKKβ that is capable of binding IKKγ (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mayet al. (Ref. 24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar; see their Fig. 4F) showed that the peptide that diminished interaction of IKKγ with IKKβ increased basal NF-κB activity 2-fold (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). From these experiments, the authors suggested that interfering with the interaction of IKKγ and IKKβ increases basal intrinsic activity of IKK (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). By contrast, another report indicated that expressed IKKβ in COS cells alone had low activity but that its activity was stimulated by co-expression of IKKγ, suggesting that IKKγ stimulates IKKβ (in the absence of stimuli) (25Li X.-H. Fang X. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4494-4500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To better understand whether the presence of IKKγ has a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on IKKβ in the absence of stimulation and to ascertain the role of the IKKγ binding domain (γBD) on basal IKK activity, reconstitution of the full IKK complex in a model system lacking endogenous IKK and its upstream signaling pathways would be very helpful. In this paper, we demonstrate that human IKK can be reconstituted in yeast and forms a complex that is the same size as IKK isolated from human cells. The activity of this complex was 4–5-fold higher than the IKK activity from nonstimulated HeLa cells. We used this reconstituted system to study the role of the interaction of IKKγ with IKKα and IKKβ (on the level of kinase activity) and also to study the stoichiometry of subunits. All IKK subunits were expressed with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N terminus. HA-IKKγ was subcloned into the p425 methionine-inducible yeast expression vector, which contains a LEU2 selection marker (26Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The promoter regions of pESC-ura and pESC-trp (Stratagene) were removed and replaced with the promoter, multiple cloning site, and transcription termination sequence from p425, and HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ were subcloned into these vectors, respectively, to generate pESC ura met HA-IKKα and pESC trp met HA-IKKβ. The mutant IKKβΔγBD was generated by PCR using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) and the primers 5′-GTTAAATGAGGGCCACACATTGG and 5′-TCATGAGGCCTGCTCCAGGCAGCTGTGCTCTTCTTCTTCCGTCTGGGCCG TGAAACTCTG to loop out the 18 nucleotides corresponding to the γBD (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar); the PCR product was digested and subcloned into the vector pESC trp met HA-IKKβ. IKKαΔγBD was constructed using PCR to truncate the last 8 amino acids using the primers 5′ GGATCAGATTATGTCTTTGCATGC and 5′ CCCGTTAACTCAATTCATCATACT and subcloned into the pESC ura met HA-IKKα vector. The deleted regions were verified by sequencing. Plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain YPH499 (Stratagene) using lithium acetate as described (Stratagene pESC Yeast Epitope Tagging Vectors Instruction Manual). A 2-ml overnight culture of yeast was grown in selective drop-out medium (Q-Biogene) containing 4 mmmethionine (Q-Biogene) to suppress expression of the IKK and then amplified in 400 ml of selective noninducing drop-out medium. The yeast were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 30 h before being transferred to inducing medium (without methionine) for 10–12 h (at 30 °C with shaking). For harvesting and lysing the yeast, all steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. They were first washed in 400 mm (NH4)2SO4, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol containing protease inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1.1 μg/ml phosphoramidon). 1–2 g of yeast pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mmsodium metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol with protease inhibitors) in a capped 15-ml conical tube, frozen at −80 °C, and thawed on ice. Acid-washed 425–600-μm glass beads from Sigma (equal in volume to the yeast pellet) were added to the yeast, and the suspension was vortexed 3 times for 1 min each (with 1-min incubation on ice between mixings). Then the suspension was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was collected. To extract more protein, 1 ml of additional lysis buffer was added to the yeast, and the vortexing and centrifugation and resuspension procedure was repeated an additional eight times. To remove particulate material, the crude supernatant was centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 1.5 h, and the supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C. For some experiments, IKK was partially purified by gel filtration. For all gel filtration procedures, up to 0.3 ml of sample (0.3–1 mg of yeast extract) was injected onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For HeLa cell extracts, IKK was concentrated by Q Sepharose chromatography prior to gel filtration. Samples were fractionated with a flow rate of 0.3 ml per min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The gel filtration buffer contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 20 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Brij 35. The column was calibrated using the following standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): blue dextran 2000 (void,V0), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (230 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). Lysates (S100 supernatants) from nonstimulated or TNF-stimulated HeLa cells were prepared as previously described (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). IKKγ with a hexahistidine tag was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (13Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). IKKβ with a hexahistidine tag was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts or fast protein liquid chromatography fractions from HeLa cells and yeast were immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of monoclonal anti-IKKα antibodies (B78–1, Pharmingen) followed by binding to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immune complexes were pelleted and washed once with lysis buffer and once with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 20 mmMgCl2. For kinase assays, 5–15 μl of fast protein liquid chromatography fraction or washed immune complexes was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm cold ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 33 μg/ml GST-IκBα1–54, and γ-32P ATP (ICN). (GST-IκBα1–54, expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was used as the substrate because it contains the regulatory serines but lacks other residues that could be phosphorylated nonspecifically (27DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).) The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 97 °C. After SDS-PAGE and transfer (see below) radiolabeling was detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Extracts, immunoprecipitated proteins, and fast protein liquid chromatography fractions were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed using monoclonal antibodies directed against IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ (Imgenex) or against HA (USC/Norris core facility) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce SuperSignal reagent). For experiments to quantify the ratio of catalytic to regulatory subunits, proteins were transferred for 2 h at 300 mA; to verify that the transfer of IKK proteins was complete, any remaining proteins in the gel were transferred to a second polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The results indicated that 99% of IKKβ and 100% of IKKγ were transferred under our conditions. Densitometry was performed using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S Max quantification system. Endogenous and recombinantly expressed IKK has been characterized from mammalian cells as well as insect cells (Sf9 cells with the baculovirus system), but the yeast system may have some advantages for biochemical studies. The baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells has been successfully used to reconstitute catalytic subunits (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H. Rouw S.A. Koboldt C.M. Hall T. Sommers C. Hauser S.D. Pierce J.L. Combs R.G. Reitz B.A. Diaz-Collier J.A.

However, a complete reconstitution has not been shown in Sf9 cells and is not practical due to the complications associated with multiple viral infection in Sf9 cells. Mechanistic analysis is also complicated in Sf9 and mammalian cells by the presence of endogenous proteins because expressed mutated forms of IKK are directed into heterocomplexes containing endogenous proteins (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent development of IKK knockout cell lines partially resolves this problem, but there are also newly discovered IKK homologs that may have some redundant and overlapping functions. Many of these potential pitfalls can be overcome by using a reconstituted system. Current knowledge indicates that S. cerevisiae lacks NF-κB activity (28Epinat J.-C. Whiteside S.T. Rice N.R. Israel A. Yeast. 1997; 13: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and therefore is unlikely to contain NF-κB or its upstream signaling molecules. Therefore, exogenously expressed proteins (such as IKK subunits) probably would not be affected by yeast signaling pathways. The three subunits of IKK were subcloned into plasmids (each with a different selection marker: uracil, tryptophan, or leucine) containing HA tags and methionine-inducible promoters and transformed into yeast. (The inducible system was used in order to grow the yeast to a sufficient density before induction in case the expressed proteins were toxic). The yeast were grown in selective liquid media prior to induction. After 10–12 h induction, the yeast were washed and lysed, and the S100 was obtained (see under “Experimental Procedures”). As indicated by Western blot (Fig.1A), yeast that were not transformed did not contain IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ (see thefar right lane (YPD)); however, these yeast do contain a protein recognized by the αHA antibody that runs below IKKγ (data not shown). Yeast were transformed with IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ in various combinations, and clones expressing the IKK proteins at high levels were chosen for further study. In most clones transformed with multiple subunits, the IKKγ expression was higher than the expression of α or β (as assessed by Western analysis with their identical HA tag). The level of IKKα was slightly lower than the level of IKKβ in the IKKα·β·γ clone shown (which was used for further studies). Because IKK expressed in bacteria forms large aggregates that are not native (data not shown), we needed first to determine whether IKK reconstituted in yeast formed a complex that was similar in size to IKK isolated from human cells. Extracts from untransformed yeast and yeast expressing human IKKβ or IKKα·β·γ or mutant IKKβKA·γ were fractionated on a Superose 6 gel filtration column, and IKK activity toward GST-IκBα1–54 was assessed in each fraction. As shown in Fig. 1B, IKKβ (alone) produced in yeast runs at 158–300 kDa; this is the same size as dimers of IKKβ (without IKKγ) from mammalian or Sf9 cells (11Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant peak of IKK from TNF-stimulated HeLa cells elutes at about 900 kDa. IKKα·β·γ produced in yeast produces two peaks, one the size of the full IKK complex from human cells and the other around 158–300 kDa (the size of the catalytic subunit dimers). Extracts from untransformed yeast and from yeast expressing mutant IKKβKA·γ do not have significant IKK activity in any fraction (compared with an equal amount of fractions 10–11 taken from yeast expressing IKKα·β·γ). Similar results were obtained when IKK was isolated from each fraction by immunoprecipitation for kinase assay. These results indicate that the IKK that we have expressed in yeast is native and that, most likely, the 900-kDa complex contains no additional proteins. To demonstrate that it behaves the same as in mammalian cells, we expressed a mutant of IKK in which the critical lysine in the catalytic site is mutated to alanine (βKA); this IKK was inactive as assessed by immunoprecipitation/kinase assay (Fig. 1C). The IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ that were used for yeast expression have identical HA tags at their N termini. This allowed us to determine the ratio of regulatory to catalytic subunits in the complex. Supernatant from yeast co-expressing human IKKβ and IKKγ was partially purified by gel filtration to remove any subunits that were not incorporated into the large complex. The 900-kDa fraction was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies directed against HA. As shown in Fig.2A, there is roughly an equal amount of IKKβ and IKKγ in this complex. Densitometric analysis indicates that the ratio of γ to β is between 1.2 and 1.5. Similarly, when IKKα·β·γ was partially purified by gel filtration and analyzed by Western using antibodies against HA, the ratio of IKK(α+β) to IKKγ was 1:1. We attempted to use the HA immunoblot to quantify the ratio of IKKα to IKKβ, but unfortunately, the tagged proteins are inseparable, even with a large 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2B). It was previously shown (by Coomassie Blue staining) that the IKK complex contains roughly equal amounts of IKKα and IKKβ (13Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Therefore, the core subunit composition of IKKα·β·γ complex is α1β1γ2, and the core subunit composition of IKKβ·γ is β2γ2. In terms of activity, we predicted two possible scenarios: 1) that the complex would be low activity (similar to or lower than IKK activity from nonstimulated HeLa cells), or 2) that the complex would have high activity (similar to IKK from TNF-stimulated cells). IKK activity from yeast expressing IKKα·β·γ (partially purified by gel filtration) was compared with nonstimulated and TNF-stimulated HeLa cell extracts (S100); for these studies, the complexes were all immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies against IKKα (the subunit that was limiting in the yeast). The results (Fig.3A) indicate that the activity of yhIKKα·β·γ is intermediate to nonstimulated and TNF-stimulated HeLa cells. The activity of TNF-stimulated HeLa cells was ∼15–20-fold higher than the activity from nonstimulated HeLa cells, and the activity of IKKα·β·γ expressed in yeast was ∼4-fold higher than the activity from nonstimulated HeLa cells (Fig.3B). To verify that the IKK complex reconstituted in yeast is specific for the regulatory serines in IκBα, we tested the activity of this enzyme toward a mutant form of IκBα in which the regulatory serines are substituted with alanines (AA). Similar to the enzyme from HeLa cells, IKKα·β·γ made in yeast phosphorylates wild-type IκBα1–54 but not the AA mutant (Fig.3C). We also compared the various recombinant IKK complexes expressed in yeast to each other. Fig. 3D compares the activities of IKKα, IKKα·γ, and IKKα·β·γ. The 900-kDa complexes of IKKα·γ and IKKα·β·γ were partially purified by gel filtration before immunoprecipitation to eliminate complexes not containing γ, whereas IKKα was immunoprecipitated directly from the S100. (Samples were adjusted to contain similar amounts of IKKα in this experiment. Because the stoichiometry of IKKα·β·γ is 1:1:2, and the stoichiometry of α·γ is 2:2, the IKKα·β·γ sample contained approximately twice as many total IKK complexes as IKKα or IKKα·γ.) The results indicate that IKKα and IKKα·γ have very low kinase activity toward GST-IκBα1–54 whereas IKKα·β·γ has much higher kinase activity. The activity of IKKα·γ was over twice the activity of IKKα alone. The activity of IKKα·β·γ was 10–13-fold higher than that of IKKα·γ. Next, we compared the activities of IKKβ, IKKβ·γ, and IKKα·β·γ complexes reconstituted in yeast and partially purified by gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 3E, the activity of IKKβ was lower than the IKK activity of the complexes containing IKKβ·γ or IKKα·β·γ. The activity of IKKβ·γ and IKKα·β·γ was ∼7–15-fold higher than that of IKKβ alone. These data suggest that IKKγ plays a role in allowing the kinase to self-activate. The kinase-stimulating effect of co-expression of IKKγ with IKKβ was observed in completely different yeast clones and preparations, indicating that the effect is a general phenomenon (data not shown). Moreover, the higher activities of IKKβ·γ and IKKα·β·γ than IKKβ alone was observed over a range of IκBα concentrations, indicating that the substrate was not limiting (Fig. 3F). Finally, we compared the activity of IKKβ·γ expressed in yeast to IKKβ expressed in Sf9 by immunoprecipitation/kinase assay; the results (Fig.3G) indicate that the enzyme expressed in Sf9 cells is over twice as active as the enzyme expressed in yeast. To further explore the role of IKKγ on the activity of IKK, we generated IKKα and IKKβ constructs in which the γBD at the C terminus (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) has been deleted. IKKβΔγBD was transformed alone and along with IKKγ and IKKγ plus IKKαΔγBD intoS. cerevisiae and the interaction of IKKγ with these mutants was assessed by immunoprecipitation and by gel filtration. As previously shown by affinity pull-down analysis (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), the interaction of IKKγ with IKKβΔγBD was very weak compared with the interaction of IKKγ with wild-type IKKβ as assessed by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). However, the interaction of IKKγ with IKKβΔγBD or with IKKαΔγBD+ IKKβΔγBD was not entirely abolished as assessed by gel filtration. As shown in Fig.4A, IKKβΔγBDexpressed alone elutes from the Superose 6 gel filtration column at 158–300 kDa (the same as wild-type IKKβ). However, when co-expressed with IKKγ in the yeast, some of the IKKβΔγBD forms a complex with IKKγ and elutes as a high molecular weight complex. Similarly, some of the IKKαΔγBD+IKKβΔγBD forms a >700-kDa complex with IKKγ. Whereas wild-type IKKβ·γ and wild-type IKKα·β·γ elute predominantly in fractions 10 and 11 (∼900 kDa), the IKKαΔγBD·βΔγBD·γ and IKKβΔγBD·γ complexes eluted predominantly in fractions 11 and 12, suggesting that the size or shape of the complex may be slightly different from wild-type IKK. To investigate the role of the γBD in IKK activity, we compared the activity of these mutant forms to the corresponding wild-types (Fig.4B). IKKβΔγBD alone had a level of activity similar to that of IKKβ wild-type, and as shown previously, the activity of IKKβ alone was much lower than that with IKKγ. We looked at two gel filtration fractions from the IKKβΔγBD·γ extract, fraction 11, in which IKKβΔγBD was complexed with IKKγ, and fraction 14, which was devoid of IKKγ. Fraction 11 had very low activity, indicating that the association of IKKβΔγBD with IKKγ was not enough for IKKγ to allow IKK to self-activate, suggesting that the γBD is required for the self-activation of IKKβ in the absence of stimulation. Fraction 14 had a level of activity that was similar to that of wild-type IKKβ and that of IKKβΔγBD alone. Similar effects were observed when we compared the activity of IKKα·β·γ wild-type to IKKαΔγBD·βΔγBD·γ. Association of IKKγ with the IKKαΔγBD and IKKβΔγBD mutants was not sufficient to allow the complex to self-activate. It appears that the presence of the γBD is needed for IKKγ to allow IKK to self-activate even in the absence of upstream signaling. This may suggest that this interaction is inhibited in resting mammalian cells. Finally, we wanted to investigate whether we could activate IKKβ by the addition of purified IKKγ in vitro. IKKβ (partially purified by gel filtration) was incubated with 0, 10, and 50 ng of pure IKKγ for 30 min on ice before assessment of IKK activity. As shown in Fig. 4C, addition of IKKγ could not activate the kinase. Similarly, incubation of IKKγ with IKKβΔγBD did not change the kinase activity. This suggests that the IKKγ must form a complex with IKKβ in vivo in order to facilitate self-activation. Previous research indicated that S. cerevisiae lacks NF-κB activity (28Epinat J.-C. Whiteside S.T. Rice N.R. Israel A. Yeast. 1997; 13: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and this report indicates that yeast do not contain IKK subunits as assessed by Western blot and also lack the ability to phosphorylate the regulatory serines on IκBα. Reconstitution of IKK complex containing α, β, and γ subunits turned out to be a useful tool because it allowed production of a large quantity of native complex for structural and mechanistic studies. Similar to mammalian and insect cells, IKK catalytic subunits expressed alone in yeast form relatively small 158–300-kDa complexes, whereas the catalytic subunits co-expressed with IKKγ elute at ∼900 kDa. This indicates that the IKK reconstituted in yeast is native and most likely contains no additional proteins. Through the use of the identical HA tag on each subunit, we were able to show that there is approximately a 1:1 ratio of IKK catalytic subunits to IKKγ. Therefore, the core subunit composition of IKKα·β·γ is α1β1γ2. Both IKKα and IKKα·γ reconstituted in yeast had a much lower level of kinase activity toward GST-IκBα1–54 than IKKα·β·γ when adjusted for equal amounts of IKKα. This was a predicted result because it was previously shown that IKKβ is a more effective kinase for IκBα than IKKα (19Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H. Rouw S.A. Koboldt C.M. Hall T. Sommers C. Hauser S.D. Pierce J.L. Combs R.G. Reitz B.A. Diaz-Collier J.A. Weinberg R.A. Hood B.L. Kilpatrick B.F. Tripp C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25883-25891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activity of reconstituted IKKα·β·γ was higher than an equivalent amount of IKK from nonstimulated HeLa cells but lower than an equivalent amount of IKK from TNF-simulated HeLa cells. In mammalian cells, IKK is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, but the exact mechanisms of regulation are still not known. IKK activity is inhibited by PP2A in vitro, indicating that the kinase is activated by phosphorylation (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of two sites in the activation loop of IKKβ is essential for activation of IKK by itself or after stimulation with TNF or interleukin 1, although the kinase responsible is unknown (14Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Putative upstream kinases of IKK include NF-κB-inducing kinase (29Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), mixed-lineage kinase (30Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ushmorov A. Dienz O.

Karin M. Raz E. Cell. 2000; 103: 909-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest that the phosphorylation of T-loop residues may occur through autophosphorylation (15Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), indicating that IKK can self-activate. The partial activation of IKK reconstituted in yeast could be explained if yeast contains a true IKK activator (such as an upstream kinase like mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) that is only partially active under conditions in which the IKK was being made. Alternatively, the yeast may contain a kinase that is homologous to the true IKK activator but far less capable of activating IKK. On the other hand, it is possible that the partial activity of IKK reconstituted in yeast is due to lack of negative regulation in the yeast. An enzymatic activity or negative regulator using a different mechanism may be preventing IKK self-activation in mammalian cells. This negative regulation may occur through regulation of IKKα·β interaction with IKKγ (see below). IKK reconstituted in yeast will provide a useful system for analyzing putative positive and negative regulators of IKK. The yeast reconstitution system was used to assess the role of IKKγ on IKK activity and to assess the importance of the γBDs found in IKKβ and IKKα. IKKβ expressed in yeast in the absence of IKKγ had much lower IKK activity than IKKβ·γ or IKKα·β·γ. There are two alternative reasons for lower kinase activity in the absence of IKKγ. First, it is possible that IKKγ is needed to allow homologous signaling proteins present in yeast to activate the expressed IKK (to the small extent it was activated). Second, it is also possible that IKK needs to form a large complex in order to autophosphorylate and self-activate and does so through IKKγ. The fact that IKKβΔγBD·γ and IKKαΔγBD·βΔγBD·γ formed large but inactive complexes indicates that IKKγ interacts with different regions of IKKα and IKKβ to hold the complex together, and the interaction of IKKγ with the γBD of IKKα and IKKβ is a dynamic interaction required for activation. The yeast data suggest that this dynamic interaction is somehow prevented in resting mammalian cells. In addition, the 4–5-fold higher activity from TNFα-stimulated cells over IKK expressed in yeast suggests that interaction of IKKγ with the C terminus of IKKα and IKKβ, although required for activation, is not sufficient for full activation of IKK. This in turn suggests that IKK may be regulated by a multistep mechanism. A multistep activation mechanism would provide IKK with the regulatory potential,e.g. being activated at different intensities and kinetics, to respond to the great diversity of NF-κB inducers. The yeast reconstitution system will provide a useful tool for further structural and mechanistic analyses of IKK. Human IKK expressed in yeast can be used for clean mechanistic analysis because there is no background of endogenous IKK proteins. It is also useful for biochemical and regulatory studies, because when the IKK is expressed in yeast and isolated, it is simple to test whether a single molecule or subcellular fraction changes the activity of the enzyme. Finally, it can be used to study the structure and composition of the IKK complexes. We thank Dr. Ami Aronheim, Hugo Lee, and Cindy Feei-Chyong Yen for various reagents."

Sonication of preformed fibers to expose fresh ends did not change the results, excluding a possibility of occasional deformation of one end as the reason of the apparent unidirectional growth.

These and other studies have established that the prion fibers are made through two distinct processes, the generation of seeds of fibers and the elongating growth of fibers. Here, we report the observation of fiber growth of Sup35NM labeled by fluorescent dyes. Different from most methods for analysis of fiber growth, e.g. Congo red binding, sedimentation analysis, and circular dichroism, and electron microscopy, this method enabled us to watch growing fibers individually in aqueous conditions. By using Sup35NM labeled with either green or red fluorescent dye, directionality of fiber growth was clearly observed. For bacterial expression, DNA encoding Sup35NM was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pYK807 (a gift of Akihiko Kikuchi), which contains whole sup35gene (18Kikuchi Y. Shimatake H. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), as a template.

The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned as an NdeI-EcoRI fragment into pET21c, and the fidelity of the construct (pET-Sup35NMHC, where HC means His8-Cys) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET-Sup35NMHC, cultured at 37 °C to A 600 = ∼0.7, and induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested, suspended, and broken by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.33 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mg/ml DNaseI, and a tablet of proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The suspension was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The pellets were suspended with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4% (v/v) Triton X-100, washed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C, suspended in water, and washed again by centrifugation. The resultant pellets were solubilized in Buffer A (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole) and were applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow (Qiagen) column. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and eluted with a 10–500 mm imidazole gradient in Buffer A. The eluate containing Sup35NM was dialyzed with 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and was applied to reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Poros R2/H). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a 0–95% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and fractions containing Sup35NM were collected. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 276 nm. Extinction coefficient for Sup35NM (25720m−1 cm−1) was calculated based on the amino acid composition using DNASTAR software. Purified Sup35NM was verified as an expected polypeptide by both N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrographic analysis. Sup35NM that had additional His8-Cys at the C terminus was used for the labeling, and because several proteins can be fused to the C terminus of the Sup35NM fragment without significant loss of the prion infectivity, we introduced Cys (and the fluorescent dyes) at the C terminus of the Sup35NM fragment. Sup35NM was incubated either with an excess of tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR)1 or Oregon GreenTM 488-maleimide (OG; Molecular Probes) in 8m guanidine HCl and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) for 24 h at 4 °C. Unreacted fluorescent dyes were removed by microcon-5 (Millipore) filtration and washed with 8 mguanidine HCl repeatedly until filtrate did not show fluorescence. Labeled Sup35NM was concentrated with microcon-5. On average, a polypeptide was labeled by 0.3 dyes. For biotinylation, biotin-PEAC5-maleimide (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was used. Prior to each experiment, Sup35NM in 8m guanidine HCl was passed through a 100-kDa molecular-cut filter (microcon-100; Millipore). The fiber formation was initiated by dilution of Sup35NM into Buffer B (5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) 100-fold or more, and the solution was incubated at 25 °C with gentle agitation. At the indicated times, the protein solution was mixed with Congo red solution, and the absorption spectrum was measured. Congo red bound to the amyloid fibers was estimated by the equation established by Klunk et al.(19Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Time-lapse binding of Congo red to fibers of either TMR (red)-, or OG (green)-labeled Sup35NM showed similar propagation as that of unlabeled Sup35NM with correction of a small contribution of labeling dyes to the absorbance (data not shown). We confirmed that fibers were formed similarly from guanidine HCl-denatured Sup35 and from urea-denatured Sup35NM by electron microscopic analysis (data not shown). However, because amorphous aggregates tended to appear in the urea solution of red-Sup35NM, we routinely started fiber formation from the guanidine HCl-denatured Sup35NM. Typically, red-Sup35NM (200 μm) in 8 m guanidine HCl were diluted 1:200 into Buffer B containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer B was filtered with an 0.22-μm filter and was previously degassed. After a 3-h incubation at 20 °C with gentle stirring by 10-rpm rotation, green-Sup35NM (200 μm) in 8 m guanidine HCl was diluted 1:200 into the mixture, and incubation was continued. At appropriate times, an aliquot of the incubated mixture was flowed into an observation chamber assembled from slide glasses (20Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and fibers were allowed to adhere to the glass surface for 5 min. The free protein was removed by washing with excess Buffer B. To minimize bleaching, the solution in the chamber was exchanged with Buffer B containing 2,500 units/ml catalase (Fluka), 0.2 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), 6 mg/ml glucose, and 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (21Harada Y. Sakurada K. Aoki T. Thomas D.D. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Red- and green-labeled Sup35NM fibers were observed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with fluorescence cubes, WIG, and WIB (Olympus) for TMR and OG, respectively. The images were recorded with a SIT camera (G2741-08; Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) on a videotape and analyzed with NIH image and Adobe Photoshop. When indicated, a mixture of OG-Sup35NM fibers (1 μm) was subjected to sonication for 1 s at 4 °C with a Branson Sonifier 250. Green-Sup35NM containing biotinylated Sup35NM (molar ratio of green-Sup35NM to the biotinylated green-Sup35NM was 4:1) in 8 m guanidine HCl was diluted 120-fold into Buffer B containing 1 mmdithiothreitol (final Sup35NM concentration, 780 nm) and incubated for 4 h at 25 °C. To observe the growth of the fibers under a microscope, we fixed the green fibers on a glass surface coated with biotinylated α-casein via a streptavidin (Sigma) linker. The unfixed fibers were removed by washing the chamber with Buffer B, and 667 nm red-Sup35NM monomers flowed into the observation chamber. The chamber was incubated for 25 min to allow attachment of red-Sup35NM to the preformed and immobilized green-Sup35NM fibers. After 25 min the free red-Sup35NM was washed away with Buffer B, and fibers were again observed by the fluorescence microscopy. To repeat the cycle 667 nm red-Sup35NM monomers were reintroduced into the chamber and allowed to incubate. This cycle of fiber growth and microscopic observation was repeated every 25 min. Fluorescent images were recorded and processed as described above. Because fusion of several proteins to the C terminus of Sup35NM does not significantly impair its ability to form fibers (5Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 8DePace A.H. Santoso A. Hillner P. Weissman J.S.

Biol. 2001; 307: 1247-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we introduced fluorescent dyes at the C-terminal cysteine of Sup35NM. Fiber formation was started by diluting the labeled Sup35NM in 8 m guanidine HCl into buffer. Fibers formed from fluorescent Sup35NM with kinetics similar to unlabeled Sup35NM, as tested by Congo red binding, light scattering, and electron microscopy (data not shown). When the fibers were immobilized onto the glass surface, fibers made of the labeled Sup35NM were clearly visible with fluorescence microscopy. This microscopic technique, combined with alternating use of TMR-labeled (red) or OG-labeled (green) Sup35NM, enabled us to investigate the polarity of the fiber growth. First, red fibers were formed from red-Sup35NM. Most red-Sup35NM monomers were incorporated into fibers and then green-Sup35NM monomers were added, and elongation of fibers was allowed to continue. At the indicated times, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was taken and fibers were fixed onto the glass surface and observed with a fluorescence microscope. This procedure produced fibers segmented with two colors. If the fibers elongate unidirectionally, green segment should be found at only one end of the individual red fibers, producing “red-green” fibers. On the other hand, bidirectional growth of the fibers predicts the generation of “green-red-green” fibers. Fluorescent images of individual fibers were categorized into two main variations, “green-only” fibers and red-green ones (Fig.1 A). Statistical analysis showed that, among 1343 fibers, 252 (19%) were red-green fibers, whereas only 7 (0.5%) were green-red-green fibers (Fig.1 B). The green-only fibers amounted to 79% of the total. We compared the average length of the green-only fibers to that of the green segment of the red-green fibers and found that the former (mean, ∼1.0 μm) was shorter than the latter (mean, ∼1.6 μm) (Fig.1 C). This indicates that the green-only fibers are the products formed de novo after the addition of the green-Sup35NM, because the green-Sup35NM monomers themselves can assemble into the seeds and generate green-only fibers after lag period, in addition to binding to and elongating the preformed red fibers. Fusion of two fibers did not account for the red-green fiber formation, because simple mixing of preformed red fibers and green fibers did not produce the red-green fibers. In addition, the apparent polarity of the fiber growth is not because of any bias introduced by the attached fluorescent dyes. This was verified by the reciprocal experiment with the reverse order of addition; addition of red-Sup35NM monomers to the preformed green fibers resulted in production of red-only and red-green fibers in a ratio similar to the above (data not shown). To follow the growth of the same fibers, we developed another observation system (Fig. 2 A). First, the preformed green-fibers containing biotinylated Sup35NM were immobilized on the glass surface through biotin-streptavidin linkers and then red-Sup35NM monomers were introduced, and fibers were allowed to grow further. Every 25 min, free red-Sup35NM was removed to eliminate background fluorescence, and elongated fibers in the same observation field were visualized. After observation, red-Sup35NM monomers were reintroduced, and fiber growth resumed. This protocol again produced results that showed strong polarity of fiber growth (Fig.2 B); ∼70% of the total elongated fibers were of the unambiguous unidirectional fibers, ∼15% were bidirectional, but of the strongly polarized type in which we could detect only a very faint fluorescent spot on the end opposite from growing end of the fiber, and ∼15% were of bidirectional fibers without any polarity (i.e. both fiber ends grew with a similar rate). Under the conditions shown in Fig. 2 B, the mean growth rate of the unidirectionally growing fibers was ∼1.0 μm/h. During a series of experiments, we noticed that the fraction of unidirectional growth in the total elongated fibers differed from preparation to preparation, ranging from ∼98% (Fig. 1 B) to ∼70% (Fig.2 B) of the total. One might suspect that the unidirectional growth we observed is simply because of the formation of inactive fiber-ends, or in other words, “dead ends”. To eliminate this possibility, we sonicated the fibers to expose new, active fiber ends by fragmentation. Brief sonication severed the preformed fibers, producing short fibers approximately one-fifth of the length of the unsonicated fibers (Fig. 3 A). We immobilized the sonicated red fibers on a glass slide and then added the green-Sup35NM monomers for the further elongation (Fig.3 B). The fraction of fibers exhibiting unidirectional growth after sonication was comparable with that without sonication (Fig.3 C). This result confirmed that the strong polarity of fiber growth is an inherent property of the yeast prion Sup35NM. We have developed a method to observe growth of the prion fibers under a microscope by labeling proteins with fluorescent dyes, and we have indicated polarity of fiber growth; the majority of fibers grew unidirectionally, and only a small fraction of fibers grew to both directions. Our result is in contrast with a recent report by Scheibelet al. (11Scheibel T. Kowal A.S. Bloom J.D. Lindquist S.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 366-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in which bidirectional growth of Sup35NM was proposed to be dominant based on electron microscopic observation. 2Because Scheibel et al. (11Scheibel T. Kowal A.S. Bloom J.D. Lindquist S.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 366-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) used the Sup35NM fragment without a histidine tag, we also investigated the directionality of the yeast prion fibers grown from Sup35NM without any histidine tag. Again, the growth of the prion fibers revealed the strong polarity (A. Kishimoto, H. Taguchi, and M. Yoshida, unpublished observation). However, they also found fibers growing unidirectionally but did not present the results of a quantitative analysis. The real reason for the presence of bidirectional growing fibers in our experiments is not known, but two comments are worth mentioning. The bidirectional growth could be explained by some combinations of unidirectional growth, such as side-by-side association of two fibers aligned oppositely, whereas the unidirectional growth can be hardly explained by the combination of the bidirectionally growing fibers. Or, if growth of one end of a bidirectionally growing fiber is extremely slow or tends to stop soon, the growth appears as if unidirectional. Indeed, half of the bidirectionally growing fibers was the strongly polarized type. Therefore, strictly speaking, our results indicate the strong polarity of fiber growth but cannot eliminate a possibility of bidirectional growth. The unidirectional fiber growth of yeast prion reminds us of bacterial flagella fibers, which also grow unidirectionally bothin vivo and in vitro (24Asakura S. Eguchi G. Iino T. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 227-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed previously (2Horwich A.L. Weissman J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the bacterial flagella are in some ways analogous to Sup35NM. Indeed, this is suggested by the fact that the N and C termini of flagellin, a building block of flagella, are disordered as monomers but become ordered upon polymerization into flagella fibers (25Aizawa S.I. Vonderviszt F. Ishima R. Akasaka K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed for the prion conversion process, and they belong to two general classes (Fig.4), differing in the critical step, that is, whether conversion takes place after (Model 1) or before (Model 2) association with the fiber. Model 1 is better able to explain unidirectional growth; a monomer has a single fiber-binding site, and another binding site, which is necessary to accept the next monomer, is generated only after the monomer associates to the fiber. If a prion monomer has two fiber-binding sites, a fiber should grow bidirectionally as in Model 2. As time-lapse AFM analysis has revealed a bidirectional growth of fiber-forming amylin and β-amyloid peptides (26Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 27Blackley H.K. Sanders G.H. Davies M.C. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J. Wilkinson M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it is not clear that fiber growth with strong polarity, unidirectional growth as an extreme case, is a general feature of prion fibers. Nevertheless unidirectional growth polarity of the yeast Sup35NM prion fibers seems clear. We thank Dr. Jeanne Hardy for critical reading of the manuscript."

It displays both PPIase and chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. To localize these two activities to specific regions of the protein, we created and analyzed a set of fragments of FKBP52. The PPIase activity toward both peptides and proteins is confined entirely to domain 1 (amino acids 1–148). The chaperone activity, however, resides in the C-terminal part of FKBP52, mainly in the region between amino acids 264 and 400 (domain 3). Interestingly, this domain also contains the tetratricopeptide repeats, which are responsible for the binding to C-terminal amino acids of Hsp90. Competition assays with a C-terminal Hsp90 peptide suggest that the non-native protein and Hsp90 are bound by different regions within this domain."

Moreover, they provide mechanical support for vesicle budding and their release into the cytosol. Clathrin-coated vesicles are the most extensively studied class of transport vesicles. They are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and sorting of lysosomal proteins. The dissociation of the clathrin coat is not only a prerequisite for fusion with acceptor membranes, but may also be required for the interaction of the vesicle with microtubule motor proteins (2Nakagawa T.

Hsc70 in its “ATP-bound conformation” interacts with the auxilin J domain, a highly conserved motif common to all members of the DNAJ protein family (14Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Auxilin-stimulated hydrolysis of bound ATP converts hsc70 to the ADP conformation, which is characterized by a tight association with unfolded proteins (15Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). Thus the function of the auxilins is to target hsc70 with bound ATP to clathrin cages and to couple ATP hydrolysis with clathrin-hsc70 complex formation (3Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Clathrin heavy chain trimers, also known as clathrin triskelia, are released from the coat structure together with three tightly bound hsc70 molecules (16Ungewickell E.

Auxilin 2 differs from auxilin 1 in two important aspects: first, auxilin 2 recognizes not only the plasma membrane adaptor AP-2 but also the Golgi-adaptor protein AP-1 (4Umeda A. Meyerholz A. Ungewickell E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and second it contains an amino-terminal Ser/Thr-kinase domain (7Kanaoka Y. Kimura S.H. Okazaki I. Ikeda M. Nojima H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This domain shares sequence homology with members of the Ark kinase family (19Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ark2p is associated with Sla2p, an actin-binding protein, which is also present in clathrin-coated vesicles (20Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The in vivo function of hsc70 in the uncoating process was first addressed by injecting a monoclonal antibody directed against this protein into living cells (21Honing S. Kreimer G. Robenek H. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies interfered with endocytosis and increased the number of membrane-associated clathrin structures. More recently this observation was extended by overexpressing dominant negative hsc70 mutants, which also inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis and interfere with other aspects of clathrin dynamics (22Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The importance of functional auxilin orthologs in uncoating was recently demonstrated for yeast and nematodes (9Gall W.E. Higginbotham M.A. Chen C. Ingram M.F. Cyr D.M. Graham T.R. Curr.

Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In both instances defects in uncoating were observed. In this context it may be of significance that both auxilins contain a PTEN-like domain, which might attach these proteins to membranes enriched in phosphoinositides and regulate their activity (25Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Thus, there is now a wealth of evidence implicating the auxilins and hsc70 in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles in vivo. However, little is known about the molecular events that lead to auxilin-mediated placement of hsc70 on the clathrin heavy chain, which causes disruption of clathrin-clathrin interactions and clathrin-adaptor associations (26Hannan L.A. Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2217-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The clathrin heavy chain consists of a proximal leg segment, which is closest to the vertex where the three heavy chains join, and a distal leg segment linked by a flexible linker to a com-pactly folded amino-terminal domain (TD).1The clathrin TD is not required for the self-assembly of clathrin, but is essential for its interaction with peripheral and integral membrane proteins that control clathrin assembly on membrane surfaces. Forin vitro uncoating the clathrin TD was shown to be dispensable as were the clathrin light chains that bind along the proximal leg segment (5Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Our unexpected finding that the clathrin TD associates with auxilin 1 prompted this study. Here we show that the auxilin 1 segment 547–910 contains at least two distinct binding sites for each, the TD and α-appendage. An AP180 fragment, which lacks the ENTH-domain (epsin N-terminal homology domain), competes efficiently with auxilin 1 for binding to the TD. A second auxilin 1 binding site on the clathrin heavy chain is located on the distal domain. Full-length bovine auxilin 1 cDNA in pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (3Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was used for constructing recombinant auxilin 1 fragments. To generate the cDNA for auxilin 1 (amino acid residues 715–901) the NcoI- and ApoI-cleaved fragment was ligated into pET32a between the NcoI andEcoRI restriction sites. The auxilin 1 fragment (619) was first subcloned into theSphI site of pUC57 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Next the insert was excised from pUC57 with SalI andHindIII and inserted into the expression vector pET32b (Novagen) that was linearized with the same enzymes. Polyhistidine-tagged auxilin 1 fragments were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Novagen, Madison, WI). After 3 h of growth at 37 °C the culture was transferred to room temperature and 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside (Eurobio, Le Ulis, France) was added to induce expression of recombinant proteins for 3 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and lysed by sonification as described previously (3Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were included in the lysis buffer. Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Auxilin 1 fragments were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was connected to an FPLC-System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES, 12.5 mm potassium acetate and 5 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.1 (buffer G). The cDNA of human clathrin heavy chain in pBluescript (KIAA 0034) was a gift from T. Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan. Clathrin proximal domain (clathrin-PD; amino acid residues 1073–1675) was generated by cleavage with MspI while the distal domain of clathrin (clathrin-DD; amino acid residues 438–1073) was excised with StuI and BspMII. The clathrin fragment coding for the proximal domain and about half of the distal domain (clathrin-D*PD; amino acid residues 730–1675) was obtained using the restriction enzyme DraI. All clathrin constructs were ligated into the pET32a vector and expressed with an amino-terminal polyhistidine tag in BL21(DE3)pLysS as described above. Only the bacteria used for expressing the clathrin DD were grown for 2.5 h at 37 °C and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 4.5 h. The protocol for the purification of recombinant clathrin fragments was identical to that for the recombinant auxilin 1 fragments. The AP180 fragment His6-AP180-(328–896) was created by R. Knorr by inserting the SalI-HindIII fragment of pst36 into PQE-31 vector (27Morris S.A. Schroder S. Plessmann U. Weber K. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The plasmid used for the expression of the clathrin TD (residues 1–579 of the bovine clathrin heavy chain fused to GST) was provided by Jim Keen. Richard Anderson provided the construct for the α-appendage domain of murine αc (residues 701–938) (28Wang L.H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Reagents for DNA work were from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The molar concentration of clathrin used in the following experiments refer to the heavy chain and light chain of one triskelion leg. 1.3 × 10−10 mol clathrin assembled into cages by dialysis against buffer A (100 mm2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 6.4) were incubated on ice for 1 h with 1.9 × 10−10 mol of either auxilin 1-(547–714), auxilin 1-(715–901) or GST-auxilin 1-(547–910) in a total volume of 100 μl and then centrifuged at 90,000 ×g for 20 min in a TLA-45 rotor (Beckman Optima TL-100). Resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In this and all subsequent experiments the pellets were resuspended in a final volume that was identical to that of the supernatants. To remove the TD from about two-thirds of the clathrin heavy chains, cages (6.8 × 10−10 mol of clathrin in 300 μl) were digested with 0.21 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) for 10 min on ice in buffer A containing 1.6 mm CaCl2. The reaction was terminated with 74 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington). To quantitatively remove the TD from all heavy chains, 1.4 × 10−9 mol assembled clathrin in 600 μl of buffer A plus 1.6 mm CaCl2 were preincubated with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin for 10 min on ice and then further digested for 50 min at 10 °C with a total amount of 0.4 mg/ml trypsin in a volume of 760 μl. The reaction was stopped with 378 μg of soybean inhibitor. Trypsin-treated cages were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 90,000 × g for 30 min. The clathrin pellets were washed once in 1 ml of buffer A containing 25 or 126 μg of soybean inhibitor depending on the stringency of the digestion. After a second centrifugation the pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of buffer G with 20 μg of soybean inhibitor (40 μg of inhibitor when high concentrations of trypsin were used). Trypsin-digested cages containing 9 × 10−11 mol of clathrin were incubated in 40 μl of buffer G for 30 min on ice with either 1.7 × 10−10 mol of auxilin 1-(547–714), 1.8 × 10−10 mol auxilin 1-(619–738) or 1.9 × 10−10 mol auxilin 1-(715–901). 3.5 × 10−10 mol of GST-auxilin 1-(547–910) were incubated together with equimolar amounts of trypsin-clipped cages and His6-AP180 (5Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) in a reaction volume of 100 μl. The cages were separated from unbound protein ligands by ultracentrifugation at 90,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants and resuspended pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified clathrin was preincubated in buffer G for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min to remove aggregates. The supernatant containing 1.4 × 10−10 mol of clathrin was incubated on ice with 2.8 × 10−10 mol of either auxilin 1-(547–714), auxilin 1-(715–901), auxilin 1-(619–738), or GST-auxilin 1-(547–910) for 1 h in a volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixture was divided into two aliquots and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min. One aliquot was analyzed by SDS-PAGE while the other one was diluted to 100 μg/ml, negatively stained with uranylacetate, and used for electron microscopy (3Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 500 μg of clathrin-coated vesicles from pig brain in 250 μl of buffer A were digested for 30 min on ice with 0.3–1.5 μg of trypsin as detailed in Fig. 8. Addition of 0.36–3.6 μg of soybean trypsin-inhibitor terminated the reaction. The cages were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in 20 μl of buffer G containing 0.1 μg of the inhibitor. To test the cofactor function of recombinant auxilin 1 fragments 250 μg of trypsin-treated pig brain-coated vesicles were incubated with 6.9 × 10−10 mol of hsc70 (5Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and 6.4 × 10−11mol of either GST-auxilin 1-(547–910) or the His6-tagged auxilin 1 fragments for 20 min at 25 °C in uncoating buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0). hsc70 was preincubated on ice for 15 min with regeneration mixture containing 2 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 units/ml creatine kinase as final concentrations. Assembled clathrin and free triskelia were separated by centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GST-α-appendage and GST-TD fusion proteins immobilized on 10 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with ∼25 μg of bound fusion protein were diluted with 10 μl of Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding experiments were carried out for 45 min on ice in 50 μl of buffer G with 5 × 10−10 mol of the auxilin 1 fragments (547–714, 619–738, and 715–901) or thrombin-digested GST-auxilin 1-(547–910). 2.4 × 10−10 mol of thrombin-digested GST-auxilin 1-(547–910) were incubated with 20 μl of GST-TD beads in a reaction volume of 100 μl. 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mg/ml of highly purified bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to prevent nonspecific interactions. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 11,000 rpm in a A-8–11 swinging bucket rotor (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and washed twice with 500 μl of buffer G. For the first wash the resuspended beads were underlayed with 60 μl of 10% sucrose in the same buffer. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed with the supernatant and bead fractions. For immunoblot analysis 2.5 μg/ml mAb100/4 directed against auxilin 1 (8Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and the anti-penta-His antibody (0.2 μg/ml, Qiagen) were used. When rat brain cytosol was used in pull-down experiments auxilin 1 was stained with the affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody R5C3, which was developed in our laboratory. Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) using Renaissance Enhanced Luminol substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium). Fresh porcine brains were obtained from a local abattoir. The tissue was washed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and then homogenized in an equal volume of buffer G. Membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was gel-filtered with a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated in buffer G. The protein concentration in the cytosol varied between 10–15 mg/ml. Pull-down experiments with immobilized GST-TD were performed as described. Unfractionated bacterial lysate containing full-length recombinant His6 auxilin 1 (5Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) was transferred into phosphate buffered saline and 0.1% Triton X-100 using a PD-10 desalting column. 1 ml of lysate were incubated 15 μl of either GST-TD or GST-α-appendage beads for 1 h at 4 °C. In both experiments binding of auxilin 1 was detected by immunoblotting using mAb100/4. 10 μl of GSH-Sepharose with bound GST-auxilin 1-(547–910) were diluted as described above and incubated with 2.2 × 10−10 mol clathrin-DD in 50 μl of buffer G containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 1.5 × 10−10 mol clathrin-D*PD or 2 × 10−10 mol clathrin-PD were preincubated on ice for 10 min without any beads. After a short prespin in a benchtop centrifuge the supernatants of the recombinant proteins were added to the immobilized fusion proteins and incubated for 30 min on ice. Binding was analyzed as described above. A GST fusion protein containing the clathrin amino-terminal domain (GST-TD) attached to GSH-Sepharose beads was used to pull down TD-binding proteins from pig brain cytosol. Among the proteins that associated specifically with the clathrin TD was auxilin 1 (Fig.1). This result was unexpected because the clathrin TD is not required for in vitro uncoating of clathrin coats (5Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility of an indirect interaction between auxilin 1 and the clathrin TD through other cytosolic proteins, we tested and confirmed the ability of the recombinant clathrin TD to bind recombinant auxilin 1 directly from bacterial lysates (Fig. 1). Next we expressed the carboxyl-terminal segment GST-auxilin 1-(547–910), which was previously shown to be fully functional in an in vitro uncoating assay (3Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and removed its GST moiety with thrombin. The resulting auxilin 1-(547–910) associated in pull-down experiments with the immobilized TD. Among the proteins known to interact with the clathrin TD is the neuronal assembly protein AP180 (29Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Hao W. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8667-8676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether AP180 and auxilin 1 bind to the same or overlapping sites on the TD, we expressed a polyhistidine-tagged recombinant fragment of AP180 (segment 328–896) that was previously shown to bind the clathrin TD (29Morgan J.R. Prasad K. Hao W. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8667-8676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First we confirmed its interaction with the TD and then demonstrated that GST-auxilin 1-(547–910), when added in excess, blocked the interaction of the recombinant AP180 fragment with the clathrin TD almost completely (Fig. 2). This effect was not due to the displacement of GST-TD by GST-auxilin 1-(547–910) from the GSH-beads, because the amount of GST-TD in the pellets remained constant (data not shown). Thus we conclude that auxilin 1 and AP180 share overlapping binding sites on the clathrin TD. Recombinant auxilin 1-(547–813), which lacks the J-domain was also tested and shown to bind with similar efficiency to the TD as auxilin 1-(547–910) (data not shown here, but see also Fig. 8). Taken together we have demonstrated that auxilin 1 is capable of associating directly with the globular clathrin TD and that it competes with AP180 for binding.Figure 2Competition between His6-AP180-(328–896) for the clathrin amino-terminal domain. A constant amount of His6-AP180-(328–896) was added to immobilized GST-TD beads together with increasing concentrations of GST-auxilin 1-(547–910). Note that the recombinant auxilin fragment displaces the AP180 fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Auxilin 1 was previously demonstrated to bind and to assist hsc70 in the uncoating of trypsin-clipped clathrin cages that lack the TD (5Ungewickell E.

This suggests that auxilin 1 recognizes at least two distinct sites on clathrin: one on the TD, as shown above, and another somewhere else on the heavy chain. This could clearly be shown by incubating AP180 together with auxilin 1-(547–813) with intact cages and with cages that had been treated with increasing trypsin to remove the TD either partially or completely. Auxilin 1-(547–813) could be used for this experiment, because we knew from previous work that it binds trypsin-clipped clathrin cages (3Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast AP180 is known to require an intact heavy chain for binding (30Murphy J.E. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10850-10855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The different binding characteristics of the two proteins are clearly demonstrated here: while auxilin 1-(547–813) binds to cages, irrespective of the presence of the TD, binding of AP180 declines dramatically upon its removal (compare lane P3 with the control lane P4 in Fig.3). To localize the clathrin binding elements within auxilin 1 more precisely, we expressed the segments 547–714, 619–738, and 715–901 with a polyhistidine tag in bacteria (Fig.4). The recombinant proteins were purified on a Ni-NTA affinity resin and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography. All fragments interacted with GST-TD and GST-α-appendage in pull-down experiments, albeit to different extents (Fig. 5). For the binding experiments the concentrations of the recombinant fragments were adjusted to 3.5 μm, and all pull-downs were performed in parallel to allow semi-quantitative estimates of binding efficiencies. Consistently we observed that auxilin 1-(715–901) interacted less efficiently with the clathrin TD than the fusion proteins contai"

We identified two genes (gdrAB) ofKlebsiella pneumoniae for a glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor (Tobimatsu, T., Kajiura, H., Yunoki, M., Azuma, M., and Toraya, T. (1999) J.

The purified factor reactivated the glycerol-inactivated and O2-inactivated glycerol dehydratases as well as activated the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex in vitro in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and adenosylcobalamin. The factor mediated the exchange of the enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamins for free, adenine-containing cobalamins in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ through intermediate formation of apoenzyme. The factor showed extremely low ATP-hydrolyzing activity and formed a tight complex with apoenzyme in the presence of ADP. Incubation of the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex with the reactivating factor in the presence of ADP brought about release of the enzyme-bound cobalamin. The resulting tight inactive complex of apoenzyme with the factor dissociated upon incubation with ATP, forming functional apoenzyme and a low affinity form of factor. Thus, it was established that the reactivation of the inactivated holoenzymes takes place in two steps: ADP-dependent cobalamin release and ATP-dependent dissociation of the apoenzyme-factor complex. We propose that the glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor is a molecular chaperone that participates in reactivation of the inactivated enzymes.

Diol dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.28), an isofunctional enzyme, is inducibly formed when certain bacteria are grown in a medium containing 1,2-propanediol (3Toraya T. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 217-254Google Scholar). This enzyme involved mainly in the utilization of 1,2-propanediol by Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria (3Toraya T. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) ofKlebsiella oxytoca has been well characterized (18Toraya T. Mori K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13170-13178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is a molecular chaperon-like factor that mediates ATP-dependent release of the tightly bound, modified coenzyme from the inactivated holoenzyme. The reactivation takes place in two steps (i.e.ADP-dependent cobalamin release and ATP-dependent dissociation of apodiol dehydratase-reactivating factor complex (19Mori K. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13170-13178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). The amino acid sequences of GdrA and GdrB are 61 and 30% identical to those of DdrA and DdrB, respectively (17Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although functional similarity of these reactivating factors was suggested from these sequence similarities, the reactivating factor for glycerol dehydratase has not yet been investigated in vitro. In the present paper, we report the purification, characterization, and mechanism of action of the recombinant glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor. During the preparation of this manuscript, a paper has appeared that reports characterization of a similar factor of Citrobacter freundii (20Seifert C. Bowien S. Gottschalk G. Daniel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2369-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of its function still remains obscure. Crystalline AdoCbl was a gift from Eizai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). CN-Cbl was obtained from Glaxo Wellcome. AdePeCbl was prepared as described before (21Sando G.N. Grant M.E. Hogenkamp H.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 428: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and [57Co]CN-Cbl (specific activity, 240 μCi/μg) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and ICN Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Glycerol dehydratase was purified from Escherichia coli JM109 carrying pUSI2E(GD) (12Tobimatsu T. Azuma M. Matsubara H. Takatori H. Niida T. Nishimoto K. Satoh H. Hayashi R. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22352-22357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by Sepharose CL-6B and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. Glycerol dehydratase with a specific activity of more than 50 units/mg of protein was used in this study. All other chemicals and the enzymes used for construction of plasmids were commercial products of the highest grade available and were used without further purification. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as a host. The expression plasmid for the glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor was constructed as follows. The plasmid pCXV(gdrB·gdrA) (13Tobimatsu T. Kajiura H. Yunoki M. Azuma M. Toraya T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4110-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested completely with BglII and partially with NdeI. The resulting 2.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment was inserted into theNdeI-BamHI region of pET21a to produce pET(gdrB·gdrA). E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying plasmid pET(gdrB·gdrA) was cultured in Terrific Broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. When the culture reached an A650 of ∼1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm. The E. coli cells were cultivated overnight at 17 °C, harvested, and stored at −80 °C until use. About 15 g of wet cells were suspended in 150 ml of 0.05 mpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. To the cell extract obtained after centrifugation at 27,200 × g for 30 min, ammonium sulfate was added to 5% saturation. After removal of a precipitate by centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to 25% saturation. The precipitate was collected, dissolved in 15 ml of 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and dialyzed against 5 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Dialysate was applied onto a Sepharose CL-6B column (bed volume, 500 ml) that was equilibrated with 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 0.3 m 1,2-propanediol. The column was developed with the same buffer, and the fractions containing GdrA and GdrB were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a Centriplus-10 concentrator (Amicon) and stored at −80 °C. The amount of propionaldehyde formed from 1,2-propanediol was determined by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone method (22Toraya T. Ushio K. Fukui S. Hogenkamp H.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of glycerol dehydratase is defined as the amount of enzyme activity that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of propionaldehyde/min at 37 °C with 1,2-propanediol as substrate. Activity of the glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor was assayed with 1,2-propanediol as substrate by its capability of activating the inactive enzyme·CN-Cbl complex. This activity was well correlated with its capability of reactivating the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme. Protein concentration of crude enzyme and reactivating factor was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentrations of purified glycerol dehydratase and its reactivating factor were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar) for the reactivating factor was 86,500m−1 cm−1. PAGE was performed under nondenaturing conditions as described by Davis (25Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15911) Google Scholar) or under denaturing conditions as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205461) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE of glycerol dehydratase was performed in the presence of 0.1 m 1,2-propanediol to prevent its subunits from dissociation (27Poznanskaya A.A. Tanizawa K. Soda K. Toraya T. Fukui S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In some experiments, ATP or ADP was also added with MgCl2 (1 mm each) and KCl (2 mm) to gels and electrode buffer. Protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The NIH Image program, version 1.61 (National Institutes of Health) was used for densitometric analysis of gels. The products formed by the hydrolysis of ATP with the reactivating factor were analyzed by TLC on a poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose F plate (Merck) with 2 mformic acid containing 0.5 m LiCl as a solvent system (28Mangold H.K. Stahl E. 2nd ed. Thin-Layer Chromatography: A Laboratory Handbook. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1969: 786-807Google Scholar), as described before (19Mori K. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13170-13178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ATP-hydrolyzing activity of the reactivating factor was assayed by the release of [32P]Pifrom [γ-32P]ATP, as described before (19Mori K. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13170-13178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) by a modification of the method of Schnebli and Abrams (29Schnebli H.P. Abrams A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of the factor was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼3.1 × 106 dpm) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 3 mm MgCl2, in a total volume of 100 μl. After termination of the reaction by adding 0.9 ml of ice-cold suspension of 6% (w/v) charcoal in 50 mmNaH2PO4 and mixing vigorously for 10 min, the charcoal was removed by centrifugation. The amount of radioactivity in 0.5 ml of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting, and ATPase activity was obtained by subtracting the radioactivity of a minus reactivating factor control. The Mrof the two proteins (64,000 and 12,000) overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pET(gdrB·gdrA) corresponded to the predicted molecular weights of GdrA (63,594) and GdrB (11,994), respectively. They were co-purified through ammonium sulfate fractionation and Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography (Fig.1A) and migrated as a single band when electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions (Fig.1B). The sequences of N-terminal six amino acids of the large and small subunits were confirmed by Edman sequencing to be identical with those predicted from the nucleotide sequences ofgdrAB (13Tobimatsu T. Kajiura H. Yunoki M. Azuma M. Toraya T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4110-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis indicated that the molar ratio of the large and small polypeptides was ∼1:1. The apparent molecular weight of the complex determined by FPLC with a calibrated Superose 6 column (HR 10/30) was ∼135,000 (data not shown), suggesting that the subunit structure of the putative reactivating factor is most likely (GdrA)2(GdrB)2. Reactivation of the glycerol-inactivated hologlycerol dehydratase in vitro was monitored by the recovery of 1,2-propanediol-dehydrating activity. In the presence of the purified reactivating factor, AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+, the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme restored its catalytic activity but not at all without the factor nor in the absence of ATP and Mg2+ (Fig.2A). Fig. 2B showed that the holoenzyme inactivated by O2 in the absence of substrate (9Poznanskaya A.A. Yakusheva M.I. Yakovlev V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 484: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Johnson B.C. Stroinski A. Schneider Z. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) also underwent rapid reactivation by the factor in the presence of AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+ without a significant lag period. Thus, it is evident that the putative reactivating factor actually functions as a reactivating factor for both glycerol-inactivated and O2-inactivated hologlycerol dehydratases in vitro. The inactive complex of glycerol dehydratase with CN-Cbl, an adenine-lacking cobalamin, can be considered as a model of the inactivated holoenzyme. Fig. 2C indicated that the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex was also activated rapidly in vitroby the factor in the presence of free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+. In contrast, the complex of enzyme with AdePeCbl, an adenine-containing cobalamin, did not undergo significant activation (Fig. 2D). AdePeCbl is an inactive analog of AdoCbl, in which the ribose moiety is replaced by a pentamethylene group (21Sando G.N. Grant M.E. Hogenkamp H.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 428: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and forms a very tight complex with diol dehydratase (22Toraya T. Ushio K. Fukui S. Hogenkamp H.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absolute requirement of both reactivation of glycerol-inactivated and O2-inactivated holoenzymes and activation of the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex for free AdoCbl strongly suggested that the reactivation and the activation take place by exchange of the enzyme-bound, modified coenzyme and CN-Cbl, respectively, for free intact AdoCbl. CN-Cbl and AdePeCbl were used as models of the modified and intact coenzymes, respectively (18Toraya T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3372-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex was incubated with or without the reactivating factor in the presence of AdePeCbl, ATP, and Mg2+, followed by dialysis to remove unbound cobalamins, the spectrum of the dialysate indicated that the enzyme-bound CN-Cbl was replaced by AdePeCbl in the presence of factor (Fig. 3A). This exchange did not occur without the factor. The reverse was not the case even in the presence of factor, ATP, and Mg2+ (Fig.3B). Thus, it was suggested that the reactivating factor mediates the exchange of the enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamin for free, adenine-containing cobalamin. To examine the possibility that only an upper ligand undergoes exchange under the conditions, the enzyme·[57Co]CN-Cbl complex was incubated with and without the factor in the presence of AdePeCbl, ATP, and Mg2+, followed by ultrafiltration to remove unbound cobalamins. One of the typical results is shown in TableI. The 57Co radioactivity bound to glycerol dehydratase was almost completely lost in the presence of factor, ADP, and Mg2+, whereas the amount of radioactivity corresponding to more than 1 mol of CN-Cbl/mol of enzyme was retained in the protein fraction in the absence of factor. In the presence of ATP, a half of [57Co]CN-Cbl bound to enzyme was lost by the factor. This result, together with the spectroscopic observation, indicated that the entire molecule of enzyme-bound CN-Cbl underwent the exchange for free AdePeCbl or release in the presence of reactivating factor. It is evident that ADP is more effective than ATP for this exchange or release.Table IReactivating factor-mediated exchange of glycerol dehydratase-bound CN-Cbl for free AdePeCblNucleotide addedReactivating factorProtein-bound 57CoCN-Cbl bound to glycerol dehydratasecpmmol/molATP+9280.64−1,7501.22ADP+1500.10−1,9201.34Enzyme·[57Co]CN-Cbl complex was prepared by incubating apoenzyme (10 units) with 15 μm [57Co]CN-Cbl (5,780 cpm/nmol) at 37 °C for 30 min in 70 μl of 0.04m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8). To 30 μl of the resulting mixture was added 0.14 mg or none of reactivating factor in 35 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 15 mm ATP or ADP plus 15 mm MgCl2 and 5 μm AdePeCbl in a total volume of 90 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then ultrafiltrated on a Microcon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon) to remove unbound cobalamins. The protein fraction retained on the filter was washed twice with 90 μl of 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 16 mm ATP or ADP plus 16 mm MgCl2.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme·[57Co]CN-Cbl complex was prepared by incubating apoenzyme (10 units) with 15 μm [57Co]CN-Cbl (5,780 cpm/nmol) at 37 °C for 30 min in 70 μl of 0.04m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8). To 30 μl of the resulting mixture was added 0.14 mg or none of reactivating factor in 35 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 15 mm ATP or ADP plus 15 mm MgCl2 and 5 μm AdePeCbl in a total volume of 90 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then ultrafiltrated on a Microcon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon) to remove unbound cobalamins. The protein fraction retained on the filter was washed twice with 90 μl of 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 16 mm ATP or ADP plus 16 mm MgCl2. The57Co radioactivity in the protein fraction was determined by a γ-counter. The similar experiment without the factor was carried out as a control. Data are means (n = 2). Glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme and the enzyme·aqCbl·5′-deoxyadenosine complex were incubated with the reactivating factor in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and K2SO3 and then dialyzed to remove unbound cobalamin. SO32− was added to prevent the dissociated aqCbl from reassociation with the enzyme by converting it to sulfitocobalamin (31Toraya T. Watanabe N. Ushio K. Matsumoto T. Fukui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9296-9301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrum of the dialysate from the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme indicated that, although a small amount of cob(II)alamin remained bound, a major part of the enzyme-bound cobalamin was released in the presence of factor but not in its absence (Fig. 3C). Catalytic activity was restored by adding AdoCbl to the dialysate (data not shown). Fig. 3D showed that most of the enzyme-bound aqCbl dissociated from the inactive enzyme·aqCbl·5′-deoxyadenosine complex, a model of the inactivated holoenzyme. It was thus concluded that apoenzyme is formed as an intermediate in the reactivating factor-mediated cobalamin exchange. When ATP was incubated with the reactivating factor, time-dependent decrease of ATP and formation of ADP were observed by TLC (data not shown). Release of [32P]Pi was observed upon incubation of [γ-32P]ATP with the factor, indicating that the factor hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and Pi.kcat was 1.5 min−1 (mean,n = 5). The time required for hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP/mol of factor was calculated to be ∼40 s, indicating that this factor is an ATPase with extremely low activity. Glycerol dehydratase itself did not hydrolyze ATP at all. The ATP-hydrolyzing activity (kcat) of the factor during glycerol dehydration (reactivating condition) was 0.9 min−1, which was significantly lower than that during 1,2-propanediol dehydration (essentially nonreactivating condition) (1.6 min−1) or in the absence of AdoCbl (1.5 min−1). The molar ratio of glycerol dehydratase to reactivating factor was ∼1:3 in this experiment. When the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the factor was measured with various ratios of the enzyme to the factor, ATP-hydrolyzing activity decreased until the molar ratio became to ∼2:1 (Fig. 4). It was thus suggested that the ATPase activity of the reactivating factor is inhibited by its binding to glycerol dehydratase. Complex formation between glycerol dehydratase and its reactivating factor was analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE (Fig.5). When apoenzyme was incubated with the factor in the presence of ADP, a new major band appeared (Fig.5C). When this band was developed in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE, all of the α, β, and γ subunits of glycerol dehydratase and the GdrA and GdrB proteins were detected (data not shown), indicating that this band is a complex between the enzyme and the factor. Formation of the apoenzyme-factor complex was much less in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 5A) and not detectable at all in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the ADP- and ATP-bound reactivating factors are high and low affinity forms for the apoenzyme, respectively. When the factor was incubated with enzyme-cobalamin complexes, the enzyme-factor complex was not formed at all from either enzyme·AdePeCbl or enzyme·CN-Cbl complex in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5B) or in its absence (Fig.5A). In the presence of ADP, only a small amount of the enzyme-factor complex was formed from the enzyme·AdePeCbl complex, a “nonactivable” complex, whereas a large amount of the enzyme-factor complex was formed from the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex, an “activable” complex (Fig. 5C). The second band of the complex was observed in these cases. It may have an assembly different from the first one, although their exact molar compositions were not determined. When the enzyme·CN-Cbl and enzyme·AdePeCbl complexes were incubated with and without the reactivating factor in the presence and absence of ATP or ADP, followed by ultrafiltration to remove unbound cobalamins, the spectrum of the protein fraction indicated that most of the enzyme-bound CN-Cbl was released from the enzyme by the factor in the presence of ADP (Fig.6A). The release was not observed at all without the factor, indicating that the ADP form of the factor causes release of the enzyme-bound CN-Cbl. ATP was also effective for the release of CN-Cbl but to a lesser extent. This suggests that ATP exerts its effect after being hydrolyzed to ADP. In contrast, the factor-mediated release of the enzyme-bound AdePeCbl was not observed with either ADP or ATP (Fig. 6B). It seems likely that the enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamins are released from the enzyme through the complex formation with the reactivating factor. The effect of enzyme-factor complex formation on catalytic activity was investigated with added coenzyme. When apoglycerol dehydratase was incubated with the reactivating factor in the presence of ADP, it lost enzyme activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7C). ADP alone did not inhibit the activity (data not shown). The inhibition was observed in the absence of ADP as well but to a lesser degree (Fig. 7B). In contrast, inhibition was not observed at all in the presence of ATP. It is likely that the extent of inhibition of enzyme activity by the factor depends on formation of the enzyme-factor complex. Thus, it was concluded that the apoenzyme-factor complex is unable to be reconstituted into active holoenzyme with added AdoCbl. When ATP was added together with AdoCbl, it completely reversed the inhibition (Fig.7), probably by facilitating dissociation of the inactive apoenzyme-factor complex into free apoenzyme and the factor. Such an effect of ATP on the dissociation of the complex was confirmed by nondenaturing PAGE (data not shown) and seems reasonable, because the ATP-bound reactivating factor is the low affinity form for glycerol dehydratase. Glycerol dehydratase as well as diol dehydratase undergoes rapid inactivation by glycerol during catalysis (3Toraya T. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30.

Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 413-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enigma was solved by our discovery of the reactivation systems in the bacteria that produce these enzymes (10Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ushio K. Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The subunit structure, function, and mechanism of action of the putative reactivating factor was unraveled with diol dehydratase for the first time (18Toraya T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3372-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Mori K. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13170-13178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and now with glycerol dehydratase. Recently, we obtained evidence for the presence of a specific reactivating factor for ethanolamine ammonia-lyase as well. 2K. Mori and T. Toraya, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it seems likely that other AdoCbl-dependent enzymes also have their own reactivating factors. This prediction would be quite reasonable, because all of the AdoCbl-dependent enzymes catalyze reactions by a radical mechanism and therefore tend to undergo inactivation during catalysis or even in the absence of substrate (32Toraya T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 106-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The reactivating factor for diol dehydratase was shown to cross-reactivate the glycerol dehydratase in permeabilized E. coli cells (33Tobimatsu T. Kajiura H. Toraya T. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This fact was supported by the finding that the reactivating factor for glycerol dehydratase was very similar to that for diol dehydratase in the subunit structure and the functional role. However, it should be noted that the glycerol dehydratase-reactivating factor was not capable of cross-reactivating the inactivated holoenzyme of diol dehydratase (20Seifert C. Bowien S. Gottschalk G. Daniel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2369-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Tobimatsu T. Kajiura H. Toraya T. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This indicates that there must be differences between them as well. The reactivating factor showed low but distinct ATPase activity. Although the hydrolysis of ATP was absolutely required for reactivation of the inactivated holoenzymes by the reactivating factor (10Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ATP hydrolysis was not directly linked to the reactivation of the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme. Such a phenomenon is seen with diol dehydratase-reactivating factor (19Mori K. Toraya T.

Biophys. 1989; 268: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ATPase activity of the reactivating factor by binding to apoenzyme under reactivating conditions was observed here for the first time. This may be suitable for cellular economy of energy. Fig. 8A shows the two-step mechanism that we propose for the reactivation of glycerol-inactivated hologlycerol dehydratase. The O2-inactivated holoenzyme and the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex can be (re)activated by the same mechanism. First, the factor-bound ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, which induces the conformational change of the factor from a low affinity form to a high affinity form. Complexation of the ADP form of the factor with inactivated holoenzymes results in release of the modified coenzyme, because the apoenzyme gets energetically more stabilized by complex formation with the ADP form of factor than with adenine-lacking cobalamins. The resulting apoenzyme-factor (ADP form) complex is inactive even when assayed with added AdoCbl, but the exchange of the factor-bound ADP for free ATP induces the conformational change of the factor back to the low affinity form and results in dissociation of the complex into free apoenzyme and the ATP form of the factor. The free apoenzyme can be reconstituted to catalytically active holoenzyme with added AdoCbl, and the reactivating factor returns to the reactivation cycle by hydrolysis of ATP. The rate of ATP hydrolysis under reactivating conditions (0.9 min−1) is in the same range as the rate of mechanism-based inactivation of the holoenzyme by glycerol (0.35 min−1) (36Yakusheva M.I. Malahov A.A. Poznanskaya A.A. Yakovlev V.A. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inactivation of the enzyme and its reactivation are not directly coupled but roughly synchronized. ATP plays dual roles in the reactivation as the precursor of ADP for cobalamin release and as the allosteric effector for dissociation of the enzyme-factor complex. The following two assumptions are important for interpreting discrimination of the adenine-lacking cobalamin from adenine-containing cobalamin (Fig. 8B). (i) There is an equilibrium between enzyme-cobalamin complex plus reactivating factor (ADP form) and a cobalamin-enzyme-factor (ADP form) ternary complex, and (ii) release of cobalamin occurs from this ternary complex. If the enzyme-bound cobalamin is an adenine-lacking cobalamin, the equilibrium toward the right would be favored, and the cobalamin would be finally released from the enzyme. The enzyme would become more stabilized upon complex formation with the ADP form of factor than with an adenine-lacking cobalamin. In contrast, if the enzyme-bound cobalamin is an adenine-containing cobalamin, the equilibrium would shift toward the left, and the cobalamin would be virtually unreleased. This difference could be explained by a larger binding energy with an adenine-containing cobalamin than that with an adenine-lacking cobalamin upon binding to the enzyme. In the case of diol dehydratase, it was shown from the KD value for adenine (37Toraya T. Matsumoto T. Ichikawa M. Itoh T. Sugawara T. Mizuno Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9289-9293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the presence of adenine moiety may decrease Keqby a magnitude of 1.7 × 104 (19Mori K. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13170-13178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All of the data presented in this paper indicate that the complex of GdrA and GdrB serves as the reactivating factor for glycerol dehydratase by a mechanism similar to that of diol dehydratase-reactivating factor. Both of these factors bind to the target proteins and induce their conformational change through tight complex formation with them. This results in release of the modified coenzyme, and the reactivating factors themselves do not become a constituent of the final products. Thus, they meet the criteria of molecular chaperones. Their extremely low ATPase activity is not unusual for molecular chaperones (35Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). Three regions of the deduced amino acid sequence of the GdrA and DdrA subunits of the factors show high fragmentary similarity with those of the DnaK protein and the other Hsp70 group of molecular chaperones (17Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Bardwell J.C.A. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, the ATP/ADP-switching mechanism might be conserved between these reactivating factors for glycerol and diol dehydratases and the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones.

Expression of IFNA genes in infected cells is cell type-dependent and is regulated at the transcriptional level. The present study is focused on the molecular mechanism underlying the differential expression of human IFNA1 and A2 genes. Two nucleotides, at positions −98 and −81 of IFNA1 and A2 promoter, were pivotal to the differential expression. The DNA pull-down and chromatin precipitation assays have shown that nuclear interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7 as well as IRF-1 bind to IFNA1 virus-responsive element (VRE). Interestingly, overexpression of IRF-7 increased the otherwise weak binding of both IRF-3 and IRF-7 to IFNA2 VRE. These data together with the results of two-step chromatin immunoprecipitation strongly suggest that the IRF-3 and IRF-7 bind to IFNA1 promoter as a dimer. Furthermore, binding of IRF-3 and IRF-7 to IFNA VRE is associated with the presence of acetylated histone H3, suggesting that histone acetyltransferase(s) is tethered together with virus-activated IRF-3 and IRF-7 to the IFNA1 promoter. In addition, the constitutively active IRF-3 (5D) and IRF-7 (2D) mutants activate the endogenous IFNA genes in uninfected cells; however, the expression profile of IFNA is not identical to that induced by viral infection.

Virus-mediated activation of Type I IFN gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional levels. The minimal cis-acting elements that confer the response of Type I IFN genes to the virus-activated signaling are located within the 110 nucleotides 5′ of the transcription initiation site (2Hiscott J.

The virus-responsive element (VRE) in the IFNA promoter region contains purine-rich GAAANN motifs that serve as a specific binding site for the proteins of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. Nine cellular IRFs and three viral homologues have been identified (4Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M.

All of the cellular IRFs share a region of homology in the amino terminus encompassing a highly conserved DNA-binding domain characterized by five tryptophane repeats (4Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Three of these repeats contact DNA recognizing the GAAA or AANNGAAA sequences (9Fujii Y.

KSHV-encoded IRFs that contain an imperfect DNA-binding domain are not able to bind DNA with the same specificity as cellular IRFs. Several IRFs were implicated in the regulation of Type I IFN gene expression in virus-infected cells. Among them, IRF-1 was first identified as an activator of IFNB gene, whereas IRF-2 antagonized the IRF-1-mediated activation and behaved as a suppressor. Despite the observation that the embryonic fibroblasts from IRF-1 −/− mice express normal level of IFNA and B (12Matsuyama T. Kimura T. Kitagawa M. Pfeffer K. Kawakami T. Watanabe N. Kundig T.M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4798-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it was observed that IRF-1 is associated with the human IFNB promoter in vivo, thus suggesting that IRF-1 may contribute to the transcriptional regulation of human IFN B gene (14Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Three IRFs (IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7) were shown to be the direct transducers of virus-mediated signaling and to play a crucial role in the expression of Type I IFN genes (15Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S.

Although IRF-3 is constitutively expressed in all types of cell (22Au W.C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), constitutive expression of IRF-7 can be detected mostly in lymphoid cells. In most cell types, expression of IRF-7 can be stimulated by Type I IFN (16Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Expression of IRF-5 seems to be restricted to B cells and dendritic cells (24Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the murine system, the induction of Type I IFN genes in virus-infected cells was proposed to proceed by two sequential phases. During the initial phase, which does not require protein synthesis, transcription of IFNB and IFNA4 genes is activated. The second phase, during which the rest of IFNA subtypes is induced, depends on IFN-mediated induction of IRF-7 expression (20Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation are the recent results from infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts with homozygous deletion of IRF-3 gene that displayed significant reduction of Type I IFN expression, and an additional defect in IFN signaling pathway completely abolished the virus-mediated induction of Type I IFN genes (21Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). In human cells, however, overexpression of IRF-3 only stimulates expression of IFNB gene (28Juang Y.-T. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.-C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and the expression of IRF-7 is essential for the induction of all IFNA genes. Cells, such as 2fTGH fibroblasts, that do not express IRF-7 are impaired in virus-mediated induction of all IFNA genes, which can be rescued upon reconstitution of IRF-7 expression (17Yeow W.-S.

Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ribozyme-targeted reduction of IRF-3 levels also resulted in a dramatic decrease in expression of some IFNA subtypes, suggesting that IRF-3 is also indispensable for the induction of certain IFNA genes (18Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Lowther P.W. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly induction of IFNA genes can be also rescued in non-IRF-7-expressing cells by overexpression of IRF-5, but activation of this transcription factor is virus-specific and results in expression of different IFNA subtypes than found in infected cells expressing IRF-7 (24Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In infected cells both IRF-3 and IRF-7 are phosphorylated by an yet unidentified kinase and retained in the nucleus, where IRF-3 but not IRF-7 further interacts with the transcription co-activator, p300/CBP (30Lin R.

Structure-function analysis of IRF-3 and IRF-7 proteins revealed that both of these IRFs contain the auto-inhibitory domain, which in transient transfection assay suppresses the transcription activity of these factors (34Lin R.

Furthermore, the results of the study with IRF-7 dominant negative mutant suggested that IRF-3 and IRF-7 can form homodimers and heterodimers and that these interactions are critical for the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of endogenous IFNA genes (15Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

The interaction between the members of IRF family was found to result in novel biological activities (38Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6468-6478PubMed Google Scholar). Although the promoters of all IFNA genes are highly homologous, differential expression of these genes as a function of cell type and inducing agents has been observed (39Hiscott J. Cantell K.

J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), IFNA1 was the major subtype expressed in human fibroblast expressing ectopic IRF-7 (17Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C.

The aim of this study was to gain more insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the differential expression of human IFNA1 and IFNA2 genes. To this effect, we have identified the critical cis- and trans- regulatory elements regulating expression of the endogenous IFNA1 and IFNA2 genes in HeLa cells as well as in human 2fTGH cells, in which the expression of IRF-7 was reconstituted by ectopic IRF-7 or its mutants. The results have indicated a critical role of IRF-3/IRF-7 heterodimers in the stimulation of transcription of these two IFNA genes and showed that the relative levels of IRF-7 in the cells affect the assembly of IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-7, and acetyltransferase on the transcriptionally active promoters of IFNA1 and IFNA2 genes in infected cells. 2fTGH (kindly provided by Dr. G. Stark), 293T, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For infection, Sendai virus purchased from Specific Pathogen Free Avian Supply (Preston, CT) at a concentration of 240 hemagglutinin units/60-mm plate or 15 hemagglutinin units/well of 24-well plate was used. Mutant IFNA SAP reporter genes were generated by inserting synthesize double-stranded oligomer corresponding to the IFN VRE (−109 to −54) into ptk-SAP vector at SalI and XbaI sites. IRF-7 (Δ247–467) and IRF-7/3 expression plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. R. Lin. The other plasmids used in this study were described previously (15Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All the transfections were done using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Culture medium collected from IFNA SAP reporter gene-transfected cells was first clarified by centrifugation and incubated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactive the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. The samples were then incubated with 2 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphatase substrate in diethanolamine buffer. The resulting product was quantified with a microplate reader at 210 nm. Total RNA was purified from cells by the guanidine isothiocynate method. Following the treatment of DNase I, 1 μg of RNA sample was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in 30 μl of final volume, using oligo(dT)12–18as primer. Primer sets that amplify all the IFNA subtypes, β actin, IRF-3, and IRF-7 cDNAs were described previously (15Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Pitha P.M.

The conditions used for the reverse transcription-PCR in this study were identical to that used previously. The 25 cycles of amplification yielded a semi-quantitative result (15Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 293T cells transfected with IRF-3, and various IRF-7 expression plasmids were lyzed in co-precipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged and precleared with protein A-agarose for 2 h. The supernatant (200 μg) was then incubated with the respective antibody overnight. After extensive washing with the co-precipitation buffer, precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by Western blot. DNA pull-down assay was done as described recently (15Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, biotinylated double-stranded oligomers corresponding to the IFNAVRE region (−110 to −53 base pairs) were synthesized and coupled with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal Inc.). Nuclear extract dialyzed against the binding buffer (10% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mmMgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were then incubated with the DNA bound magnetic beads in the presence of salmon sperm DNA as nonspecific competitor for 4 h at 4 °C. After gentle washing of the beads, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the presence of DNA-binding protein was identified by Western blot. The detailed assay procedure was described previously (24Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (5 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of IFNA SAP reporter genes. At 16 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with Sendai virus for 5.5 h. To cross-link the proteins bound to DNA, the cells were treated with 11% formaldehyde (0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 1% for 30 min at 37 °C. The in vivocross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of glycine to final concentration of 0.125 m. The cell pellets were washed and resuspended in 400 μl of sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) on ice and lysed by sonication for 10 s. These samples were then diluted 10-fold with 3.6 ml of dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with protein A-agarose for 2 h. Following the preclearing, equal amounts of proteins (as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-acetylated Histone 3 (Upstate Inc), anti-IRF-7, or anti-NFκβ p65 antibodies (Santa Cruz) or monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2, Strategene Inc.) or IRF-3 antibody (PharMingene, Inc.) for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were extensively washed with the dilution buffer, resuspended in TE buffer (100μl), and treated with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) for 4 h. The cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were reverted by heating at 65 °C for 6 h, and the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA purified by precipitation with ethanol in the presence of 2 m ammonium acetate was resuspended in 60 μl of water, and 15 μl were used as a template for PCR amplification with IFNA-SAP specific primers that could amplify both IFNA1 and IFNA2 VRE (sense, 5′-AAGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGGT; antisense, 5′-ACAGTGGCCAGGCAGGAATTGATCT). These primers detect selectively transfected plasmids and not the endogenous promoters. The PCR was performed with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolab Inc.) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA thermal cycler at 94 °C, for 4 min for 1 cycle; 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles; and 72 °C for 3 min for 1 cycle. We have previously observed that in infected human fibroblast, 2fTGH, ectopically expressing IRF-7, IFNA1 was the major induced subtype (17Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Juang Y.-T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although the expression of IFNA2 in these cells was very low. It was shown previously that recombinant IRF-7 but not IRF-3 binds efficiently to IFNA2 VRE (17Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Juang Y.-T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Lin R. Genin P. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6342-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); however, the detailed analysis of the functional IRF-binding sites in VRE of IFNA1 and IFNA2 genes has not been performed. To determine the cis-acting elements that are responsible for the differential expression of IFNA1 and IFNA2 genes in infected cells, we have focused on the −103 to −67 region of IFNA1 promoter, which was previously showed by the DNase footprinting analysis, to bind recombinant IRF-3 and IRF-7 (17Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Juang Y.-T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This region contains two potential IRF-binding sites (IRF-E) that are present both in the IFNA1 and IFNA2 promoters. These sites can be aligned with the PRDIII and PRDI of IFNB VRE (Fig.1 A). Both of these IRF-Es contain the AANNGAAA consensus sequence determined by x-ray crystallography as the IRF-2 DNA-binding site (9Fujii Y. Shimizu T. Kusumoto M. Kyogoku Y. Taniguchi T. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5028-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To identify which of these IRF-Es in IFNA1 and IFNA2 promoters determine the differential response to viral infection, we constructed series of mutated VRE in which the nucleotides in the IRF-Es of IFNA1VRE were sequentially replaced by those present in IFNA2 (Fig. 1 A). The ability of the VRE mutants to activate transcription of the reporter gene, SAP, was then tested by a transient transfection assay in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Sendai virus infection resulted in a 23-fold of induction of IFNA1SAP, whereas the induction of IFNA2 SAP was only 3-fold. The IFNA1 mutant containing either three nucleotide changes (4PM) from IFNA1 to IFNA2, in the region corresponding to PRDI or a single nucleotide change in this region (M1) lost the virus-mediated inducibility. These results indicated that the −81 adenine is crucial for the inducibility of this VRE, whereas the cytosine and guanine at positions −86 (M2) and −79 (M4), respectively, were not critical. Interestingly, when a guanine at position −98 was deleted from IFNA1 VRE, thereby creating a perfect match to IFNA2 in the PRDIII corresponding region, the inducibility of the resulting mutant (M5) has decreased to a level similar to that of IFNA2 reporter. Also when the IRF-E in the PRDIII corresponding region was disrupted (M3), this mutant did not respond the virus-mediated induction. To further confirm that the −98 G and −81 A are the determinants of the differential expression of the IFNA1 and IFNA2 genes, we generated IFNA2-VRE mutant (plasmid 2>1) in which we inserted guanine at position −98, replaced guanine with adenine at position −81, and found that the inducibility of this mutant was restored to about 60% of the activity of IFNA1 reporter. To determine whether the PRDI- and PRDIII-like regions are equally important for the induction, we replaced nucleotides either in position −98 or in position−81 of IFNA2 VRE (M6 and M7, respectively) and analyzed the activity of these mutants. The results have shown that the PRDIII-like element is more important for the virus-mediated induction of IFNA1 promoter, because the mutation in position −98 led to 12-fold induction, whereas the mutation in −81 led to only 7-fold induction. Taken together, these data indicated that two nucleotides within the two IRF-binding sites of IFNA1 VRE and IFNA2 VRE determine their response to viral infection. To determine whether spacing between these IRF-Es is important for the activation of these VREs, we have tested the expression of a mutant that contains a 5bp insertion between the two putative IRF-Es in the IFNA1 VRE and found that this mutant (5bp) is not inducible by virus. These results strongly suggest that the interaction between IRF proteins binding to these sites is important for the gene activation. Consistent with this notion, we found that mutation (M1 and M5) in either of the IRF-binding sites is sufficient to abolish the induction, indicating that these two IRF-binding sites cannot function independently. We have shown that previously that the relative level of IRF-3 and IRF-7 modulated the expression profile of IFNA subtypes (18Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Lowther P.W. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine how the relative levels of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in the cells affect the expression of IFNA1 and IFNA2 genes, we examined the expression of the reporter plasmids containing the IFNA1, IFNA2 VRE, or their mutants in infected cells overexpressing either IRF-3 or IRF-7. The results of the transient transfection assay showed (Fig. 1 B) that overexpression of IRF-3 resulted in a 2–3-fold increase of expression of IFNB reporter gene. There was little effect on the expression of all of the IFNA reporter plasmids tested, suggesting that the levels of IRF-3 in HeLa cells are not a rate-limiting factor for the induction of IFNA genes. Because IRF-3 was shown to form homodimers in vivo, we speculated that overexpression of IRF-3 may result in increased levels of IRF-3 homodimer in the cells, which by itself is unable to activate IFNA VRE. This result is consistent with our previous observation that overexpression of IRF-3 in the absence of IRF-7 failed to induce IFNA genes in infected cells (17Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Juang Y.-T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). By contrast, overexpression of IRF-7 substantially enhanced the inducibility of IFNA VRE. Interestingly, expression of IFNA1 VRE mutants that completely lost virus inducibility (e.g. M1 and M5) was partially rescued by IRF-7. Furthermore the expression of IFNA1 VRE with single nucleotide mutation in PRDI- or PRDIII-corresponding regions (M6 and M7) was about 2-fold more effective than the expression of wt IFNA2 VRE. These results indicate that increased levels of IRF-7, which may facilitate formation of IRF-7 homodimers and/or increase the relative levels of IRF-3/IRF-7 heterodimers, enhances the expression of otherwise silenced IFNA2 VRE in a transient transfection assay. These data also indicate that the presence of an AANNGAAA motif in PRDI- or PRDIII-corresponding regions is involved in the IRF-7-mediated activation. It is also noteworthy that the only two mutants that failed to respond to the IRF-7 overexpression-mediated rescue are 5bp and M3. This result indicates that the spacing and integrity of these two IRF-Es are essential for the IRF-7-mediated activation of IFNA VRE. It was shown previously that the constitutively active mutants of IRF-3 and IRF-7, IRF-3 (5D) and IRF-7 (2D), respectively, were able to activate IFNA and IFNB reporter genes in the absence of viral infection (34Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 35Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting their virus-independent nuclear localization. We have therefore analyzed the ability of these mutants to activate expression of IFNA1 and IFNA2 VRE reporters and their mutants in uninfected cells. As shown in Fig.2, overexpression of IRF-7 (2D) in uninfected HeLa cells resulted in 7.5-fold induction of IFNA1VRE reporter, whereas the induction of IFNA2 VRE reporter was slightly lower (5-fold) (Fig. 2). In contrast, IRF-3 (5D) activated very effectively the expression of IFNA1 VRE (25-fold enhancement), but it did not significantly activate the IFNA2 VRE. Similarly, the relative levels of expression of the IFNA1 and IFNA2 mutants in response to IRF-3 (5D) and IRF-7 (2D) were comparable with that seen in infected cells transfected with wt IRF-3 and IRF-7 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, in the transient expression assay, the activation of IFNA promoter by virus and by the constitutively active mutants shows the same specificity. To determine the effect of IRF-3 (5D) and IRF-7 (2D) on the expression profile of the endogenous IFNA genes, we used 2fTGH cells. We have shown previously tha"

Generation of transgenic mice harboring various segments of the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen promoter led us to suspect that a repressor element was located between −10.5 and −17 kilobase pairs. Stable and transient transfection experiments in ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells confirmed the existence of such a repressor element at about −14 kilobase pairs and showed that it consisted in an almost perfect three-time repeat of a 41-base pair sequence. This element, which we named COIN-1, contains three E2-boxes, and a point mutation in at least two of them completely abolished its repressor effect. In gel shift assays, COIN-1 bound a DNA-binding protein named δEF1/ZEB-1, and mutations that abolished the repressor effect of COIN-1 also suppressed the binding of δEF1. We also showed that the repressor effect of COIN-1 was not mediated by chromatin compaction. Furthermore, overexpression of δEF1 in ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells enhanced the inhibitory effect of COIN-1 in a dose-dependent manner and repressed the expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene. Thus, δEF1 appears to repress the expression of the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen gene, through its binding to COIN-1.

It is the most abundant protein of mammalian bodies, and a major component of most extracellular matrices. In the extracellular space, type I collagen molecules self-assemble into highly organized fibrils and then fibers, which largely contribute to the high tensile strength of the structural framework supporting body structures (reviewed in Ref. 1Van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5 (23): 2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, an abnormal accumulation of type I collagen, along with other components of the extracellular matrix, can greatly and irreversibly impair functions of various organs including lung, kidney, liver, or skin. Thus, the production of type I collagen needs to be tightly regulated, and this regulation appears to occur mostly at a transcriptional level (reviewed in Ref. 2Rossert J. de Crombrugghe B. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2001Google Scholar). It involves a control of the levels of expression of type I collagen genes as well as a control of their coordinate expression and their cell-specific expression. Different positive regulatory sequences have been identified in the pro-α1(I) collagen gene (reviewed in Ref. 2Rossert J. de Crombrugghe B. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2001Google Scholar). The 220-bp pro-α1(I) proximal promoter is extremely active in transfection experiments andin vitro transcription assays, and it has been described as one of the most potent eukaryotic promoters (3Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It contains enhancers such as a CCAAT-box, Sp1-binding sites, and other GC-rich sequences (4Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first intron of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene also contains positive regulatory elements such as an AP-1 binding site (6Liska D.J. Slack J.L. Bornstein P. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or an Sp1-binding site that is involved in maintaining bone density (7Grant S.F. Reid D.M. Blake G. Herd R. Fogelman I. Ralston S.H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The role of this site in maintaining normal levels of expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene throughout life has been shown by knock-in experiments (8Hormuzdi S.G. Penttinen R. Jaenisch R. Bornstein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cis-acting element located in the 3′-flanking region of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene has been shown to drive high levels of reporter gene expression in transiently transfected fibroblastic cells (9Rippe R.A. Umezawa A. Kimball J.P. Breindl M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1753-1760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Contrasting with the existence of these enhancers, type I collagen turnover appears to be a slow process, which suggests that inhibitory factors are essential to control the overall level of expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene. Nevertheless, few repressor elements have been described in this gene. An inhibitory element located between −361 and −339 bp1 has been identified in the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen promoter, in transient transfection experiments (10Ravazzolo R. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7382-7387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A GC-rich repressor element has also been described in the first intron of the human gene (11Bornstein P. McKay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 1603-1606Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It had a repressor effect in transient transfection experiments, but sequences adjacent to this element completely abolished its repressor effect (11Bornstein P. McKay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 1603-1606Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of most of the first intron did not increase the levels of expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene in vivo (8Hormuzdi S.G. Penttinen R. Jaenisch R. Bornstein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A member of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors named cKrox is the only transcription factor that has been reported as being able to down-regulate the level of expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene (12Widom R.L. Culic I. Lee J.Y. Korn J.H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 407-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, its role in modulating the transcription of this gene remains controversial (12Widom R.L. Culic I. Lee J.Y. Korn J.H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 407-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Galera P. Musso M. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9372-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In transient transfection experiments, overexpression of the mouse cKrox gene enhanced the transcription of a reporter gene cloned downstream of a promoter containing three copies of a cKrox binding site (13Galera P. Musso M. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9372-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), while overexpression of a truncated form of the human cKrox gene had an inhibitory effect on the expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene (12Widom R.L. Culic I. Lee J.Y. Korn J.H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 407-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides cis-acting elements able to modulate the level of transcription of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene, regulatory elements responsible for its cell-specific expression have been identified. Only a discrete subset of cells of mesenchymal origin synthesize type I collagen. These cells are mostly fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and odontoblasts. Studies performed using transgenic mice harboring various fragments of the mouse, rat, or human pro-α1(I) collagen gene have shown that there is a modular arrangement of separate cell-specificcis-acing elements responsible for the expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene in different type I collagen-producing cells (14Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Bogdanovic Z. Bedalov A. Krebsbach P.H. Pavlin D. Woody C.O. Clark S.H. Thomas H.F.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). So far, three cell-specific elements have been identified within the mouse gene: an element located within 900 bp of the proximal promoter induced reporter gene expression in some skin fibroblasts; a second element located between −1656 and −1570 bp conferred high levels of reporter gene expression in osteoblasts and odontoblasts; and a third element located between −2300 and −3200 bp conferred reporter gene expression in tendon and fascia fibroblasts (14Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Rossert J.A. Chen S.S. Eberspaecher H. Smith C.N. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cis-acting element(s) responsible for the expression of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene in fibroblasts other than those present in fascia, tendons and skin remain(s) to be identified. In order to identify new cis-regulatory elements within the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen gene, we have generated transgenic mice harboring segments of the corresponding promoter extending up to −17 kb and containing or not containing the first five introns of the gene. Analysis of these mice led to the identification of a repressor element that we named COIN-1 (for collagen-inhibitory element-1). COIN-1 is a three-time repeat of a 41-bp motif containing an E2-box and is located 14 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. It binds a widely expressed transcription factor called δEF1/ZEB-1, which appears to be responsible for the repressor effect of COIN-1, and is able to down-regulate the level of expression of the endogenous gene independently on chromatin compaction. We used two previously published plasmids containing segments of the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen promoter cloned upstream of the lacZ reporter gene in the placH expression vector (14Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). pJ251 contains a segment of the pro-α1(I) promoter extending from −2310 to +110 bp. pJ320 contains a sequence of this promoter extending from −3150 to +110 bp. Plasmids containing segments of the mouse pro-α1(I) promoter extending upstream of −3150 bp were constructed using placH and pDT816 (18Toman D. de Crombrugghe B. Matrix: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, Great Britain1995: 353-391Google Scholar). pDT816 is a cosmid clone that contains all of the mouse pro-α1(I) exons and introns and 17 kb of the 5′-flanking region. pC15.56 was generated by cloning anSpeI/XbaI fragment extending from −15 kb to +110 bp in placH. pC3.112 was obtained by cloning anXbaI/EcoRV fragment extending from +192 to +3196 bp in pJ251, immediately upstream of the lacZ gene, and in frame with it. pC3.112 is thus coding for a fusion protein that contains the segment of the pro-α1(I) collagen chain encoded by the first six exons of the pro-α1(I) collagen gene (minus the signal peptide), and lacZ. PC6.267 and pC6.273 were generated by cloning an EcoRI/BamHI segment extending from −17 to −10.5 kb in pJ320 and in pC3.112, respectively. pC320.4 was obtained by cloning an EcoRI/SpeI fragment extending from −17 to −12.5 kb of the pro-α1(I) promoter in pJ320. pC320.1 was obtained by cloning an EcoRI/PstI fragment extending from −17 to −16 kb in pJ320. pC320.2XN was obtained by cloning a PstI/PstI fragment extending from −16 to −14 kb in pJ320, in the 5′–3′ orientation. pC320.312, pC320.400, and pC320.1.3 were obtained by cloning subfragments of this 2-kb segment: a SpeI/StuI fragment, a StyI/SpeI fragment, and aStyI/StyI fragment in pJ320, respectively. pC320.1.5 was obtained by cloning a PstI/SpeI fragment extending from −14 to −12.5 kb in pJ320. pC15.56.2XN was obtained by cloning the PstI/PstI fragment extending from −16 to −14 kb in pC15.56 in the 5′–3′ orientation. pC123, pC123.2.1m, pC123.2m, pC123.3m, and pC123.3d were obtained by cloning double-stranded oligonucleotides in pJ320. pDR583 contains a segment of the Hoxb-7 promoter, extending from −583 to +81 bp. It is cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene, of an SV40 splice site and polyadenylation signal, and downstream of a polyadenylation cassette which prevents read-through transcription. In pDR6, the 6.5-kb pro-α1(I) promoter fragment extending from −17 to −10.5 kb was inserted upstream of theHoxb-7 promoter in pDR583. pGL3 control vector, pSVβ-gal control vector, and pSVneo contain the luciferase reporter gene, the β-galactosidase reporter gene, and the neomycin resistance gene, respectively, cloned downstream of the SV40 promoter and enhancer (Promega). pCMVX-δEF1 contains the cDNA encoding δEF1, cloned in the pCMVX expression vector (19Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenes and transgenic embryos were generated using standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For each embryos, staining was scored semiquantitatively, using a 0–2 scale, by an investigator not aware of the construct harbored by the embryo. It was scored 0 for no expression, 1 for low levels of expression, and 2 for high levels of expression. To screen for transgenic mice, genomic DNA was extracted from the embryo's yolk sacs with the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions, and a sequence of the lacZ gene was amplified by PCR, as previously described (22Wassarman P.M.

For transient transfection experiments, cells were plated at 400,000 cells/well in six-well plates (Nunc, Kamstrup, Denmark) and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. In each well, 0.25 pmol of lacZ-containing plasmids were co-transfected with 0.10 pmol of pGL3 control vector. In some experiments, pCMVX and pCMVX-δEF1 were also co-transfected in increasing concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 pmol). Reporter gene expression was measured 72 h after the start of transfection. All transfection experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. For stable transfection experiments, linearizedlacZ-containing plasmids were mixed with linearized pSVneo in a 10:1 molar ratio. They were transfected as described above in 10-cm diameter Petri dishes (Nunc). Seventy-two hours after the start of transfection, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). Under these conditions, untransfected cells died within 10 days. Experiments were done in triplicate. In each triplicate, the transfected clones were pooled to eliminate an integration site effect. Cell extracts were prepared as previously described (24Calmont A. Reichwald K. Ronco P. Rossert J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1682-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with the luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions in a luminometer (EG&G, Bad Wilbad, Germany). Luciferase activity was also assayed by using a luminometer as previously described (24Calmont A. Reichwald K. Ronco P. Rossert J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1682-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 500,000 cells/10-cm Petri dish (Nunc) and grown to confluence. Nuclei were isolated as previously described (25Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Approximately 107 nuclei were resuspended in 90 μl of a buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.5 mm spermine, 0.34 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Then 10 μl of assay buffer containing 0–60 IU/reaction of DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the nuclei. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 800 μg of proteinase K. Proteins were then digested overnight at 55 °C. The DNA was purified and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes with standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). It was then electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel and blotted on a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad). This membrane was then processed following the manufacturer's recommendations and hybridized with a 825-bp lacZ probe. Nuclear extracts from ROS 17/2.8 cells were prepared as previously described (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The probes were end-labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of the E. coli DNA polymerase I. Then 0.3 ng of each probe was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts at room temperature for 30 min, in 20 μl of δEF1 binding buffer (27Sekido R. Murai K. Funahashi J. Kamachi Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima Y. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Competition experiments were performed using a 30–100-fold molar excess of nonlabeled competitor. Supershift experiments were performed by adding an anti-δEF1 antibody in the binding reaction. The complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 22 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mm EDTA. Northern analysis of pro-α1(I) collagen transcription was conducted with total RNA from ROS17/2.8 cells transfected with 0.1 pmol of pCMVX or 0.1 pmol of pCMVX-δEF1. Total RNAs were prepared with RNAwiz (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. They were fractionated and blotted onto nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed using a random prime-labeled cDNA probe for the pro-α1(I) RNA (28Niederreither K. D'Souza R. Metsaranta M. Eberspaecher H. Toman P.D. Vuorio E. De Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An 18 S RNA probe was also used as a probe to control for differences in the total amount of RNA loaded. The signals were quantitated using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the ImageQuant software. To compare different groups of transgenic embryos, we performed statistical analysis according to analysis of variance followed by the Fisher's protected least significant difference test (Statview). In order to identify new cis-acting regulatory elements within the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen gene, we generated transgenic mice harboring segments of the promoter located upstream of −4 kb and/or the first five introns.lacZ was used as a reporter gene, since X-gal staining allows us to easily detect tissues and cells expressing the transgene during embryonic development. Foster mothers were sacrificed at 15.5 days postconception, because at this time, the endogenous gene is expressed in most type I collagen-containing tissues as well as in ossification centers (28Niederreither K. D'Souza R. Metsaranta M. Eberspaecher H. Toman P.D. Vuorio E. De Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We first generated transgenic mice using pC3.112. This construct contains 2.3 kb of the pro-α1(I) proximal promoter, a sequence extending from the 3′-end of exon 1 (and thus lacking the sequence coding for the signal peptide) to the 5′-end of exon 6 andlacZ cloned in frame with the sixth exon (Fig.1A). Out of 12 transgenic embryos, seven expressed lacZ in ossification centers at high levels, one at low levels and four showed no staining after overnight incubation with X-gal (Fig. 1B). We then used pC15.56 to generate transgenic mice (Fig. 1A). Three out of seven transgenic embryos expressed lacZ in ossification and tendons at high levels, one expressed it at low levels, and three did not show any X-gal staining (Fig.1B). To test the role of sequences located upstream of −13 kb, we generated transgenic embryos using pC6.267 (Fig. 1A). Only four out of 11 transgenic embryos harboring pC6.267 expressed the reporter gene. It was expressed in ossification centers and tendons in all cases but at high levels only in two cases (Fig. 1B). We then generated transgenic embryos harboring pC6.273. (Fig. 1A). Only two out of six transgenic embryos harboring pC6.273 expressed thelacZ reporter gene, and in both cases it was expressed in ossification centers at low levels (Fig. 1B). In these two cases, X-gal staining was restricted to ossification centers. Taken together, these data showed that the percentage of founder embryos expressing the reporter gene at high levels was significantly lower with the two constructs containing the 6.5-kb pro-α1(I) promoter sequence, extending from −17 to −10.5 kb, than with the corresponding constructs lacking this upstream sequence (2 out of 17versus 10 out of 19, respectively, p < 0.05). Hence, these data suggested that the 6.5-kb fragment of the pro-α1(I) promoter, extending from −17 to −10.5 kb contains a repressor element. To confirm this, we stably transfected pC3.112 and pC6.273 in ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells. β-Galactosidase activity was 68% lower in ROS17/2.8 cells stably transfected with pC6.273 than in those stably transfected with pC3.112 (Fig. 1C). Besides, β-galactosidase activity was similar when ROS17/2.8 cells were stably transfected with pC6.273 and pC6.267, suggesting that the first five introns do not contribute to the inhibitory effect (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed histological analysis of transgenic embryos sections to precisely map the pattern of expression of the transgenes out of ossification centers and tendons (data not shown). In particular, transgenic embryos, at 15.5 days postconception never disclosed X-gal staining in organ capsules, the lung, the trachea, the pericardial membranes, the aortic trunk, the cardiac valves, the digestive tract, the metanephros, the muscles, and the soft connective tissues. These data suggested that neither the pro-α1(I) promoter sequence located between −17 kb and −3.2 kb nor the first five introns contain new tissue-specific cis-acting elements active during embryonic development. Since chromatin structure appears to play an important role in regulating gene expression, and in particular the pro-α2(I) collagen gene expression (25Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and since the DNase I-hypersensitive sites present within the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen gene have been precisely mapped (29Salimi-Tari P. Cheung M. Safar C.A. Tracy J.T. Tran I. Harbers K. Breindl M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 61-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we studied whether DNase I-hypersensitive sites present within the endogenous gene were also present within constructs containing the repressor element and stably integrated in the genome of ROS17/2.8 cells. The pro-α1(I) collagen gene contains two DNase I-hypersensitive sites between −17 kb and −11 kb, another one immediately upstream of the transcription start site, one within the first intron, and one within the fifth intron (Fig.2A). First, nuclei isolated from cells stably transfected with pC6.267 were incubated with increasing amounts of DNase I, and the subsequently extracted DNA was digested with NarI (Fig. 2B). The DNA fragments were then separated on an agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane, which was hybridized with a probe corresponding to lacZ. The probe hybridized with four fragments of different size (Fig. 2, B and D). The high molecular weight one was generated by NarI digestion of the DNA extracted from nuclei untreated with DNase I. The 8- and 7-kb ones were generated by NarI digestion and DNase I digestion at two hypersensitive sites located in the pro-α1(1) promoter sequence extending from −17 to −10.5 kb. The 4-kb band was generated byNarI digestion and DNase I digestion at a hypersensitive site lying in the proximal promoter (Fig. 2, B andD). Nuclei isolated from ROS17/2.8 cells stably transfected with pC6.273 were also used to identify DNase I-hypersensitive sites within the transgene. They were incubated with increasing amounts of DNase I, and the extracted DNA was digested with HindIII (Fig.2C). The lacZ probe hybridized with a 10.5-kbHindIII restriction fragment when DNA was extracted from DNase I-untreated nuclei. In nuclei treated with increasing amounts of DNase I, the lacZ probe hybridized with additional DNA fragments migrating at about 7, 6.5, and 4 kb (Fig. 2, C andE). These fragments correspond to HindIII digestion and DNase I digestion at hypersensitive sites located in the proximal promoter, the first intron, and the fifth intron, respectively. The DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the two transgenes were identical to those present in the endogenous gene, in type I collagen-producing cells, suggesting that the repressor effect was not mediated by modifications of the chromatin structure. To confirm that the inhibitory effect of the fragment located between −17 and −10.5 kb was not mediated by modifications of chromatin conformation, we performed transient transfection experiments with constructs containing (pC6.267, pC6.273) or not containing (pJ320, pC3.112) the repressor element. Relative β-galactosidase activities in ROS17/2.8 cells transfected with pC6.267 and pC6.273 were 2 times lower than β-galactosidase activities in cells transfected with pJ320 and pC3.112, respectively (Fig.3A). To test the ability of the repressor element to inhibit the activity of an heterologous promoter, the pro-α1(I) promoter fragment extending from −17 to −10.5 kb was cloned upstream of a 664-bp segment of theHoxb-7 proximal promoter and of the luciferase reporter gene (pDR6) and transiently transfected in RC.SVtsA58 tubular epithelial cells. Luciferase activity was more than 2 times lower in cells transfected with pDR6 than in cells transfected with pDR583, a construct lacking the 6.5-kb fragment (Fig. 3B). To delineate more precisely the boundaries of the inhibitory element, transient transfection experiments were performed using subsegments of this element, cloned upstream of 3.2 kb of the pro-α1(I) proximal promoter and oflacZ.

To investigate the mechanism by which IKKγ/NEMO regulates the IKK complex, we examined the ability of IKKγ/NEMO to recruit the IκB proteins into this complex. IKKγ/NEMO binding to wild-type, but not to a kinase-deficient IKKβ protein, facilitated the association of IκBα and IκBβ with the high molecular weight IKK complex. Following tumor necrosis factor-α treatment of HeLa cells, the majority of the phosphorylated form of endogenous IκBα was associated with the high molecular weight IKK complex in HeLa cells and parental mouse embryo fibroblasts but not in IKKγ/NEMO-deficient cells. Finally, we demonstrate that IKKγ/NEMO facilitates the association of the IκB proteins and IKKβ and leads to increases in IKKβ kinase activity. These results suggest that an important function of IKKγ/NEMO is to facilitate the association of both IKKβ and IκB in the high molecular weight IKK complex to increase IκB phosphorylation.

For example, a kinase known as RIP, which is recruited to the TNF receptor following TNFα treatment of cells, binds to IKKγ/NEMO and leads to the subsequent association of IKKα and IKKβ (37Li Y.

Fibroblasts isolated from these mice are defective in activating the NF-κB pathway in response to a variety of stimulators of this pathway. In humans, mutation of a single copy of the IKKγ/NEMO gene is associated with a syndrome known as incontinentia pigmenti, an X-linked defect that results in lethality in males and a granulocytic infiltration of the skin in females (52Smahi A.

These mutations, which impair but do not eliminate NF-κB function, result in an X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by hyper-IgM production and hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia. Thus, both biochemical and genetic studies indicate a critical role for IKKγ/NEMO in regulating NF-κB activation. Although IKKγ/NEMO is critical for activation of the NF-κB pathway, the exact mechanisms involved in its regulation remain to be elucidated. Previously, we demonstrated that interactions between IKKγ/NEMO and IKKβ are critical for the formation of the high molecular weight IKK complex (41Li X.-H. Fang X. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4494-4500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed the role of IKKγ/NEMO in facilitating interactions between IκB and IKKβ. IKKγ/NEMO was critical for the association of IκB and IKKβ with the high molecular weight IKK complex. Furthermore, we found that IκB in the high molecular weight complex was preferentially phosphorylated. Finally, we demonstrated that IKKγ/NEMO enhanced the association of the IκBα and IKKβ and increased IKKβ kinase activity. Thus, the ability of IKKγ/NEMO to both stimulate the association of the IκB proteins with IKKβ and increase IKKβ kinase activity is likely important in activating the NF-κB pathway. The wild-type murine IKKγ/NEMO cDNA was cloned into the CMV expression vector pCMV5 fusing the Myc tag to the amino terminus of IKKγ/NEMO sequence (41Li X.-H. Fang X. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4494-4500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An N-terminal IKKγ/NEMO deletion containing amino acid residues 101–412 and a C-terminal IKKγ/NEMO deletion containing amino acids 1–312 were also cloned downstream of the Myc epitope in pCMV5 (41Li X.-H.

HeLa cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and supplemented with the same components as above. Transfections were carried out using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. For a typical cell fractionation experiment, COS cells cultured overnight in 100-mm plates were transfected with 2.0 μg of each DNA construct. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from either 107 transfected COS cells or nontransfected cells including 108 HeLa, 2.5 × 108 MEFs, and 2.5 × 108 IKKγ knock-out as detailed previously (41Li X.-H.

TNFα (20 ng/ml) and MG-132 (25 μm) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Calbiochem, respectively. For protein fractionation, the cytoplasmic extracts of cells were prepared according to Dignam (58Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, were harvested by scraping from the culture dishes and precipitated by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (10 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 50 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 μm okadaic acid) and proteinase inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the cells were disrupted with 20 strokes through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were mixed with 0.11 volume of buffer B (0.3m Hepes (pH 7.9), 30 mm MgCl2, 1.4m KCl) and centrifuged again at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatants were assayed for protein concentration according to the Bradford method, and a total of 2 mg of protein was subjected to Superdex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography in buffer D (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, and 0.2 mm EGTA), and 1-ml fractions were collected. Protein markers (Sigma) used for the Superdex-200 column were bovine thyroglobulin (669 kDa), horse spleen apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). Western blotting was done with 30 μg of protein obtained from each of the column fractions including monoclonal antibodies directed against the HA epitope (12CA5), the FLAG epitope (M2; Sigma), and the Myc epitope (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and polyclonal antibodies directed against IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; Sc-371), phospho-IκBα (Ser32) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), IKKβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Sc-7607), and IKKγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Sc-8330). The antibodies used are specified in the figure legends. Cytoplasmic lysates of COS cells containing 300 μg of protein were incubated with either 2.5 μg of the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody directed against the HA epitope, the M2 monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope, or the Myc monoclonal antibody. Following this, 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added and mixed for 1 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with modified buffer D (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiotheitol, 0.06% Nonidet P-40) containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Electrophoresis on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was performed, and the gel was subjected to immunoblotting with specific antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For kinase assays, 50 μl of each column fraction was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1–2 μg of anti-IKKα (Sc-7606) obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology in 150 μl of PD buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 300 μmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) for 1–3 h at 4 °C and analyzed byin vitro kinase assays in the presence of 5 μg of bacterially expressed GST fusion protein consisting of IκBα (aa 1–54) or with serine residues 32 and 36 changed to alanine. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reactions were mixed with protein sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and β-mecaptoethanol), heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and loaded on a 12% SDS gel. The phosphoprotein products were visualized by autoradiography. To better understand the mechanism by which IKKγ/NEMO stimulates IKKβ kinase activity, we transfected expression vectors encoding wild-type epitope-tagged IKKβ and a variety of epitope-tagged IKKγ/NEMO constructs into COS cells (Fig.1A). Following immunoprecipitation of IKKβ, we assayed its ability to phosphorylate GST fusion"

Cleavage of DCLK by calpain severs the kinase domain from its microtubule anchorage domain and releases it into the cytoplasm. The isolated kinase domain retains catalytic activity and is structurally similar to CPG16, a second product of the DCLK gene expressed in the adult brain that lacks the doublecortin domain.

The C-terminal kinase domain is also encoded by a distinct transcript, first cloned in a screen for activity-regulated transcripts in adult brain known as CPG16 (13Silverman M.A. Benard O. Jaaro H. Rattner A. Citri Y. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2631-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, a microtubule-associated form of the kinase, DCLK, is mostly strongly expressed during embryogenesis while a cytoplasmic form of the kinase, CPG16, is expressed in the adult brain. An important question is how the microtubule binding and kinase activities of DCLK are regulated. The catalytic core of DCLK shows strong amino acid similarity to members of the calcium-calmodulin family of protein serine-threonine kinases, though the calmodulin binding domain is not conserved in DCLK (14Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and biochemical studies have indicated that calmodulin does not regulate the function of the DCLK kinase domain (13Silverman M.A. Benard O. Jaaro H. Rattner A. Citri Y. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2631-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated forms of both doublecortin and DCLK are associated with microtubules and may therefore contribute to regulation of their microtubule binding (15Francis F. Koulakoff A. Boucher D. Chafey P. Schaar B. Vinet M.C. Friocourt G. McDonnell N. Reiner O. Kahn A. McConnell S.K. Berwald-Netter Y. Denoulet P. Chelly J.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar); however, DCLK autophosphorylation is not required for microtubule binding (11Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,17Lin P.T. Gleeson J.G. Corbo J.C. Flanagan L. Walsh C.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9152-9161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have reported previously that overexpression of CPG16 or DCLK in cultured cells results in the appearance of truncated forms of the protein (13Silverman M.A. Benard O. Jaaro H. Rattner A. Citri Y. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2631-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci.

In fact, many serine-threonine kinases have been shown to be susceptible to proteolytic processing by the ubiquitous calcium-activated cysteine protease calpain (18Barnes J.A. Gomes A.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 17-27Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, cytoskeletal proteins are also a prominent target for calpain (19Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), perhaps reflecting the partial association of μ-calpain to microtubules (20Perlmutter L.S. Siman R. Gall C. Seubert P. Baudry M. Lynch G. Synapse. 1988; 2: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that DCLK is a substrate for calpain, with proteolysis yielding an active kinase domain no longer anchored to the microtubule cytoskeleton binding domain. In neurons this appears to result in easily detectable differences in DCLK N- and C-terminal immunoreactivity within the soma, with the C-terminal kinase domain entering the nucleus following proteolysis. Since calpain is activated by calcium, we propose that this may be a calcium-responsive means for regulating the localization of DCLK kinase activity during embryonic development. 293-T cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Transfections of plasmid DNA were carried out routinely using calcium phosphate precipitation (21Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar), using 5 μg of plasmid/6-cm plate or 15 μg of plasmid/9-cm plate. Construction of FLAG-DCLK expression vector has been described previously (14Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Calpeptin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was applied 2 days following transfection, at the indicated concentrations for 30 min before protein extraction. The calpastatin cDNA was kindly supplied by Dr. Piechaczyk (22Pariat M. Carillo S. Molinari M. Salvat C. Debussche L. Bracco L. Milner J. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2806-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and subcloned into a pCDNA by Chava Gil-Henn 2H. Gil-Henn, G. Volohonsky, and A. Elson (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 31772–31779 and cotransfected at the indicated amount with 2 μg of FLAG-DCLK/6-cm plate. Primary neurons were prepared from corticostriatal tissue dissected from timed embryonic day 14.5 mouse embryos. Neurons were suspended in PBS + 0.6% glucose (PBS-glu) and were gently titurated with a pipette, incubated with 0.003% DNase at 37 °C for 10 min, then spun down and resuspended in PBS-glu three times and 1.5 × 106neurons plated on polyornithine-coated 3-cm plates or glass coverslips for culture (as described in Ref. 23Chamak B. Prochiantz A. Development. 1989; 106: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extracts were made in modified RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μm pepstatin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentration was assessed by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Western blot was carried out using the Laemmli system, on 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gels. Before loading proteins were denatured by boiling for 3 min in sample buffer. Blocking and antibody dilution were in 2.5% skim milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween. Production of anti-DCLK C-terminal and anti-DCLK N-terminal antibodies was described previously (11Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All Western blots were carried out with the anti-DCLK C-terminal antibody. Other antibodies were anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel), anti-tubulin monoclonal clone DM1A antibody (Sigma), peroxidase-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were developed using Supersignal chemiluminescence (Pierce). For preparation of recombinant GST-DCLK, DCLK open reading frame was subcloned in frame into pGEX-2T using BamHI andEcoRI sites from FLAG-DCLK. Plasmid was transfected into BL21(DE3)RIL bacteria (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which were grown in M9ZB + 2% glucose at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6. Induction of protein expression was carried out using 0.2 mm IPTG at 18 °C for 16–24 h. Protein was extracted in NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with sonication. Soluble fraction was bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h and then washed extensively in NETN before elution from column in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmglutathione, 10% glycerol. For in vitro proteolysis, m-calpain (Sigma) was incubated with GST-DCLK at 30 °C in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 for times indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by adding sample buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue or subjected to Western blot as described in the figure legends. For in vitro kinase assay following calpain cleavage, kinase reaction buffer containing 20 mmmagnesium acetate, 20 μm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mmZnCl2, 2.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) was added after 1 h of in vitro proteolysis. As the kinase reaction contains zinc, a potent calpain inhibitor (24Vitto A. Nixon R.A. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), there was no need to separately inactivate calpain. Kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min before termination by addition of sample buffer with 10 mm EDTA. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and subjected to autoradiography. For assessment of the effect of calpain on DCLK activity, the kinase assay was allowed to proceed for multiple time points. Quantitation was accomplished by exposure of the dried gel to phosphoimager. To assess whether cleavage of DCLK dissociates the kinase domain from the microtubule domain, 5 μg of GST-DCLK was bound to 10 μl of glutathione-agarose beads and incubated in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 milliunits of m-calpain. After 60 min, the reaction buffer was removed, the beads washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and resuspended in sample buffer. Both fractions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-DCLK antibody. Two days after transfection with FLAG-DCLK, 293-T cells were gently washed once with PBS and then overlaid with microtubule-stabilizing extraction buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2supplemented with protease inhibitors as above) for 3 min at room temperature. The extraction buffer was removed and centrifuged at 500 × g to discard detached cells. Cells remaining on the plate were then extracted in RIPA buffer as above. Both fractions were subjected to Western blot with anti-FLAG and anti-DCLK antibodies. After 7 days in culture, neurons were treated with 10 μm calpeptin or Me2SO overnight before being fixed with cold methanol and stained with anti-DCLK N-terminal (1:2) or anti-DCLK C-terminal (1:10) affinity-purified antibodies and lissamine rhodamine-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Immunoblot of extract from primary cultured neurons with the anti-DCLK C-terminal antibody gives an 85-kDa band corresponding to the predicted size of the DCLK protein and identical to that found in embryonic brain tissue (14Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, a less intense but reproducible band of 50 kDa is observed in these blots (Fig. 1, lane 1). We noted previously that, when DCLK was overexpressed in a variety of cell types, a 50-kDa specific immunoreactive band is recognized by the anti-DCLK C-terminal antibody in addition to the expected 85-kDa protein. We expressed an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged DCLK construct in 293-T cells to enable us to track both fragments produced by cleavage of DCLK. Western blot of FLAG-DCLK transfected cells with either anti-FLAG or anti-DCLK antibodies both revealed an 85-kDa band corresponding to the size of the FLAG-DCLK fusion protein (Fig. 1,lanes 3–6). However, when cells were cultured at high confluence, each antibody recognized an extra band: for the anti-DCLK antibody, a 50-kDa band (Fig. 1, lane 3), and for the anti-FLAG antibody, a 35-kDa band (Fig. 1,lane 5). The appearance of a 50-kDa band in transfected 293-T cells that is of similar size to that found in cultured neurons suggests that the neuronal 50-kDa band is derived from DCLK and is not merely a cross-reactive protein. Furthermore, Mizuguchiet al. (25Mizuguchi M. Qin J. Yamada M. Ikeda K. Takashima S. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1713-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) noted a 35-kDa band cross reactive to their anti-DCLK N-terminal antibody in human fetal brain extracts. As the C-terminal 50-kDa band and the N-terminal 35-kDa band appear under the same conditions in 293-T cells and have a combined molecular mass the size of the full-length DCLK protein, we wondered whether these peptides may be derived by proteolytic cleavage of the FLAG-DCLK protein at the boundary of the doublecortin domain and the ST-rich domain (the cleavage A site in Fig.2).Figure 2Cleavage of DCLK is predicted to generate a fragment similar to CPG16. The size of immunoreactive bands observed following transfection of 293-T cells with FLAG-DCLK indicates the approximate position of the two sites where DCLK is cleaved. Cleavage A bands arise from proteolysis in the region preceding the ST-rich domain. Cleavage B bands are generated by cleavage in the region following the ST-rich domain. Major domains in DCLK (GenBank™ accession no. AF155819) are annotated. The locations of the epitopes recognized by antibodies used in this study are also indicated. PEST domains (see “Discussion”) are marked byblack squares. CPG16 (GenBank™ accession no.AF155820) is a second product of the DCLK gene, transcribed in adult brain, and is similar to the kinase domain of DCLK following cleavage at the ST-rich domain. The DCLK splice form used in this study has a 16-amino acid insertion disrupting the PEST domain in CPG16 and effectively creating two adjacent PEST domains. PEST domains were scored using the PESTfind program (www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind). C-term, C-terminal; N-term, N-terminal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cysteine protease calpain has been implicated in proteolytic processing of many cytoskeletal proteins and serine-threonine kinases (18Barnes J.A. Gomes A.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 17-27Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As DCLK falls into both classes, we tested whether the degradation products observed in FLAG-DCLK-transfected cells were attributable to calpain. Following transfection of 293-T cells with FLAG-DCLK, we applied the cell-permeable calpain inhibitor calpeptin. Calpeptin inhibited the generation of both of the 50-kDa C-terminal and 35-kDa N-terminal bands and acted in a dose-dependant fashion (Fig.3, A and B). In several transfection experiments, including this one, both antibodies recognized a third band. In these cases the C-terminal antibody revealed a 42-kDa band and the anti-FLAG antibody a 43-kDa band. Although the C-terminal antibody reveals an ∼40-kDa band in primary neuron extract (Fig. 1, lane 1), this band is distinctly smaller than that observed following transfection of 293-T cells. In addition, calpain cleavage of DCLK in embryonic brain lysate did not augment the 40-kDa band (Fig. 5). For these reasons we do not believe that the 40-kDa band in primary neuronal extract represents a calpain cleavage product of DCLK and may simply be a cross-reactive band. As the 42-kDa C-terminal and 43-kDa N-terminal bands appeared in the same transfection experiments and have a combined molecular mass the size of DCLK, we consider it likely that they are generated by proteolytic cleavage of DCLK at a second site (the cleavage B site in Fig. 2). Under these conditions the 42-kDa C-terminal and 43-kDa N-terminal bands are not lost, nor were they diminished by prolonged incubation with calpeptin, suggesting that they are very stable or are not products of proteolysis of DCLK by calpain. Calpeptin is not absolutely specific for calpain. We therefore sought to test the effect of the potent and specific physiological calpain inhibitor calpastatin (26Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Imajoh S. Imahori K. Suzuki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Calpastatin was co-expressed with FLAG-DCLK in 293-T cells and completely eliminated the appearance of both the cleavage A products and the cleavage B products (Fig.4). Only when minute amounts of calpastatin plasmid were used (30 ng compared with 2 μg of FLAG-DCLK plasmid) were traces of the cleavage products visible. The high specificity of calpastatin strongly supports the contention that calpain constitutively cleaves DCLK overexpressed in 293-T cells. The elimination of the cleavage B site bands in this experiment probably reflects the potent inhibition of calpain by calpastatin before any cleavage of DCLK could occur. One caveat is that chronic expression of calpastatin may indirectly effect DCLK cleavage by another protease. However, the similar effects of acute calpeptin application and calpastatin co expression argue that calpain cleaves DCLK overexpressed in 293-T cells. To determine whether the 50-kDa band seen in neuronal cell extract could be produced by calpain, we studied cleavage of DCLK from embryonic mouse brain in vitro. Anti-DCLK C-terminal antibodies recognize a faint 50-kDa band in embryonic mouse brain extract, which was stable with prolonged incubation at 37 °C (Fig.5, lanes 1–3). However, on addition of calcium, DCLK was entirely cleaved to the 50-kDa C-terminal fragment within 90 min of incubation (Fig. 5,lanes 4–6). Cleavage of DCLK could be entirely prevented by addition of calpeptin (Fig. 5, lanes 7–9). Together, the calcium dependence of this proteolytic event and its sensitivity to calpeptin indicate that DCLK is cleaved by calpain and supports the suggestion that the endogenous 50-kDa band in primary neuronal extract is also derived from proteolytic processing of DCLK by calpain. To directly demonstrate that calpain can cleave DCLK, we prepared recombinant GST fusion DCLK by glutathione affinity purification from bacteria. Coomassie Blue staining revealed that the full-length 110-kDa GST-DCLK fusion protein was copurified with several smaller bands mostly between 45 and 65 kDa (Fig.6A, lane 1). Western analysis with anti-DCLK N-terminal antibody demonstrated that these bands contain the DCLK epitope recognized by this antibody, suggesting that they are either degradation products or abortive translation products (data not shown). As Western blot with anti-DCLK C-terminal antibody recognized only the 110-kDa band (Fig.6B, lane 1) and no smaller fragments characteristic of degraded proteins, we favor the latter interpretation. Purified m-calpain cleaved GST-DCLK in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A,lanes 3–6), requiring the presence of calcium (Fig. 6A, lanes 7 and 8). No degradation of GST-DCLK was seen following incubation with calcium and heat-inactivated calpain (Fig. 6A, lane 9). The cleavage products of ∼28, 31, and 33 kDa (Fig.6A, lanes 5 and 6) all belong to the GST protein (results from N-terminal sequencing; data not shown). Western blot using the C-terminal antibody revealed that DCLK was initially cleaved to a 50-kDa C-terminal band, which was further degraded to a ladder of bands between ∼40 and 50 kDa, consistent with cleavage at various sites within and immediately after the ST-rich domain (Fig. 6B). This demonstrates that in vitrocalpain directly processes DCLK into cleavage fragments similar to those observed in cultured cells. Calpain cleavage sites appear to reflect structural determinants on target proteins rather than precise amino acid motifs (27Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The presence of a ladder of bands instead of discrete bands at 42 and 50 kDa, as seen in cell and tissue lysate, may reflect structural variations in recombinant GST-DCLK due to differential autophosphorylation of recombinant molecules or lack of normal DCLK association partners like microtubules. Alternatively, calpain may have degraded specificity due to in vitroconditions. Cleavage of DCLK at the ST-rich domain would be predicted not to impair kinase activity of the fragment containing the catalytic domain because such a fragment is structurally very similar to another product of the DCLK gene, CPG16 (Fig. 2). We first assessed the ability of in vitro cleaved DCLK to autophosphorylate. Proteolysis initially resulted in the appearance of an autophosphorylating 50-kDa band (Fig.7A, right panel, lanes 3 and 4) similar to the 50-kDa C-terminal fragment detected in Fig.6B; more extensive proteolysis resulted in loss of autophosphorylation (Fig. 7A, lane 5). Loss of autophosphorylation by the 40–50-kDa C-terminal fragments detected in Fig. 6B could indicate abolition of kinase activity or loss of autophosphorylation sites. We therefore assayed kinase activity following DCLK cleavage using myelin basic protein as a substrate. No loss of kinase activity toward myelin basic protein was observed even after incubation of DCLK with large amounts of calpain (Fig. 7A, lane 5). Based on the sizes of the DCLK cleavage fragments, the calpain cleavage site is predicted to be in the ST-rich domain between the doublecortin domain and the kinase domain (Fig. 2). As the doublecortin domain is responsible for anchorage of the protein to the microtubule cytoskeleton, cleavage in this area could release the kinase domain from its microtubule localization. We therefore sought to confirm that the C-terminal cleavage fragment is released following cleavage by calpain. To determine whether the C-terminal fragment remains associated with the N-terminal domain after cleavage, we digested recombinant GST-DCLK bound to glutathione beads. Under these conditions, all of the C-terminal cleavage fragments were released from the beads (Fig. 8A). To determine whether the kinase domain is released from a microtubule localization following cleavage, we fractionated FLAG-DCLK-transfected 293-T cells into microtubule and cytosolic fractions. Under these extraction conditions in 293-T cells, the 50-kDa C-terminal fragment was not stable; however, the 42-kDa C-terminal fragment partitioned into the cytosolic fraction, whereas the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment containing the doublecortin microtubule binding domain partitioned into the microtubule-enriched fraction (Fig. 8B). In primary corticostriatal neurons, DCLK C-terminal immunoreactivity is most marked on microtubules in growth cones, with weaker staining in the cell body (11Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the anti-DCLK N-terminal antibody gives a similar staining of growth cones, but in the cell body, staining is concentrated in the perinuclear region rather than in the nucleus (Fig. 9, compare A and C). We wondered whether this difference may reflect differential localization of N-terminal and C-terminal fragments following proteolysis by calpain. Following overnight application of calpeptin, neurons were fixed and stained with both antibodies. Whereas the localization of the N-terminal fragment of DCLK was unaffected (Fig. 9, C and D), the C-terminal antibody immunostaining was strikingly altered, with staining now concentrated in a perinuclear localization similar to that of the N-terminal fragment. The extensive modifications to neuritic architecture that occur during development imply the existence of mechanisms to selectively remodel the neuronal cytoskeleton. Proteolytic processing of the microtubule-associated protein DCLK may represent one such mechanism. In this report we present evidence that DCLK is a substrate for calpain. We demonstrate that a 50-kDa band in embryonic mouse brain extract and primary cultured neurons recognized by the anti-DCLK antibody is also generated in 293-T cells after transfection with full-length DCLK. In 293-T cells the 50-kDa band is eliminated by application of calpain inhibitors. In mouse brain extract, DCLK is completely cleaved to a 50-kDa product when calcium is added but not in the presence of the calpain inhibitor calpeptin. Calpain directly cleaves recombinant DCLK in vitro producing C-terminal fragments of 40–50 kDa. Such an event may be physiologically significant, as we demonstrate that cleavage results in release of the fragment containing the kinase activity from microtubule anchorage into the cytosol. In primary neurons, DCLK C-terminal immunoreactivity in the cell soma is normally concentrated in the nucleus, with N-terminal staining highlighting the perinuclear region. However, inhibition of calpain causes C-terminal staining to closely resemble the N-terminal pattern of staining, suggesting that the C-terminal fragment enters the nucleus following cleavage. Multiple roles for calpain in normal and pathological conditions have been posited including in promoting progression through the cell cycle and apoptosis (see Ref. 27Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar for a review). Loss of function mutations in a muscle-specific form of calpain, p94, cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (28Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Devaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. Cell. 1995; 81: 27-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), whereas increased calpain activity has been linked with other muscular dystrophies, cataract formation, and Alzheimer's disease. Calpain promotes cell motility, by facilitating the elimination of focal adhesion complexes (29Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the adult central nervous system, calpain has been implicated in adult synaptic plasticity (see Ref. 30Chan S.L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar for review) whereas, during development, calpain involvement has been suggested in regulation of neurite retraction (31Song D.K. Malmstrom T. Kater S.B. Mykles D.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), perhaps in the context of regulating connectivity during early postnatal development (32Bi X. Chen J. Baudry M. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cleavage of DCLK in transfected 293-T cells was prominent when cells were allowed to grow at high density. Although we did not study this phenomenon in detail, we believe it may relate to greater cell death at high density for two reasons. First, the physiological calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, has been shown to be a substrate for caspases (33Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A. Talanian R.V. Keegan M. Herzog L. Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 34Kato M. Nonaka T. Maki M. Kikuchi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); degradation of calpastatin during apoptosis could disinhibit calpain resulting in greater cleavage of DCLK. Second, we were able to stimulate production of the 50-kDa band in transfected 293-T cells by induction of apoptosis. The 50-kDa cleavage product observed in 293-T cells was rapidly degraded, disappearing once DCLK cleavage was inhibited. It has been suggested that proteolysis of muscle sarcomere proteins by calpain may promote ubiquitin-dependent degradation according to the N-end rule (35Hasselgren P.O. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DCLK contains three PEST domains (Fig. 2) (amino acid motifs enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine), which have been proposed to target proteins for rapid degradation. The 50-kDa cleavage product would retain all three PEST domains. Although the original PEST hypothesis implicated calpain in the degradative pathway (36Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar) and many PEST-containing proteins are indeed calpain substrates, the calpain-PEST hypothesis is disputed (37Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A. Jariel-Encontre I. Poulat F. Berta P. Piechaczyk M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Splice variants of DCLK affect all three PEST domains, potentially modulating the susceptibility of DCLK to proteolysis by calpain. The anti-DCLK C-terminal antibody used in this study recognizes one of two C-terminal splice forms of DCLK (herein referred to as DCLK-α). When we studied the fate of endogenous DCLK in embryonic brain lysate following calcium addition, all of the DCLK-α was digested by calpain (Fig. 5); however, the N-terminal antibody, which is insensitive to C-terminal splice variants, revealed that some DCLK remained intact (data not shown). Intriguingly, the other DCLK C-terminal splice form lacks a C-terminal PEST motif. We are currently investigating the susceptibility of different splice forms of DCLK to cleavage by calpain. DCLK expression is widespread during the period of embryonic brain development and down-regulated thereafter (14Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Lin P.T. Gleeson J.G. Corbo J.C. Flanagan L. Walsh C.A. J.

Pathol. 1999; 155: 1713-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During this time, DCLK immunoreactivity is seen in neuronal cell bodies and neurites, but is strikingly enhanced in growth cones (11Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The finding that DCLK is a substrate for calpain is pertinent in the light of studies demonstrating roles for calcium and calpain in regulating growth cone behavior. During neural development, molecular signals at axon guidance checkpoints cause calcium transients in growth cones, which induce growth cone stalling, and promote the elaboration of filopodia, which sample the local environment (38Goldberg D.J. Grabham P.W. Neuron. 1999; 22: 423-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Calcium fluxes in the growth cone are transduced by the calcium-calmodulin phosphatase calcineurin (39Gomez T.M. Spitzer N.C. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (40Zheng J.Q. Felder M. Connor J.A. Poo M.M.

Res. 1994; 39: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Calpain activation in response to calcium influx has been shown to block neurite outgrowth in SH-SY-5Y cells (41Shea T.B. Cressman C.M. Spencer M.J. Beermann M.L. Nixon R.A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and neuroblastoma cells (42Shea T.B. Beermann M.L. Nixon R.A. J.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal cell types, calpain has been shown to be required for formation of filopodia and lammelipodia (45Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and in cultured aplysia neurons, local calcium spikes trigger calpain activation and elaboration of morphologically complex growth cones (46Gitler D. Spira M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1123-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Activation of calpain in the growth cone by calcium influx may result in cleavage of DCLK, releasing the kinase activity from the cytoskeleton. At present we cannot distinguish between the possibilities that the DCLK doublecortin domain sequesters DCLK kinase activity from cytoplasmic or nuclear targets, and an alternative model in which cleavage serves to disengage the kinase activity from microtubule-associated targets. Models involving calpain-mediated release of an active fragment from an anchorage domain have been proposed for several proteins including the membrane-associated phosphatases STEP (47Nguyen T.H. Paul S. Xu Y. Gurd J.W. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1995-2001PubMed Google Scholar) and PTP-1B (48Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the protein-tyrosine kinase Src (49Oda A. Druker B.J. Ariyoshi H. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of primary neurons with anti-DCLK C-terminal antibody reveals partial nuclear localization (11Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, staining of primary neurons with an N-terminal antibody reproduces the growth cone pattern observed with the C-terminal antibody but stains the perinuclear region in the cell soma. Inhibition of calpain caused a shift in the localization of the C-terminal fragment within the cell soma, with immunoreactivity now concentrated in a perinuclear fashion similar to that observed with the N-terminal antibody. This hints that, in neurons, calpain cleaves the C-terminal kinase domain from its N-terminal microtubule anchorage domain, allowing it to enter the nucleus. Transfection of cultured cells with CPG16, which is similar to the 50-kDa C-terminal fragment of DCLK, results in mostly cytoplasmic localization. However, upon pharmacological elevation of cAMP, CPG16 moves into the nucleus (13Silverman M.A. Benard O. Jaaro H. Rattner A. Citri Y. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2631-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These two lines of evidence suggest that DCLK may have targets in the nucleus, and that the release of the kinase domain from the microtubule anchorage domain by calpain may represent a calcium-responsive means of regulating the localization of DCLK kinase activity.

Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Mediator associates tightly with RNA polymerase II (Pol II)1 to form a Pol II holoenzyme (h-Pol II) and plays a pivotal role in diverse aspects of transcriptional regulation. The search for homologous Mediator complexes in the mammalian system identified a number of protein complexes that contain several yeast Mediator homologs that function as both positive and negative regulators of transcription in vitro (3Gu W.

However, certain Mediator subunits function in an activator-specific manner to modulate the expression of distinct subsets of genes (8Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell.

Differential dissociation of Mediator components by high urea treatment (11Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) revealed that Mediator subunits with similar genetic properties form distinct modular subassemblies. Recently, the modular structure of Mediator was visualized by low resolution structural analysis (14Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and image processing of single particles of Mediator and h-Pol II revealed that Mediator alone assumes a compact structure; however, at high pH or in the presence of Pol II, Mediator displays an extended conformation with three domains (head, middle, and tail) forming an envelope that wraps around Pol II (14Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because purified yeast h-Pol II in conjunction with basal transcription factors can support activated transcription in a well defined yeast transcription system (1Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 2Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that gene-specific activators communicate either directly or indirectly with Mediator to recruit Pol II to the promoter. This hypothesis was substantiated by the following observation. First, h-Pol II was shown to interact with the functional activation domains of the VP16 and Gcn4 transcriptional activator proteins (8Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Drysdale C.M. Jackson B.M. McVeigh R. Klebanow E.R. Bai Y. Kokubo T. Swanson M. Nakatani Y. Weil P.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we demonstrated that a distinct Mediator module (the Gal11 module) is required for transcriptional activator binding to h-Pol II (8Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition to the essential role of Mediator complex in transcriptional activation, several lines of evidence indicate the involvement of Mediator in transcriptional repression as well. Genetic analyses revealed that several Mediator genes (such as SIN4,RGR1, and GAL11) play a role in the transcriptional repression of the HO, SUC2, andIME1 genes (17Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4503-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Song W. Treich I. Qian N. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Alleles of SIN4 andGAL11 were identified as suppressors of (i) anNC2 (Dr1/DRAP1) repressor mutation and (ii) defective silencing at the HMR mating-type locus in yeast (20Kim S. Cabane K. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2455-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast cells lacking the MED1 gene, which encodes a subunit of the Rgr1 subcomplex, are viable but show a complex phenotype that includes partial defects in both repression and induction ofGAL gene transcription (21Balciunas D. Galman C. Ronne H. Bjorklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, deletion of theHRS1 gene, which encodes a subunit of the Gal11 module, causes derepression of the GAL1, PHO5, andHSP26 genes (22Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Hrs1 protein was shown to interact with Tup1 protein in vitro (23Papamichos-Chronakis M. Conlan R.S. Gounalaki N. Copf T. Tzamarias D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8397-8403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that several proteins in the Rgr1 subcomplex are required for transcriptional repression. To decipher the modular structure of Mediator and identify the functions associated with each module, we used a urea-induced disruption assay and reconstitution experiment with recombinant proteins to analyze the protein-protein interactions among the Mediator subunits and examined the role of each subunit in transcriptional regulation with genome-wide expression analysis. The copper-inducible LexA-tagged yeast expression vector was constructed as follows. The CUP1 promoter region from −1 to −1000 (translation initiation site is +1) was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (XhoI and HindIII sites are in the 5′- and 3′-end primers, respectively). A DNA fragment containing the LexA DNA binding domain, a multicloning site, and theADH1 terminator was isolated from pEG202 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by usingHindIII and XbaI. These fragments were introduced into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pRS313 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and named pCE1. The SSN6 and SRB10 coding regions were cloned by in vivo gap repair (25Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and inserted in-frame into the multicloning site of pCE1 to create pCESSN6 and pCESRB10, respectively. pAJ201 (26Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), which had four LexA binding sites in the upstream region of the CYC1 core promoter, was used as a reporter construct. The TUP1 open reading frame was cloned by in vivo gap repair and then introduced into pGEX-4T-1 in-frame to construct the GST-Tup1 fusion construct. GST-Tup1 was expressed in bacterial strain DH5α and then purified. The Tup1 open reading frame was also cloned into pHAFASTBACHTb (see “Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses”) in-frame to construct an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Tup1 protein, and the virus expressing the HA-tagged Tup1 was screened as described in the baculovirus expression system manual (Life Technologies, Inc.). The HA-tagged Tup1 was purified with Q-Sepharose FF and HA.11 Ab matrix (BabCo, Richmond, CA). Various Mediator mutant cells (10Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol.

After the copper induction, the cells were shifted to 37 °C and then allowed to grow for an additional 2.5 h. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (28Lee T.I. Wyrick J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E.G. Gadbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To prepare the probe for Northern blot analysis, the BamHI-SacI DNA fragment of LacZ and the LexA DNA binding region were isolated and32P-labeled by Klenow fragment in the presence of random hexanucleotide.

To construct a baculovirus that expresses an N-terminal HA-tagged Mediator protein, the HA epitope sequence (YPYDVPDY, 5′-TACCCATACGACGTGCCAGACTAC-3′) was inserted into the NcoI and EcoRI sites in pFASTBACHTb (Life Technologies, Inc.) to construct pHAFASTBACHTb. All the Mediator genes were cloned by in vivo gap repair, verified by nucleic acid sequencing, and introduced into pFASTBACHTb and pHAFASTBACHTb expression vectors in-frame. Recombinant baculovirus clones for each of the Mediator proteins were isolated and further amplified until a titer of >1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml was achieved according to the baculovirus expression system manual (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 cells were cultured in Grace's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Each recombinant virus was used for infection at a multiplicity of infection of 2. Multiple recombinant viruses were infected together at the same multiplicity of infection for coexpression experiments; Sf9 cells were infected with virus mixtures A (HA-Med1, Med4, and Med9/Cse2) and B (HA-Srb7, Med7, and Med10/Nut2) to make Med9/Cse2 and Med10/Nut2 modules, respectively. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g after 48 h of incubation, washed once with a phosphate-buffered saline solution, resuspended in 10 ml of IP300 buffer (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet-400, and 300 mm potassium acetate), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Next, the lysate was disrupted by Dounce homogenization (20 strokes with a “B” pestle) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The whole-cell extract was diluted with the same volume of IP buffer (same as IP300 buffer with the exclusion of 300 mm potassium acetate) and then applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (10 ml) equilibrated with D150 buffer (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% Glycerol, plus 150 mm potassium acetate). The column was washed with 2 volumes of D300 buffer and then eluted with D600 buffer. Fractions containing recombinant Mediator proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis with anti-Med6 antibodies (29Lee Y.C. Min S. Gim B.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), dialyzed against IP150 buffer, and then incubated for 8 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of HA.11 Ab affinity matrix (BabCO). After binding, the resin was washed three times for 5 min at 4 °C with 500 μl of IP1500 buffer. The proteins bound to the resin were eluted by washing twice with IP150 buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA, BabCO) at 4 °C for 30 min. The purity of each eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and immunoblotting. Wild-type and mutant yeast strains were grown to an A600 of 0.5 in YPD at 30 °C. For temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants, the cultures were diluted with an equal volume of YPD and allowed to grow for 45 min at 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated, and the genomic expression profile of each strain was determined using four Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Poly(A) mRNA was isolated, converted to biotin-cRNA, and hybridized to the GeneChips, which were then washed, stained, and scanned as described previously (9Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J.

Five poly(A)-tagged control RNAs were added to equal amounts of total RNA from each preparation. The levels of these controls were then used to normalize each wild-type and mutant expression profile to total RNA. Two independent experiments were performed for each wild type versus mutant comparison. Individual mRNA levels were scored if the computer algorithm analyzing the scanned results (30Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat.

A decrease was called if an mRNA dropped more than 2-fold in both comparisons. An increase was called if an mRNA increased more than 2-fold in both comparisons. The observations that the Mediator has a structure that is composed of two functionally distinct subcomplexes (Srb4 and Rgr1) (11Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and that the Gal11, Med2, Hrs1, and Sin4 proteins form a functional module that bind to the C-terminal region of Rgr1 (12Li Y. Bjorklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether Med9/Cse2 and Med10/Nut2 also form modular structures with distinct functions. To this end, we first purified h-Pol II from wild-type yeast and mutant yeast strains that carried either the med9Δ(MED9/CSE2 deletion) or med10ts(temperature-sensitive) mutations. Subsequent immunoblot analysis of h-Pol II purified from the wild-type and mutant yeast strains revealed that the composition of h-Pol II from the med10ts strain was indistinguishable from that of wild type (data not shown). However, the h-Pol II from the med9Δ strain was completely devoid of Med9/Cse2 and Med1, deficient in Med4, and retained all the other Mediator components but at a slightly reduced level (Fig.1A). This result indicates that Med9/Cse2, Med1, and probably Med4 associate to form a modular structure. To confirm the above result, we immobilized the Mediator complex with anti-Med9/Cse2 Ab-coupled agarose beads and analyzed the polypeptides retained after a urea wash. The 1 m urea wash removed mainly the polymerase subunits associated with the Mediator complex, whereas a 2 m urea wash removed the Srb4 subcomplex from the beads without affecting the association of the Rgr1 subcomplex with the beads (Fig. 1B). When the beads were washed extensively at an even higher urea concentration (3 m), only Med1 and Med4 (in addition to Med9/Cse2) were retained on the beads. To determine whether direct interactions exist among Med9/Cse2, Med1, and Med4, Sf9 cells were co-infected with baculoviruses that contained Med4, Med9/Cse2, and HA-tagged Med1 expression constructs. The Sf9 lysate was then analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal Ab-coupled agarose beads. Immunoblot and silver-staining analysis of the immunoprecipitate showed that Med4 and Med9/Cse2 proteins co-precipitated with the HA-Med1 protein via direct interaction, whereas GST protein added to the extracts remained in the supernatant (Fig. 2A and data not shown). These observations demonstrate that Med9/Cse2, Med1, and Med4 also form a stable modular structure, as do the components of the Gal11 module. Although the existence of the Gal11 and Med9/Cse2 modules was demonstrated with several experimental techniques, we were unable to observe a Med10/Nut2 containing module either by compositional analysis of med10ts/nut2ts h-Pol II or using the urea dissociation method (because of the relatively low binding affinity of anti-Med10/Nut2 Ab; data not shown). Therefore, we examined the physical interactions in Sf9 cells of Med10/Nut2 with the rest of the polypeptides (Med7 and Srb7) in the Rgr1 subcomplex. Immunoprecipitation of Sf9 cell extracts in which Med7, Med10/Nut2, and Srb7 were coexpressed with anti-Med10 Ab showed that Med7 and Med10/Nut2 associated directly with Srb7 in the absence of other Mediator proteins, thus demonstrating the presence of a Med10/Nut2 module (Fig. 2B). Therefore, Mediator appears to contain at least three modular structures (the Gal11, Med9/Cse2, and Med10/Nut2 modules) that are tethered independently to the Rgr1 protein in the Rgr1 subcomplex. To identify the distinct roles of the Med9/Cse2 and Med10/Nut2 modules in transcriptional regulation, we analyzed the genome-wide gene expression patterns in yeast strains that contained mutations in theMED9/CSE2 and MED10/NUT2genes using HDAs for 6181 yeast genes. Total RNA was isolated frommed9Δ/cse2Δ andmed10ts/nut2ts mutant yeast strains and their wild-type counterparts 45 min after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, and these RNA preparations were hybridized to the HDAs. 2S. J. Han, J.-S. Lee, J. S. Kang, and Y.-J. Kim, unpublished data. Among the 5376 yeast genes, the expression levels of which were determined for themed10ts mutant strain, 2899 genes (54%) were down-regulated more than 2-fold under restrictive conditions, whereas only 56 gene were up-regulated (1%) (Table II). In contrast, the number of genes, the expression of which was affected in the med9Δ mutant strain was quite small (384 of 4806 genes down- or up-regulated); however, a significant number of genes (209 of 384 genes affected) were up-regulated (Tables II andIII). Therefore,MED10/NUT2 seems to be required for the transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, whereasMED9/CSE2 is generally dispensable for transcriptional activation but required for the mediation of transcriptional repression for a subset of genes.Table IIDNA chip analysis of Mediator mutantsNumber of scored genes2-aNumber of genes that gave significant hybridization signals above background.Number of genes2-bThe number of genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in each Mediator mutant strain was scored.Down 2-fold or moreUp 2-fold or moremed10ts53762899 (54.0 %)56 (1.0 %)med9Δ4806175 (3.6 %)209 (4.3 %)mRNA isolated from med10ts/mut2ts andmed9Δ/cse2Δ mutant yeast strains and their wild-type counterparts 45 min after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature were hybridized to four Affymetrix GeneChip arrays that contain probes for 6181 yeast genes.2-a Number of genes that gave significant hybridization signals above background.2-b The number of genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in each Mediator mutant strain was scored.

Genes with the most severe defects in transcriptional repression (genes up-regulated in the mutant) or activation (genes down-regulated in the mutant) are shown. To examine whether the Med9/Cse2 module is involved in transcriptional repression as suggested by the HDA analysis, we used Northern analysis to examine the effect of med9Δ mutation on the expression of genes that are repressed under a rich growth condition (FLO1, SUC2, SOL4, andHXK1) and compared their effect with that of thegal11Δ mutation. When the cells were grown in YPD, expressions of the SOL4, SUC2, andHXK1 genes were repressed completely (SUC2) or at least several fold (SOL4 and HXK1) in wild-type cells. However, the med9Δ/cse2Δ mutant was defective in transcriptional repression of SOL4 andHXK1 (4- and 3.5-fold increases in transcripts, respectively), whereas gal11Δ mutants showed defects in the transcriptional repression of the SOL4 andSUC2 genes (12- and 10-fold increases, respectively; Fig.3). In addition, Med9 is required for the transcriptional repression of FLO1, but Gal11 is dispensable for the FLO1 repression (Fig. 3). Therefore, Gal11 and Med9 proteins are required for transcriptional repression of distinct group of genes and seem to constitute repressor interaction modules of the Mediator complex. In addition to the MED9/CSE2 and GAL11results shown here, certain alleles of other Mediator components (SIN4 and RGR1) have been implicated in transcriptional repression (18Covitz P.A. Song W.

However, whether the Mediator proteins are involved directly in transcriptional repression or indirectly by controlling the expression of a specific transcriptional repressor protein has not yet been demonstrated clearly. To determine whether specific Mediator subunits are involved directly in transcriptional repression, we measured the transcriptional repression of a reporter gene (LacZ) that contained a binding site for the LexA repressor protein. We expressed LexA-Ssn6 or LexA-Srb10 repressor fusion proteins in various Mediator mutant backgrounds and monitored reporter gene expression (Fig.4A). In the absence of copper, LexA-Srb10 and LexA-Ssn6 were expressed at a barely detectable level from the CUP1 promoter; therefore a moderate level of basal expression of the reporter gene (LacZ) was detected in all of the strains tested (Fig. 4B). Upon induction with copper, the highly expressed repressor fusion proteins were recruited to the reporter gene promoter (CYC1 promoter fused toLacZ), which resulted in a 9-fold repression ofLacZ transcription in wild-type cells. The inactivation ofMED10/NUT2 activity did not affect the transcriptional repression of LacZ by either of the repressor fusion proteins. However, when the transcriptional repressors were overexpressed in the absence of the Med9/Cse2 or Gal11 proteins, neither LexA-Srb10 nor LexA-Ssn6 was able to repress LacZexpression. These results suggest that Med9/Cse2 and Gal11, but not Med10/Nut2, are required directly for transfer of the repression signal from gene-specific transcriptional repressor proteins to the basal transcription ma"

Insights into biochemical mechanisms that control the activity of SOD1 inside the cell provide a basis for understanding the molecular basis of this neurological disorder. Mechanisms for activation of SOD1 must account for protein-protein interactions with CCS chaperone. Biochemical assays reveal that the metallochaperone protects copper from the most extreme copper scavengers in vitro but allows facile and direct transfer of the metal to SOD1. This observation leads to the proposal of an intermediate in which copper was simultaneously coordinated by side chains in both CCS and SOD1 (4Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C.

While the two most C-terminal domains of yCCS are required for contact with SOD1 in vivo, it is not known how these proteins dock or how the metal is transferred.

A central assumption in the heterotetramer model is that E,Zn-ySOD1 (where E indicates an empty copper-binding site) or E,E-ySOD1 remains a dimer upon encountering yCCS (22Hall L.T. Sanchez R.J.

Several characteristics of SOD1 suggest that this need not be the case. First metal occupancy influences the stability of the dimeric state of bovine SOD1 (bSOD1) (7Lyons T.J. Gralla E.B.

Both E,E-SOD1 and E,Zn-SOD1 are less stable than holo-SOD1(31); however, E,Zn-ySOD is the dominant form in cells that lack yCCS (32Lyons T.J. Nersissian A. Goto J.J. Zhu H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S.

In this study we employ a mutant form of yeast E,Zn-SOD1 in which one of the four copper binding histidine residues is replaced with a residue that cannot bind metal ions. Using this protein as bait we have delineated steps required for capture of a complex that contains the docked copper chaperone. The new experiments corroborate our preliminary report supporting a heterodimer (33Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C.

The mutagenic primers 5′-CGTGGGTTCCACATTTTTGAGATGCC-3′ and its reverse complement were used to create the mutation. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing of the plasmid (ABI Prism). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells, which were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 100 µm carbenicillin toA600 = 0.8 and then induced with 500 µm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h. Protein was extracted from the cell pellet by three cycles of freeze-thaw lysis into 2.5 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.8. The extract was treated with a combination of gel filtration chromatography on a prep scale Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE column with a gradient of 2.5 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.8 to 50 mmK2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8 yielding ∼50 mg of [H48F]ySOD1 per liter of Luria-Bertani medium. Both the purity of [H48F]ySOD1 (>95% by SDS-PAGE gel) and protein identity were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy with an observed mass of 15,733.2 Da (calculated mass: 15,732.5 Da) indicating processing of the N-terminal methionine. The concentration of a stock solution of E,Zn-[H48F]ySOD1 monomer (10.0 µm) was determined using a calculated extinction coefficient of ε280 = 1400m(monomer)−1 cm−1 from the Gill and von Hippel equation (35Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. v. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). The low absorbance at 280 nm arises from a single tyrosine residue in [H48F]ySOD1 with a minor contribution from two cysteines that are assumed to be bridged by a disulfide bond. The concentration of the same stock solution was determined to be 10.5 µm by Bradford assay using IgG standard. Consequently, routine SOD1 concentrations were determined using values from the IgG/Bio-Rad assay multiplied by a factor of 0.95 (10.0 µm/10.5 µm). Purified [H48F]ySOD1 protein (10 µm) was analyzed by ICP-AES for Cu and Zn and was also screened for SOD activity by standard native PAGE NBT assay (36Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Colowick S.P. Kaplan N.O. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Orlando1984: 93-104Google Scholar). Analysis of 9.5 µm purified [H48F]ySOD1 by ICP-AES revealed 9.7 µm zinc and essentially no copper (less than 15 nm). To prepare antibodies specific for yCCS and ySOD1, full-length wild-type ySOD1 and yCCS were purified as previously reported and then further purified by HPLC on a Vydac C4 column using a gradient of water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions were combined, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in deionized water to be used in the inoculum. The identity and purity of the proteins were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The HPLC-purified yCCS and ySOD1 were used as antigens for polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit (Biodesign International). Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed by combining 50 µl of 100 µm apo- or Cu-yCCS with 50 µl of 100 µm H48F or apo-[WT]ySOD1 for 1 h on ice in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/MES, pH 8.0. 1 µl of primary antibody for yCCS was added to the reaction and the sample was incubated for 30 min on ice. Prewashed protein A-Sepharose beads were then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The beads were washed with 100 µl 1× phosphate-buffered saline, then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 ×g three times. The beads were boiled for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was then centrifuged for 5 min and run on a 12% Tris-denaturing SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred from gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk, and analyzed by Western blot using ySOD1 polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody (1:8000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate (BioRad) as the secondary antibody (1:8000 dilution). The blot was developed using the Hybond ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 150 µl of 100 µm Cu or apo-yCCS were incubated with 150 µl of 100 µm[H48F]ySOD1 on ice for 0, 30, and 60 min. Reactions were analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis on 12% Tris-HCl precast native gels (Bio-Rad). 5 µl of each reaction mixture was combined with native PAGE sample buffer (containing Tris, EDTA, Coomassie dye, and glycerol), and the electrophoresis was run for 1 h at 200 V. The above reaction mixtures (250 µl) were also analyzed on a Superose 12 analytical gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Running buffer was Chelex-treated and consisted of 50 mmTris/MES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Gel filtration standards included 100 µm bovine serum albumin (mass, 66.3 kDa; elution volume, 12.3 ml), ovalbumin (mass, 42.8 kDa; elution volume, 13.4 ml), holo-hSOD1 (mass, 31.6 kDa; elution volume, 14.5 ml) and carbonic anhydrase (mass, 29.0 kDa; elution volume, 14.6 ml). Gel filtration of Cu-yCCS, apo-yCCS, and [H48F]ySOD1 was performed using 250 µl of 100 µm protein. Absorbance in all cases was monitored at 254 nm due to the low extinction coefficient at 280 nm of [H48F]ySOD1. Complexes isolated by gel filtration, as described above, were analyzed relative to yCCS and H48F alone by native PAGE gel stained by Coomassie dye. Western blot of the native PAGE gel after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and overnight blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk was performed using yCCS polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody (1:8000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate as the secondary antibody (1:8000 dilution). The membrane was then stripped at 50 °C using 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl as the stripping buffer, and re-blotted using ySOD1 polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody (1:8000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate as the secondary antibody (1:8000 dilution). Complexes isolated by gel filtration were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and ICP-AES. For MALDI-TOF, a sample of ∼10 µm protein complex was diluted 1:4 into a solution of 30% CH3CN and 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid in water with sinapinic acid matrix (10 mg/ml). A myoglobin internal mass calibration standard was also added to this mixture prior to application on the MALDI-TOF sample plate. The maleimide derivative of coumarin (CPM) and the reducing agent tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Purified [H48F]ySOD1 was reduced overnight with TCEP in Tris, pH 7.5 and 1.0 m NaCl. CPM was added from a freshly prepared stock solution in Me2SO. The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 45 min. The mixture was dialyzed against buffer MES pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, 25 µm TCEP at 4 °C. Labeled protein concentration was determined using the NanoOrange kit from Molecular Probes. The labeling ratio of dye to protein (LR), under these conditions, is no more than 0.5, indicating that on the average only one of the two cysteines of the monomer is labeled. Equilibrium sedimentation studies on a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV absorbance optics conducted on 18–20 µmsamples of CPM-labeled and unlabeled [H48F]ySOD revealed average masses of 27.4 ± 1.5 and 29.2 ± 5.7 kDa respectively, indicating that neither the mutation nor the labeling causes aggregation beyond the dimer state (data not shown). A four-hole AN-60 rotor was used at 18,000 and 22,000 rpm; scans were taken at 280 nm. Fluorescence measurements were made on an ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 300 watt UV Xenon arc lamp. The absorption and emission wavelengths were 384 and 469, and the bandwidths were 8 and 16 nm, respectively. The experiments were conducted in 1.5 ml of MES pH 6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 µm TCEP, 25 °C. CPM-labeled [H48F]ySOD (10–12 nm) was titrated with apo-yCCS or Cu-yCCS and the anisotropy, using the T format, and total fluorescence intensities were measured at each protein concentration. CuSO4 or ZnSO4 was added to the SOD1 aliquot to a final concentration of 87 nm in the strongly reducing buffer. This condition leads to quantitative formation of Cu(I), which readily loads CCS under these conditions (4Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In all the experiments the system came to equilibrium within min, and the anisotropy was subsequently measured for 30 and 60 s several times at each point and averaged for the final analyses. The data were fit with Origin 4.1 software package from MICROCALTM Software, INC. using the following binding expression in Equation 1, A=Af+(Ab−Af)[K(x)/(1+K(x))]Equation 1 where A is the measured anisotropy, Af and Ab are the anisotropies of the free and bound fluorescent molecule CPM-[H48F]SOD1, X is the concentration of added CCS, andK is the observed equilibrium binding constant. TheK, Af, and Ab were the fitted parameters in the analyses. Values for Ab and Af were found to be ∼0.09 and 0.07 for all runs. Although small (∼0.02 units), this increase in anisotropy is sufficient for analysis of binding reactions (37Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). No copper-dependent quenching of the CPM moiety was observed in the fluorescence intensity, which decreased by ∼20% over the course of the titration of both the apo and copper cases. Mutation of the copper binding histidine 48 to phenylalanine in ySOD1 disrupts the native copper binding site but, as anticipated, does not disrupt zinc binding. Under conditions where the wild-type protein binds both copper and zinc, the [H48F]ySOD1 binds 1.02 mol of Zn(II) per mol of monomer and essentially no copper (<0.0015 mol Cu per mol monomer). This mutant thus cannot fully accept a copper ion in the native catalytic binding site and was used to trap a chaperone/enzyme complex. Immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that yCCS readily forms a complex with [H48F]SOD1 (Fig. 1). Under these conditions apo-[wt]ySOD1 is not captured (data not shown). The sequence of binding and release reactions that lead to activation of the wild-type ySOD1 are potentially too rapid to be detected in this assay. Western blots using ySOD1 primary antibody show strong interaction of yCCS with [H48F]ySOD1 despite repeated washing with high salt buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline). Apo-yCCS forms an apparently weaker complex indicated by a less intense band for [H48F]ySOD1 (Fig. 1). To characterize this complex, methods to isolate it from the individual proteins were established. A time course of the reaction between yCCS and [H48F]SOD1 reveals that a new band in native gels appears in less than 30 min of exposure to air at 4 °C. No complex is observed if the reaction is performed and analyzed in the anaerobic chamber for as long as 24 h. This exposure to oxygen may stabilize either CCS or SOD1 via disulfide bond formation. 2A. S. Torres, N. Brown, L. E. Lemont, and T. V. O'Halloran (2001), manuscript in preparation. The new band in the native gel exhibits an intermediate mobility between yCCS and [H48F]ySOD1 (Fig. 2A). As with the immunoprecipitation results, the new complex appears in reaction mixtures containing the copper-loaded or apo-form of the chaperone. Also in accord with the immunoprecipitation results shown in Fig. 1, we find the new band is more intense in the Cu-yCCS reaction than in the apo-yCCS case, again indicating that copper favors heterocomplex formation (Fig. 2A). Removing metal from the wild-type SOD1 active site is known to weaken SOD1 homodimer stability (31Marmocchi F. Caulini G. Venardi G. Cocco D. Calabrese L. Rotilio G. Physiol. Chem. Phys. 1975; 7: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The purified reactants were thus examined by analytical gel filtration monitored at 254 nm to test whether the [H48F]SOD1 is a dimer or monomer under these conditions. In the previous study, SOD1 was not detected when fractions were monitored at 280 nm (33Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14720-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); however, it is readily observable at 254 nm. The elution volume of [H48F]ySOD1 was 14.5 ml and corresponds to an apparent mass of 32 kDa on the calibrated Superose 12 column (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the protein is predominately a dimer under these conditions. Similar analysis reveals the apo-yCCS is a monomer while the Cu(I)-loaded form exhibits both monomeric and dimeric states, consistent with previous observations (19Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration analysis of equimolar reaction mixtures (1:1 CCS/SOD1) reveals a new species with an apparent mass of 41 ± 2 kDa (Fig. 2B). This is within experimental error of the theoretical mass for a heterodimer containing yCCS and [H48F]ySOD1 (42.9 kDa); however, changes in metal occupancy or conformation of one of the proteins in the sample could lead to hydrodynamic changes that appear as a larger mass. The new peak fractions were therefore examined for protein and metal content by additional methods. To further delineate protein content, all fractions from the gel filtration profiles were also analyzed by Western blot for SOD1 and by Bradford assay for total protein (Fig. 3). When [H48F]ySOD1/yCCS mixtures were injected on the column, only fractions 26–33 contained protein; and, when [H48F]ySOD1 was injected alone, only fractions 30–32 contained protein. Western analysis of all fractions using ySOD1 primary antibody provides a sensitive test of whether larger oligomers such as heterotetramers are present in the early fractions. SOD1 is detected in earlier fractions (26–30 corresponding to mass range 50–30 kDa), but none was detected in fractions that would contain species larger than 66 kDa, ruling out the possibility that the observed complex corresponds to a heterotetramer (theoretical mass, 85.8 kDa). The mixture of apo-[H48F]ySOD1 and Cu-yCCS also elutes in fractions corresponding to 50–30 kDa. These shifts in elution volume are evidence of a [H48F]ySOD1 heterodimer with yCCS. The fraction exhibiting the maximum absorbance for both mixtures and corresponding to a mass of 41 kDa (fraction 28) was further analyzed by nondenaturing native gel electrophoresis and Western blot using both yCCS and ySOD1 primary antibodies (Fig.4). The intermediate band observed for fraction 28 (Fig. 4, first panel) has the same relative mobility as the band detected in the time course (Fig. 2A). Western blots demonstrate that after separation by gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis, the complex still contains both yCCS and ySOD1 (Fig. 4). In the equimolar reaction mixtures, Cu-yCCS begins with approximately one copper atom per monomer and [H48F]ySOD1 begins with approximately one zinc atom per monomer. Therefore, an intac"

In the present study, citraconylation of lysine residues in apoB-100 abolished the ability of the modified low density lipoprotein to associate with apo(a), thereby demonstrating a direct role for lysine residues in apoB in the first step of Lp(a) assembly. To identify specific lysine residues in the amino terminus of apoB that are required for the noncovalent interaction, we initially used an affinity chromatography method in which recombinant forms of apo(a) (r-apo(a)) were immobilized on Sepharose beads. Assessment of the ability of carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoB-18 to bind to r-apo(a)-Sepharose revealed that a 25-amino acid sequence in apoB (amino acids 680–704) bound specifically to apo(a) in a lysine-dependent manner; citraconylation of the lysine residues in the apoB derivative encoding this sequence abolished the binding interaction. Using fluorescence spectrometry, we found that a synthetic peptide corresponding to this sequence bound directly to apo(a); the peptide also reduced covalent Lp(a) formation. Lysine residues present in this sequence (Lys680 and Lys690) were mutated to alanine in the context of apoB-18. We found that the apoB-18 species containing the Lys680mutation was incapable of binding to r-apo(a)-Sepharose columns, whereas the apoB-18 species containing the Lys690 mutation exhibited slightly reduced binding to these columns. Taken together, our data indicate that Lys680 is critical for the noncovalent interaction of apo(a) and apoB-100 that precedes covalent Lp(a) formation. We have previously shown that lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) assembly involves an initial noncovalent interaction between sequences within apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) kringle IV types 5–8 and the amino terminus of apolipoprotein B-100 (sequences between amino acids 680 and 781 in apoB-100), followed by formation of a disulfide bond.

Hegele R.A. Koschinsky M.L. Curr. Cardiol. Rep. 1999; 1: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Lp(a) is similar to low density lipoprotein (LDL) both in lipid composition and in the presence of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). Lp(a) is distinguishable from LDL, however, by the presence of a unique glycoprotein termed apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), which is attached to apoB-100 by a single disulfide bond. The presence of apo(a) likely confers the unique structural and functional properties attributable to Lp(a). Apo(a) contains tandem repeats of a sequence that is highly similar to plasminogen kringle IV, followed by sequences that are homologous to the kringle V and protease domains of plasminogen (2McLean J.W.

Apo(a) contains 10 distinct subclasses of kringle IV; the kringle IV type 2 domain (KIV2) is present in variable copy number, which forms the basis for the observed isoform size heterogeneity of Lp(a) (3Lackner C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15471-15474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in which an initial noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB-100 results in the correct orientation of the two proteins that is required for subsequent disulfide bond formation; validation of this model was provided by studies that clearly demonstrated that the efficiency of the noncovalent step dictates the extent of covalent Lp(a) formation (8Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Early studies have shown that the process of Lp(a) formation can be inhibited by lysine, lysine analogs such as ε-aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA), and proline (8Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Frank S. Durovic S. Kostner K. Kostner G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); studies by our group have specifically demonstrated that the noncovalent step of Lp(a) assembly is also sensitive to the addition of arginine and phenylalanine (8Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Koschinsky M.L. Marcovina S.M. May L.F. Gabel B.R. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have focused on defining the sequence requirements in both apo(a) and apoB-100 that are required for their noncovalent association. Using truncated derivatives of recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)), we have shown that sequences within apo(a) kringle IV types 6–8 (each of which are thought to contain weak lysine-binding sites (LBS)) are required for noncovalent interaction with LDL and that this interaction can be inhibited by lysine, lysine analogs, proline, arginine, and phenylalanine (8Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). With respect to identification of sequences in apoB-100 that are required for noncovalent association with apo(a), we previously analyzed a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated apoB species for their ability to bind apo(a) (12Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that sequences between apoB-18 (N-terminal 18% of apoB-100) and apoB-15 are necessary for noncovalent association with apo(a) kringle IV 5–8; we further showed that this interaction is sensitive to the addition of lysine analogs and proline (12Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the notion that lysine-binding sites in apo(a) directly interact with lysine residue(s) in apoB-100 remains to be substantiated. In this study, we initially sought to define conclusively a role for lysine residue(s) in apoB-100 in mediating noncovalent association with apo(a) by chemical modification of lysine residues in apoB-100 with citraconic anhydride. Our second goal was to precisely identify sequences within the region spanning apoB-15 and apoB-18 that mediate noncovalent binding to apo(a) using novel carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoB-18 for noncovalent assembly assays. Our third goal was to identify lysine residue(s) within this region that are important for the first step of Lp(a) assembly. LDL was purified as previously described (13Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6510) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole blood obtained from a normolipidemic volunteer (in accordance with ethics procedures set forth by Queen's University) was collected into EDTA (5 mm final concentration). Plasma was isolated by low speed centrifugation of whole blood (710 ×g for 20 min) and supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. LDL (in the 1.02–1.063 density range) was isolated from plasma by sequential flotation. The final LDL fraction was dialyzed extensively against HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored at 4 °C for no longer than 4 days prior to use. All proteins were judged to be pure by the appearance of a single band upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by staining with Coomassie Blue; LDL concentration was determined by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. A 17-kringle (17K)-containing form of r-apo(a) and an apo(a) derivative containing KIV5–8 were constructed and expressed as previously described (14Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F.

Briefly, CM (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) harvested from stably transfected cells was chromatographed on a 50-ml lysine-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The column was washed extensively with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl until the absorbance at 280 nm was <0.02. R-apo(a) was eluted with 0.2 m ε-ACA in the same buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against HBS, and concentrated using polyethylene glycol 20000 (Fluka). Protein concentrations for all r-apo(a) derivatives were obtained by absorbance measurements at 280 nm (corrected for Rayleigh scattering) using previously determined extinction coefficients (14Koschinsky M.L.

Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32096-32104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Purified LDL was modified with citraconic anhydride as previously described (17Bakillah A. Jamil J. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); this procedure has been reported to result in the modification of 50% of the lysine residues within apoB-100 (17Bakillah A. Jamil J. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, an equal volume of a saturated sodium acetate solution was added to 1 mg of purified LDL, and the mixture was incubated on a rocker at 4 °C for 15 min. At this time, a 50-fold excess (with respect to lysine concentration in apoB-100) of citraconic anhydride was added in two equal portions with a 15-min incubation at 4 °C between additions. The modified LDL was then dialyzed exhaustively against HBS to remove free citraconic anhydride, and the protein concentration was determined by a modified Bradford assay using BSA as the standard. Modification of lysine residues with citraconic anhydride is a reversible process. In our study, reversal of the citraconylation was achieved by lowering the pH of the solution to 5 by a stepwise addition of 1 m HCl. The LDL (pH 5) was then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 by a stepwise addition of 1 m NaOH. The LDL was dialyzed against HBS, and the protein concentration was determined by a modified Bradford assay using BSA as the standard. LDL modification and de-modification were qualitatively verified by subjecting native, modified, and de-modified LDLs to agarose gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. Samples (10 μg each) were added to 2 μl of loading dye (50% sucrose and bromphenol blue in HBS) and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel made up in 0.5× buffer containing 45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The samples were electrophoresed at 4 °C for 2 h at 100 V, and lipoproteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The native, modified, and de-modified LDLs were also subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue; these analyses revealed no fragmentation of apoB-100 by these procedures. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based binding assay was utilized to monitor the binding of native LDL, LDL modified with citraconic anhydride, and de-modified LDL to immobilized r-apo(a). Purified 17K r-apo(a) was coated onto microtiter wells (polyvinyl chloride 96-well plates, Costar Corp.) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with a solution of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST), the microtiter wells were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 150 μl of a 2.5% (w/v) solution of BSA in HBS. Blocked wells were washed with PBST and incubated with varying concentrations (starting at 500 nm, serially diluted in diluent buffer (1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in HBS)) of native, citraconic anhydride-modified, or de-modified LDL for 18 h at 4 °C. At this time, the wells were washed with PBST and incubated with a 333 pg/μl solution of anti-apoB antibody monoclonal 1D1 (epitope within apoB-26) (18Milne R.W. Theolis Jr., R. Verdery R.B. Marcel Y.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 23-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in diluent buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After another washing step with PBST, the microtiter wells were incubated with a solution of a sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma; 200 pg/μl in diluent buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. A final wash with PBST was performed, after which the wells were developed for 5 min with 100 μl of developing solution containing the substrateo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.42 mg/ml). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 mH2SO4 solution, and the absorbance at 490 nm (less the background absorbance at 650 nm) was measured using a Titertek plate reader. In vitro covalent Lp(a) assembly assays were performed as previously described (10Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, 17K r-apo(a) was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, and its concentration in CM was quantified by ELISA using purified 17K r-apo(a) as a standard. Purified native LDL (50 nm) was incubated with CM (diluted with HBS) containing 2 nm 17K r-apo(a) at 37 °C in a total volume of 300 μl. At selected times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h), a 30-μl aliquot was removed from the incubation, added to an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) in the absence of a reducing agent, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-apo(a) monoclonal antibody a-6 (epitope is within KIV2) (20Marcovina S.M. Albers J.J. Gabel B. Koschinsky M.L. Gaur V.P. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The extent of recombinant Lp(a) (r-Lp(a)) assembly was then quantified by densitometric analysis of the blots by dividing the density of the Lp(a) band by the sum of the densities of the Lp(a) and free apo(a) bands. To assess the effect of modification of LDL with citraconic anhydride on covalent Lp(a) formation, LDL modified with citraconic anhydride (50 nm) was used in place of native LDL. The r-apoB derivatives utilized in this study are shown schematically in Fig. 1; details of the construction of the corresponding expression plasmids are described below. All constructs were assembled in the pRK5 expression plasmid, which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter and SV40 transcription termination sequences (14Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To create an apoB-18 expression construct in pRK5, a 2600-base pairEcoRI/BamHI fragment was excised from apoB-18-pCMV5 (21Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated into the pRK5 vector, which had been digested with these enzymes. Using apoB-18 in pRK5 as a template for polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis, carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoB18 were created by the introduction of a premature stop codon at amino acids 680, 705, 730, and 755 to generate apoB-15, apoB-15.8, apoB-16.5, and apoB-17.3, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis was also utilized to generate two mutants of apoB-18 in which Lys680 or Lys690was mutated to alanine, resulting in the apoB-18(K680A) and apoB-18(K690A) derivatives, respectively. McArdle rat hepatoma 7777 (RH7777) cells expressing each of the r-apoB derivatives were generated as previously described (14Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, these cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation using 10 μg of each r-apoB expression plasmid and 1 μg of a plasmid encoding the neomycin resistance gene per 100-mm plate. Stable transformants were selected by culturing cells in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) until cellular foci developed. At this time, foci were picked and screened for r-apoB expression by ELISA and Western blot analysis using the 1D1 anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. Purified r-apo(a) corresponding to the 17K or KIV5–8 r-apo(a) derivatives were immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (12Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); affinity chromatography using r-apo(a) derivatives coupled to Sepharose was performed as previously described (12Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, CM (0.25 ml) harvested from cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant apoB-18 or carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoB-18 was applied to 1-ml r-apo(a)-Sepharose columns corresponding to either the 17K or KIV5–8 derivative. After a 20-min incubation period at room temperature, the flow-through and wash (5 × 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl) fractions were collected. Specifically bound r-apoB was eluted in 3 × 1-ml fractions with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.2 m ε-ACA. All column fractions were then immunoprecipitated (12Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with 1 μg of a sheep polyclonal antibody raised against human LDL (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, followed by Western blot analysis using the 1D1 anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. Binding was quantified by densitometric analysis as previously described (12Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In some experiments, CM containing apoB-15.8 was treated with citraconic anhydride using a methodology identical to that described for purified LDL. Binding to 17K and KIV5–8 r-apo(a)-Sepharose was performed as described above. A synthetic peptide (apoB-(680–704)) corresponding to amino acids 680–704 (N-KQGFFPDSVNKALYWVNGQVPDGVS-C) in the primary sequence of apoB-100 was generated using an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The preparation was assessed to be ∼95% pure and was solubilized in HBS for use in this study. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of r-apo(a) were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer. The 17K r-apo(a) derivative (100 nm) was titrated with apoB-(680–704). Titrations were performed in HBS and 0.1% Tween 20 in a quartz cuvette that had been conditioned with this buffer prior to use. Tween 20 was included to minimize nonspecific interactions between apo(a) and/or peptide and the quartz cuvette. Apo(a) tryptophan excitation was performed using a wavelength of 280 nm and a slit width of 2.5 nm, whereas tryptophan emission was detected at a wavelength of 340 nm and a slit width of 5 nm with a 290-nm cutoff filter placed in the emission beam. Ligand solutions (containing 100 nm 17K r-apo(a) to eliminate dilution effects) were added in a stepwise manner until saturation of the fluorescence change was attained. Fluorescence directly attributable to apoB-(680–704) was controlled for by performing a titration of the peptide in the absence of apo(a) and subtracting the appropriate fluorescence values from those obtained in the presence of r-apo(a). To estimate KD and ΔImax for the r-apo(a)/apoB-(680–704) interaction, titration curves were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 1, ΔI=ΔImax[P]0KD+[P]0Equation 1 where ΔI is the absolute change in fluorescence, ΔImax is the absolute change in fluorescence at saturating ligand concentrations, KD is the dissociation constant, and [P]0 is the total concentration of apoB-(680–704). Based on initial regression analyses in which the number of apoB-(680–704)-binding sites on apo(a) was included in the model as a fit parameter and was calculated to be ∼1, a 1:1 r-apo(a)/apoB-(680–704) binding stoichiometry was assumed. Purified LDL (300 μg) was incubated with a 50-molar excess of 5′-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein overnight at 4 °C. To remove free 5′-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein, fluorescein-labeled LDL was passed over a 1-ml DEAE-cellulose column (Sigma) and eluted with HBS. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against HBS containing 0.01% Tween 20. The concentration of fluorescein-labeled LDL was determined using a modified Bradford assay, and the protein was stored at 4 °C for no longer than 3 days prior to use. Fluorescein fluorescence measurements of fluorescein-labeled LDL were performed using the LS50B luminescence spectrometer. Fluorescein-labeled LDL (50 nm) was titrated with 17K r-apo(a). Titrations were performed in HBS and 0.01% Tween 20 in a quartz cuvette that had been conditioned with this buffer prior to use. Tween 20 was included to minimize nonspecific interactions between apo(a) and/or LDL and the quartz cuvette. Fluorescein was excited at a wavelength of 495 nm and a slit width of 2.5 nm, whereas fluorescein emission was detected at a wavelength of 530 nm and a slit width of 5 nm with a 510-nm cutoff filter placed in the emission beam. Ligand solutions (containing 50 nm fluorescein-labeled LDL to eliminate dilution effects) were added in a stepwise manner until saturation of the fluorescence change was attained. To estimate theKD for the fluorescein-labeled LDL/r-apo(a) interactions, titration curves were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 1 (with a total concentration of r-apo(a) substituting for the total concentration of the peptide). To determine the effect of apoB-(680–704) on the second step of Lp(a) assembly, in vitro covalent Lp(a) assembly assays were performed as described above. In the first experiment, Lp(a) assembly was allowed to proceed for a fixed time (t = 4 h) in the presence of varying apoB-(680–704) concentrations (0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm). Following Western blotting, densitometry was performed to calculate the percent r-Lp(a) assembly. Lp(a) detected at time 0 corresponds to contaminating Lp(a) in the purified LDL fraction. As such, the percent r-Lp(a) was corrected for contaminating Lp(a) by subtracting the value at time 0. Relative r-Lp(a) formation was calculated by dividing the percent r-Lp(a) formed in the presence of apoB-(680–704) (t = 4 h) by the percent r-Lp(a) formed in the absence of the peptide (t = 4 h). In the second experiment, a time course assay (t = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h) was performed in the absence or presence of either 1 mm peptide or 2 mm ε-ACA. The Western blot was subjected to densitometric analysis to determine the percent r-Lp(a) formed, and the data were fit to Equation 2, %Lp(a)=b(1−e−ct)Equation 2 where b is the maximal percent r-Lp(a) formed,c is a constant, and t is the time of the reaction. This equation describes exponential rise to a maximum and was derived from first principles with the assumption that Lp(a) assembly occurs as a two-step process. To demonstrate that lysine residue(s) within apoB are specifically involved in the first step of Lp(a) assembly, we treated purified LDL with citraconic anhydride (which specifically modifies primary amines) and assayed the ability of the modified LDL to noncovalently bind 17K r-apo(a). Modification of LDL was qualitatively detected by the appearance of a mobility shift on a nondenaturing 1% agarose gel (Fig. 2A,inset). The modified LDL (lane 2) migrated faster than native LDL (lane 1) as a consequence of changes in the surface charge of the molecule. An ELISA-based binding experiment was performed to measure the noncovalent association between immobilized 17K r-apo(a) and modified LDL. The results indicate that although native LDL exhibited binding to 17K r-apo(a) in this system, the modified LDL did not (Fig. 2A). An in vitro Lp(a) assembly assay was used to examine whether the citraconylation of LDL affected its ability to form covalent Lp(a) particles. Covalent Lp(a) particle formation was observed with native LDL, whereas the ability of the citraconic anhydride-modified LDL to form covalent Lp(a) was completely abolished (Fig. 2B). The antibody reactivity of the modified or de-modified LDL species did not differ from that of native LDL as assessed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Citraconylation of LDL was reversed by incubation at low pH and verified by native agarose electrophoresis (Fig.2A, inset). Although incomplete de-modification was observed, this partial reversal of the LDL modification was adequate for the complete recovery of noncovalent binding to apo(a) (Fig. 2A), which may reflect the more efficient de-modification of lysine residue(s) specifically important for apo(a) binding. Collectively, these results indicate that lysine residues in apoB-100 are essential for the binding LDL to apo(a) and hence for the assembly of covalent Lp(a) particles. We have previously demonstrated that sequences between apoB-18 (N-terminal 18% of apoB-100) and apoB-15 are important for the first step of Lp(a) assembly (12Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To identify a region within apoB-18 that mediates the first step of Lp(a) assembly, we generated carboxyl-terminal"

We previously suggested that HMG-D might substitute for the linker histone H1 in the preblastoderm embryo and that this substitution might result in the characteristic less compacted chromatin. We have now studied the association of HMG-D with chromatin using a cell-free system for chromatin reconstitution derived from Drosophila embryos. Association of HMG-D with chromatin, like that of histone H1, increases the nucleosome spacing indicative of binding to the linker DNA between nucleosomes. HMG-D interacts with DNA during the early phases of nucleosome assembly but is gradually displaced as chromatin matures. By contrast, purified chromatin can be loaded with stoichiometric amounts of HMG-D, and this can be displaced upon addition of histone H1. A direct physical interaction between HMG-D and histone H1 was observed in a Far Western analysis. The competitive nature of this interaction is reminiscent of the apparent replacement of HMG-D by H1 during mid-blastula transition.

U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1897-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 32Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 33Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). During early Drosophiladevelopment, histone H1 is not detectable (34Elgin S.C. Hood L.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4984-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Anderson K.V. Diss. Abstr. 1980; 41: 28BGoogle Scholar, 36Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, H1 is not involved in chromatin condensation in these earliest phases of Drosophila development characterized by rapid condensation-decondensation cycles. We have previously suggested that HMG-D could function as a linker protein in the absence of histone H1 in Drosophila (37Ner S.S. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, Wolffe and colleagues (10Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have postulated a similar role for the Xenopus HMG B1 protein. Thus, as the maternal pool of HMG-D is titrated by the rapid replication and concomitant chromatin assembly and as histone H1 is synthesized, HMG-D would functionally be superseded by histone H1 around mid-blastula transition (37Ner S.S. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To test the above model and to examine the interplay between HMG-D and H1 in the process of chromatin assembly, we have used an in vitro chromatin assembly system derived from preblastodermDrosophila embryos. We show that, in a similar manner to histone H1, incorporation of purified HMG-D into chromatin alters the nucleosome repeat length (NRL),1 indicative of interaction with the nucleosomal linker DNA. Using bead-immobilized DNA as a substrate for HMG-D binding, we further show that H1 is able to displace HMG-D from chromatin. Finally we show, by far Western analysis, a strong physical direct interaction between H1 and HMG-D. Chromatin assembly using Drosophila embryo extracts and micrococcal nuclease I digests were performed as described (70Becker P.B. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A standard assembly reaction (133 μl) contained 40 μl of embryo extract (conductivity equals 80 mm KCl), 80 μl of EX buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate), 13.3 μl of an energy-regenerating-system (300 mm creatine phosphate, 10 mg creatine kinase/ml, 30 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol), and 650 ng of plasmid DNA. Chromatin was assembled for 5 h at 26 °C on DNA coupled to paramagnetic beads (Dynal) (71Blank T.A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.B. Methods. 1997; 12: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) under identical conditions, but all volumes were scaled proportionately as needed. For the experiment shown in Fig. 4, 3 μg of immobilized DNA was assembled into chromatin and isolated from the reaction mixture by exposure to a magnetic field for 20 s. Chromatin beads were immediately resuspended in 100 μl of EX buffer containing 80 mm KCl (EX80). 25 μl of the suspension was used in each subsequent reaction. Histone H1 (∼1 μg) or HMG-D (∼500 ng) were added to the beads in EX80 (total volume, 50 μl) and incubated at 26 °C for 30 min. After incubation the chromatin was reisolated and washed successively with 2 × 50 μl of EX buffers containing increasing concentration of KCl, typically, EX80, EX300, and EX500. Eluted proteins were precipitated by addition of 8 μl of StrataClean resin (Stratagene). After centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 2 min), the proteins in the pellet and those remaining on the paramagnetic beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Plasmid XX3.2 (71Blank T.A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.B. Methods. 1997; 12: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was digested in the polylinker sequences withEcoRI and ClaI to linearize the DNA. The DNA was blunt ended in the presence of 50 μm Biotin-14-dATP and 200 μm each of α-thio-dTTP, α-thio-dCTP, and α-thio-dGTP with Klenow enzyme. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by a gel filtration. The reaction selectively incorporates two biotinylated dATP molecules at one end of the DNA fragment, whereas α-thio-dCTP and α-thio-dGTP are added at the other end. Subsequently the DNA molecules were attached to paramagnetic beads coated with Strepavidin via the biotin moiety as described previously (40Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 1 μg of 6.2-kilobase DNA was coupled to 25 μl of bead suspension. We routinely coupled 40 μg of DNA as follows. The magnetic bead suspension (800 μl) was washed in 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Nonidet P-40, twice in 800 μl of 2× wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mNaCl), and resuspended in 660 μl of 4× wash buffer, 600 μl of H20. 40 μg of linearized DNA in 60 μl was added to the bead suspension, and the tube was rolled overnight at 27 °C. Expression of HMG-D inEscherichia coli and its purification have been described previously (20Jones D.N. Searles M.A. Shaw G.L. Churchill M.E. Ner S.S. Keeler J. Travers A.A. Neuhaus D. Structure. 1994; 2: 609-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence encoding the full-length protein was cloned in pET24a expression vector between the NdeI andXhoI sites. Expression of HMG-D from this clone gives rise to a mixture of truncated forms: HMG-D109, HMG-D108, HMG-D107, HMG-D106, HMG-D105, and HMG-D104 (verified by mass spectrometry). To improve the yield of the full-length protein, we replaced the GAG codon by GAA codon for the Glu residues in positions 101, 102, 110, and 112 and also the GAT codon by GAC for the Asp residues in positions 108 and 109. BL21(DE3) cells transformed by the expression vectors were grown at 37 °C untilA600 = 0.8 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (250 μg/ml), and growth was continued for 4 h at 25 °C to overproduce HMG-D112. Plasmids expressing truncated HMG-D proteins HMG-D83 and HMG-D100 (N-terminal 83 or 100 amino acid residues) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using primer pairs, SnfdNcoI/SnHMG-D83, and snfdNcoI/SnHMG-D100. SnHMG-D83 is 5′-GGAATTCAAGCTTACTATCCACCACCGTTGGCAGCACTG-3. SnHMG-D100 is 5′-GGAATTCAAGCTTACTACTTCTTGCTCTTCTTCGCCACC-3′. SnfdNcoI is 5′-GGGAATCAACCATGGCTTCTGATAAGCCAAAACGCCCACTCTCC-3′. These fragments were subsequently cloned into pKK233-2 at theNcoI-HindIII sites. HMG-D was purified from preblastoderm embryo extract (36Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The extract was heat denatured by a 10-min incubation at 75 °C. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and proteins in the supernatant were further fractionated by selective ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate from a 70–95% ammonium sulfate cut contains the majority of HMG-D. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, and 50 mm KCl (containing a mixture of protease inhibitors) and dialyzed against this same buffer. The dialysate was further fractionated on a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono S column. HMG-D was loaded onto the column in buffer containing 50 mm KCl and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. It elutes at 0.3–0.35 m NaCl. Histone H1 was isolated from 0–16 h Drosophila embryos as described previously (40Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes were performed using standard conditions (72Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The membrane was then subjected to denaturation in 6m guanidine HCl in HNT (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 30 min. The proteins were refolded by stepwise incubation in HNT buffer containing successively decreasing concentration of guanidine HCl until 0.01m. Each wash was for 15 min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated in HNT containing 5% milk powder for 1 h. After washing briefly in HNT (50 mm NaCl, 1% milk powder), the filter was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the same buffer containing radiolabeled HMG-D (∼106cpm/ml incubation buffer). The filter was washed in HNT (50 mm NaCl) for 5 min, washed in HNT (100 mm NaCl) for 30 min, and exposed to film. Both histone H1 and HMG-D contain serine/threonine residues that can be phosphorylated with protein kinase C. The enzyme requires a lipid mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) for efficient incorporation of phosphate moiety. HMG-D (1 μg) was incubated in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μl of lipids, and 0.1 milliunits of protein kinase C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 30 min at 37 °C, unincorporated label was removed by gel filtration (Sephacryl-200 HR, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was used immediately or stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. Approximately 25 ng of labeled HMG-D or H1 were added to 5 μg of cold protein for the competition experiments. To analyze the association of HMG-D with chromatin, we made use of a homologous cell-free system for chromatin reconstitution under physiological conditions in vitro (36Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The core of this system is an extract from preblastoderm Drosophila embryos. Incubation of plasmid DNA in this extract in the presence of ATP and an energy-regenerating system results in the formation of nucleosomal arrays with regular spacing. These extracts are deficient in histone H1 but contain large amounts of endogenous HMG-D (37Ner S.S. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Chromatin was reconstituted according to standard procedure (39Becker P.B. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 207-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 5 h and then isolated by gel filtration on a S-400 spin column. Chromatin proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and associated HMG-D was detected by Western blotting. Although stoichiometric amounts of the core histones were detected by Coomassie blue and silver staining on parallel gels, we were unable to detect HMG-D under these conditions (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that HMG-D was lost during gel filtration, we repeated the experiment using linear DNA coupled to paramagnetic beads (“immobilized DNA”) (40Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Immobilized chromatin can be separated from the extract within seconds in a magnetic field and subjected to various extractions. Immobilized chromatin was washed sequentially with buffer containing 80 and 500 mm KCl, and the eluted proteins as well as those remaining on the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and HMG-D detected by Western analysis (Fig.1a). Although HMG-D in the 80 mm KCl eluted fraction represents protein sticking nonspecifically to the reaction tube and paramagnetic beads (data not shown), we consistently observed low but distinct amounts of chromatin-associated HMG-D in the protein fraction eluted with 500 mm salt wash (lane 2). We estimate that there is ∼1 molecule of HMG-D/20–25 nucleosomes. Relative to the core histones and histone H1, this level of HMG-D appears to be similar to what has previously been reported for other HMGB proteins (41Goodwin G.H. Johns E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 42Isackson P.J. Bidney D.L. Reeck G.R. Neihart N.K. Bustin M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4466-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nuclei isolated from 0–4-h-old embryos contain substantially greater amounts of HMG-D than the 1 molecule of HMG-D/20–25 nucleosomes (Fig.1a, lane 4), as has been previously shown (37Ner S.S. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We conclude from these experiments that chromatin assembled using the embryonic extract contains only little HMG-D. To determine whether the failure to detect stoichiometric amounts of HMG-D in the assembled chromatin was due to modification of the endogenous protein (see below), we added recombinant HMG-D to the chromatin assembly and followed its association with immobilized DNA during a time course of nucleosome assembly. The samples were removed at 15, 45, 120, and 300 min, and chromatin was purified magnetically, subjected to diagnostic salt washes, and finally analyzed by Western blotting as before (Fig. 1b). Recombinant HMG-D was able to efficiently bind to naked immobilized DNA in the absence of embryo extract and was eluted entirely by 500 mm KCl (Fig.1b and c, lanes 1–3). During chromatin assembly, we observed the presence of substantial amounts of both exogenous and endogenous HMG-D at early times (Fig. 1b,lanes 4–9). However, as chromatin reconstitution proceeded, the amounts of associated HMG-D decreased correspondingly; after 120 min both endogenous and exogenous HMG-D were less than 25% of the initial values. By 300 min the amounts of recombinant and endogenous HMG-D were, again, low but detectable. The antibody also cross-reacted with two additional, unknown proteins migrating at ∼25 and ∼32 kDa eluting at higher salt, which, like HMG-D, were abundant during the early phases of chromatin assembly but were substantially reduced or undetectable at 300 min. The exogenous HMG-D is more tightly associated with chromatin. We conclude that both the endogenous and exogenous HMG-D were associated with DNA, but the bulk of the proteins were displaced gradually as chromatin matures. A situation similar to this has been observed in vivo; embryos undergoing rapid nuclear division in the syncytial blastoderm embryo contained much more HMG-D than embryos in later stages of development (37Ner S.S. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A number of observations suggest that HMGB1 can act as a linker protein analogous to H1 (8Jackson J.B. Pollock J.M. Rill R.L. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3739-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The incorporation of histone H1 into reconstituted chromatin can be visualized conveniently by the associated increase in the NRL (defining the nucleosome spacing) (36Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 43Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). So far histone H1 is the only protein known to increase the NRL, presumably because of its interactions with the internucleosomal linker DNA. To test whether HMG-D would also affect the NRL as expected for a linker protein, we analyzed the NRL of HMG-D containing chromatin using the classical micrococcal nuclease assay. Blank and Becker (43Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the NRL of reconstituted chromatin is strongly affected by the cation concentrations during reconstitution. At low salt the NRL is 155–165 bp, whereas moderate increases in cation concentrations result in NRLs of 185 bp and above. The addition of recombinant HMG-D to the chromatin assembly reaction at low salt conditions results in an increase in NRL from 160–165 to 180–185 bp, but further addition of protein does not result in further increases (Fig. 2a). By contrast, if histone H1 is incorporated into chromatin under similar conditions, the NRL may be increased to well beyond 200 bp (43Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We suggest that the change in NRL results from the binding of HMG-D to the linker sequence, in analogy to but clearly distinct from histone H1. We also tested truncated HMG-D proteins and HMG-Z, a zygotic protein closely related to HMG-D (44Ner S.S. Churchill M.E. Searles M.A. Travers A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4369-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in this assay. Full-length HMG-Z functioned like HMG-D, with similar changes in NRL observed upon addition of similar protein amounts (Fig. 2a). A change in NRL was also observed with a C-terminal truncation of HMG-D lacking the acidic residues (HMG-D100). HMG-D100 contained the DNA binding motif and an alanine-lysine-rich region homologous to a region in histone H1. HMG-D74, lacking the acidic tail and the alanine-lysine rich region, failed to alter the spacing (data not shown). This truncated protein still contained the DNA-binding motif but bound DNA much less efficiently than the full-length protein (23Churchill M.E. Jones D.N. Glaser T. Hefner H. Searles M.A. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,45Churchill M.E. Changela A. Dow L.K. AJ K. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 99-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46Payet D. Travers A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that the acidic residues are not required for altering the spacing but that the alanine-lysine rich region is involved in binding to chromatin and in the process alters the NRL. In the absence of exogenous HMG-D the NRL is 160–165 bp, yet the extract contains high levels of endogenous HMG-D. Why, then, does the endogenous protein not cause a change in the NRL? To address this issue we purified HMG-D from embryo extracts (Fig. 2b) and added it into a chromatin assembly reaction. However, we did not observe any change in the NRL (data not shown). HMG-D isolated from early embryo extracts ran differently from the recombinant protein (Fig.2b), suggesting that the endogenous protein is extensively modified, as also inferred by Renner et al. (47Renner U. Ghidelli S. Schafer M.A. Wisniewski J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1475: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Different fractions from the Mono S column were heterogeneous, suggesting the presence of isoforms (Fig. 2b, lanes 1 and2). By electron spray mass spectrometry we have shown that all the endogenous protein was modified by acetylation and that a large proportion of the endogenous protein was also phosphorylated at a single site (Fig. 2c). The affinity of the endogenous protein for DNA is similar to that of the isolated HMG domain (data not shown), suggesting that the modifications may antagonize the function of the basic domain required for efficient nucleosome spacing. Although exogenous HMG-D increased the NRL, arguing for a stoichiometric interaction with nucleosomes, only relatively low protein levels were found to associate in a stable manner with purified chromatin. The association with chromatin may, therefore, be transient and dynamic in the presence of the crude embryonic extract. We next tested whether HMG-D was able to bind chromatin in the absence of the assembly system. Chromatin was reconstituted for 5 h on immobilized DNA and isolated on a magnet. Under these conditions little to no endogenous HMG-D was associated with the chromatin. We then incubated the chromatin with recombinant HMG-D. To facilitate the analysis of the chromatin-associated HMG-D, we “spiked” the HMG-D with a small amount of marked protein that had been radiolabeled with protein kinase C and [γ-32P]ATP. Half of this reaction was analyzed with a micrococcal nuclease digest and yielded a regular nucleosomal ladder having the shorter spacing characteristic of linear chromatin (48Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The other half was subjected to sequential washes with increasing salt concentrations that allowed us to test the affinity of bound HMG-D to chromatin. Fig.3b shows that HMG-D associated with chromatin could be eluted with 80 and 160 mm KCl in the wash buffer. Under these conditions relatively high levels of HMG-D can be incorporated on to the chromatin, such that it can be detected by silver staining of the protein gels (Fig. 3c). We estimate that ∼0.5–1 molecules of HMG-D/histone octamer can associate with bead chromatin. In a manner analogous to HMG-D, we also were able to i"

Intracellularly, sucrose-6-phosphate (sucrose-6-P) is hydrolyzed by sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase (8Kunst F. Pascal M. Lepesant J-A. Walle J. Dedonder R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Thompson J. Nguygen N.Y. Sackett D.L. Donkersloot J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14573-14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to glucose-6-phosphate and fructose, which are then fermented via the glycolytic pathway to yield primarily lactic acid. The structures of sucrose, its five isomeric α-d-glucosyl-d-fructoses (trivially designated trehalulose, turanose, maltulose, leucrose, and palatinose), and some related α-linked disaccharides are depicted in Fig. 1. In contrast to the many reports of sucrose fermentation, there are few references to the utilization of the isomeric glucosyl-fructoses by microorganisms (12Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This fact is of particular relevance to oral biology in light of the associative role(s) of sucrose and streptococcal species in the etiology of dental caries (13Loesche W.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 353-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Newbrun E. Newbrun E. Cariology. Quintessence Publications Inc., Chicago1989Google Scholar). Sucrose is the precursor for glucan synthesis that facilitates attachment of S. mutans to the tooth surface; subsequent fermentation of the disaccharide to lactic acid initiates the demineralization of tooth enamel. In this context, isomers of sucrose attract attention as potential substitutes for dietary sucrose (15Takazoe I. Frostell G. Ohta K. Topitsoglou V. Sasaki N. Swed. Dent. J. 1985; 9: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ooshima T. Izumitani A. Takei T. Fujiwara T. Sobue S. Caries Res. 1990; 24: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Moynihan P.J. J. Dentistry. 1998; 26: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) because they are about half as sweet as sucrose, are not metabolized (noncariogenic), and, in the case of palatinose and leucrose, are produced on an industrial scale (18Schiweck H. Munir M. Rapp K.M. Schneider B. Vogel M. Zuckerindustrie (Berlin). 1990; 115: 555-565Google Scholar, 19Schwengers D. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydrates As Organic Raw Materials. VCH Publishers, New York1991: 183-195Google Scholar). From the limited information available, one might reasonably conclude that the isomers cannot be translocated by the membrane-localized transporter EII(CB) of the sucrose-PTS or that intracellular sucrose-6-P hydrolase is unable to hydrolyze the phosphorylated PTS products. Our interest in these issues stemmed from a survey of disaccharide utilization by K. pneumoniae that revealed excellent (and unexpected) growth of this organism on all five isomers of sucrose (12Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although organisms grown previously on a particular isomer readily metabolized sucrose and all other isomers, cells ofK. pneumoniae grown previously on sucrose fermented only sucrose (12Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Comparative analyses of proteins in various cell extracts (by two-dimensional PAGE) revealed high level expression of a specific polypeptide (molecular mass ∼ 50 kDa) during growth on the isomers, but this protein was not induced by growth of the organism on sucrose. These observations provided the first indication that forK. pneumoniae, the initial steps in metabolism of sucrose, and those of its analogs, might be separable and distinct. In the present study we have identified two adjacent genes (aglA and aglB) in K. pneumoniae that encode a membrane-localized transport protein of the PTS (EIICB, or AglA) and a nucleotide (NAD+) plus metal-dependent phospho-α-glucosidase (AglB), respectively. Together, these proteins facilitate the phosphorylative translocation and subsequent hydrolysis of the five α-linked isomers of sucrose. To facilitate the comparison of the properties of sucrose-6-P hydrolase with those of AglB, the genes encoding the two proteins (scrB (7Titgemeyer F. Jahreis K. Ebner R. Lengeler J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar) and aglB, respectively) have been cloned, and both enzymes have been purified from high expression systems. Recently, we prepared trehalulose-6′-P, turanose-6′-P, maltulose-6′-P, leucrose-6′-P, and palatinose-6′-P in substrate quantity (12Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the availability of these novel compounds permitted the determination of the substrate specificities of highly purified AglB and sucrose-6-P hydrolase. Remarkably, sucrose-6-P hydrolase, which by sequence-based alignment is assigned to Family 32 of glycosyl hydrolases, hydrolyzed only sucrose-6-P. In contrast AglB, which belongs to Family 4, catalyzed the cleavage of the five isomeric 6′-phosphoglucosyl-fructoses. In this paper, a comparative assessment of conformational, overall shape and polarity features of sucrose-6-P and its isomeric disaccharide-6′-phosphates is given, providing insight into the molecular basis for substrate discrimination by the two phosphoglucosyl hydrolases. Carbohydrates were obtained from the following sources: trehalulose from Südzucker, Mannheim/Ochsenfurt, Germany; maltulose and isomaltose from TCI America; leucrose from Fluka; and palatinose from Wako Chemicals. Sucrose, turanose, and other high purity sugars were purchased from Pfanstiehl Laboratories. Maltitol, NADP+, trehalose-6-P,p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside (pNPαGlc), and PEP were obtained from Sigma. Phosphorylated derivatives trehalulose-6′-P, sucrose-6-P; turanose-6′-P, maltulose-6′-P, leucrose-6′-P; palatinose-6′-P, maltose-6′-P, isomaltose-6′-P, and maltitol-6-P were prepared in this laboratory by PEP:PTS activity in permeabilized (palatinose-grown) cells of K. pneumoniae(12Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrate pNPαGlc6P was prepared by selective phosphorylation of pNPαGlc with phosphorus oxychloride in trimethyl phosphate containing small proportions of water (20Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/hexokinase (EC 1.1.1.49; EC 2.7.1.1), and phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Ultrogel AcA-44 and TrisAcryl M-DEAE were from Sepracor. The organism was grown at 37 °C in 1-liter bottles, each containing 800 ml of the medium defined by Sapico et al. (21Sapico V. Hanson T.E. Walter R.W. Anderson R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 51-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) of the appropriate sugar. After growth to stationary phase, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C) and washed twice in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MgCl2. The yield was ∼2 g wet weight of cells/liter. SDS-PAGE was carried out in the Novex XCell Mini-Cell system (Invitrogen). Novex NuPage (4–12%) Bis-Tris gels and MES-SDS running buffer (pH 7.3) were used together with Novex Mark 12TM protein standards, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using NuPage transfer buffer and SeeBlueTM prestained standards. TheAmersham Pharmacia Biotech Multiphor flat-bed electrophoresis unit, precast Ampholine PAG plates (pH range, 3.5–9.5) and broad range standards were used for electrofocusing experiments. During purification, the activity of AglB in column fractions was detected by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, pNPαGlc6P. The specific activity of the enzyme was determined in a discontinuous assay that contained in 2-ml: 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm NAD+, and 1 mm pNPαGlc6P. After the addition of the enzyme preparation, samples of 0.25 ml were removed at 20-s intervals (over a 2-min period) and immediately injected into 0.75 ml of 0.5m Na2CO3. TheA400 nm of the yellow solution was measured, and rates of pNP formation were calculated by assuming a molar extinction for the p-nitrophenoxide anion ε =18,300m−1 cm−1. One unit of AglB activity is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of pNP min−1. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and protein microsequencing were carried out by Kendrick Laboratories, Inc. and by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Columbia University, NY, respectively. The mass of AglB was determined by electrospray in an HP1100 mass spectrometer, and the sequence of N-terminal amino acids was determined with an ABI 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) with an on-line ABI 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The procedure for immunodetection of AglB with polyclonal antibody to MalH from F. mortiferumhas been described previously (20Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, using the unfinished genome sequence of K. pneumoniae (Washington University Genome Sequencing Center, St. Louis, MO) and our own sequence data later, five primer sets were designed to amplify, clone, and characterize the DNA fragment encoding genes aglA andaglB of K. pneumoniae ATCC 23357. The five primer sets were constructed as follows: KP1F-KP1R, 5′-GCCAGTTTTTTCTCTCCTGGTAGC-3′ and 5′-GCATATTACGAAAGACGGYCCAGC-3′; KP2F-KP2R, 5′-CCCTACGAGTTGTTACATGAGGATTTC-3′ and 5′-CCCCCAATGACCACAAACG-3′; KP3F-KP3R, 5′-GGCTGGACCGTCTTTCGTAATATG-3′ and 5′-TTCGAGTTACCGTGCAGGGCAAAG-3′; KP4F-KP4R, 5′-CGCTTGGGTGTGGGTTACAC-3′ and 5′-GCCGTGGTTTTACCTCGTGC-3′; KP5F-KP5R, 5′-CCCTGATCCTGCGTCTGAACC-3′ and 5′-GTTAGCCAGCGAA AAGCGG-3′. The components of the amplification mixtures (100 μl) were: 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 1× buffer provided by the manufacturer, 20 mm each of the four DNTPs, 100 ng of DNA, and 250 ng of each primer. Amplifications were carried out in a thermal cycler (PerkinElmer 9600, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After an initial 2-min denaturation at 95 °C, the mixtures were subjected to 30 cycles of amplification. Each cycle consisted of 1 min denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min annealing at 58 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min/kilobase of insert. These were followed by a 10-min runoff at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen) and ligated into pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After transformation into E. coli TOP 10 competent cells, colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. For amplification of the gene aglB, two primers were synthesized from the nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. 4: forward primer KPBF, 5′-CCCACCATGGGAGGCAGTATCATG-3′ (theaglB sequence, base pairs 2001–2015, is in bold face, and the NcoI site is underlined); reverse primer KPBR, 5′-CCCAGAATTCTTAATGCAGCTCAGG-3′ (the sequence complementary to the downstream region of aglB, base pairs 3321–3335, is in bold face, and the EcoRI site is underlined). PCR amplification was performed using high fidelityPfu DNA polymerase. The amplified 1.3-kilobase DNA fragment was digested with restriction endonucleases (NcoI andEcoRI), electrophoresed through 1% agarose gel, and purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit). The fragment was ligated into the similarly digested (NcoI-EcoRI) high expression vector pSE380 (Invitrogen) to form pAP-16. (In this construct, the aglB gene is under control of the powerfultrc hybrid promoter, which is also regulated by thelacO operator and the product of thelacIq gene. Because the plasmid also carrieslacI, expression of aglB is strongly repressed in the absence but is fully induced in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)). Plasmid pAP-16 was transformed into competent cells of E. coli TOP 10 (Invitrogen), and transformants were selected on LB agar containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. DNA fragments cloned in pCR-Blunt vector were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the Sequenase 7-deaza-dGTP sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH), and [α-35S]deoxyadenosine triphosphate was used for labeling. For all clones, both strands of DNA inserts were sequenced. The MacVector sequence analysis package (Version 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) was used to compile, edit, and analyze the results. E. coli TOP 10 (pAP-16) was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (150 μg/ml) to a densityA600 nm ∼ 0.4 units. IPTG (0.5 mm) was then added to the culture, and growth was continued for 3 h. The culture was harvested by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C), and the cells (∼ 2.1 g wet weight/liter) were washed by resuspension and centrifugation from 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmMnCl2 and 0.1 mm NAD+ (designated TMN buffer). Washed cells (∼38 g) were resuspended in 80 ml of TMN buffer, and the organisms were disrupted (at 0 °C) by 2 × 1.5-min periods of sonic oscillation in a Branson instrument (model 350) operating at ∼75% of maximum power. The extract was clarified by centrifugation (180,000 × g for 2 h at 5 °C), and the high-speed supernatant was transferred to sacs and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of TMN buffer. The enzyme was purified by low pressure chromatography, and all procedures were performed in a cold room. Dialyzed high-speed supernatant (∼85 ml) was transferred at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min to a column of TrisAcryl M-DEAE (2.6 × 14 cm) previously equilibrated with TMN buffer. Nonadsorbed material was removed by washing with TMN buffer, and AglB was eluted with 800 ml of a linear, increasing concentration gradient of NaCl (0–0.3 m) in TMN buffer. Fractions (8 ml) were collected, and AglB activity was revealed by the intense yellow color formed upon addition of fraction samples (4 μl) to microtiter wells containing 100 μl of pNPαGlc6P assay solution. Fractions with the highest activity (22Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1973; 29: 790-797Crossref Google Scholar) were pooled and concentrated to 19 ml by pressure filtration (Amicon PM-10 membrane, 40 psi). Ammonium sulfate crystals (1.9 g) were added slowly with stirring to a concentration of 0.75 m. The ∼ 20 ml solution from step 1 was transferred (flow rate 0.5 ml/min) to a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (2.6 × 14 cm) equilibrated with TMN buffer containing 0.75m (NH4)2SO4. Nonadsorbed protein(s) were eluted, and then 500 ml of a decreasing, linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4(0.3–0 m) in TMN buffer was passed through the column. Fractions of 5 ml were collected, and AglB was recovered primarily in fractions 45–60. These fractions were pooled and concentrated by Amicon filtration to ∼9 ml. Approximately 3 ml of preparation from step 2 was applied at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min to a column of Ultrogel AcA-44 (1.6 × 94 cm) previously equilibrated with TMN buffer containing 0. 1 m NaCl. Fractions of 2.1 ml were collected, and those containing maximum AglB activity (50Lichtenthaler F.W. Immel S. Kreis U. Starch/Stärke. 1991; 43: 121-132Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 51Lichtenthaler F.W. Immel S. Int. Sugar J. 1995; 97: 12-22Google Scholar, 52Immel, S., and Lichtenthaler, F. W.

(This procedure was repeated with the remaining 2 × ∼3-ml portions of concentrate from phenyl-Sepharose chromatography). AcA-44 chromatography yielded a total of ∼24 ml of highly purified AglB (3 mg/ml; specific activity 4.15 units/mg). A continuous spectrophotometric assay was used for substrate specificity studies and determination of kinetic parameters for AglB. This indirect glucose-6-P dehydrogenase/NADP+-coupled assay monitors formation of glucose-6-P during the AglB-catalyzed hydrolysis of substrates. The standard 1-ml assay contained: 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mmNADP+, 1 mm substrate (6′-P isomer of sucrose, or phospho-α-glucoside), and 2 units of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase/hexokinase. Reactions were initiated by addition of 15 μl (45 μg) of AglB preparation, and the increase inA340 nm was recorded in a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. Initial rates were determined using the kinetics program of the instrument, and a molar extinction coefficient ε = 6, 220 m−1 cm−1 was assumed for calculation of NADPH formed (equivalent to glucose-6-P liberated). In kinetic analyses the concentration range of substrate was usually 0.2–4 mm, and kinetic parameters were determined from Hofstee plots with an Enzyme Kinetics program (dogStar software, Version 1.0c). The products of turanose-6′-P hydrolysis (glucose-6-P and fructose) were determined by inclusion of 5 mm ATP and 2 units of phosphoglucose isomerase in the assay. The scrB gene was amplified from K. pneumoniae genomic DNA using the low-error-rate FailSafeTM polymerase (Epicentre). In the forward primer (5′-GGCCATGGCGCTCTCTCTGACGCTGAA-3′), base pairs 3119–3137 of the K. pneumoniae scrYAB operon (GenBankTM accession number X57401) are bolded, and theNcoI site is underlined. In the reverse primer (5′-GGGGGTCGACTACGCGTTTGGTTTTCATCA-3′), base pairs 4587–4606 of scrYAB are bolded, and theSalI site is underlined. The amplicon was digested withNcoI and SalI and ligated into similarly digested pProEX Hta (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the recombinant plasmid(s) was transformed into E. coli K12 strain DH5α-E (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ampicillin-resistant transformants were selected, and the scrB genes of four plasmids containing inserts of approximately the correct size were sequenced. All shared the following differences from the published (7Titgemeyer F. Jahreis K. Ebner R. Lengeler J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar) scrB coding sequence: 991C→T, 1006G→T, 1249C→T, 1270C→T, 1549C→T, 1552A→G, 1675G→A, 1699T→C, 1738G→A (numbering as in pScrBLong). All of these differences are silent, and one plasmid was chosen and designated pScrBLong. The organism was grown in LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. At A600 nm = 0.5, IPTG was added (1 mm) and growth was continued for ∼ 4 h. Cells were harvested and washed with 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) as described earlier. The yield was ∼2.9 g wet weight of cells/liter. Briefly, the purification of sucrose-6-P hydrolase was as follows. A high-speed supernatant was prepared, after resuspension and sonication, of 10 g of E. coli DH5αE (pScrBLong) resuspended with 20 ml of 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The dialyzed preparation was applied to a column of TrisAcryl M-DEAE, and after washing with the same buffer, sucrose-6-P hydrolase was eluted with an increasing gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m). Fractions with sucrose-6-P hydrolase activity were pooled, concentrated to 8 ml, and then mixed gently with 30 ml of 0.1 m MES buffer (pH 5). Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation, and the clarified solution was applied to a column of phosphocellulose P-11 (Whatman) previously equilibrated with 0.1 m MES buffer (pH 5). Nonadsorbed proteins were removed, and sucrose-6-P hydrolase was eluted with the same buffer containing an increasing concentration of potassium phosphate buffer (0–0.1 m, pH 7). Active fractions (eluted at ∼ 50 mm Pi) were pooled and concentrated. sucrose-6-P hydrolase was purified to homogeneity by passage of this solution through an AcA-44 gel filtration column previously equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl. Concentration of active fractions yielded about 22 mg of sucrose-6-P hydrolase of specific activity 12.5 units/mg (with 10 mm sucrose as substrate in the assay; see below). Sucrose-6-P is the natural substrate for sucrose-6-P hydrolase, but the enzyme also hydrolyzes sucrose when the disaccharide is present at high concentration. Because of the limited availability of sucrose-6-P, the parent sugar was used as substrate during purification of sucrose-6-P hydrolase, and the glucose-6-P dehydrogenase/hexokinase-NADP+-coupled assay measured glucose formed by sucrose hydrolysis. The 1-ml assay contained: 0.1m HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NADP+, 1 mmATP, 10 mm sucrose, 2 units of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase/hexokinase, and enzyme solution. One unit of sucrose-6-P hydrolase activity is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of glucose/min. A conformational analysis of all disaccharides and their 6′-phosphates was carried out using a molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, i.e. CHARMM (22Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2027535477,"Protein kinase C (PKC) θ, a Ca2+-independent isoform of PKC, has been known to be expressed in skeletal muscle and T cells. In the present study, we isolated and characterized a smaller transcript expressed in the mouse testis, the cDNA of which is referred hereafter as PKCθII and the original PKCθ as PKCθI. The cDNA clone of PKCθII has 2184 base pairs and 464 amino acids in the possible open reading frame, consisting of the 5′ unique sequence of 20 amino acids and the PKCθI sequence of 444 amino acids. Genomic DNA analysis revealed that transcription of PKCθII is initiated from the PKCθII-specific exon, which is located between exons 7 and 8 of the PKCθ gene, indicating that alternative splicing is the mechanism by which PKCθII is generated. PKCθII is expressed exclusively in the testis in an age-dependent manner with sexual maturation. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of microdissected tissues clearly demonstrated that PKCθII is expressed in the seminiferous tubules of the mouse testis. Consistent with its molecular structure lacking the C1 regulatory domain, PKCθII is constitutively active as determined by an in vitro kinase assay, being independent of PKC activators,e.g. phosphatidylserine and phorbol ester. PKCθII may play a crucial role in spermatogenesis or some related function of the testis. Protein kinase C (PKC) θ, a Ca2+-independent isoform of PKC, has been known to be expressed in skeletal muscle and T cells. In the present study, we isolated and characterized a smaller transcript expressed in the mouse testis, the cDNA of which is referred hereafter as PKCθII and the original PKCθ as PKCθI. The cDNA clone of PKCθII has 2184 base pairs and 464 amino acids in the possible open reading frame, consisting of the 5′ unique sequence of 20 amino acids and the PKCθI sequence of 444 amino acids. Genomic DNA analysis revealed that transcription of PKCθII is initiated from the PKCθII-specific exon, which is located between exons 7 and 8 of the PKCθ gene, indicating that alternative splicing is the mechanism by which PKCθII is generated. PKCθII is expressed exclusively in the testis in an age-dependent manner with sexual maturation. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of microdissected tissues clearly demonstrated that PKCθII is expressed in the seminiferous tubules of the mouse testis.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar). Members of the PKC family are divided into three groups based on their molecular structures and activating mechanisms: conventional PKC (α, β, and γ isoforms) requiring calcium, phosphatidylserine (PS), and diacylglycerol (DG) for activation; novel PKC (δ, ε, η, and θ isoforms) activated independent of calcium; and atypical PKC (ζ and λ/ι isoforms), which are independent of both calcium and DG. Alternative splicing-derived variants of PKC were reported for the β and δ isoforms, i.e. PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCδII, and PKCδIII (2Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K.

Unlike PKCη, PKCθ was found to be expressed in muscle cells, suggesting the possibility that it is derived from the muscle layer incidentally present in the skin preparation. Besides muscle cells, PKCθ is known to play an important role in T cells; it is colocalized in the T cell receptor and CD3 complex at the contact region between antigen-specific T cells and antigen-presenting cells (10Monks C.R.

Expression of a small-size PKCθ mRNA in the testis was reported by Mischak et al. (18Mischak H. Goodnight J. Henderson D.W. Osada S. Ohno S. Mushinski J.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We also noted the presence of a small-size transcript of PKCθ in the testis. 2Y. S. Niino, T. Irie, M. Takaishi, T. Hosono, N.-h. Huh, T. Tachikawa, and T. Kuroki, unpublished data. However, this small-sized PKCθ has not been characterized yet. In the present study, we report on PKCθII, a new PKC isoform derived by alternative splicing of the PKCθ gene, which lacks the V1 domain and a zing finger motif in the C1 regulatory domain and is expressed exclusively in the seminiferous tubules of the mouse testis. The mouse testis cDNA library prepared from the CD-1 mouse testis (Stratagene, CA) was screened by a standard protocol (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using PCR products of the V3 region (875–1289 bp) of PKCθI as a probe (probe A in Fig.3A). A pair of the primers 1/2 used is shown below in TableI.

PCR products were subcloned into pBluescriptII(−) and sequenced with the ALFexpress system. The Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN) Blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized with random-prime-labeled cDNA probes: these were probe A, mentioned above for PKCqI/qII, 50–250 bp of PKCθII (probe B in Fig.3A) for PKCθII, and 118–577 bp of PKCθI (probe C in Fig. 3A) for PKCθI. The filters were exposed overnight for 3 nights (PKCθI/θII and PKCθII) or for 7 nights (PKCθI) consecutively. Genomic DNA of an 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mouse was prepared from the tail by a method described previously (20Ausubel, F. M. B. R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Vol. 1, unit 2.2, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MAGoogle Scholar) and subjected to genomic PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Pairs of the primers 3/5, 4/5, and 6/7 were used for amplification of exon 2/θII exon, exon 4/θII exon, and θII exon/exon 8, respectively (Table I). PCR products were subcloned into pBluescriptII(−) and sequenced by Nippon Flour Mills Co., Ltd. Total RNA of the testis from 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 8- and 26-week-old mice was purified with a QuickPrep Total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScriptII (Life Technologies, Inc.) and amplified in AmpliTaq Gold under the following PCR conditions: 5 min at 95 °C, 25 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. Pairs of primers 8/10 and 9/10 were used for PKCθI and PKCθII, respectively. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% NuSieve 3:1 agarose gel and visualized with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, OR). cDNA concentrations were normalized to the G3PDH content. The cDNAs for in situhybridization were prepared by PCR using a pair of primers 11/12 for PKCθI and 13/14 for PKCθII. The PCR products were digested withBglII and KpnI and cloned into pLITMUS 28 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were transcribed from a plasmid containing PKCθI or PKCθII cDNA linearized by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro. The testis of the 6-month-old mice (ICR) was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in the Tissue Tek O. C. T. compound (VWR Scientific, San Francisco, CA) and frozen-sectioned. Sections were treated with proteinase K (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min and refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. They were hybridized in a hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, pH 4.5, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 2.5 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe) at 50 °C overnight. The hybridized RNA was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) according to the procedure described by Wilkinson (21Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York, NY1992: 75-83Google Scholar). The testis of 2- and 4-week-old mice was rapidly embedded in the Tissue Tec OCT medium and frozen-sectioned at 8-μm thickness. Frozen sections were fixed in 100% methanol for 3 min and then stained with toluidine blue. Once air-dried, the sections were laser-microdissected with a CRI-337 (Cell Robotics, Inc., Albuquerque, NM) (22Emmert-Buck M.R. Bonner R.F. Smith P.D. Chuaqui R.F. Zhuang Z. Goldstein S.R. Weiss R.A. Liotta L.A. Science. 1996; 274: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Approximately 20–200 cells were laser-transferred from the seminiferous tubules and the interstitium. Contamination with nontarget components was monitored morphologically. Total RNA was extracted from laser-transferred cells according to a modified RNA microisolation protocol described by Emmert-Buck et al. (22Emmert-Buck M.R. Bonner R.F. Smith P.D. Chuaqui R.F. Zhuang Z. Goldstein S.R. Weiss R.A. Liotta L.A. Science. 1996; 274: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing with 70% ethanol, the pellets were resuspended in 9 μl of RNase-free H2O. Total RNA from microdissected tissues was reverse-transcribed in the reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.4, 75 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.01 mdithiothreitol, 2 mm dNTP, 25 μmoligo(dT)20, 25 ng/μl random hexamer oligonucleotides, and avian RNase H-minus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 60 min at 50 °C. The resulting cDNAs were amplified in 25 μl of PCR mix consisting of GeneAmp 1× PCR Gold Buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, and 0.125 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under the following conditions: 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. Pairs of the primers used were primers 8/10 for PKCθI, 9/10 for PKCθII, 15/16 for β-actin, 17/18 for protamine-1, and 19/20 for selenoprotein-P. FLAG-tagged expression plasmids of PKCθI and -θII were constructed with pFLAG-CMV5 (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The stop codon was removed from cDNAs of PKCθI and PKCθII, and the EcoRV site was introduced by PCR. Both cDNAs were subcloned into theEcoRV site of pFLAG-CMV5. The cDNAs were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) into HEK293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for immunoprecipitation. Full-length cDNAs of PKCθI and -θII were cloned into pEF-BOS expression plasmid (23Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) and transfected into COS7 cells, which were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Transfected COS7 cells as well as testis from 26-week-old mouse (50 mg each) were sonicated in homogenizing buffer, and aliquots of each samples were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PKCθ antibody against the C-terminal peptide for PKCθI/II (nPKCθ (C-18), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Transfected HEK293 cells were sonicated in a homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The supernatants obtained by centrifugation at 21,000 × gfor 10 min were incubated with Protein G-Sepharose beads harboring the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), followed by washing with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) three times, buffer B (the same as buffer A without EGTA) once, and buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) once. An aliquot of the immunoprecipitated beads was separated using 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Transferred products on membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the anti-PKCθ antibody, followed by immunodetection using Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression at the protein level was monitored by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Kinase activity of pFLAG-PKCθI and -PKCθII was assayed in vitro using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as a substrate. Immunoprecipitated proteins were normalized by immunoblotting and incubated in 50 μl of the reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) in the presence or absence of the PKC activators,e.g. 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mmEGTA, 50 μg/ml PS, and 100 ng/ml TPA at 25 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Following a brief centrifugation, 20-μl aliquots of supernatants were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and after drying, the gels were exposed to an x-ray film. As shown in Fig.1, Northern blot analysis of PKCθ in mouse tissues demonstrated the existence of at least four transcripts corresponding to bands of 3.5-, 3.0-, 2.5-, and 1.2-kb mRNA when a DNA fragment of the V3 region was used as a probe (probe A in Fig.3A). The two large transcripts (3.5 and 3.0 kb) were detected in all the tissues examined except for the testis, whereas the testis expressed smaller transcripts of 2.5 and 1.2 kb. To identify the transcript of 2.5 kb, we screened a mouse testis cDNA library with probe A and isolated two independent clones containing the entire coding region. Throughout this paper, the 2.5-kb transcript is referred to as PKCθII and the original PKCθ as PKCθI. The transcript of 1.2 kb remains to be identified. The cDNA clone of PKCθII has 2184 bp, to which 18 nucleotides were added by 5′-RACE of mouse testis mRNA. As shown in Fig.2, PKCθII cDNA consists of a unique sequence of 276 bp at the 5′-end and a sequence identical to PKCθII at the 3′-end, of which the boundary is located at 879 bp of the PKCθI cDNA (GenBank™ accession number D11091). The deduced amino acid sequence of PKCθII contains four methionines, as a candidate of the starting amino acid for translation, although none of them conform to the Kozak consensus sequence (Fig. 2). Hereafter, we adopted the first methionine as a starting site because of the presence of an in-frame termination codon upstream. A possible open reading frame initiated from the first ATG codes 464 amino acid, consisting of the 5′ unique sequence of 20 amino acids and the PKCθI sequence of 444 amino acids (Fig. 2). The latter sequence contains a part of the C1 regulatory domain lacking the zinc finger motif, the V3 domain, the C3/V4/C4 catalytic domain, and the C-terminal V5 domain. The N-terminal 20-amino acid sequence does not show significant homology to any sequence in the existing cDNA data base. The structure of the PKCθII cDNA is compared with that of PKCθI in Fig. 3A. Northern blot analysis showed that the unique sequence of PKCθII (probe B in Fig.3A) hybridized only the smaller PKCθII transcripts expressed in the testis (Fig. 1B), whereas a probe of the 5′-end of PKCθI (probe C in Fig. 3A) hybridized mRNA of PKCθI expressed in the heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig. 1C). A common probe for PKCθI and PKCθII (probe A) hybridized both PKCθI and PKCθII (Fig.1A). In addition, we found that PKCθII was not expressed in the ovary (data not shown). These results indicate that PKCθII is specifically transcribed in the testis whereas PKCθI is expressed ubiquitously except in the testis. The above sequencing data suggest that the 2.5-kb transcript detected in the testis could be derived from alternative splicing of the PKCθ gene (Pkcq). The Pkc q was mapped to chromosome 10p15 in human (24Kofler K. Kochl S. Parson W. Erdel M. Utermann G. Baier G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and chromosome 2 in mice (25Blanco G. Brown S.D. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Its genomic structure in human was reported (GenBank™ accession number AL158043). PCR analysis of the mouse genomic DNA indicated that the sizes of PCR products from the PKCθII-specific domain to exons 2, 4, and 8 were 20, 5.5, and 2.3 kb, respectively. Exons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were found to be well conserved in mouse and human genomes. Based on these results, we located the PKCθII-specific exon composed of 276 nucleotides (hereafter, the θII exon) between exons 7 and 8 (Fig. 3B). Exon θII can be accepted into exon 8, because sequences at the exon-intron boundaries fit with the donor-acceptor splicing rule. However, no splicing acceptor sequence was found around the 5′-boundary of the θII exon, suggesting that the θII exon is the first exon of PKCθII cDNA. Fig. 3B summarizes the generation of PKCθI and PKCθII cDNAs from the PKCθ gene by alternative usage of exons: The V1 and C1 domains of PKCθI cDNA are generated from exons 1–8, whereas the PKCθII unique sequence is derived from the θII exon. A testis-specific promoter may be located upstream of the θII exon. This genomic structure indicates that alternative splicing is the mechanism by which PKCθII is generated. In the testis, spermatogenesis and androgen production proceed in an age-dependent manner, becoming mature at about 4 weeks after birth. Age-dependent expression of PKCθII was analyzed by RT-PCR using total testis RNA isolated from newborn, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 8-, and 26-week-old mice. Expression levels were normalized to GAPDH, and developmental stages were monitored based on the expression of c-Kit, protamine-1, and acrosin (data not shown). When the primers for PKCθII-specific sequences were used, expression of PKCθII was first detected at 3 weeks and increased thereafter with age until adulthood (Fig. 4). In contrast, PKCθI was not expressed in the testis at any age when amplified using the PKCθI-specific primers. This observation suggests that PKCθII is involved in the maturation of a cell function(s) in the testis, e.g. spermatogenesis and/or androgen production, and responsiveness. PKCθI and PKCθII were expressed at the protein level in the mouse testis and in the cells overexpressing these cDNAs. In Fig. 5A, total proteins of the testis from 26-week-old mouse as well as from COS7 cells transfected with PKCθI and PKCθII cDNAs were subjected to immunoblotting with the antibody against to the common C-terminal peptide for PKCθI and PKCθII. A band corresponding to the molecular mass of PKCθII (50 kDa) was detected in the testis and PKCθII-transfected cells, whereas a band corresponding to PKCθI (80 kDa) was seen only in the PKCθI-expressing cells. Expression at the protein level was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting of HEK293 cells transfected with pFLAG-PKCθI and -PKCθII (Fig. 5B). The transfected HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting with the PKCθI/PKCθII antibody. Again, products of PKCθI and PKCθII were detected in the cells transfected with the corresponding cDNAs. The testis is composed of two important functional components: the seminiferous tubules producing male germ cells and the interstitium producing androgen. To localize the expression of PKCθII in the testis, we performed in situ hybridization and RT-PCR of laser-microdissected tissues. As shown in Fig. 6, mRNA transcribed by the θII exon was detected by in situ hybridization exclusively in the seminiferous tubules, not in the interstitial cells. A negative control with a sense probe did not show any signal. Furthermore, PKCθI was found not to be expressed in the testis when the PKCθI-specific sequence was used as a probe (data not shown). It is not certain from in situ hybridization whether Sertoli cells expressed PKCθII, although a Sertoli cell-derived cell line, TM-4, did not express it (data not shown). These specific features of PKCθII expression were further confirmed by RT-PCR of the microdissected seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells from 2- and 4-week-old mice (Fig.7). The expression of PKCθII was monitored based on β-actin mRNA, and cell type specificities were examined morphologically as well as expression of protamine-1 and selenoprotein-1 in the seminiferous tubules and interstitium, respectively (26Koga M. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Tsuchida J. Uchida K. Kitamura M. Sakoda S. Matsumiya K. Okuyama A. Nishimune Y. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Hecht N.B. Bower P.A. Waters S.H. Yelick P.C. Distel R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7B, PKCθII was expressed in the seminiferous tubules of 4-week-old mice, but not in those of 2-week-old mice, whereas no expression was observed in the interstitium. PKCθI was not detected in any testis component at 2 or 4 weeks. These data clearly indicate the exclusive expression of PKCθII in seminiferous tubules in an age-dependent manner. The lack of the complete C1 regulatory domain in PKCθII suggests the possible independence of PS and DG or phorbol esters for its activation. To address this question, cDNAs of PKCθI and PKCθII were subcloned into the expression vector pFLAG-CMV5, transfected into HEK293 cells, and immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. After normalizing the expression level of PKCθI and PKCθII by immunoblotting with the anti PKCθ antibody (Fig. 5B), immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assay in the presence or absence of known activators of PKC. Myelin basic protein was used as a substrate. As seen in Fig. 8A, PKCθII showed a certain level of kinase activity in the absence of activators and no further activation was observed following the addition of Ca2+, PS, or TPA, suggesting the possibility that PKCθII is constitutively active independent of the PKC activators. Activity of PKCθI, however, was dependent on PS and TPA, which is in agreement with previous report (6Osada S. Mizuno K. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Giampa L. Telford D. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, autophosphorylation was observed only with PKCθI in an activator-dependent manner (Fig. 8B). No autophosphorylation was noted with PKCθII. PKCθII is unique in that it is mainly composed of a catalytic domain and it is specifically expressed in the seminiferous tubules of the mouse testis. Genomic DNA analysis revealed that PKCθII is generated by alternative splicing of the PKCθ gene. The cDNA of PKCθII consists of a unique N-terminal sequence encoding 20 amino acids and the C-terminal sequence identical to that of PKCθI encoding a part of the C1 regulatory domain followed by the V3 domain, C3/V4/C4 catalytic domain, and V5 domain. Alternative splicing is a common transcriptional mechanism, by which functionally diverse polypeptides are produced from a single gene. Based on a minimum estimate, 35% of human genes show variably spliced products (29Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 30Croft L. Schandorff S. Clark F. Burrage K. Arctander P. Mattick J.S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 340-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing yields a wide variety of the encoded proteins by addition or deletion of a sequence(s), which may be involved in a certain stage of development and differentiation. As for PKC, alternatively spliced isoforms of the β and δ isoforms are known. PKCβI and -βII are produced by alternative splicing of the C-terminal V5 domain, which may function in intracellular localization (31Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 32Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, two alternatively spliced isoforms of PKCδ have been reported, i.e. PKCδII and PKCδIII. PKCδII contains a 78-bp insertion at the caspase-3 recognition sequence at the V3 domain (GenBank™ accession number AB011812). PKCδIII is generated by an 83-bp insertion at the same V3 domain, causing in-frame termination, thereby yielding a truncated form of PKCδ without the catalytic domain (4Ueyama T. Ren Y. Ohmori S. Sakai K. Tamaki N. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we reported another alternatively spliced isoform of PKC, i.e.PKCθII. Functions of certain proteins are switched on/off by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Switching enzymes, therefore, should be strictly regulated. There are several ways of regulating protein kinases. These include binding of the regulatory proteins, a good example being cdk kinases that are regulated by binding to cyclins and cdk inhibitors, and phosphorylation of a specific residue, such as serine 15 of p53 and threonine 160 of cdk2 (33Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 34Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). PKC is well known to be activated by metabolic turnover of polar head groups of membrane phospholipids (35Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Other activation mechanisms for PKC include phosphorylation of a serine/threonine residue at the activation loop (36Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and cleavage between the regulatory and catalytic domains (37Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter mechanism is the case for PKCθII. When assayed in vitro using immunoprecipitated PKCθII, a certain level of background kinase activity was noted in the absence of PS and TPA. Addition of activators did not enhance the activity, which is consistent with its molecular structure, i.e. lacking the zinc finger motif in the C1 regulatory domain. These data suggest that PKCθII is constitutively active independent of PKC activators. PKCθII may be regulated at the transcription level or by a yet-unidentified mechanism. Absence of autophosphorylation in PKCθII suggests possible absence of an autophosphorylation site(s) or its regulating mechanisms in PKCθII. PKCθII is most unique in that it is expressed exclusively in germ cells in seminiferous tubules. There is no expression of PKCθII in any tissue other than the testis, and in the testis the expression is limited exclusively to seminiferous tubules. This was demonstrated byin situ hybridization and RT-PCR of the microdissected tissues using the PKCθII-specific probe or primer, respectively. In contrast, Kim and Shin (38Kim H.M. Shin T. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported that signals of PKCθ were detected in the interstitial cells of mouse testis by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining. However, the 5′-end probe that they used for in situ hybridization was specific to PKCθI, not to PKCθII, and the commercially available antibody used recognized both PKCθI and PKCθII. We also found that the same antibody stained interstitial cells not seminiferous tubules. Spermatogenesis occurs in seminiferous tubules and consists of three phases: proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia, meiotic division of spermatocytes, and development of post-haploid spermatids to sperms. Age-dependent expression of PKCθII after 3 weeks coincides with differentiation of haploid germ cells, suggesting its crucial involvement in spermatogenesis. However, Sunet al. (39Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) reported that PKCθ null mice seemed normal and were fertile. These mice were generated by homologous deletion of the exon encoding the ATP binding site of the C3 domain, which corresponds to amino acid residues 154–207 in PKCθII. Fertility of these mice may be due to redundancy of PKC in testis, in which α, δ, θII, and ζ isoforms are present (18Mischak H. Goodnight J. Henderson D.W. Osada S. Ohno S. Mushinski J.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Further study is needed for elucidating the mechanism by which PKCθII mediates signals for spermatogenesis."

Here we report the identification of a novel KRP termed KRMP1, which has a deduced 1780-amino acid sequence composed of ternary domains. The amino-terminal head domain is most similar to the kinesin motor domain of the MKLP-1 subfamily and has an intrinsic ATPase activity that is diminished by substituting the consensus Lys-168 with Arg. The central stalk domain is predicted to form a long α-helical coiled-coil, and can interact with each otherin vivo. An in vivo labeling experiment revealed that KRMP1 is phosphorylated, and we also found that the region within the tail domain containing Thr-1604 as the cdc2 kinase phosphorylation site differs from the bimC box conserved in the bimC subfamily of KRPs. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that endogenous KRMP1 was localized predominantly to the cytoplasm during interphase and dispersed throughout the cell during mitosis. Consistent with this finding, overexpressed KRMP1 was detected in a complicated nuclear or cytoplasmic pattern reflecting multiple nuclear localization/export signals. Furthermore, KRMP1 interacted with the mitotic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 in vivo, and an in vitrointeraction was detected between the tail domain of KRMP1 and the WW domain of Pin1. Overexpression of KRMP1 caused COS-7 cells to arrest at G2-M, and co-expression of Pin1 reversed this effect, indicating their physiological interaction.

Eukaryotic cells have a set of nucleotide-dependent molecular motors to fulfill specific demands on their viability. Cell division is the most essential and evolved system that engages a number of dynein and kinesin-related proteins (KRPs)1 to move mitotic spindles and chromosomes in a precise and regulated order. Most of the KRPs identified thus far have been shown to be involved in the mitotic process (reviewed in Refs. 1Vernos I. Karsenti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Barton N.R. Goldstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3Miki H.

Kinesins generate force against microtubule, a major constituent of mitotic spindle, via the conserved motor domain capable of binding microtubule and catalyzing ATP. They are categorized into subgroups according to their similarity within this motor domain, and their roles are also related in many cases. The most popular type of KRP, including conventional kinesin heavy chain, has its motor domain at the amino terminus, and the exclusive sequences are divergent in their length and similarity. The non-motor sequence is considered to determine the cargo specificity of the molecular motor and undergoes modification such as phosphorylation or protein-protein interaction that regulates the mechanochemical activity of the motor. The transition from G2 to M phase is triggered by nuclear import of cdc2 kinase, which then phosphorylates mitotic proteins on the Ser/Thr-Pro motif to induce consecutive events upon the onset of mitosis. Although the precise mechanism by which this onset happens is under investigation, one description for the mechanism is proposed as the specific interaction of regulatory proteins in the state of mitotic phosphorylation. The mitotic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 (4Lu K.P. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) is such a candidate and interacts with a large number of mitotic phosphoproteins including cdc25, Wee1, Myt1, Plk1, and cdc27 (5Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 6Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S.

Pin1 preferentially binds to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motif through the amino-terminal WW domain and catalyzes the peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of proteins through the carboxyl-terminal isomerase domain (8Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mitotic phosphorylation by several kinases including cdc2 kinase causes the Ser/Thr-Pro motif to interact with Pin1, although not all of mitotic phosphorylation sites are responsible for Pin1 binding. Antimitotic protein MPM-2 monoclonal antibody (9Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) recognizes a phosphoepitope that almost overlaps with a subset of mitotic phosphorylation sites accessible to Pin1. The reactive sequence for Pin1 and MPM-2 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to higher vertebrate and is functionally important in the progression of mitosis because both the overproduction or removal of Pin1 (10Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) and the microinjection of MPM-2 (11Kuang J. Zhao J. Wright D.A. Saunders G.F. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Here we report the identification of a novel KRP, termed KRMP1, which undergoes in vivo phosphorylation. KRMP1 has an amino-terminal kinesin motor domain that is most similar to that of the emerging MKLP-1 subfamily (12Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Goud B. Science. 1998; 279: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 13Nislow C. Sellitto C. Kuriyama R. McIntosh J.R. J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). KRMP1 has an extraordinarily long coiled-coil domain compared with other KRPs, including known members of the MKLP-1 subfamily. The carboxyl-terminal globular tail domain is strongly phosphorylated by mitotic kinase activities almost attributed to cdc2 kinase, which is responsible for phosphorylation on residue Thr-1604 of KRMP1. Furthermore, both Pin1 and MPM-2 were reactive with mitotically phosphorylated tail domain. The interaction between KRMP1 and Pin1 is mediated through the WW domain of Pin1 and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis and also by functional study, in which the cell cycle arrest induced by KRMP1 overexpression was overridden by the co-expression of Pin1. These data suggest that KRMP1 may be a novel Pin1 target required for mitotic regulation or that KRMP1, with its motor activity, may regulate both localization and interaction of Pin1 with other substrates to contribute to the mitotic process. Unless otherwise noted, routine chemical materials were obtained from either Sigma or Wako (Osaka, Japan). Molecular standards and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant cdc2 kinase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Olomoucine was purchased from Calbiochem. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the FLAG epitope tag (M2; Sigma) were purchased from the indicated suppliers. Anti-α-tubulin mAb YL1/2 (Harlan Sera-Lab, Loughborough, United Kingdom), anti-nucleoporin p62 mAb (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and antimitotic protein mAb MPM-2 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) were purchased from the indicated suppliers. The polyclonal antibodies to the HA epitope tag and Myc epitope tag were purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). KRMP1 polyclonal antiserum C1163 was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide (NH2-GCSKENVSQPKRAKRKLYT-COOH; thebold letters correspond to residues 1726–1742 of the KRMP1 protein) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The full-length cDNA of KRMP1 was cloned with immunoscreening and a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The UNI-ZAP HeLa cDNA expression library (Stratagene) was immunoscreened with serum 114 (from scleroderma patient K.S.) as described previously (16Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Starting with more than 300,000 plaques in the first screening, 20 positive clones were obtained and excised into pBlueScriptII SK(−)in vivo. Two overlapping clones (clones 14 and 17 in Fig.1A) were pieces of a novel KRP. In this reading frame, there was a stop codon at position −7 (nucleotide −21) upstream of a putative first codon within clone 14. This seems to be odd because the bacterial translation of the following sequence might not occur then, but the accuracy of the sequence is supported by some expressed sequence tag data base entries in the GenBankTM. In the 3′ sequence, two clones extended to the same position without any stop codons. To obtain a carboxyl-terminal stretch, 3′-RACE was performed utilizing the following primers: KP+1 corresponding to nucleotides 1181–1201 (5′-GTGAAAGGTTAAGAGAGACTG-3′), KP+3 corresponding to nucleotides 1480–1499 (5′- GGACCTGTCAAATCTTCTCA-3′), KP+5 corresponding to nucleotides 1952–1972 (5′-CTCGAGAAGAAGCAGCGAAAG-3′), and Adapter Universal Amplification Primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′). The initial amplification product with the primer pair KP+1-Adapter Universal Amplification Primer was used as the template for the nested polymerase chain reaction. At the first attempt, KP+3 was chosen as the nested forward primer, and a 1.4-kilobase fragment containing an in-frame stop codon at position 880 (nucleotide 2638) was isolated (clone 11). Based on this sequence, secondary RACE primer KP+5 was designed and gave rise to a rather prominent 4.0-kilobase band (clone 514) that added up to an open reading frame of 5340 base pairs (1780 amino acids) in length. The nucleotide sequences of clones 11 and 514 were identical, except that clone 11 had a 120-base insertion at nucleotide position 2005, and the sequences following nucleotide 2551 of clone 11 and nucleotide 2431 of clone 514 were different from each other. In summary, the deduced amino acid sequence of clone 11 contained a 40-amino acid insertion and a 30-amino acid extension unrelated to that of clone 514, which we assumed to be alternative splicing variants. Because it appeared to have a relatively high copy number, we chose to use clone 514 in the present study. The clones from immunoscreening and RACE were assembled at a unique XhoI site (nucleotide 1952) to obtain full length. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Plasmid DNA sequences were determined by the dye termination method with ABI 310 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A series of deletion fragments of KRMP1 cDNA were amplified with the forward primer containing aSalI restriction site at the 5′ terminus and the reverse primer carrying a stop codon followed by aNotI/PstI site. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using a polymerase chain reaction-based method. The insert fragments digested with SalI andNotI/PstI were subcloned into the appropriate expression plasmids to create an in-frame fusion to the preceding reading frame. Mammalian expression vectors pME-HA (17Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Bacterial expression vectors pGEX 5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pET32b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) were used to express fusion proteins carrying glutathione S-transferase (GST) or 6×His tag at the amino terminus. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing to ensure the correct reading frames. Cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and appropriate heat-inactivated serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was used for COS-7 and 293 cells, minimum essential medium with 10% calf serum was used for HeLaS3 cells, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum was used for NIH3T3 cells. All media and supplements were purchased from Sigma and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively, unless otherwise noted. HeLaS3 cells were synchronized at the G1-S boundary by treating them with 1.0 μg/ml aphidicolin (Calbiochem) for 20 h. To obtain cell populations at different stages of the cell cycle, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then released into complete medium. To obtain M-phase cell extracts, NIH3T3 cells were synchronized at the G2-M boundary by directly treating them with 400 ng/ml nocodazole for 20 h and then collected by mechanical shake-off. Plasmid DNAs for transfection were prepared using a commercial extraction kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106cells/dish, and after culture for 24 h, the cells were transfected with the indicated constructs or empty plasmids as a control, using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All subsequent manipulations were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and then clarified at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Cell lysates (containing about 600 μg of protein) were rotated for 2–3 h with 5 μg of antibody (anti-HA mAb 12CA5 or anti-FLAG mAb M2) and 40 μl of a 50% solution of protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and eluted by boiling with 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for electrophoresis. Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% or 10%), followed by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For visualization, blots were probed with the appropriate primary antibody and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (from New England Biolabs and Bio-Rad, Hertfoldshire, United Kingdom) and an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant proteins fused to GST or 6×His tag at the amino terminus were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 or BL21 DE3, respectively. The bacterial cultures were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside an absorbance of ∼0.4 at 600 nm, incubated with vigorous agitation at 23 °C for 16 h, and harvested. They were then lysed under native condition, followed by affinity purification with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The assay of ATPase activity was performed by using the modified Malachite Green method (18Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which determines the hydrolyzed Pi concentration. The 25-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and purified GST fusion proteins and was placed on ice for intervals of reaction. Sodium phosphate buffer was used as the Pi standard sample. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and quenched by adding perchloric acid solution to a concentration of 0.3 m. Total RNA was isolated with ISOGEN reagent (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan) and used as the template for RT-PCR with SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). No obvious bands were seen within the similarly treated negative control samples without reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR primers for quantification of the mRNA level were as follows: forward primer BamSalKP nucleotides 1–33 (5′-GGATCCGTCGACATGGAATCTAATTTTAATCAAGAGGGAGTACCT-3′) and reverse primer NheI nucleotides 654–634 (5′-TGCACTTTTGCTAGCAATTTC-3′) and forward primer KP+4678 nucleotides 4621–4641 (5′-GTCGACATAGAAACACAAATCATGGAT-3′) and reverse primer KP-5550 nucleotides 5454–5430 (5′-CTATATGCAGAGTGATTTAATGCAT-3′). Cells synchronized at different periods were harvested, washed once with PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. They were then resuspended in PBS, incubated with 20 μg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 30 min, and treated with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide at 4 °C. Flow cytometry analysis was done on FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and analyzed with CellQuest software. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-KRMP1. At 48 h after transfection, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.1 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free media for 3 h. Total cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. The kinase reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml; 3000 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 3 μg of substrate proteins, and M-phase extracts or recombinant cdc2 kinase. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated by boiling with Laemmli sample buffer. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Incorporated32P was detected by autoradiography. Cells were grown on coverslips, transfected, and cultured for 24–48 h. They were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min for permeabilization. The coverslips were blocked with 5% normal goat serum (EY Laboratories Inc., San Mateo, CA) for 30 min and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibody. Primary antibodies were anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:500), anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (1:500), anti-α-tubulin mAb YL1/2 (1:200), polyclonal antiserum to KRMP1 (1:200), and anti-nucleoporin p62 mAb (1:100), diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. They were then washed twice (5 min each time) with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, incubated at room temperature for 2 h with fluorescence (Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:50; Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA, Zymed Laboratories Inc., and Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, AL), and washed twice more (5 min each time) with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. For chromatin staining, coverslips were incubated with 20 μg/ml RNase and treated with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. The coverslips were then dried, mounted in Permafluor (Lipshaw-Immunon, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) onto glass slides, and viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC-800 confocal microscope. Images were Kalman-averaged. We screened a HeLa cDNA expression library with autoimmune serum 114 taken from a scleroderma patient and obtained 20 positive clones. Seven clones were partial cDNAs of the novel dynamin-like protein, as reported previously (16Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, two overlapping but independent clones seemed to encode the head portion of a novel KRP. They were elongated to a putative full-length clone with a size of 6.5 kilobases (Fig.1A) using the RACE method and expressed sequence tag data base search, and this clone contained an open reading frame encoding a novel protein, which we have termed KRMP1 (kinesin-related motor interacting with Pin1). The deduced 1780-amino acid polypeptide (Fig. 1B) was composed of three domains, an amino-terminal kinesin motor domain, a central stalk domain, and a carboxyl-terminal globular tail domain, which is the most common feature shared among the amino-terminal-type KRPs (see below). In COS-7 cells transfected with HA-KRMP1, a 220-kDa band was detected by immunoblotting using both rabbit polyclonal antiserum (C1163) directed against the carboxyl-terminal tail domain of KRMP1 and anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1C; data not shown). Co-migrating endogenous KRMP1 protein was also immunoprecipitated with antiserum C1163 from HeLaS3, 293, and COS-7 cell lysates (Fig. 1C, only the data from HeLaS3 cells are shown as representative data). The band of this size corresponds well to the 1780-amino acid polypeptide, corroborating the accuracy of the open reading frame. Sequence comparison of the kinesin-related motor domain indicated that KRMP1 is closely related to RB6K (12Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Goud B.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which are thought to arise from a MKLP-1 subfamily (Fig.2A and B). The nucleotide-binding consensus motifs, SGKT (N1 or P-loop), SSRSHS (N2), and LAGSE (N3) were all conserved in KRMP1. The similarity to MKLP-1 subfamily members was outstanding around these consensus motifs (27–41% identity within the first 500 amino acid sequence of KRMP1), whereas the carboxyl-terminal half remainder sequences diverged further. To examine whether the motor domain of KRMP1 possesses intrinsic ATPase activity, we generated the corresponding sequence (residues 1–503, head) as a GST fusion protein and measured its ATPase activity. The wild-type GST-head hydrolyzed ATP in a time-dependent manner, whereas the mutant carrying substitution of Lys-158 in the consensus P-loop with Arg (K158R) effectively inhibited the activity (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis rate was dose-dependent, and the wild-type GST-head domain incubated at 4 °C exhibited no apparent ATP hydrolysis (data not shown). Thus, it was confirmed that the amino-terminal kinesin-related sequence of KRMP1 is an innate ATPase. Many KRPs have a central α-helical stalk domain through which coiled-coil oligomerization is achieved (23Yang J.T. Laymon R.A. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 879-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction (24Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar) indicated that the central region of KRMP1 is likely to form an α-helical coiled-coil (Fig.3A). KRMP1 (1780 amino acids) expands to almost twice the length of the other members of the MKLP-1 subfamily (∼1000 amino acids) because KRMP1 has an extraordinarily long stalk domain (∼1000 amino acids; see Fig. 3A). The role of this stalk domain on self-oligomerization was examined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Myc-tagged full-length KRMP1 (Myc-full) and HA-tagged full-length KRMP1 (HA-full) were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, and we found that they could associate in vivo (Fig. 3B). To corroborate the association via the stalk domain, we employed the Myc-tagged construct lacking the amino-terminal motor domain (residues 504–1780, stalk-tail). One favorable aspect of this construct was that it had a greater expression level than the full-length one, although the reason for this was not discovered. Myc-tagged stalk-tail and various HA-tagged derivatives of KRMP1 were tested for their association (Fig. 3C). Apparently, the amino-terminal half of the stalk domain (stalk1) contributed to the co-immunoprecipitation (lanes a, c, d, e, and h in Fig. 3C). HA-tagged constructs containing the carboxyl-terminal half of the stalk domain (stalk2) tended to form a dimer migrating at about twice the size of the monomer band (lanes c, f, and i in Fig. 3C), which may explain the apparent lack or weakness of co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged stalk-tail. These data show that the central ∼1000-amino acid stalk domain should contribute to thein vivo formation of an α-helical coiled-coil structure. It has been reported that among the MKLP-1 subfamily, RB6K reveals a cell cycle-dependent expression pattern, which shows a low level during interphase and reaches a maximum level during M phase (19Hill E. Clarke M. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5711-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Fontijn R.D. Goud B. Echard A. Jollivet F. van Marle J. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2944-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We therefore examined using RT-PCR analysis whether the expression level of KRMP1 is also regulated during the cell cycle, and we found that KRMP1 was rather constantly expressed throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 4A). A search of the GenBankTM data base revealed that a 566-amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus was identical to MPP-1, which was previously reported as an epitope sequence for antimitotic protein MPM-2 monoclonal antibody after phosphorylation by M-phase kinases (25Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine the MPM-2 reactivity of KRMP1 during the cell cycle, HeLaS3 cells were synchronized at G1-S or G2-M, and then cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to KRMP1, followed by immunoblotting using MPM-2. The results showed that the MPM-2 reactivity of KRMP1 was much greater at G2-M than at G1-S (Fig. 4B) and also revealed that the protein level of KRMP1 is likely to be invariant through the cell cycle. Together, these findings raised the possibility that the function of KRMP1 in M phase could be switched via phosphorylation. An in vivo labeling experiment with exogenously expressed KRMP1 in COS-7 cells showed that KRMP1 is actually phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 4C). To address the phosphorylation profile of KRMP1 in M phase, a series of nonoverlapping fragments (residues 1–503, head; residues 504–1003, stalk1; residues 1004–1519, stalk2; and residues 1520–1780, tail) covering the full-length sequence of KRMP1 were purified as GST fusion proteins and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and the M-phase cell extracts. In vitro kinase assays showed that the tail domain was strongly phosphorylated and that the head domain was also phosphorylated, but to a lower extent (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, to explore whether the M-phase phosphorylation activity against KRMP1 is attributed to cdc2 kinase, the proteins described above were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using"

The interactions among the components of the troponin complex (troponins T, C, and I) are essential to understanding the regulation of muscle contraction. While the structure of TnC is well known, and a model for the binary TnC·TnI complex has been recently published (Tung, C.-S., Wall, M. E., Gallagher, S. C., and Trewhella, J. (2000)Protein Sci. 9, 1312–1326), very little is known about TnT. Using non-denaturing gels and NMR spectroscopy, we have analyzed the interactions between TnC and five peptides from TnT as well as how three TnI peptides affect these interactions. Rabbit fast skeletal muscle peptide TnT-(160–193) binds to TnC with a dissociation constant of 30 ± 6 μm. This binding still occurs in the presence of TnI-(1–40) but is prevented by the presence of TnI-(56–115) or TnI-(96–139), both containing the primary inhibitory region of TnI. TnT-(228–260) also binds TnC. The binding site for TnT-(160–193) is located on the C-terminal domain of TnC and was mapped to the surface of TnC using NMR chemical shift mapping techniques.

Contraction begins with the binding of Ca2+ to the troponin complex, triggering conformational changes that are propagated to tropomyosin and actin. The troponin complex is constituted by a Ca2+-binding subunit, troponin C (TnC),1an inhibitory subunit, troponin I (TnI), and a tropomyosin-binding subunit, troponin T (TnT). When the muscle is relaxed, TnI inhibits myosin ATPase activity. The smallest region of TnI capable of this inhibition is known as the inhibitory region, or the inhibitory peptide (residues 96–115). Upon binding of Ca2+, TnC undergoes conformational changes and removes the inhibition by TnI. TnT binds to TnI, TnC, and tropomyosin, anchoring the troponin complex to the thin filament and propagating the conformational changes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev.

A model for the structure of the skeletal binary TnC·TnI complex was recently built based on a number of binding and activity assays such as cross-linking, fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET), and neutron scattering data as well as the available structural information (15Tung C.-S. Wall M.E. Gallagher S.C. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite the amount of information on the interactions between TnC and TnI that has emerged in the last few years, not much is known about the structure of TnT, either isolated or interacting with another troponin subunit. Rabbit skeletal TnT yields two fragments when digested by chymotrypsin. The N-terminal fragment, known as T1, binds to tropomyosin, while the C-terminal fragment, T2, binds TnI and TnC (for reviews, see Refs. 3Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar and 16Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although TnI by itself inhibits myosin ATPase and TnC can remove the inhibition, TnT is necessary for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin ATPase by the troponin complex. Direct interaction of TnT with TnC is responsible for this calcium-sensitizing effect (17Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Herein we show that two TnT peptides, containing residues 160–193 and 228–260, bind to TnC and that other peptides in the T2 region do not bind TnC. We also show that two TnI peptides containing the inhibitory region compete with TnT-(160–193) for TnC, while the first 40 residues of TnI bind to TnC simultaneously with TnT-(160–193). Using two-dimensional 1H,15N NMR spectroscopy to follow the titration of TnC with the peptide TnT-(160–193), we calculated the binding constant for this peptide and mapped the binding region on the surface of TnC. We show this mapping on the model of the binary TnC·TnI complex and discuss the competition results in this context. The expression and purification of recombinant chicken skeletal TnC, NTnC, CTnC, [15N]TnC, and [13C,15N]CTnC were performed as described previously (14Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D.

Proteins and peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in NMR buffer or non-denaturing gel electrophoresis buffer in appropriate concentrations. All protein and peptide concen- trations were determined by amino acid analysis in duplicate. TnC complexes with TnT and TnI peptides were visualized on 10% glycerol-polyacrylamide gels (25Katayama E. Nozaki S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unlabeled recombinant TnC (or the individual domains) and the peptides were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. TnT-(209–243) could not be resuspended in the buffer and was resuspended directly in TnC solution. Protein concentrations were determined to be 25 μm for TnC, 19 μm for CTnC, 16 μm for NTnC, 143 μm for TnT-(151–170), 104 μm for TnT-(160–193), 59 μm for TnT-(181–215), 128 μm for TnT-(209–243), 185 μm for TnT-(228–260), 89 μm for TnI-(1–40), 103 μm for TnI-(56–115), and 186 μm for TnI-(96–139). TnC and TnT or TnI peptides were mixed in ratios from 1:1 to 1:4. TnC/TnI/TnT mixtures were made in 1:1:1 ratios. The mixtures were incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature before analysis and then diluted in sample buffer and analyzed in 10% glycerol, 8% polyacrylamide gels as described (26Farah C.S.

Recombinant TnC uniformly labeled with15N and the peptide TnT-(160–193) were resuspended in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20 mmdithiothreitol, 6 mm CaCl2, 0.03% sodium azide, and 0.2 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH 6.9. TnC concentration in the initial NMR sample was 0.6 mm, and TnT-(160–193) concentration in the stock solutions was 21 and 62 mm, respectively. Titration points of 0.14, 0.29, 0.43, 0.57, 0.71, 0.86, 1, 1.14, 1.29, 1.43, 1.87, and 2.3 molar equivalents of TnT-(160–193) were observed consecutively. 2-μl aliquots of the 21 mm solution were added for the first 10 points, and 2-μl aliquots of the 62 mm solution were added for the last two points. Both one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra were acquired at every titration point. Recombinant CTnC uniformly labeled with 15N and 13C and the peptide TnT-(160–193) were resuspended in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm CaCl2, 0.03% sodium azide, and 0.2 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH 6.9.

Both one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra were acquired at every titration point. A last point was acquired later, with 0.54 mm CTnC and 4.69 molar equivalents of TnT-(160–193). All one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Unity 600 MHz spectrometer. One-dimensional1H spectra were acquired using spectral widths of 7500 or 8000 Hz, a 1H pulse width of 10 μs (90o), and an acquisition time of 2 s. The 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra were acquired using the sensitivity-enhanced gradient pulse sequence developed by Lewis E. Kay and co-workers (27Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem.

The five TnT peptides shown in Fig. 1a(TnT-(151–170), TnT-(160–193), TnT-(181–215), TnT-(209–243), and TnT-(228–260)) were individually mixed with TnC in the presence of Ca2+ and applied to a non-denaturing gel. TnT-(160–193) and TnT-(228–260) are able to displace the TnC band, thus binding to TnC (Fig. 2a). Therefore, TnT-(160–193) and TnT-(228–260) contain the probable sites in TnT responsible for the interaction with TnC. However, when TnT-(228–260) is mixed with TnC in TnC/TnT-(228–260) ratios larger than 1:3, the TnC band cannot be seen in the gel (data not shown). This probably results from the nonspecific binding of multiple copies of TnT-(228–260) to TnC. For this reason, this study focuses on the interactions between TnT-(160–193) and TnC. TnT-(181–215) can be seen as a separate band in the gel in the presence or absence of TnC because of its negative charge and does not affect the TnC band. In the absence of Ca2+ (1 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2), none of the peptides bound TnC (data not shown).Figure 2Interaction between TnC (whole protein or individual N or C domains) and TnT and TnI peptides. TnC was combined with one or two peptides at a time, as described under “Material and Methods,” and the mixture was analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Specific combinations of peptides and/or proteins are indicated at the bottom of the gels. Gels c and d contain TnC in all lanes. a, each of the five TnT peptides was mixed with TnC. TnT-(160–193) and TnT-(228–260) displace the TnC band and therefore bind to TnC. The TnC/peptide ratio was 1:4 for all the peptides except TnT-(228–260). The TnC/TnT-(228–260) ratio was 1:3. b, TnT-(160–193) mixed with the individual domains of TnC. TnT-(160–193) caused a displacement of the CTnC band but not the NTnC band. The TnC/peptide ratio was 1:4. c, TnT-(160–193) and TnI-(1–40) bind simultaneously to TnC, causing a double displacement of the TnC band. The ratio used in this gel was 1:1:1 (TnC/TnI-(1–40)/TnT-(160–193)). d, TnT-(160–193) and TnI-(96–139) compete for TnC. When both peptides are added to TnC the only band displacement seen is the one caused by TnI-(96–139). The ratio in this gel was 1:1:1 (TnC/TnI-(96–139)/TnT-(160–193)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the TnC-binding peptide TnT-(160–193) is mixed to the individual domains of TnC in the presence of Ca2+, it causes a partial displacement of the C domain (CTnC) band (Fig. 2b) but not of the N domain (NTnC) band. This suggests that the interaction between TnT-(160–193) and TnC occurs through the C domain of the protein. The weakening of the NTnC band suggests some binding to the N domain, but no band for the complex is seen. Given the charges of NTnC and TnT-(160–193), a stable complex should be seen in the gel. A weak complex would dissociate while migrating in the gel and would not be seen as a band. TnI peptides described in Fig. 1b (TnI-(1–40), TnI-(56–115), and TnI-(96–169)) were combined with TnC and TnT-(160–193) to evaluate how they would affect the interaction between TnC and TnT-(160–193). TnT-(160–193) and the peptide containing the first 40 amino acids from TnI (TnI-(1–40)) can bind to TnC simultaneously. When either of the two peptides is added to TnC, the TnC band is displaced. When both peptides are added to TnC, the resulting displacement is bigger, roughly corresponding to the sum of both individual displacements (Fig. 2c). This displacement shows the simultaneous binding of the two peptides to TnC. TnT-(160–193) binds to TnC with smaller affinity than TnI-(1–40), causing only a partial displacement when mixed to TnC, whereas TnI-(1–40) displaces the band totally. When the two peptides are added simultaneously to TnC, some of the TnC·TnI-(1–40) band is still seen because of the weaker binding of TnT-(160–193). When TnI-(96–139) is combined with TnC and TnT-(160–193), a different result is obtained. The only displacement seen on the TnC band is the one caused by the binding of TnI-(96–139) (Fig. 2d), which binds to TnC with greater affinity than TnT-(160–193) and prevents it from binding. The greater affinity of TnI-(96–139) can be seen from the complete displacement of the TnC band that it causes, whereas TnT-(160–193) only produces partial displacement. The same experiment was done with TnI-(56–115) and TnT-(160–193). As with TnI-(96–139), TnI-(56–115) also competes with TnT-(160–193), preventing it from binding TnC (data not shown). TnT-(160–193) was titrated into [15N]TnC and [13C,15N]CTnC solutions. The binding was followed by two-dimensional1H,15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy. The two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra of [13C,15N]CTnC in the beginning and the end of the titration are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Each cross-peak corresponds to 15N and 1H resonances of the amide of an individual amino acid. Assignments for some of the peaks are indicated in both spectra. The two spectra are clearly different. These differences were observed during the titration as a gradual shifting of the resonances of the residues affected by TnT-(160–193). The binding occurs with fast exchange kinetics on the NMR time scale. The peaks in each titration point correspond to the weighted average of peptide-free and peptide-bound peaks. This shifting can be seen in Fig.4, which shows a superimposition of a region of the two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra of [13C,15N]CTnC during the titration. While some cross-peaks almost do not change, like those for Ala-124 and Leu-137, others are greatly displaced in different directions, as exemplified by the cross-peaks for Glu-159 and Lys-156. The peaks stop moving when the [TnT-(160–193)]total/[CTnC]total ratio reaches 1, indicating the binding of only one TnT-(160–193) per CTnC.Figure 4Shifting of CTnC amide NMR cross-peaks during titration with TnT-(160–193). A detail of the two-dimensional1H,15N HSQC NMR spectrum of CTnC in the absence of TnT-(160–193) is shown in multiple contours, while peaks in the same region of the spectrum after each peptide addition are shown in single contours.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Titration of whole TnC with TnT-(160–193) produced similar results for residues in the C-terminal domain. Residues in the N-terminal domain did not move significantly until the C-terminal domain was saturated, and then they began to move. Because the N domains of two TnC molecules can interact, forming a TnC dimer (18Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), chemical shift changes in the N domain can be caused by breaking of the dimer. Peak displacements (the total chemical shift changes) for each residue were calculated from the chemical shift changes of both nuclei using Equation 1 (9McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Δδtotal=(Δδ15N)2+(Δδ1H)2Equation 1 A comparison of the NMR chemical shift changes for residues in the C domain for both titrations can be seen in Fig.5. The chemical shift changes for each residue were similar in both titrations, except for the first nine residues in CTnC. This difference is probably caused by the different environments for this region in the two proteins. While these residues are in the middle of the protein in TnC, in CTnC they are the N-terminal residues. The residues in the C domain that had a chemical shift change greater than 100 Hz at the end of the titration were averaged and normalized in both titrations, and the results were plotted in the binding curves shown in Fig. 6. Five non-overlapping cross-peaks for residues in the N domain that moved more than 40 Hz were also averaged, normalized to the C domain values, and plotted in Fig. 6a. The curves were fitted to binding using Equation2, TnC+TnT­(160–193)⇆TnC·TnT­(160–193)Equation 2 where TnC represents both [15N]TnC and [15N,13C]CTnC. The resulting dissociation constants were 30 ± 6 μm for the C domain of whole TnC and 38 ± 24 μm for CTnC. To calculate the N domain binding curve, TnT-(160–193) concentrations were adjusted at each point for the free TnT-(160–193) concentrations. The dissociation constant for the N domain cannot be accurately determined because the site did not saturate during the titration. It can be seen, however, that it is at least 10 times bigger than for the C domain and that the binding to the N domain is not significant until the C domain is 90% saturated. The curve for the N domain in Fig. 6 was plotted usingKD = 400 μm, the minimum value that fitted the data. Peak displacements caused by the binding of TnT-(160–193) (shown in Fig. 5) were mapped on the protein surface both for the C domain in the presence of TnI-(1–47) and for the whole TnC in the model of TnC·TnI (Fig. 7). The surface was colored in a gradient according to the degree to which the residues were affected by TnT-(160–193) binding. Regions in white correspond to residues whose amide chemical shift, according to Equation 1, did not change by more than 20 Hz during the titration. Residues whose peaks shifted more than 120 Hz were colored in pure red. Through this mapping, the TnT-(160–193)-binding site on TnC can be visualized in the protein and in the binary complex model. Among the five peptides covering the whole T2 region in rabbit fast skeletal muscle TnT, two peptides, containing residues 160–193 and 228–260, bind TnC according to non-denaturing gel electrophoresis data. These regions must therefore contain the physiologically important TnC-binding sites in TnT. Any binding too weak to be seen as a band in the gel under the conditions used is not likely to be physiological. These results are in good agreement with previous results from the literature. Most studies showed Ca2+-dependent binding to TnC of larger peptides from the T2 region or the whole T2 containing residues 160–193 (31Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tanokura M.

Acta. 1989; 997: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The smallest of them contained residues 160–210. There is also evidence of binding for peptides containing residues 207–259, 177–231, and 240–260 (31Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although the last two peptides did not form complexes that could be detected by electrophoresis (35Jackson P. Amphlett G.W. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The peptide containing residues 177–231 contains half of TnT-(160–193), whereas 207–259 and 240–260 overlap with TnT-(228–260). As in our experiments, these studies showed weaker binding in the absence of Ca2+, even in the presence of Mg2+ (31Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tanokura M. Tawada Y. Ono A. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Different studies have suggested that the C domain of TnC adopts different conformations when bound to Ca2+ or Mg2+ (36Trigo-Gonzalez G. Racher K. Burtnick L. Borgford T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7009-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Finley N. Dvoretsky A. Rosevear P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1439-1446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TnT-(228–260) seems to have a primary binding site on TnC but also binds TnC nonspecifically in increased concentrations. This nonspecific binding can affect affinity measurements and binding site mapping. Preliminary NMR studies showed that the peptide aggregates when in solution, and the complex TnC·TnT-(228–260) precipitates in the NMR tube (data not shown). For these reasons, we centered this work on the characteristics of TnT-(160–193) binding to TnC. The binding site for TnT-(160–193) is located on the C-terminal domain of TnC. Not only is TnT-(160–193) capable of binding to CTnC, but the same residues are involved in the binding of TnT-(160–193) to the whole protein and to CTnC, showing that the peptide is bound to the same site in both situations. When the C domain is saturated, TnT-(160–193) binds to the N domain of TnC. That binding, however, occurs with much lower affinity (more than 10 times lower) and is likely non-physiological. The dissociation constant for TnC·TnT-(160–193) binding is 30 ± 6 μm. The affinity between TnC and TnT was previously reported as almost 1000 times stronger (38Ingraham R.H. Swenson C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9544-9548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference can be caused by different conditions or different measuring methods, but most probably because we used a small peptide whereas the previous measurement was made using the whole protein. The presence of residues 228–206 from TnT probably strengthens the interaction. The difference between the affinity of TnT-(160–193) for CTnC and TnC is not statistically significant. On the other hand, the increased flexibility of the N-terminal residues of CTnC may weaken the binding to TnC. The CTnC titration did not have enough points to obtain a smaller error in the curve fitting. The binding data for the N domain in Fig. 6 has a slightly more sigmoid shape than the expected binding curve. This could be the result of breaking any partial dimerization of TnC. TnC dimerizes through the N domain (18Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the observed chemical shift changes for the N domain are the combined effect of TnT-(160–193) binding and breaking of the dimer. TnT-(160–193) binds to the N domain of TnC in the monomeric state, and both reactions contribute to the binding curve. The site was mapped on the surface of TnC in one of the two recently published models for the TnC·TnI binary complex “model L” (15Tung C.-S. Wall M.E. Gallagher S.C. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The binding site involves hydrophobic, negative, and positive residues, mostly between the EF hand sites III and IV. Residues 104–107, in the beginning of site III, form the first binding cluster. One side of both helices F and G is also involved, and residues 156–160, close to the C-terminal of the protein, complete the binding site for TnT-(160–193). TnC orientation in Fig. 7 was chosen to show the binding site. The surface not seen on the figure is mostly white and not affected by TnT-(160–193). Chemical shift changes in the N domain were not mapped on the protein surface because they possibly reflect the dimerization state of TnC. The region containing residues 160–193 in TnT involved in TnC binding is immediately N-terminal from the TnI-binding region. Residues 198–251 of TnT contain a hydrophobic heptad repeat, typical of a coiled-coil structure, that has been proposed to interact with residues 57–106 of TnI, which also contain a hydrophobic heptad repeat (39Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1985; 63: 212-218Google Scholar). A TnT fragment containing residues 177–231 of TnT bind to TnI (39Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1985; 63: 212-218Google Scholar), while a chicken TnT mutant missing residues 216–263 (40Malnic B. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and a bovine TnT mutant missing residues 203–214 (41Stefancsik R. Jha P.K. Sarkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) cannot bind TnI. These regions correspond to residues 211–260 and 205–216 in rabbit TnT2f, respectively. Residues 224–228 were also shown to be critical for TnI binding (33Tanokura M. Tawada Y. Ono A. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since regions of TnT responsible for TnC and TnI binding are located side by side, it is expected that the corresponding regions of TnC and TnI that interact with TnT would be closely located in the troponin complex. In the model in Fig. 7, the region containing the hydrophobic heptad repeat in TnI (residues 57–106) corresponds mostly to the α-helix (seen in blue to the left of the C domain of TnC), which does not interact with TnC in the complex. It is, however, close enough to the mapped TnT-binding site on TnC (colored inred) to suggest that these regions could interact with consecutive regions in TnT. The non-denaturing gel electrophoresis data (Fig. 1c) showed that TnT-(160–193) and TnI-(1–40) can bind to TnC at the same time. The region of TnI corresponding to TnI-(1–40) is shown ingreen in Fig. 7. Even though both peptides bind to same region of TnC, they do not interact with the same residues and would not compete for TnC binding. NMR chemical shift changes mapping the TnI-(1–40)-binding site on CTnC showed that the binding affects the residues in the hydrophobic pocket of CTnC (14Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), while TnT-(160–193) affects mostly the external surface of helices F and G in the region exposed to the solvent. TnI-(96–139) (Fig. 7, orange region) and TnI-(56–115) compete with TnT-(160–193) binding to TnC, indicating that they share at least part of the binding site on TnC. TnI-(96–139) contains the inhibitory peptide (residues 96–115), shown as the orangeβ-hairpin to the right of TnC in Fig. 7, and an α-helical region (residues 116–139) that binds to the N domain of TnC (9McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The inhibitory peptide is the only common region between the two peptides, and must, therefore, be the region that competes with TnT-(160–193). The model for the TnC·TnI binary complex shown in Fig. 7 does not account for that competition. We suggest that the binding site for the inhibitory peptide on TnC overlaps the TnT-binding site, at least partially. The inhibitory peptide is located close to TnT in the troponin complex, and the presence of TnT can protect the inhibitory region from chymotryptic digestion (42Tao T. Gong B.-J. Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As for TnT-(160–193), TnI-(96–115) has both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with CTnC, while TnI-(1–40) has mostly hydrophobic interactions (14Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TnT-(160–193) and TnI-(96–115) may share some of the electrostatic contacts and therefore compete for TnC. It is interesting to observe that while TnI-(96–115) competes with TnI-(1–40) and presumably with TnT-(160–193), TnI-(1–40) and TnT-(160–193) do not compete. The binding site for the inhibitory peptide probably shares different residues with TnI-(1–40)- and TnT-(160–193)-binding sites, so that the last two sites either do not overlap or the overlapping region is so small that it does not significantly affect the binding. Thus our results support much of model L from Tung et al. (15Tung C.-S. Wall M.E. Gallagher S.C. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), except for the exact position of the inhibitory peptide. Model R is not compatible with our results. The position of TnI residues 3–33 in model R, overlapping the mapped TnT-(160–193)-binding site, would cause competition between TnI-(1–40) and TnT-(160–193). We suggest that model L is probably closer to the actual structure of the binary TnC·TnI complex. This is the first time that a TnT-binding site has been mapped on TnC. When combined with the information available on TnI binding to TnC, the mapping offers insights into how the three components come together in the structure of troponin tertiary complex.

Those mechanisms can vary, but they always involve the movement of charged gating particles through the transmembrane electric field. These gating charges can be intrinsic to the channel protein, as described in potassium, sodium, and calcium channels (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). For instance, in the shaker-like potassium channels described in animal and plant membranes, mutations of basic amino acids of the S4 transmembrane domain drastically change the voltage regulation of the channel, indicating that these amino acids contribute to the gating charge (2Papazian D.M. Timpe L.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Alternately, voltage-dependent closure can be achieved by voltage-dependent block of the channel pore by a soluble charged molecule. This is the case for NMDA ionotropic receptors (3Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar, 4Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Guthrie P.B.

Except in guard cells, for which a combination of electrophysiology, pharmacology, and genetic approaches has provided strong evidence that the slow-type anion channel is involved in stomatal closure (7Pei Z.-M.

The tight control of anion channel activation by intra- and extracellular factors is thus an important step in signal transduction pathways.Few studies on the regulation of the voltage gating have been performed on plant anion channels. The gating of the fast anion channel (GCAC1) of Vicia faba guard cells is affected by both extracellular factors such as chloride, malate (15Hedrich R. Marten I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Hedrich R. Marten I. Lohse G. Dietrich P. Winter H. Lohaus G. Heldt H.-W. Plant J. 1994; 6: 741-748Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and auxins (17Marten I. Lohse G. Hedrich R. Nature. 1991; 353: 758-762Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and intracellular factors such as nucleotides, which have been proposed to be allosteric regulators of the channel protein (18Schulz-Lessdorf B. Lohse G. Hedrich R. Plant J. 1996; 10: 993-1004Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A different mode of regulation by ATP through cytosolic protein phosphorylation has been described for the voltage-dependent anion channel of tobacco cell suspension (19Zimmermann S. Thomine S. Guern J. Barbier-Brygoo H. Plant J. 1994; 6: 707-716Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whatever the complexity of their regulation, plant anion channels are basically voltage-sensitive and open upon membrane depolarization. Therefore, a good knowledge of the voltage-dependent gating mechanisms is needed to further understand how regulatory agents affect anion channel activity.Two anion channels with distinct regulation characteristics reside at the plasma membrane of epidermal cells of Arabidopsishypocotyls: (a) a highly nitrate-permeable channel with slow activation and deactivation kinetics (20Frachisse J.M. Colcombet J. Guern J. Barbier-Brygoo H. Plant J. 2000; 21: 361-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (b) a rapid voltage-dependent anion channel permeable to sulfate (21Thomine S. Zimmermann S. Guern J. Barbier-Brygoo H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Thomine S. Guern J. Barbier-Brygoo H. J. Membr.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In a previous study, Thomine et al. (22Thomine S. Guern J. Barbier-Brygoo H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown, based on the activity of nonhydrolyzable nucleotides, that the nucleotide regulation of the rapid anion channel does not require ATP hydrolysis and suggested a regulation through a binding site for free ATP. However, the biophysical mechanism of nucleotide action was not elucidated. In the present study, we propose that the fast anion channel is gated mainly by the voltage-dependent entry of nucleotides into the channel pore, leading to a voltage-dependent block at hyperpolarized potentials. This model is supported by structure-function studies of nucleotides and kinetic analyses. Furthermore, we show that extracellular permeant anions can counteract the block by intracellular nucleotides, which indicates that blocking nucleotides and permeant anions interact within the channel pore.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have conducted experiments to analyze the mechanism by which intracellular nucleotides regulate the voltage dependence of the fast anion channel of Arabidopsishypocotyl cells. Raising ATPi shifts the activation curve of the fast anion current toward less negative potentials without affecting the apparent gating charge. In addition, in the absence of intracellular nucleotides, the channel becomes essentially voltage insensitive. Taken together, these two initial results provide evidence that nucleotides play a key role in the gating mechanism of the channel. This nucleotide regulation is clearly distinct from the voltage-independent regulation reported for the guard cell anion channel GCAC1 (18Schulz-Lessdorf B. Lohse G. Hedrich R. Plant J. 1996; 10: 993-1004Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Nucleotides Confer Voltage Dependence to the Channel Through an Open Channel Voltage-dependent Block MechanismOur finding that the gating charge increases with the negative charge carried by a nucleotide molecule led us to propose that nucleotides act as gating charges for the fast anion channel by entering the channel pore in a voltage-dependent manner. A similar mechanism of open channel voltage-dependent block has been demonstrated for NMDA ionotropic receptors (3Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar, 4Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Guthrie P.B. Nature. 1984; 309: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar) and inward rectifying potassium channels (Kin; Ref. 5Matsuda H. Saigusa A. Irisawa H. Nature. 1987; 325: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, these cation-selective channels are blocked by the entry of soluble cations in the pore such as Mg2+ in the case of NMDA receptors or Mg2+ and spermidine in the case of Kinchannels, whereas for the plant fast anion channel, the gating is achieved by the entry of an anionic nucleotide in the pore.The voltage-dependent open channel block mechanism predicts that channel closure, which requires recruitment of a nucleotide molecule from the cytosol to the channel pore, should be affected by ATPi, whereas channel opening should not. In agreement with the proposed mechanism, we found that the deactivation kinetics of the fast anion current, which reflects the rate of channel closure, is accelerated when the concentration of intracellular nucleotides is increased, whereas the activation kinetics remains unchanged. Under our experimental conditions, biphasic deactivation kinetics could be observed, suggesting that the blocking by nucleotides can lead to two different closed states. One of them is reached by slower kinetics and predominates at moderately hyperpolarized potentials, whereas the other is reached by fast deactivation kinetics and predominates at very hyperpolarized potentials. Compared with the open channel voltage-dependent block of NMDA receptor by Mg2+ (3Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar, 4Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Guthrie P.B. Nature. 1984; 309: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar), the mechanism of nucleotide voltage-dependent block of the fast anion channel is more complex. This is likely due to the fact that nucleotides are larger and more complex blocking particles than Mg2+ that can take several different positions in the channel pore and possibly even modify the conformation of the channel protein. Despite this complexity, it is important to note that because both deactivation constants are sensitive to ATP, both closed states correspond to conformations of the channel blocked by ATP. Our data showing that nucleotides can also induce a voltage-dependent block when perfused in the extracellular solution further support the hypothesis that nucleotides block the channel by entering the channel pore. The fact that nucleotides can act from both sides suggests that the blocking mechanism relies on the basic geometry of the pore.In addition, we studied the effect of intracellular nucleotides on the rate of channel closure at the single-channel level. In agreement with a block of the channel by nucleotides, the rate of channel closure follows the equation: 1/topen=Kon·[ATP]+AEquation 1 where Kon is the rate constant of free ATP entry into the channel pore at the voltage studied (M−1·s−1), and A reflects the ATP-independent closure. A linear fitting of Fig. 5B allowed us to determine a value of 7.3 × 106m−1·s−1 forKon at −205 mV. This constant is much faster than what is expected for simple diffusion in water and likely reflects the fact that the membrane voltage accelerates nucleotide motion inside the pore. Thus, the binding of ATP, leading to channel closure, occurs within the transmembrane electric field. When the linear relationship is extrapolated to [ATP] = 0, the rate of closure is low. On one hand, this indicates that the voltage-dependent block by intracellular nucleotides largely accounts for the closure of the channel at hyperpolarized potentials. On the other hand, this residual rate of channel closure extrapolated for 0 ATPi, together with the incomplete loss of voltage dependence when the inside of the cell was perfused with an ATP-free solution, suggests the existence of some ATP-independent voltage gating. Finally, it is important to note that this ATP-independent gating would occur at a highly hyperpolarized potential and would only account for a minor fraction of the channel voltage dependence under physiological conditions.Extracellular Permeant Anions Participate in Channel Gating by Counteracting the Effect of Nucleotides and Directly Sensing the VoltageIn addition to the effect of intracellular nucleotides, we also show that external permeant anions can alter the gating of the fast anion channel. Similar results have already been reported for the fast anion channel in V. faba guard cells (15Hedrich R. Marten I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Lohse G. Hedrich R. Planta (Berl.). 1995; 197: 546-552Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Dietrich P. Hedrich R. Plant J. 1998; 15: 479-487Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this case, extracellular malate was shown to be especially efficient in modifying the gating (15Hedrich R. Marten I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Hedrich R. Marten I. Lohse G. Dietrich P. Winter H. Lohaus G. Heldt H.-W. Plant J. 1994; 6: 741-748Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in our study, we consider for the first time the interaction between extracellular permeant anions and an intracellular blocking particle. Our data show that external anions are able to reduce the effect of intracellular nucleotides on the fast anion channel. This dose-dependent effect does not saturate at external chloride concentrations as high as 100 mm, suggesting a low affinity mechanism associated with ion permeation in the channel. This is supported by the observation that replacing chloride with a more permeant anion, nitrate, also reduces the effect of intracellular nucleotides. Because the interaction between external permeant anions and internal nucleotides can only take place inside the channel pore, this result provides further argument in favor of our hypothesis that nucleotides gate the fast anion channel by blocking the pore in a voltage-dependent manner. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of the effect of external chloride shows that increasing external chloride or replacing chloride with nitrate, a more permeant anion, accelerates fast anion channel activation while only slightly modifying the rate of closure. According to our hypothesis, channel activation reflects the expulsion of ATP from the channel pore. This result shows that rather than competing with ATP for a common or overlapping binding site within the pore, permeant external anions are able to trigger channel relief from block by kicking the nucleotide out from the pore. In this view, a more permeant anion, such as nitrate, is more efficient in triggering the expulsion of a nucleotide molecule from the channel pore.The analysis of the effect of external permeant anions also reveals a role for permeant anions in voltage sensing. Indeed, a reduction of the external permeant anion concentration results in a decrease of the gating charge of the current. Most of the variation of the gating charge occurs when the chloride concentration is raised from 0 to 10 mm, suggesting that this effect involves a high affinity mechanism distinct from the nucleotide expulsion described above. The effect of chloride on the gating charge suggests that the charge carried by the permeating anions contributes to the sensing of membrane voltage by the fast anion channel. This is in agreement with the results obtained by Dietrich and Hedrich (27Dietrich P. Hedrich R. Plant J. 1998; 15: 479-487Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) on the fast anion channel from V. faba guard cells. It is also reminiscent of the gating of the torpedo voltage-dependent chloride channel CLC-0. For CLC-0, channel activation is strongly facilitated by external chloride, and Pusch et al. (28Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) have suggested that voltage-dependent gating is conferred by the permeating charge itself, acting as the gating charge. Additional studies on the role of Cl− ions in the fast voltage-dependent gating of CLC-0 confirmed that Cl− movement within the channel is the major source of voltage dependence, whereas charge movement intrinsic to the channel protein contributes little to this process (29Chen T.-Y. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Physiological Relevance of Nucleotide and Extracellular Anion RegulationsThe various regulations of its gating likely enable the fast anion channel to sense important cellular parameters such as the concentrations of internal nucleotides and external anions. The regulation of the channel by intracellular nucleotides could couple the metabolic status of the cell and its membrane excitability (22Thomine S. Guern J. Barbier-Brygoo H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A similar role has been demonstrated in the case of K-ATP channels from pancreatic β cells (30Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In this case, an increase in the metabolic energy charge increases the inhibition of the channel by ATP (30Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This allows membrane depolarization that favors insulin secretion. In the case of the fast anion channel, the regulation by ATP could represent a means to generate a depolarization signal in response to a decrease in the metabolic charge of the cell under stress conditions, such as hypoxia, for example (31Saint-Ges V. Roby C. Bligny R. Pradet A. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The regulation by extracellular permeant anions would then act as a feed forward regulatory loop to amplify and maintain a depolarization sufficient to trigger downstream signaling events, as already suggested for the fast anion channel inV. faba guard cells (15Hedrich R. Marten I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Hedrich R. Marten I. Lohse G. Dietrich P. Winter H. Lohaus G. Heldt H.-W. Plant J. 1994; 6: 741-748Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Lohse G. Hedrich R. Planta (Berl.). 1995; 197: 546-552Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results showing that intracellular nucleotides affect the voltage dependence of the fast anion channel and that the gating charge correlates with the valence of the nucleotide led us to propose that the voltage-dependent closure of the channel at hyperpolarized membrane potentials results from voltage-dependent occlusion of the channel pore by intracellular nucleotides. From our data, we also suggested that permeant anions such as chloride or nitrate can chase the nucleotide from the channel pore by a repulsion mechanism, thus favoring channel relief from block. In addition, voltage sensing by permeant anions going through the pore could also contribute to the activation process. To our knowledge, this study represents the first evidence that plant anion channels can be gated by a voltage-dependent block mechanism and also represents the first demonstration that nucleotides, at physiological concentrations, can gate a channel through a simple biophysical mechanism. The molecular mechanisms of voltage gating are well understood for some channels. Those mechanisms can vary, but they always involve the movement of charged gating particles through the transmembrane electric field. These gating charges can be intrinsic to the channel protein, as described in potassium, sodium, and calcium channels (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). For instance, in the shaker-like potassium channels described in animal and plant membranes, mutations of basic amino acids of the S4 transmembrane domain drastically change the voltage regulation of the channel, indicating that these amino acids contribute to the gating charge (2Papazian D.M. Timpe L.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Alternately, voltage-dependent closure can be achieved by voltage-dependent block of the channel pore by a soluble charged molecule. This is the case for NMDA ionotropic receptors (3Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar, 4Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Guthrie P.B. Nature. 1984; 309: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar) and inward rectifying potassium channels (5Matsuda H. Saigusa A. Irisawa H. Nature. 1987; 325: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), which are gated by soluble cations. Except for the channels belonging to the shaker family, the gating mechanisms of plant ion channels remain poorly understood. Plasma membrane anion channels have been identified in a number of different plant tissues (6Barbier-Brygoo H. Vinauger M. Colcombet J. Ephritikhine G. Frachisse J.-M. Maurel C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 199-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Except in guard cells, for which a combination of electrophysiology, pharmacology, and genetic approaches has provided strong evidence that the slow-type anion channel is involved in stomatal closure (7Pei Z.-M. Kuchitsu K. Ward J.M. Schwarz M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 8Pei Z.-M. Ghassemian M. Kwak C.M. McCourt P. Schroeder J.I.

Schroeder J.I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), physiological functions of plant anion channels remain to be elucidated. Despite the large electrochemical gradient driving anions outside the cell, anions are accumulated in plant cells in resting conditions. However, signals such as elicitors of plant defense responses, hormones, or hypo-osmotic stress that depolarize the membrane induce anion effluxes that can be accounted for by the activation of anion channels (11Nürnberger T.

The tight control of anion channel activation by intra- and extracellular factors is thus an important step in signal transduction pathways. Few studies on the regulation of the voltage gating have been performed on plant anion channels. The gating of the fast anion channel (GCAC1) of Vicia faba guard cells is affected by both extracellular factors such as chloride, malate (15Hedrich R. Marten I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Hedrich R. Marten I. Lohse G. Dietrich P. Winter H. Lohaus G. Heldt H.-W.

Lohse G. Hedrich R. Plant J. 1996; 10: 993-1004Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A different mode of regulation by ATP through cytosolic protein phosphorylation has been described for the voltage-dependent anion channel of tobacco cell suspension (19Zimmermann S. Thomine S.

Binding of [35S]BIO7662 to Jurkat cells was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and could be blocked by treatment with an excess of unlabeled inhibitor or with EDTA.KD values for the binding of BIO7662 to Mn2+-activated α4β1 and to the nonactivated state of the integrin that exists in 1 mmMg2+, 1 mm Ca2+ were <10 pm, indicating that it has a high affinity for both activated and nonactivated integrin. No binding was observed on α4β1 negative cells. Through an analysis of the metal ion dependences of ligand binding, several unexpected findings about α4β1 function were made. First, we observed that Ca2+ binding to α4β1 was stimulated by the addition of BIO7662. From solution binding studies on purified α4β1, two types of Ca2+-binding sites were identified, one dependent upon and the other independent of BIO7662 binding. Second, we observed that the metal ion dependence of ligand binding was affected by the affinity of the ligand for α4β1. ED50 values for the metal ion dependence of the binding of BIO7762 and the binding of a lower affinity ligand, BIO1211, differed by 2-fold for Mn2+, 30-fold for Mg2+, and >1000-fold for Ca2+. Low Ca2+ (ED50 = 5–10 μm) stimulated the binding of BIO7662 to α4β1. The effects of μm Ca2+ closely resembled the effects of Mn2+ on α4β1 function. Third, we observed that the rate of BIO7662 binding was dependent on the metal ion concentration and that the ED50 for the metal ion dependence of BIO7662 binding was affected by the concentration of the BIO7662.

Although expression of α4β1 is constitutive, its interactions with ligands are strongly enhanced in an activated state that can be induced by various stimuli including antigen, anti-TCR mAbs, phorbol esters, the divalent cation Mn2+, and certain β1-specific antibodies (26Chan B.M.C.

These changes in affinity and/or avidity ultimately determine whether an interaction is productive and stabilizes the ligand-integrin complex or whether it is nonproductive. The regulation of integrin function by metal ions has been extensively studied but is complex and is not fully understood (29Humphries M.J. Cur. Opin.

This region of the α-chain is made up of seven sequence repeats of about 60 amino acids each, which are believed to be organized in a β-propeller fold found in some proteins (33Springer T.A. Proc.

A. 1997; 94: 7198-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The β-chain contains a second type of metal binding/ligand binding motif that shares homology with the A-domain of von Willebrand's factor (35Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Conner K. Larson R.S.

A homologous structure is present in some α-subunits as well. Although the role of cation-binding sites in regulating integrin function is well established, how the sites are involved is unclear. Regulation of ligand binding by cations is complicated by the fact that some metal-binding sites have an inhibitory role (30Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

The key residues in VCAM-1 (QIDSP) and CS1 (EILDVP) necessary for their interactions with α4β1 have been defined by molecular and biochemical techniques (20Wayer E.A. Kovach N.L. J.

Many groups have used these sequences as starting points to develop small molecule inhibitors that can block the interaction between α4β1and its ligands (39Vanderslice P. Ren K. Revelle J.K. Kim D.C.

Sci. 2000; 6: 398-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using a novel capped peptide strategy, we previously generated a series of subnanomolar inhibitors selective for activated α4β1, typified by the compound 4-((N′-2-methylphenyl)ureido)-phenylacetyl-LDVP (BIO1211) (42Lin K.-C. Ateeq H.S. Hsiung S.H. Chong L.T. Zimmerman C.N. Castro A. Lee W.C. Hammond C.E. Kalkunte S. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Leone D.R. Sprague A.G. Abraham W.M. Gill A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 42: 920-934Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). KD values for binding of BIO1211 to activated α4β1 ranged from 40 to 400 pmdepending on the state of activation, whereas its affinity for the nonactivated integrin was 20–40 nm. This large range of affinities provided a simple means for studying activation through direct binding measurements using radiolabeled BIO1211 as a probe for activation (44Chen L.L. Whitty A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13167-13175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such direct binding studies provide a rapid snapshot of the activation state of the integrin without the inherent complications of adhesion format assays in which changes in binding also result from changes in avidity and/or signaling. However, the relatively low affinity of BIO1211 for nonactivated α4β1 limited its utility as a probe for evaluating the biochemical properties of the nonactivated integrin. Here we describe a new probe, BIO7662, that is more than 1000 times more potent than BIO1211 for binding nonactivated α4β1 and provides a unique tool to evaluate the role of calcium as a modulator of α4β1function. The studies help to explain conflicting data in the literature and provide an alternative explanation for observed differences in the binding of α4β1 to its various ligands. [35S]BIO7662 (1, 241 Ci/mmol) was synthesized at PerkinElmer Life Sciences by reacting [35S]phenylsulfonyl chloride with the proline hydrochloride methyl ester precursor under basic conditions. The methyl ester was subsequently hydrolyzed and the product purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The radioactive purity of the product was 97.9% at the time of synthesis. [35S]BIO7662 was stored at −70 °C in methanol as a 0.45 μm stock solution. Prior to use, the labeled stock solution was diluted with unlabeled BIO7662 to a final specific activity of about 60 Ci/mmol. Jurkat and K562 cells (from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), α1-transfected K562 cells (from Beth Browning, Biogen Inc.), and α2- and α4-transfected K562 cells (gifts from M. Hemler, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. The cells were periodically monitored for high level surface expression of the appropriate integrin by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. For binding studies, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed two times with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), suspended at ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in TBS, and counted using a Neubauer hemocytometer. The cells were further diluted with TBS to the concentration indicated and treated with [35S]BIO7662 at room temperature. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of TBS plus Mn2+, and transferred to a scintillation vial containing 2.9 ml of ScintiVerse II (Fisher). Cell-associated radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. All studies were performed in siliconized 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with a standard 1-ml sample volume. Binding studies unless indicated were performed in TBS plus 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2plus 1 mm MgCl2, or 1 mmCaCl2 as described. The effects of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), pervanadate, and stromal derived factor-1a on α4β1 activation were assessed on Jurkat cells using [3H]BIO1211 as a probe for integrin activation (45Hesselgesser J.

Jurkat cells at 3 × 106/ml in TBS containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mmMg2+ were incubated for the times indicated with and without 50 ng/ml PMA in the presence of 5 nm[3H]BIO1211 or preincubated for the times indicated with pervanadate (200 nm) or stromal derived factor-1a (100 nm), and then 5 nm [3H]BIO1211 was added for 5 min. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of TBS, and transferred to a scintillation vial containing 2.9 ml of ScintiVerse II. Cell-associated radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Pervanadate was made fresh at the time of use by adding 0.09% hydrogen peroxide (final concentration) to 20 mm sodium orthovanadate and incubating the solution at room temperature for 15 min. Catalase was added to 0.2 mg/ml to quench excess peroxide. An enriched population of the α4-K562 cells that exhibited high levels of α4 expression (on average 250,000 copies/cell) was obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting, and this subclone was used for all subsequent work. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 10-liter bioreactor in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mg/ml G418, 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride at 1 × 108 cells/ml lysis buffer. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C for subsequent use. Fifteen ml of the α4-K562 cell lysate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of mAb B5G10-Sepharose 4B that had been conjugated with antibody at 5 mg/ml resin. The resin was collected in a column, washed with two column volumes of lysis buffer without bovine serum albumin, and then washed with 10 volumes of 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2. α4β1 was eluted with 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 3.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and immediately neutralized with HEPES buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions were assayed for α4β1 in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for total protein using the BCA microprotein assay from Pierce. Peak fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. The B5G10 mAb (49Hemler M.E. Huang C. Takada Y. Schwarz L. Strominger J.L. Clabby M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11478-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from mouse ascites on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The affinity-purified α4β1 (250 μg/ml) was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then diluted further to the desired integrin concentration with the same buffer. For 45Ca binding studies, 250 μl of the α4β1 (25 μg/ml, 100 nm) was incubated at 23 °C for the times indicated with 20 or 100 μm CaCl2 and with or without 100 nm BIO7662 as indicated. The samples were desalted on a 3-ml P6DG desalting column (Bio-Rad) in the same buffer. 0.25-ml fractions were collected and counted by scintillation counting.45CaCl2 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and had a specific activity of 1.4 Ci/mmol. For [35S]BIO7662 binding studies, 250 μl of the α4β1 (2.5 μg/ml, 10 nm) was incubated with 10 nm [35S]BIO7662 and processed as described for Ca2+ binding. The fluorescent indicator Magnesium Green (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used as a probe to test whether BIO7662 had chelator activity for divalent cations. 4 μmMagnesium Green in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl was treated with varying concentrations of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+, as indicated, in the presence or absence of BIO7662. Fluorescence of the indicator was monitored on an Aminco Bowman series 2 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation wavelength set at 475 nm and the emission wavelength set at 530 nm. All solutions were prepared with metal ion-free water (Fluka). BIO7662 (SchemeFS1) is a potent inhibitor of α4β1 that was of particular interest because of its high affinity for both the activated and nonactivated integrin relative to other inhibitors. BIO7662 is a member of a family of highly selective α4β1 inhibitors that was derived by rational design from the LDV sequence of CS-1 fibronectin and that directly competes with VCAM-1, CS-1, and BIO1211 for binding to the integrin. 2D. Scott, R. C. Potter, W-C. Lee, M. Cornebise, and E. Lin, manuscript in preparation. Upon binding, BIO7662 stimulates the expression of ligand-induced epitopes on the β1-subunit (data not shown), a property consistent with occupancy of the ligand-binding site of the receptor. Here, we evaluated the binding of BIO7662 to α4β1 using [35S]BIO7662 as a direct probe for binding. Fig. 1 shows the binding of [35S]BIO7662 to Jurkat (α4β1 positive) cells under various conditions that are known to affect the activation state of α4β1. [35S]BIO7662 binding curves were similar for all the states tested. From the binding data, ED50 values of about 0.5 nm and maximal binding at 1 nm were observed. Specific counts bound at saturation provided a direct measure of α4β1expression levels, and based on this number, we estimate that the Jurkat cells used in these studies have ∼80,000 copies of α4β1/cell. This value agrees with the receptor number we measured previously using BIO1211 as a reporter (44Chen L.L. Whitty A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13167-13175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The specificity of binding and integrin selectivity of BIO7662 were evaluated in the following studies. First, [35S]BIO7662 binding was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and was blocked by treatment with 5 mmEDTA, consistent with the known requirement for divalent cations for α4β1 function (Fig.2). Second, binding could be readily competed with unlabeled BIO7662; when a 10-fold excess of cold BIO7662 was added, the signal was reduced by about 10-fold, whereas a 100-fold excess of unlabeled BIO7662 reduced the signal to background levels (not shown). Third, the binding of [35S]BIO7662 to α4β1 on Jurkat cells was blocked by BIO1211. Consistent with the relative affinities of BIO1211 for activated and nonactivated α4β1, higher concentrations of BIO1211 were needed to compete for binding to the nonactivated integrin than for activated α4β1 (not shown). Fourth, when binding of [35S]BIO7662 was tested on K562 cells lacking α4β1 (α1- and α2-transfected K562 cells in Fig. 2), BIO7662 exhibited a high degree of selectivity for α4β1 under all states of activation tested.Figure 2Specificity of [35S]BIO7662 binding. [35S]BIO7662 binding specificity was tested on K562 cells transfected with either the α4(), α2 (▨), or α1 (▪) gene (1 × 106 cells/ml). The cells were treated with 5 nm[35S]BIO7662 for 40 min at ambient temperature and pelleted, and binding was determined by scintillation counting. [35S]BIO7662 binding was measured on K562 cells under the various activating treatments indicated: TBS (no divalent cation); 2 mm Mn2+; 1 mm Ca2+ plus 1 mm Mg2+; 1 mm Ca2+; 1 mm Mg2+; and 5 mm EDTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The quadratic shape of the binding curves in Fig. 1 suggested that theKD for binding was small compared with the concentration of α4β1 present in the binding assays. Consequently, a kinetic assessment of affinity was used to establish actual affinity constants of BIO7662 for α4β1. Kinetic measurements for the binding of BIO7662 to α4β1 on Jurkat cells are shown in Fig. 3a and TableI. Under 2 mmMn2+ (activated), 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+ (nonactivated), and 1 mmCa2+ conditions, binding was rapid, withkon values equaling ∼4 × 106m−1 s−1 for all three states. These findings indicate, as previously observed (44Chen L.L. Whitty A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13167-13175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), that the activation state of α4β1 does not greatly influence the association rate for binding. Association rate constants of similar magnitude were reported previously for BIO1211 (44Chen L.L. Whitty A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13167-13175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Table IBinding of [35S]BIO7662 to α4β1 on Jurkat cellsBufferkon/106koff/10−4KDm−1s−1s−1pm1 mm Ca2−, 1 mmMg2+4.00.1952 mmMn2+4.0≤0.12≤350 μmMn2+0.9≤0.12≤131 mmMg2+1.0≤0.12≤1250 μmMg2+0.13≤0.12≤921 mmCa2+4.00.591550 μmCa2−0.540.671202 mm Mn2+→ EDTA0.381 mm Ca2+ → EDTA1.5On rates, off rates, and KD values for the binding of [35S]BIO7662 to α4β1 on Jurkat cells were determined from kinetic measurements as described in Fig. 3.

Open table in a new tab On rates, off rates, and KD values for the binding of [35S]BIO7662 to α4β1 on Jurkat cells were determined from kinetic measurements as described in Fig. 3. On rates for the 2 mm Mn2+, 1 mmCa2+ plus 1 mm Mg2+, and 1 mmCa2+ were indistinguishable, and KD values were calculated using an average value of 4 × 106m−1 s−1. Dissociation curves for binding of [35S]BIO7662 to α4β1 under the various states of activation are shown in Fig. 3b (rate constants are listed in Table I).koff in the presence of 2 mmMn2+ (activated integrin) is too slow to allow determination of an accurate number, but extrapolation from the available data suggests a half-life for dissociation of at least 15 h, corresponding to a koff ≤ 0.12 × 10−4 s−1. Becausekon = 4 × 106m−1 s−1, the resultingKD that was calculated fromkon and koff is 3 pm or less. Thus, although we observed dose-dependent and saturable binding using equilibrium measurements (Fig. 1), the molar concentration of α4β1 in this assay greatly exceeded theKD for binding. Consequently, the binding curves were in essence simply measuring a titration of the receptor to full occupancy, and the ED50 values observed do not correspond to the binding affinity. This problem has been well documented in previous binding studies using BIO1211 (44Chen L.L. Whitty A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13167-13175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).koff for the 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+ nonactivated state of the integrin was also too slow to measure accurately, showing only a 15% dissociation over 3.5 h. If t12 for this process were 10 h, then koff = 0.19 × 10−4 s−1, corresponding to aKD of 5 pm. As a result of the very slow dissociation of BIO7662 from the activated and nonactivated α4β1, it was not possible to determine whether the dissociation curves were monophasic or biphasic. Only in the 1 mm Ca2+ state did dissociation occur rapidly enough to define an accurate number forkoff. Based on the data shown in Fig.3b, koff = 0.59 × 10−4 s−1, and the resulting affinity that is calculated from kon andkoff is 15 pm. Dissociation from the 1 mm Ca2+ state appeared to be monophasic. When EDTA was added to Jurkat cells that had been first treated with Mn2+ and [35S]BIO7662, radioactivity was released slowly from the BIO7662/α4β1complex. In fact only about 30% of the bound [35S]BIO7662 was released after 3.5 h of treatment with EDTA. The results from this analysis are shown in Fig.3b. koff for the release of [35S]BIO7662 from the EDTA-treated sample was ∼0.38 × 10−4 s−1. Thus, although binding of [35S]BIO7662 to α4β1 is dependent on the presence of divalent cation, and in the presence of EDTA bin"

Lactoferrin is an iron-binding 80-kDa glycoprotein. It binds Fe3+ very tightly in a closed interdomain cleft in both lobes. The iron-free structure of lactoferrin, on the other hand, adopts an open conformation with domains moving widely apart. These studies imply that initial Fe3+ binding must be in the open form. The protein intermediate was crystallized by the microdialysis method. The protein solution, with a concentration of 100 mg/ml in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, was loaded in a capillary and dialyzed against the same buffer containing 26% (v/v) ethanol placed in a reservoir. FeCl3 and CO32− in excess molar ratios to that of protein in its solution were added to the reservoir buffer. The crystals appeared after some hours and grew to the optimum size within 36 h. The structure was determined by molecular replacement method and refined to final R- and R-free factors of 0.187 and 0.255, respectively. The present structure showed that the protein molecule adopts an open conformation similar to that of camel apolactoferrin. The electron density map clearly indicated the presence of two iron atoms, one in each lobe with 4-fold coordinations: two by the protein ligands of Tyr-92(433) OH and Tyr-192(526) OH and two other coordination sites occupied by oxygen atoms of bidentate C O32− ions leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The C O32− anion is stabilized through hydrogen bonds with the synergistic anion-binding site Arg-121(463) and with Ser-122 Oγ in the N-lobe and Thr-464 Oγ in C-lobe.

The sequence comparison also reveals that the C-lobes of lactoferrins are highly conserved, whereas the N-lobes show larger variations (10Kumar P. Three-dimensional Structure Determination of Lactoferrin.Ph.D. thesis. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi2001Google Scholar). Despite sequence similarities, lactoferrins differ in important functional details including their relative affinities for iron, propensity for iron release, and receptor binding properties (9Khan J.A.

Biol. 1997; 274: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) have revealed that the two domains of each lobe are closed over an Fe3+ ion. Four of the six Fe3+ coordination sites are occupied by protein ligands (2 Tyr, 1 Asp, and 1 His residue) and the other two by a bidentate carbonate ion. The structure of the iron-saturated form of camel lactoferrin is not yet known. However, the structure of the iron-free form of camel lactoferrin has been determined recently (9Khan J.A. Kumar P. Paramasivam M. Yadav R.S. Sahani M.S. Sharma S. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The structure of camel apolactoferrin (UALF)1 shows that both of its lobes adopt open conformations. The N-2 and C-2 domains move away from the N-1 and C-1 domains, respectively, almost as rigid bodies. Thus, the transition from the open to closed conformations is expected to pass through an intermediate in which the Fe3+ ion might bind initially to the protein in the open form before being transformed into the closed holoform. The four protein ligands have different locations, and the iron-loaded open form is a possible transient intermediate toward the fully saturated holoform with closed domains. The postulated reaction scheme of iron binding is presented in Fig.1. The study of intermediateIII is necessary to reveal the pathway of Fe3+uptake/release in lactoferrins and for the understanding of protein folding. The main difficulty encountered in the structure determination of such an intermediate is in obtaining the stable protein. There is no way to trap it in solution and stabilize it over a period for the purpose of crystallization. On the other hand, the binding of Fe3+ with the protein in the crystalline state is bound to hurt the crystals if it introduces even moderate structural changes. Indeed, the soaking experiments with apolactoferrin crystals using natural cation Fe3+ and anion CO32− did not succeed, as the crystals dissolved within a few minutes. The structure of the proteolytically generated N-2 domain of an iron-saturated duck ovotransferrin has indicated the association of Fe3+ ion with N-2 domain (14Lindley P.F. Bajaj M. Evans R.W. Garrett R.C. Hasnain S.S. Jhoti H. Kuser P. Neu M. Patel K. Sarra R. Strange R. Walton A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 292-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of an iron-saturated open form of the N-lobe of hen ovotransferrin with an unnatural anion nitrilotriacetate has been reported recently (15Mizutani K. Yamashita H. Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10190-10194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, a complete molecule of native apolactoferrin and natural cation Fe3+ and anion CO32− have been used. Furthermore, here we have employed an entirely new strategy to trap an intermediate in the crystalline state. The introduction of Fe3+ and CO32− into the protein and the process of crystal nucleation were initiated simultaneously so that the iron bound intermediate in the open conformation was trapped by crystalline forces. We report here the crystal structure of such an intermediate in the binding pathway of Fe3+. The observations clearly suggest that the two tyrosine residues are the initial binding ligands in the open conformation and that some of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of anion with protein are different than those observed in diferric lactoferrins. A locally modified procedure (16Raman A. Bhatia K.L. Singh T.P. Srinivasan A. Betzel Ch. Mallick R.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was used for the purification of camel lactoferrin. Fresh colostrum was obtained from the National Research Center on Camels, Bikaner, India. Twice diluted colostrum in water was defatted by skimming. Skimmed milk was further diluted twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cation exchanger CM-Sephadex C-50 was added to it (7 g/l−1) and stirred slowly for 1 h using a mechanical stirrer. The gel was allowed to settle, and the milk was decanted. The gel was washed with an excess of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. It was packed in a column (25 × 2.5 cm) and washed with the same buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, which facilitated the removal of some of the protein impurities. Finally, the lactoferrin was eluted with same buffer containing 0.3 mNaCl. The protein solution was dialyzed against triple distilled water. The protein was again passed through a CM-Sephadex C-50 column (10 × 2.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.3 m NaCl in the same buffer. The protein was concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell. The concentrated protein was passed through a Sephadex G-150 column (100 × 2 cm) using 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The purified protein was saturated with iron to obtain a homogenous iron saturated form. The protein could be saturated by iron to the order of 98%. The iron was removed from the lactoferrin using the procedure of Masson et al. (17Masson P.L. Heremans J.F. Ferin J. Fertil. Steril. 1968; 19: 679-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified iron-saturated lactoferrin solution (1%) in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0 was dialyzed against an excess of 0.1m citric acid with regular changes every 6 h. The dialysis was carried out at different pH values from pH 8.0 to 2.0 for 24 h. Finally, citric acid was removed by dialysis against an excess of distilled water with regular changes for 24 h at 4 °C. The colorless apoprotein was obtained. These samples were lyophilized. The apo form of protein was crystallized using microdialysis (9Khan J.A. Kumar P. Paramasivam M. Yadav R.S. Sahani M.S. Sharma S. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For soaking Fe3+ into the crystals of apolactoferrin, the crystals were first transferred to the precipitant solution at pH 8.0. The original precipitant solution was replaced gradually by fresh precipitant solutions containing excess amounts FeCl3 and CO32− at 4 °C. As soon as the crystals were introduced to the precipitant solution containing FeCl3 and CO32−, they cracked badly. Instead of the original precipitant solutions, other stabilizing solutions containing 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol and polyethylene glycol were used also, but the crystals cracked and dissolved rapidly. Therefore the crystals of the intermediate were grown by a modified technique of microdialysis at 4 °C. 100 mg of purified and lyophilized camel apolactoferrin was dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. 20 μl of protein solution was placed in the glass capillaries separated by dialysis membrane from the plastic tubing. These were placed in the vials containing the same buffer with 26% (v/v) ethanol. To this reservoir solution the excess amounts of FeCl3 and CO32−were added. These vials were put aside for microdialysis at 4 °C. These setups allowed the simultaneous diffusion of Fe3+ and CO32− ions as well as the precipitating agent, ethanol, to the protein solution. The crystal nucleations were observed almost instantaneously, and the crystals with pale yellow color grew to the final dimensions of 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3 within 36 h. It may be noted that the crystals of apolactoferrin were colorless whereas those of iron-saturated lactoferrin, as observed in other cases, had a dark brown color. Therefore, the pale yellow color of the crystals indicated a different state of iron association with the protein. The iron content of the crystals was estimated from the ratio ofA465/A280 (18Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The iron saturation was found to be of the order of 80%. Unlike other lactoferrins studied so far, it is an important feature of camel lactoferrin that its iron-free form was crystallized successfully, whereas its iron-saturated form could not be crystallized despite repeated efforts for the past several years (9Khan J.A. Kumar P. Paramasivam M. Yadav R.S. Sahani M.S. Sharma S. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This fact indicates that the structure of apolactoferrin with both lobes in open conformations is more homogenous and less mobile. Therefore, a postulated iron-saturated intermediate in the apo form (Fig. 1,III) is also expected to be a stable structure, about which its successful crystallization provides appropriate evidence. The crystals of lactoferrin intermediate grown from ethanol were not stable in the x-ray beam. Therefore, they were transferred to the stabilizing solution containing crystallization buffer and 35% (v/v) 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol. The intensity data were collected at 4 °C using a MAR Research imaging plate scanner mounted on an RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator equipped with a graphite monochromator. The data were integrated using DENZO (19Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar, 41Minor W. XDISPLAYF Program. Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN1993Google Scholar) and scaled using MARSCALE (20Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to monoclinic space group C2 with cell parameters a = 175.9 Å, b = 80.6 Å,c = 56.3 Å, and β = 92.4° with 4 molecules in the unit cell. The solvent content was estimated to be 54%. The data have an Rsym of 10.5% and an overall completeness of 92% to 2.7 Å resolution (Table I). The structure determination was carried out by molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Because iron was present in the crystals, the initial attempts were made to determine the structure with models of diferric lactoferrin, but it did not yield a solution. Finally, the structure was determined with a model of camel apolactoferrin. The solution appeared to be very distinct with a final correlation coefficient of 68.5%.Table ICrystallographic dataCrystallization methodMicrodialysisCrystallization conditionsCamel apolactoferrin 100 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0Reservoir: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.026 % (v/v) ethanol, FeCl3, and CO32− (in excess) at 4 °CCrystals: irregular in shape and pale yellow in colorSpace groupC2a (Å)175.9b (Å)80.6c (Å)56.3β (°)92.4Matthews coefficient (Vm) (Å3/Da)2.66Resolution range (Å)25.0–2.7Total number of measured reflections, 044,276Number of unique observed reflections19,901I/ς(I) for all data9.6I/ς(I) for the outer shell (2.8–2.7) (Å)5.6Overall completeness (%)92Completeness (%) in the highest resolution shell (2.8–2.7) (Å)47.0Rsym for all data (%)10.5Rsym in the highest resolution shell (2.8–2.7) (Å)25.0 Open table in a new tab The model was built using the program O (22Jones T.A.

Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) using all the data between 20.0 and 2.7 Å resolution. A test set of about 5% of the data was kept aside to monitor the R-free factor during the course of refinement (24Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). The positions of two Fe3+ ions and two carbonate anions, one in each lobe, were clearly identified in the difference density (F0 − Fc) map of the first refinement round. These were included in the model followed by more than 10 rounds of refinement and manual model building. The quality of phases was further improved by solvent flattening using the program DM (25Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar, 26Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), allowing more residues to be built based on the improved electron density map. The omit maps (2F0 −Fc), contoured at 1 ς and F0 −Fc contoured at 4 ς were calculated using all of the reflection data after refinement of the model in which the Fe3+ was excluded (Fig. 4, A and B). The next set of omit maps was obtained in which CO32− was excluded (Fig. 4,C and D). Water molecules were added where the difference density (F0 − Fc) had values of more than 3 ς above the mean level, and the 2F0 − Fc map showed density at more than 1 ς level. This resulted in the determination of 232 water molecules. The final R-factor and R-free factor were 0.187 and 0.255, respectively.

The protein structure has geometry close to the ideal values with root mean square deviations of 0.013 Å and 1.8° from the standard values of bond lengths and angles, respectively. The overall mean B-factor for the structure is 57.0 Å2. It may be mentioned here that the values of overall mean B-factors for the structures of various iron-saturated forms of lactoferrins have been observed between 39 and 72 Å2 (10Kumar P. Three-dimensional Structure Determination of Lactoferrin.Ph.D. thesis. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi2001Google Scholar). These values have been found even larger (41–93 Å2) in the case of iron-free forms of lactoferrins (27Kumar, P., Yadav, S., and Singh, T. P. (2001) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar). Therefore, the mean B-value for the present structure lies within the limits of those observed for the structures of other lactoferrins and represents a typical value for lactoferrins. The structure is well defined, and in the final 2F0 −Fc electron density map, there are no breaks in the main chain and side chain densities when contoured at the 1 ς level. A Ramachandran plot of the main chain torsion angles (φ, ψ) (28Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar) shows that 84.4% of the residues are in the most allowed regions as defined in the program PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Only two residues, Leu-299 and Leu-640, are in the normally disallowed regions, which are the central residues in two γ-turns (30Matthews B.W. Macromolecules. 1972; 5: 818-819Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and have (φ, ψ) values that are typical of such conformations (70°, -60°). The two γ-turns are conserved in the N- and C-lobes of lactoferrins and transferrins (31Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). For the iron-free apo form, the solution-scattering (32Grossmann J.G. Neu M. Pantos E. Schwab F.J. Evans R.W. Townes-Andrews E.

The polypeptide chain of the present iron-saturated camel lactoferrin intermediate (ULFI) folds into two lobes (N- and C-lobes, representing the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the molecule), each of which is folded into two domains (N-1 and N-2; C-1 and C-2) (Fig. 2). This structure, when compared with the holo (Fe3+ and CO32− loaded form) structures of human (HLF) (12Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.E. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), equine (ELF) (4Sharma A.K. Paramasivam M. Srinivasan A. Yadav M.P. Singh T.P. J. Mol.

The root mean square shifts for all the Cα atoms of ULFI with those of UALF was found to be 0.54 Å (Fig. 3). In this structure, the iron atoms exist in the opened up interdomain clefts. The two Fe3+ ligating tyrosine residues in the holoform Tyr-92(433) and Tyr-192(526) appear to participate in the iron coordination, whereas the other two protein ligands of Asp-60(395) and His-253(595) are located far away from the iron atoms. The bidentate carbonate ions provide two oxygen atoms in each lobe to complete the tetrahedral coordinations of Fe3+ ions. Overall, the present structure of lactoferrin intermediate is almost indistinguishable from that of camel apolactoferrin. The molecular packing in the present crystal structure is also identical to that of apolactoferrin. The crystal nucleation of the open conformation seems to be an efficient process, and as soon as the iron binding occurs, the molecules of the iron-saturated intermediate tend to pack instantaneously. Once they are packed into a crystalline arrangement, the conversion to the next step of closing of domains is prevented by molecular packing forces.Figure 3Superimposition of the Cα traces of ULFI (red) and UALF(green).

As summarized in Table III, the distances from the iron of Tyr-92 OH and Tyr-192 OH in the N-lobe and of Tyr-433 OH and Tyr-526 OH in the C-lobe of 2.7 and 2.7 Å and 2.8 and 2.4 Å, respectively, clearly show the involvement of tyrosine residues in the coordinations with Fe3+. The other two protein ligands of Asp-60(395) and His-253(595) are not involved in the coordination with the iron atom; the distances of Asp Oδ1 and His Nε2 from iron in the N- and C-lobe are 10.5 and 8.6 Å and 10.1 and 8.2 Å, respectively. The other two coordinations of the tetrahedrally coordinated iron atom are provided by CO32− anion. The distances of CO32− O-1 and CO32− O-2 from iron in the N- and C-lobe are 2.8 and 2.8 Å and 2.6 and 2.6 Å, respectively. The coordination distances in the present structure are slightly larger than those generally observed in the structures of lactoferrins (4Sharma A.K. Paramasivam M. Srinivasan A. Yadav M.P.

The other anion interactions that are different in ULFI involve a hydrogen bond with Ser-122 Oγ in the N-lobe and Thr-464 Oγ in the C-lobe. Additionally, a water molecule is present in each lobe to form a hydrogen bond with CO32−. In the present structure, the anion lacks two hydrogen bonds with backbone nitrogen atoms of residues 123(465) and 124(466), which are present in the iron-saturated forms of other lactoferrins. Residues 121–124(463–466) are part of the positively charged anion binding pocket. Although it has gained a hydrogen bond through a water molecule in each lobe, but overall the anions remain slightly loosely bound in the structure of intermediate. The current crystal structure corresponds to intermediateIII, LF·2 Fe3+·2 CO32− complex (Fig. 1), with an open conformation in which only four of the six Fe3+coordination sites are occupied by the side chains of protein ligands Tyr-92(433) and Tyr-192(526) and bidentate CO32−. This is the first lactoferrin structure that demonstrates that the two tyrosine residues are the protein ligands for the Fe3+ entry in the intact lactoferrin with the open domain conformation. In this arrangement the other two ligands, Asp and His, seem to move toward the iron atom after two tyrosines have joined the iron. The positive macro-dipole at the N terminus of helix 5 (11Karthikeyan S. Yadav S. Paramasivam M. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Arg-121 are oriented toward the metal binding site, making an unfavorable environment to receive a ferric cation. This configuration readily explains the requirement for the synergistic carbonate anion, which effectively neutralizes the positive charges and confers site specificity for binding ferric ions. In the intact protein the cation charge is then balanced by the two tyrosine residues, Tyr-92(433) and Tyr-192(526). Therefore, the critical steps in the mechanism of iron binding involve an early entry of CO32− ions to interact with Arg-121(463) in the positively charged anion binding site of domain 2. The binding of the carbonate ion induces a conformational change in the side chain of Arg-121(463); this is the first conformational change in the protein in the mechanism of iron binding. The observed conformational change in Arg-121(463) corresponds to intermediate II (Fig. 1) but is extremely short-lived, as the iron binding follows it almost instantaneously. These events occur in the proximity of two tyrosine residues, 92 (433) and 192 (526), thus preparing the cleft for iron binding. As a result, the iron binds to the combination of two tyrosines and a carbonate ion first to form a tetrahedral intermediate. This is seemingly a relatively stable intermediate (III) (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that upon binding to Fe3+, Tyr-92(433) and Tyr-192(526) shift in the present structure from their original positions in camel apolactoferrin. The largest displacement between any two corresponding atoms in the N-lobe was 0.7 Å, whereas it was 1.9 Å in the C-lobe (Fig. 5). Yet another striking difference between the structures of the present intermediate and those of the iron-saturated forms of lactoferrin pertains to the positioning of the Fe3+ and CO32− ions. Although the positioning of Fe3+ is only slightly different in ULFI, the CO32− occupies a drastically displaced position. Because the lobes are in open conformation, the Fe3+ forms only four coordination links. These four bonds although weaker are geometrically identical to those observed in the structures of iron-saturated lactoferrins (4Sharma A.K. Paramasivam M. Srinivasan A. Yadav M.P. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 289: 303-317Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Karthikeyan S. Yadav S. Paramasivam M. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Biol. 1997; 274: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hydrogen-bonding interactions of CO32− anion with the protein are substantially different. Although the two key interactions with Arg-121(463) are similar, the other links are different. As seen in Fig. 6,A—D, in HLF and BLF, the remaining three hydrogen bonds involve Thr-117(459) Oγ and backbone nitrogen atoms of Ala-123(465) and Gly-124(466). In contrast, in the present structure, there are a total of only four hydrogen bonds. Two of them are with Arg-121(463), and of the remaining two, one is with Ser-122 Oγ in the N-lobe and Thr-464 Oγ1 in the C-lobe as well as one each with the solvent water molecule. Overall, the hydrogen bonding pattern of CO32− in the intermediate is different from diferric lactoferrins. The CO32−anion is also less tightly held in the intermediate, leaving scope for an adjustment on final folding. The domain closure occurs with the introduction of aspartic acid, Asp-60(395), from domain 1, which is attracted toward cation. The environment of ferric cation is completed by the neutral His-253(595) residue sited on the second interdomain-connecting strand as the polypeptide chain traverses back from domain 2 to domain 1. This mechanism is consistent with experiments on iron-binding kinetics that show a conformational change to be the limiting step in iron binding (36Cowart R.E. Kojima N. Bates G.W. J. Biol.

The role of His-253(595) in the mechanism of iron binding is less well defined, although its presence as a neutral ligand completing the octahedral environment of the iron is chemically relevant. Further studies of lactoferrin intermediates from other species may provide additional information on the mechanism of iron uptake and iron release."
